Tuberculosis remains a major international health problem despite advances in radiological diagnosis and antituberculous therapy. Disseminated tuberculous infection affecting a single bone and manifested as multifocal lytic cortical lesions is rare and unusual. We report on a 50-year-old man with multifocal involvement of the femur by tuberculosis and demonstrate positive reaction using tuberculosis-polymerase chain reaction on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded histological specimens.
