A 7-year-old girl with thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis was admitted for further diagnostic evaluation after a spinal MRI scan had shown several intraspinal extramedullary lesions. The clinical features including joint hypermobility and cigarette-paper like scars led to the presumptive diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VI (EDS VI). Analysis of urinary lysyl- and hydroxylysyl-pyridinoline cross-links excretion confirmed a deficiency of lysylhydroxylase 1 and the diagnosis of EDS VIA. Findings on the spinal MRI scan were interpreted as spinal meningeal cysts. Over a period of 2 years, the patient developed no neurological deficits and no radiological signs of progression of the spinal lesions.

We assume cystic malformations of the meninges to be most likely the result of connective tissue weakness in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VI.
