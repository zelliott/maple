We describe a family with hereditary adult-onset leukodystrophy with sparing of the optic radiations, shown clinically, neuroradiologically and electrophysiologically. All five affected members developed their leukodystrophy in their fourth decade and clinical features steadily progressed. The sparing of the optic radiations is not typical of other leukodystrophies. We suggest that this is a new clinical entity.
