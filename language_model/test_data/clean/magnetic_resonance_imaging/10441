Understanding the internal dynamics of prostate injections, particularly injection pattern distribution is a key step to developing new therapies for prostate disease that may be best served with a direct injection approach. Due to excellent properties involving liquid contrast agents, MRI can be used for targeting and monitoring of injections into organs and tissues.

Eleven intraprostatic injections were performed in vivo with canines using a custom transrectal guiding and imaging system for use in a standard 1.5 T MR scanner. In addition, 25 injections were performed on excised cadaveric human prostates, using a MedRad Spectris injector system. MRI was used to guide the injections and monitor intraparenchymal injection distribution.

T1 and T2-weighted MR images were correlated with histology to produce three-dimensional data sets that can be used to analyze trends in injection patterns. This analysis was used to develop strategies for injection prediction such as gadolinium pre-injections and diffusion-weighted imaging guidance. In addition, a rough model of prostate injections is described, and a preliminary injection guide is developed that takes into account the individual clinician's goals for therapy.

MR visualization of injected therapeutic agents allows for prediction and monitoring of drug distributions, possibly improving efficacy and reducing side effects. Injection analysis and modeling may be used to assist in optimizing clinical treatments that require or would benefit from focal parenchymal injections into the prostate.
