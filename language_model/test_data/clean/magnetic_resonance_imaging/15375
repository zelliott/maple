Acral myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma is a rare, recently described, low-grade sarcoma that involves mainly the distal extremities. The purpose of this study is to report the MRI findings in four cases of acral myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma.

Acral myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcomas may present with various MRI patterns that probably reflect their variable histologic composition. Differential diagnosis with other benign conditions, especially with ganglion cysts and giant cell tumors of the tendon sheath, may be difficult. We report tumoral invasion of the bone in one case, which to our knowledge has not been previously described.
