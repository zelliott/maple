The authors present two cases in which intraorbital wooden foreign bodies remained undetected after initial ophthalmologic examination and radiologic investigation which included plain orbital x-rays, orbital computed tomography (CT) scans, and, in one case, orbital ultrasound. In each case, subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a well-delineated low-intensity lesion suggestive of a retained foreign body. Investigation of a case of suspected wooden foreign body in the orbit should include an MRI scan if there is no contraindication, and no foreign body has been defined on CT scan, ultrasound, or plain orbital films.
