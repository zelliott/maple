X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) affects 1-2/1,000 males and accounts for approximately 10% of all mental retardation (MR). We have ascertained a syndromic form of XLMR segregating within a five-generation family with seven affected males. Prominent characteristics include mild to severe MR, cortical malformation, microcephaly, seizures, thin build with distinct facial features including a long and thin face, epicanthic folds, almond-shaped eyes, upslanting palpebral fissures and micrognathia and behavioral problems. Carrier females have normal physical appearance and intelligence. This combination of features is unreported and distinct from Lujan-Fryns syndrome, Snyder-Robinson syndrome, and zinc finger DHHC domain-containing 9-associated MR. We propose the name of this new syndrome to be CK syndrome.
