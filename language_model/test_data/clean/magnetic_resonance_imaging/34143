A case of a glomus tumour of the distal segment of the ring finger, with four apparent recurrences in an 8-year period, is described. The patient was treated by two different surgeons (two and three times respectively) and obtained pain free intervals of between 4 and 11 months before recurrence. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a glomus tumour in all five procedures. The location of the glomus tumour was defined preoperatively by high resolution MR imaging.
