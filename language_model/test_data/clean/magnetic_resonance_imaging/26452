Magnetic resonance imaging is extremely helpful in establishing a differential diagnosis. Surgical excision is recommended to correct deglutition and speech problems. Its rarity notwithstanding, dermoid cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of tongue masses in the younger population.
