A magnetic resonance image (MRI)-based method to determine the colonic transit time is described. It is based on the oral ingestion of a single dose of 4 ml Gd-DOTA following an overnight fast and the subsequent acquisition of fast three-dimensional (3D) gradient-echo sequences under apnea conditions. The technique was successfully evaluated in three healthy volunteers. Transit of the contrast agent through the small and large intestines was easily followed. Thus, MRI-based colonic transit time determinations are feasible.
