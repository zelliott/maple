A case of fetal autosomal dominant microcephaly was prenatally diagnosed with ultrasonography in a woman with previously undiagnosed microcephaly. At the time of initial ultrasonographic assessment, the mother was identified to have a markedly small cranium, consistent with maternal microcephaly. The ultrasonographic examination showed the fetal head size to be four standard deviations below the mean for gestational age. Gestational dating from the other biometric parameters and from the last menstrual period was consistent with 31 weeks' gestation. Neurosonographic evaluation of the fetus revealed no obvious structural abnormalities. Serial ultrasonographic examinations at 35 and 38 weeks' gestation showed no changes in the fetal head size. A 2.64 kg male fetus was delivered at term. Neonatal assessment showed the fetal head circumference to be less than the second percentile for gestational age. Neurologic assessment of the neonate with magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal development of the brain, with small cerebellar and cerebral hemispheres, and pachygyria. These images are compared with the magnetic resonance images of the mother. Our findings of maternal and fetal microcephaly are consistent with autosomal dominant microcephaly. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the prenatal diagnosis of autosomal dominant microcephaly.
