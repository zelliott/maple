Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is rarely reported in patients with multiple sclerosis. We recently managed a 32 year-old Saudi female patient who was managed for a relapse of her multiple sclerosis but in whom CVT was incidentally found in the course of investigations. She was asymptomatic with regards to the CVT and she had no identifiable predisposing factor apart from her recent confinement which was uneventful. The case underscores the importance of looking for other lesions that may be 'clinically silent' in MS patients presenting with relapse as well as emphasising the advantage of neuroimaging in revealing unsuspected but potentially fatal disorders.
