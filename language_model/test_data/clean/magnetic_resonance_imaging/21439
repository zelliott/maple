The challenges associated with microsurgery of vascular malformations located in the midbrain, pons and medulla have promoted the development of alternative therapeutic techniques. To assess the efficacy and safety of radiosurgery in the management of brain stem vascular malformations we reviewed our 5-year experience in 50 patients evaluated between 4 and 51 months (mean, 25 months) after radiosurgery. Twenty-eight patients (56%) underwent gamma unit radiosurgery for symptomatic arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and 22 patients (44%) for angiographically occult vascular malformations (AOVMs). Patients varied in age from 7 to 76 years (mean, 39 years). Forty-one patients (82%) had from 1 to 5 hemorrhages prior to gamma knife radiosurgery. Ten (20%) had one or two prior unsuccessful operations, and 37 (74%) presented with a neurological deficit. Of the patients with AVMs, 6 were considered Spetzler Grade III, and 22 (79%) Grade VI (inoperable: major component within the brain stem parenchyma). Forty-four malformations (88%) were adjacent to or within the midbrain and pons; the remainder involved the medulla. Average malformation diameters varied from 6 to 30.4 m (mean, 20.6; mean volume 4614 mm3). The minimal radiation dose to the margin of the malformations ranged from 12 to 25.6 Gy (mean, 18.9 Gy). Of the 28 patients with AVMs, 8 had follow-up angiograms at a minimum of 2-years after radiosurgery (or sooner if their MRIs suggested obliteration). Of these patients, 7 (88%) showed complete obliteration of their malformations. No patients with AOVMs rehemorrhaged if more than 15 months elapsed after radiosurgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
