We performed MRI on 13 infants after operative reduction for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Using an axial gradient-echo sequence, MRI accurately depicted the acetabular anatomy and confirmed adequate reduction in 12 patients. The one patient with redislocation after surgery was correctly identified. MRI can be carried out quickly, inexpensively and without risk of radiation and is the investigation of choice to confirm adequate reduction in DDH.
