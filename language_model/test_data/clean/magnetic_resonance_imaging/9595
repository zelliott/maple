Left ventricular non-compaction is a myocardial disorder characterized by excessive trabeculations and deep recesses that communicate with the ventricular cavity, which is thought to result from a failure of the trabecular regression that occurs during normal embryonic development. It carries a high mortality from heart failure or sudden cardiac death. A 15-year-old female patient was referred to our institution for moderate symptoms of heart failure. Echocardiography and MRI showed a bicuspid aortic valve with severe regurgitation, subaortic VSD, dilated left ventricle and left ventricular non-compaction with a moderately decreased ejection fraction, as well as isthmic coarctation and transverse arch hypoplasia. We elected to perform transaortic VSD closure and aortic valve replacement using a mechanical prosthetic valve on an arrested heart, and to address aortic coarctation and transverse arch hypoplasia using an extra-anatomic ascending-to-descending aorta bypass. Aortic cross-clamping was limited to 41 minutes. The postoperative recovery was rapid and the girl was discharged in NYHA class I with an estimated LVEF of 39%. Although management must be individualized, extra-anatomic bypass is a good single-stage approach for patients with complex coarctation and concomitant cardiovascular or myocardial disorders, reducing ischemic time and offering a better chance of successful weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass.
