We present a new technique of image fusion (IF) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRT) and anti-CEA-immunoscintigraphy (Behring 431/26) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). We performed SPECT and MRT within 8 hours on the same day. Glucagon intravenously was used to reduce artefacts due to intestinal motility. Before image fusion we analysed the SPECT and MRT images independently of each other. The MRT and SPECT were connected by a local area network (LAN) to a Gateway computer, which is also used as a picture archive. There a program automatically starts, translates the MRT data from the ACR/NEMA format to the Elscint one and these data are sent for image fusion to the nuclear medicine computer Elscint SP1. By means of a clinical example we present anatomic concordant superimposition and explain the findings and the clinical value of our technique. This system and technique are equally applicable to other digital imaging investigations. By IF, on the basis of the certain evidence of the tracer depot of a pathological lesion diagnosed by MRT and the reliability of the anatomical assignment of a focal lesion diagnosed by SPECT, early detection of local recurrence after surgical treatment of rectal cancer, the correct localisation of recurrent disease and its distinction from non-malignant tissue becomes possible. This enables planning of further therapeutical strategies.
