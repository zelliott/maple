Recently, there has been an increased interest in quantitative MR parameters to improve diagnosis and treatment. Parameter mapping requires multiple images acquired with different timings usually resulting in long acquisition times. While acquisition time can be reduced by acquiring undersampled data, obtaining accurate estimates of parameters from undersampled data is a challenging problem, in particular for structures with high spatial frequency content. In this work, principal component analysis is combined with a model-based algorithm to reconstruct maps of selected principal component coefficients from highly undersampled radial MRI data. This novel approach linearizes the cost function of the optimization problem yielding a more accurate and reliable estimation of MR parameter maps. The proposed algorithm--reconstruction of principal component coefficient maps using compressed sensing--is demonstrated in phantoms and in vivo and compared with two other algorithms previously developed for undersampled data.
