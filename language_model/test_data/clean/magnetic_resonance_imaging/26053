We report a case of angiosarcoma in the retroperitoneal cavity. A 66-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with the complaint of chest discomfort. Imaging studies including computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large solid retroperitoneal mass adjacent to the bladder. There was no evidence of metastasis. The tumor was surgically resected and histopathologically diagnosed as angiosarcoma from the positive staining for VIIIth factor, mitotic figures and abnormal endothelial cells. Six months after surgery, local recurrence adjacent to the bladder appeared. We resected the mass and started adjuvant therapy using Interleukin-2. However, he died of progressed disease one year after the first operation.
