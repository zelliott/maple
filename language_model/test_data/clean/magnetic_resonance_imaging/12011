The authors present the results of a comparative prospective study of the staging 202 bronchogenic carcinomas (T and N) before surgery. The results of CT (202 cases) and MRI (64 cases) were compared with surgical evaluation and pathologic findings. CT and MRI were part of the decisive criteria for therapeutic-surgery choice and were interpreted before surgery. The results showed poor sensitivity for the T and N but better specificity. MRI is superior to CT with the 3 dimensional demonstration and T1 T2 weighted sequences, but its utility remains limited. The authors give their preferred indications for MRI investigation after CT staging. Staging by CT (and MRI) is of great value to avoid impossible thoracotomy and to confirm the findings of mediastinoscopy (suspected N2 and even more N3).
