The physical properties of bioceramics have made them ideal for a variety of prosthetic devices. Their porous structure allows fibrovascular tissue to invade the implant and secure it and provides a surface for muscular attachment. This process has been well-documented in animal studies; however, this case report describes the periodic imaging changes seen in a 67-year-old man following placement of a bioceramic orbital prosthesis.
