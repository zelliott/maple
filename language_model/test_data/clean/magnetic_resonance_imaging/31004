To understand the cause and prevention of postoperative ischemic and/or venous parenchymal infarcts after intracranial meningioma resection, the authors describe the value of neuroimaging in predicting the surgical plane of cleavage.

A prospective study of 100 meningiomas was performed, in which tumor size, absence or presence of peritumoral edema, tumor-parenchyma interface, and types of arterial vascularization (that is, dural-meningeal, pial-cortical, or mixed) were correlated with the type of dissection plane (extrapial, subpial, or mixed) encountered at surgery. A direct correlation was found between the tumor size identified on T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequences and the degree of subpial (nonextrapial) surgical plane of cleavage (p < 0.00001). A similar correlation was found with the grade of peritumoral edema identified on preoperative computerized tomography (CT) scanning (p < 0.0001) or T2-weighted MR imaging sequences (p < 0.00001) and tumor pial vascularization as seen on angiography (p < 0.0001). Nevertheless, the tumor-parenchyma interface on preoperative T2-weighted MR imaging sequences was not predictive of the surgical plane (p > 0.5). The worst clinical outcome was found in the tumors located in eloquent areas and in which a subpial plane was encountered at surgery (p = 0.03).

Peritumoral edema on preoperative CT and MR studies and tumor pial vascularization as seen on selective angiography can be used to predict the surgical plane of cleavage in meningiomas. The association between tumor size and a subpial surgical plane may be explained by a more pial vascularization seen on angiography. Meningiomas with a location in eloquent cortex and a subpial dissection plane should be considered a high-risk group.
