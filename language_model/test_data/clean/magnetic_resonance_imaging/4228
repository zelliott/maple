The aim of this work was to evaluate the usefulness of Computed Tomography and Magnetic Risonance in the staging of the nonseminomatous germ cells tumours of the testis. The authors discussed the role of CT and MR imaging to value the detection of retroperitoneal metastases of the nonseminomatous germ cells tumours of the testis pre and post treatment.
