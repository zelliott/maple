Restricted visualization of the surgical field is one of the most critical challenges for minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Current intraoperative visualization systems are promising. However, they can hardly meet the requirements of high resolution and real time 3D visualization of the surgical scene to support the recognition of anatomic structures for safe MIS procedures. In this paper, we present a new approach for real time 3D visualization of organ deformations based on optical imaging patches with limited field-of-view and a single preoperative scan of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). The idea for reconstruction is motivated by our empirical observation that the spherical harmonic coefficients corresponding to distorted surfaces of a given organ lie in lower dimensional subspaces in a structured dictionary that can be learned from a set of representative training surfaces. We provide both theoretical and practical designs for achieving these goals. Specifically, we discuss details about the selection of limited optical views and the registration of partial optical images with a single preoperative MRI/CT scan. The design proposed in this paper is evaluated with both finite element modeling data and ex vivo experiments. The ex vivo test is conducted on fresh porcine kidneys using 3D MRI scans with 1.2 mm resolution and a portable laser scanner with an accuracy of 0.13 mm. Results show that the proposed method achieves a sub-3 mm spatial resolution in terms of Hausdorff distance when using only one preoperative MRI scan and the optical patch from the single-sided view of the kidney. The reconstruction frame rate is between 10 frames/s and 39 frames/s depending on the complexity of the test model.
