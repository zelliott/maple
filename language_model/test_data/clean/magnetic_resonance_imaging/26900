A 16-year-old male teenager presented with seizure and loss of consciousness for 20 min. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a mass occupying the right medial temporal lobe. Histological examination revealed a non-pigmented area with spindle-shaped and large xanthomatous pleomorphic cells and a pigmented region with pigmented neoplastic cells with fascicular arrangement. Immunohistochemical studies showed the tumor was positive for GFAP and low index of Ki-67. Considering the patient's history, clinical data and pathological findings, we rendered a rare variant named pigmented pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma.
