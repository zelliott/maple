Long-term followup (over 5 years) of staged reconstruction for chronic ruptures of both peroneal tendons using a Hunter rod and the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon is presented.

Seven patients with chronic ruptures of both peroneal tendons who had at least two previous surgeries that failed were treated with excision of the remaining portion of the peroneal tendons and implantation of a Hunter rod to the insertion of the peroneus brevis. Patients performed passive range of motion exercises for 3 months before removal of the Hunter rod and transfer of the FHL into the newly formed sheath, attaching it to the insertion of the peroneus brevis on the fifth metatarsal. The patients' ages ranged from 30 to 57 (average 38) years. All were women. All had at least two previous failed procedures (range two to six). The average time from initial injury to the index surgery was 4.6 (range 2 to 7) years. Patients were evaluated by physical examination and a questionnaire. The average range of followup was 8.5 years (range 143 to 167 months).

All wounds healed without complications. One patient (a workers' compensation patient) had continued complaints of pain and ambulated with a molded ankle-foot orthosis (MAFO). The remaining six patients reported complete relief of symptoms and returned to full preinjury levels of activity. One patient required a Brostr√∂m ankle ligament repair 2 years after tendon transfer for a new injury but has remained pain free for the last 62 months. There were five excellent, one good, and one fair result. All patients stated they would repeat the surgery.

Staged reconstruction with excision of the remaining portion of the peroneal tendons and reconstruction with a Hunter rod and FHL transfer has been shown to be an effective long-term treatment for chronic peroneal tendon ruptures.
