We report a unique case of metastatic craniopharyngioma. Initially, the patient had a right frontal craniotomy for resection of a suprasellar mass, which was determined to be an adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma. Seven years later, an MR study of the brain showed two peripheral enhancing lesions adjacent to the dura and contralateral to the craniotomy site. Pathologic examination again showed adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma. Although recurrence, both local and along surgical tracts due to implantation of craniopharyngioma tissue, has been reported, this case raises the possibility of meningeal seeding to remote sites.
