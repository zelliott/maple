To characterize the clinical, MR, MR angiographic, and conventional angiographic findings in vertebrobasilar disease in children.

Eight children with posterior circulation ischemia and infarction had conventional spin-echo MR and MR angiography of the head and neck. Six patients had conventional angiography.

Six patients had alteration of vertebral or basilar artery flow void on spin-echo images. MR angiography showed all six cases of angiographically proved vertebrobasilar dissection or occlusion despite overestimating the extent of arterial abnormality in two patients. In two patients the intracranial peripheral branch cutoff shown at angiography was correctly predicted on screening MR angiography.

Posterior circulation infarction in children is usually secondary to traumatic injury to the vertebrobasilar circulation. MR and MR angiography noninvasively show vertebrobasilar flow disturbances and compare favorably with angiography in documenting dissection or occlusion of the vertebrobasilar circulation. MR angiography may obviate the need for invasive angiography in these children at diagnosis and during follow-up of anticoagulation therapy.
