A 53-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with headache and convulsion. Advanced anemia with a Hb level of 3.5 g/dl had been detected about a month earlier, and it had been treated by iron administration to achieve a Hb level of 8.9 g/dl. The patient developed status epilepticus on admission. The blood pressure was elevated, and brain diffusion weighted imaging and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging revealed high intensity areas in the bilateral posterior and parietal lobes, right frontal lobe, and right basal ganglia. The cerebrospinal fluid protein was elevated. The convulsions settled after continuous infusion of thiamylal under mechanical ventilation. Subsequently, the patient became conscious, and the brain MRI abnormalities gradually disappeared. While a number of factors such as hypertension, medication and others have been reported as causes of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), comparatively rapid anemia correction could also possibly precipitate PRES as like as this case. Thus anemia correction needs to be undertaken carefully.
