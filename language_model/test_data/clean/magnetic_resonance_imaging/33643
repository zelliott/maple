Patch aortoplasty (PA) for coarctation of aorta (COA) can lead to aneurysm formation at the repair site. X-ray, echocardiogram and computed tomography are unreliable for diagnosis of this complication.

To evaluate prospectively patients with PA for COA by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect presence of aneurysm at the repair site.

All patients who underwent PA at the authors' institution were identified. MRI was performed in transverse and long axis oblique views on all patients except those who had, or were going to have, aortic angiography for other reasons. Details of the surgical procedure were obtained from the hospital records.

Of the 18 patients studied, 15 had MRI and three had aortic angiography. Age at PA ranged from one week to 13.3 years (mean 6.3 years). The interval from PA to MRI or angiography was 9.5 years (range four to 12.5). No aneurysm was detected in any patient. Recoarctation was diagnosed in two patients not previously suspected but discovered on MRI. At PA the intimal shelf causing coarctation was either not excised or only minimally trimmed in 14 of 15 instances.

The incidence of late aneurysm formation following PA for COA is low in the authors' patients, possibly due to minimal intimal damage at repair, although these patients should be followed longer. MRI was useful for assessment of aneurysm and restenosis.
