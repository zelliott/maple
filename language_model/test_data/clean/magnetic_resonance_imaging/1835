Primary cerebral neuroblastoma is one of a group of highly malignant undifferentiated primitive neuroectodermal tumours arising from germinal matrix cells of the embryonic neural tube. They occur primarily in young children and are extremely rare in adults. They may be multicentric and have often spread throughout the central nervous system at the time of diagnosis. A case of a 16-year-old man is described, and the recent literature is reviewed.
