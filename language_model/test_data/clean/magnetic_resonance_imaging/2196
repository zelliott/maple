MRI was performed on patients with miliary pulmonary tuberculosis to look for brain involvement and to study the features sequentially, during treatment. We studied seven patients with typical radiographic tuberculosis, and no symptoms or signs of central nervous system involvement. Conventional spin-echo (SE) imaging, including contrast enhanced images, was performed in all cases. All patients showed brain involvement: four patients showed lesions mainly less than 3 mm in diameter, better seen on contrast-enhanced images. These patients showed oedema around the lesions after 2 months of treatment, with subsequent regression on follow-up. The remaining three patients had multiple lesions, 3 mm or more in diameter, which showed a gradual decrease on follow-up. We conclude that the brain may commonly be involved in miliary pulmonary tuberculosis. The response to treatment depends on the stage of the granuloma and shows a definite pattern of healing on follow-up.
