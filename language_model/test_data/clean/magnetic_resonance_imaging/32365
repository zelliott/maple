Astrocytomas are central nervous system neoplasms, which are derived predominately from astrocytes. On the basis of the histopathologic characteristics astrocytomas are graded from I to IV. The cells that demonstrate the greatest degree of anaplasia are used to determine the histologic grade of the tumor. The mean age of survival are approximately 10 years from the time of diagnosis for pilocystic astrocytomas (World Health Organization grade I), more than 5 years for patients with low-grade diffuse astrocytomas (WHO grade II), 2 to 5 years for those with anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO grade III), and less than 1 year for patients with glioblastoma (WHO grade IV). The treatment is a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy depending of the grade of astrocytoma. We present a case of 31-year-old man with grade III astrocytoma with subsequent chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with imatinib mesylate as part of his chronic myelogenous leukemia treatment failing to show recurrence of the astrocytoma 10 years after standard treatment for astrocytoma.
