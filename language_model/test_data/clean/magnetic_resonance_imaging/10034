Since intraluminal thrombus in the context of carotid artery stenosis is rarely encountered, treatment for this condition remains controversial. The present paper describes six cases of carotid artery stenosis with thrombus and discusses the efficacy and complications of carotid artery stenting (CAS). From April 2002 to May 2004, six patients with carotid artery stenosis and intraluminal thrombus receiving medical therapy underwent CAS at our institution. CAS was performed with distal protection alone (method 1) in three patients, and three other patients underwent CAS with reversed-flow system and distal protection (method 2). Two of six patients experienced worsening neurologic symptoms despite medical therapy. All six patients were successfully treated with CAS and showed satisfactory patency of the artery. Embolic lesions were detected on diffusion-weighted MRI after the procedure in all patients treated with method 1 but not in patients treated with method 2. Complications included stent thrombosis (n=1) and in-stent thrombus (n=1). All six patients achieved a modified Rankin Scale 1 or 2 classification at 30 days after stenting. In conclusion, CAS was feasible for stenosis even with intraluminal thrombus. Use of method 2 for this condition may reduce the incidence of thromboembolic events although our series was small in number.
