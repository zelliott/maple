To describe periorbital changes induced by chronic topical therapy with daily bimatoprost 0.03% (Lumigan, Allergan Inc., Irvine, CA, U.S.A.).

A clinical investigation of 5 nonconsecutive patients with unilateral glaucoma treated daily with topical bimatoprost 0.03% for up to 4 years prior to presentation.

In eyes treated with bimatoprost 0.03% the authors noted periorbital fat atrophy, deepening of the upper eyelid sulcus, relative enophthalmos, loss of the lower eyelid fullness, and involution of dermatochalasis compared with the fellow untreated eye. By inspecting old photographs the authors confirmed that these unilateral changes were not present prior to starting bimatoprost. In addition, these changes were partially reversible after discontinuation of the medication, whenever that was possible. In 2 cases imaging studies confirmed the clinical impression that these findings were not related to primary orbital pathology.

Physicians and patients should be aware of the potential of bimatoprost 0.03% to produce periorbital changes.
