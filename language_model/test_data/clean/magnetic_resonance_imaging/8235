Interferon-beta-1b is a valuable first-line therapy for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Many non-severe cutaneous reactions to recombinant interferon beta are described at injection sites. Panniculitis after subcutaneous injection of beta interferon is a rare adverse event; we describe two such cases at beta interferon injection sites.

Two women aged 22 years and 45 years with severe multiple sclerosis receiving immunotherapy with beta interferon were admitted to an emergency department following the appearance of extremely painful induration at injection sites rendering walking impossible after several months of interferon injections. One of the patients had fever. Histology tests showed vasculitis and capillary thrombosis in one-woman and dermal oedema in the other. MRI scanners showed extensive avascular necrosis of soft tissue without fasciitis in both patients. Interferon withdrawal and surgical debridement was carried out in one case and beta interferon was successfully reintroduced in both cases.

Only two cases have been reported of panniculitis induced by subcutaneous beta interferon injection. Clinically, such cases may mimic infectious processes. The present cases show that MRI may be useful in diagnosis and that the vascular toxicity of interferon beta probably plays a role in panniculitis. Temporary withdrawal of treatment, rotation of several injection sites and alternative routes of administration may all be proposed.
