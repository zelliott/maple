Colloid cyst is a rare intracranial tumor in childhood. This is the first report on the coexistence of a colloid cyst and the neuroglial heterotopia.

A 3-year-old boy presented with a 10-day history of headache. Radiological findings revealed a cyst in the third ventricle and a solid mass protruding into the lateral ventricle causing obstructive hydrocephalus. The cyst was attached to the solid mass. Endoscopic aspiration and removal of the cyst followed by biopsy of the protruding mass was performed. Headache and vomiting then disappeared and the patient returned to normal life.

The pathologic diagnosis was a colloid cyst associated with neuroglial heterotopia. We experienced a case of coexistent colloid cyst and neuroglial heterotopia, which have different embryonal origins.
