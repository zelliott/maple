A 61-year-old male presented with a brain abscess manifesting as high fever and generalized convulsion attacks. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging disclosed a ring-like enhanced lesion in the parietal lobe. Thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography (201Tl SPECT) images demonstrated a high uptake lesion with a 201Tl uptake index on the early image of 2.21, which suggested malignant disease. The washout ratio was 0.73. His symptoms and the ring-like enhanced lesion on MR images disappeared after 2 months of antibiotic treatment. The final diagnosis was brain abscess, despite the 201Tl SPECT findings. 201Tl SPECT washout ratio may be a better indicator of brain abscess than uptake index.
