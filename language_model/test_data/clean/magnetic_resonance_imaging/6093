Case report.

To report a long segment epidural hematoma with thoracic cord compression caused by a metastatic carcinoma.

To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma caused by metastatic carcinoma.

A 60-year-old woman with back pain and progressive leg weakness suddenly developed complete paraplegia and anesthesia below T8. A thoracic spine MRI showed an epidural hematoma and metastatic tumor. We describe the clinical course, radiographic imaging, operative findings, and treatment results.

Despite immediate surgery, the patient failed to have any significant improvement in her neurologic symptoms. A previously unsuspected primary lung tumor was diagnosed. She died 6 months after spine surgery.

Spinal epidural hematoma can occur in association with metastatic tumors in that area.
