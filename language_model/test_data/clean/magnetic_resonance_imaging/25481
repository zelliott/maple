There is a shortage of data addressing the clinical characteristics of patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who present with intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH).

A retrospective cohort study of members of a large, pre-paid health care program was conducted to identify factors that distinguish ICH secondary to cerebral AVMs from all other causes. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed using Student's t test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and logistic regression.

Patients with an underlying AVM were younger and more likely to be female, non-smokers with lower blood pressures, lower cholesterol, and lower white blood cell counts on presentation.

These clinical characteristics may be useful in defining potential risk factors in future prospective studies as well as targeting candidates for additional imaging studies after ICH with no apparent etiology.
