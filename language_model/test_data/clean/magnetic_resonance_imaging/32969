Extensive surgical removal of tumor tissue can contribute to longer survival for patients with gliomas. Intraoperative magnetic resonance (iMR) imaging is important for safe and maximal resection of brain tumors. A new operating room equipped with a 1.5-T MR imaging system and neuronavigation opened at Yamagata University Hospital in 2008. Using this new suite, we have safely treated over 200 cases. Use of iMR imaging improved glioma resection rates in 25 (34%) of 73 cases, and gross total resection was achieved in 48 patients (66%). Motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring was performed in combination with iMR imaging for 32 gliomas. MEP monitoring was successful in 30 cases (94%). Transient decreases in MEP amplitude were seen in two patients. One patient showed transient motor weakness and another showed improvement of motor function. The iMR imaging system provides useful information for tumor resection that allows intraoperative modification of surgical strategies. Combining MEP monitoring with iMR imaging appears to offer the most effective method for safe glioma surgery near eloquent areas.
