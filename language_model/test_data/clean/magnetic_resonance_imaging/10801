More than 90% of head and neck tumours are squamous cell carcinomas. This review focuses on tumours arising from the mucosal surfaces of the upper aerodigestive tract. We discuss the aetiology, presentation and investigation of these tumours and give special attention to their management which may comprise surgical resection, chemoradiation or combined therapy. The surgical treatment of the clinically positive neck and the somewhat controversial topic of management of the N0 neck are also discussed.
