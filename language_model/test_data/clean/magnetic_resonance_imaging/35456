We assessed the contribution of diffusion, perfusion and spectroscopy imaging for the diagnosis and follow-up of intraaxial tumors, suspected to be grade II gliomas. Twenty-four patients were included from April 2005 to July 2006, 17 initially and seven during their follow-up. The diagnosis was reconsidered in a first group of six patients: a high-grade tumor was suspected and confirmed in five. These patients presented a lipid peak; the perfusion results and the CHO/Cr and CHO/NAA ratios were not pathological. The second group included patients with grade II gliomas: these 18 patients had a radiographic work-up, initially, then at three months and every six months. For this group, no evidence of a change of grade were observed. Abnormal findings were noted in seven patients: among these patients, one developed radiographic progression, one other had radiographic progression associated with a spectroscopy lipid peak; only spectroscopy changes were noted in the third patient; the last patient had radiographic progression with perfusion and spectroscopy abnormalities; these four patients were treated. These observations suggest that diffusion, perfusion and spectroscopy can provide supplementary information for diagnosis and follow-up of glial tumors. The presence of a lipid peak is of particular value. The limitations of this work must also be taken into consideration: the follow-up was too short for slow-growing gliomas; the population was small and patients may have undergone surgery during the study, leading to structural modifications which may have compromised comparisons. This work should be continued with new examinations every six months and inclusion of new patients.
