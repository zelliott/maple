Although computed tomography (CT) provides a major imaging advance over conventional radiography and tomography in examining the whole body, the development of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has proven to be an even greater breakthrough in diagnostic medical imaging. The anatomic detail demonstrated in a MR image is a representation of at least three physical properties of static-tissue: proton density, and T1 and T2 relaxation times. Intrinsic differences in proton density and, in particular, in proton relaxation times of tissues allow excellent image contrast between various normal structures and high sensitivity in detecting pathological states. This article discusses imaging features of neurofibromatosis, with particular emphasis on the potential of MR imaging.
