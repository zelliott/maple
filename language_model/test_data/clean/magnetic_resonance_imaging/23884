A design for an inexpensive and reliable olfactometer is presented. The design has several advantages for fMRI and electrophysiology investigators. These advantages include relatively rapid odorant rise times, computer control, multiple odor administration, and no ferrous materials near the subjects. In addition, the device is contamination resistant, and, because the air is neither warmed nor humidified, it is unlikely to become an incubator for bacteria. The olfactometer is constructed of off-the-shelf chromatography parts that require little modification.
