Internal degloving injuries are rare in association with thoracolumbar fractures. A high index of suspicion is warranted to identify and debride such lesions to prevent infection, which can be disastrous in the presence of spinal hardware. Whether such lesions should be routinely repaired is probably dependent on the extent of avulsion.
