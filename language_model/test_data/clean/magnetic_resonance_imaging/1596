A 47-yr-old woman presented with a 1-yr history of progressive bilateral anterior lower leg pain and swelling with walking, which resolved 10 min after activity. Postexercise (forced dorsiflexion) magnetic resonance imaging revealed increased T2 signal intensity in the entire anterior muscle compartment, and anterior compartment pressures were elevated at rest and postexercise. Chronic exertional compartment syndrome can occur in some patients after even minimal physical activities, and magnetic resonance imaging without the use of radioisotopes was a useful adjunct for diagnosis.
