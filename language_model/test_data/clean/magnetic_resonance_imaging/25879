A case of leiomyosarcoma of the retrohepatic inferior vena cava associated with metastasis in the right liver lobe is reported. Resection included extended right hepatectomy, right nephrectomy, and tumor--containing inferior vena cava resection followed by polytetrafluoroethylene tube reconstruction. A comfortable survival was obtained before multifocal malignant spread led to death 42 months after surgery.
