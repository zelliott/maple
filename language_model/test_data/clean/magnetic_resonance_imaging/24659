Fingolimod acts as a functional antagonist of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor, and it traps lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organs and precludes their migration into the central nervous system. We report the case of a patient who suffered a relatively severe relapse of multiple sclerosis (MS) during the initial 3 months of fingolimod therapy, with retention of CCR7 expression on CD4(+) T cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) despite decreased numbers of lymphocytes and decreased expression of CCR7 on CD4(+) T cells in the blood. These data suggest that fingolimod may cause differential effects on the CSF and blood lymphocytes of patients with MS during the initial months of therapy.
