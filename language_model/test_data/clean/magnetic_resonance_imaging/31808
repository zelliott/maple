Coronary arterial lesions due to Kawasaki disease should be followed up throughout their lives. Although, X-ray coronary angiography is considered to be the gold standard for the detection of coronary arterial lesions, it is very invasive, hazardous, and expensive procedure. Furthermore it cannot detect the thickness of the vessel wall without using intravascular ultrasound. As a noninvasive examination, MR coronary angiography is a useful method for evaluating all types of coronary arterial lesions and intimal thickness, for all states of the disease for the early to the late phase in patients with all ages. MR myocardial imaging is also useful for detecting even small or thin subendocardial infarctions which are not able to be detected by RI imaging.
