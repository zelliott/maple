We report the MRI findings in three patients with pathologically proven hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, a rare tumor of the liver that is not well described in the MR imaging literature. The recognition of the imaging features of this rare malignancy may help further early detection and surgical treatment of this potentially curable disease.
