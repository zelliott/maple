To determine the value of gadolinium-DTPA (Gd-DTPA) as an MR contrast material for the gastrointestinal tract, we obtained T1-, T2-, and proton-density-weighted MR scans of the abdomen in 20 volunteers before and after oral administration of the compound (10 ml/kg of a 0.5- or 1.0-mM solution). Gd-DTPA was given either alone or with mannitol (15 or 30 g/l). Opacification of the small bowel after the administration of 1.0 mM Gd-DTPA was superior to that achieved after administration of the 0.5-mM solution. In the absence of Gd-DTPA, the pancreas could be delineated partly in 11 cases. After administration of Gd-DTPA, the pancreas could be well differentiated from stomach and duodenum in 16 of 20 cases. In the absence of mannitol, two of the five subjects had homogeneous opacification of the entire small bowel. When Gd-DTPA was given with either 15 or 30 g mannitol/l, homogeneous opacification of the entire small bowel was obtained in nine of 10 volunteers. Diarrhea not discomforting to the volunteers was noted in four of 20 cases. No abnormal blood tests were recorded after administration of Gd-DTPA. The results suggest that oral administration of Gd-DTPA (1.0 mM) given with mannitol (15 g/l) is effective as an MR contrast agent for the gastrointestinal tract. The formulation was found to be safe in a small series of 20 volunteers.
