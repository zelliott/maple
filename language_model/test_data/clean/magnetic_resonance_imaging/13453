Red blood cell proton nmr, T1 and T2 times, and water content were measured for normal control subjects and thirteen patients with chronic alcoholism during the withdrawal phase. T1 and T2 were significantly increased without significant alteration in cell water content. The relaxation times were more markedly affected in those with symptoms of delirium tremens. These findings suggest that the intracellular free:bound water states rather than water content is the more likely explanation for these changes. The results are discussed in relation to similar findings obtained from in vivo studies in man and in vitro studies in animals.
