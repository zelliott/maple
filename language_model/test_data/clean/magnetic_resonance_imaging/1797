Imaging modalities are the only noninvasive methods that provide morphological information on skeletal muscles. In neuromuscular diseases, electrodiagnostic investigations are routinely employed in the diagnostic process, although they only deliver functional information. Thus, imaging and electro-diagnostic methods are not in competition, but complement each other. Each method has its specific indications. The technique and diagnostic value of muscle ultrasound in neuromuscular diseases are presented in this review.
