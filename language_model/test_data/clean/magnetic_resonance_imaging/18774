To describe initial in vivo experiences with a subzone-based, steady-state MR elastography (MRE) method. This sparse collection of in vivo results is intended to shed light on some of the strengths and weaknesses of existing clinical MRE approaches and to indicate important areas of future research.

Elastic property reconstruction results are compared with data compiled from the limited existing body of published studies in breast elasticity. Mechanical parameter distributions are also investigated in terms of their implications for the nature of biological soft tissue. Additionally, a derivation of the statistical variance of the elastic parameter reconstruction is given and the resulting confidence intervals (CIs) for different parameter solutions are examined.

By comparison with existing estimates of the elastic properties of breast tissue, the subzone-based, steady-state MRE method is seen to produce reasonable estimates for the mechanical properties of in vivo tissue.

MRE shows potential as an effective way to determine the elastic properties of breast tissue, and may be of significant clinical interest.
