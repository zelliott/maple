Drug therapy to the central nervous system is complicated by the presence of the blood-brain barrier. The development of new drug delivery techniques to overcome this obstacle will be aided by a clear understanding of the transport processes in the brain. A rigorous theoretical framework of the transport of drugs delivered locally to the parenchyma has been developed using the finite element method. Magnetic resonance imaging has been used to track the transport of paramagnetic contrast markers in the brain. The information obtained by postprocessing spin-echo, T1-weighted, and proton density images has been used to refine the mathematical model that includes realistic brain geometry and salient anatomic features and allows for two-dimensional transport of chemical species, including both diffusive and convective contributions. In addition, the effects of regional differences in tissue properties, ventricular boundary, and edema on the transport have been considered. The model has been used to predict transport of interleukin-2 in the brain and study the major determinants of transport, at both early and late times after drug delivery.
