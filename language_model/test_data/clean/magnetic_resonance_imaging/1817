The usual polymorphic central nervous system involvement observed in primary Sjögren's syndrome is classified as monofocal, multifocal or diffuse involvement. We present a case of acute rhombencephalitis associated with hearing loss that could correspond to an intermediate form between diffuse and monofocal involvement. The acute onset with fever and not clinical sign of xerostomia or xerophthalmia suggest the possibility of vascular-like or infectious-like forms. We emphasize the importance of obtaining a minor salivary gland biopsy for diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome and suggest that Sjögren's syndrome could be frequently misdiagnosed.
