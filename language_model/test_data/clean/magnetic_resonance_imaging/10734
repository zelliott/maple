The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) is often used to evaluate magnetic resonance images, because it has two components, contrast and SNR, and indicates the detectability of clinical lesions. Two methods (using a phantom and using clinical images) are employed to measure CNR. In addition, there are some methods of measurement that use clinical images. In this report, the accuracy of measurement and correlation for signal detectability were evaluated in four methods of measuring CNR using clinical images. The results indicated that the inter-tissue method using an air signal provided good accuracy and was consistent with signal detectability using observer performance. In addition, a small region of interest (ROI) was better suited as the target for CNR measurement using clinical images.
