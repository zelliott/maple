Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is frequently considered the best method of diagnosis in musculoskeletal disorders. Intraarticular fluid improves joint assessment by helping to delineate intraarticular structures, separating otherwise closely-apposed structures, and filling potential spaces which lie within or communicate with the joint. Initially, it was anticipated that plain MRI would replace arthrography. The message from our surgical colleagues is that this ideal has not yet been achieved. Greater precision should reduce the need for more invasive techniques, such as diagnostic arthroscopy which is why direct and indirect MR arthrography are being employed. This article reviews the current status of MR arthrography as an evolving technique in the imaging of joint disorders.
