Adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenomas causing Cushing's disease are often difficult to identify because of their variable locations and their small size. This report presents histological evidence of an ectopic ACTH-secreting adenoma located entirely within the cavernous sinus.

A 62-year-old woman presented with central obesity, hypertension, and osteoporosis. Endocrinological evaluation suggested the presence of an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma; however, imaging studies, including dynamic magnetic resonance imaging, did not reveal any visible lesions in the pituitary gland. Bilateral cavernous sinus sampling demonstrated a large central/peripheral ACTH gradient, with a right/left ACTH gradient. The patient was treated as having pituitary-dependent Cushing's disease, until she died suddenly as a result of acute respiratory failure.

In a postmortem histological examination, an ACTH-secreting adenoma was found in the right cavernous sinus, which was completely surrounded by dura mater and had no direct connection with the pituitary gland.

Although they are rare, such adenomas located in the cavernous sinus should be recognized as one of the reasons for inaccurate cavernous sinus sampling and the failure of transsphenoidal surgery for patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome.
