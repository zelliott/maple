Acute ethmoiditis is a rare infection of ethmoidal cells. The pathognomonic sign is an edema of the internal corner of the eye. Imaging may be necessary to verify the absence of orbital or endocranial complications. Thrombophlebitis of the cavernous sinus is a serious complication of this infectious process. We report the case of an 11-year-old boy who presented with ethmoiditis complicated with thrombophlebitis of the cavernous sinus, with right hemiplegia and left Bell palsy sequelae. Early diagnosis of this disorder and urgent therapy are essential. Treatment is based on the antibiotic therapy.
