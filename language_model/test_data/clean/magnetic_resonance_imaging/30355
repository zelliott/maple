Frequent coexistence of syringomyelia and Arnold-Chiari syndrome results in overlapping of symptoms caused by these processes. Because the most common location of syringomyelic cavities is in the cervico-thoracic part of the spine, the first symptoms usually concern the upper extremities. Symptoms induced by compression through the invaginated cerebellar tonsils to the occipital foramen in Arnold-Chiari syndrome may be divided into three groups: increased intracranial pressure, cerebellar and spinal symptoms. The radiological investigations applied in recognition of those cases were initially based on different kinds of myelography, then on computed tomography. Magnetic resonance imaging is the investigation of choice nowadays. It allows one to determine the location and extension of the cavities within the spine, their relation to particular anatomical structures and possible existence of partitions, and demonstrate anomalies in the region of the craniocervical junction.
