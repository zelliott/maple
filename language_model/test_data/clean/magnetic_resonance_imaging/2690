A 68-year-old man is presented with a reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) of the right ankle diagnosed by radiography, magnetic resonance imaging and bone scintiscan. Investigations, including blood tests and bone biopsy, revealed a diagnosis of metabolic acidosis and osteomalacia. These appeared to result from a ureterosigmoidostomy performed 9 years previously for a transitional carcinoma of the bladder. Correction of the metabolic acidosis coincided with improvement in ankle pain. RSDS may be the initial presentation of osteomalacia, which in turn may be caused by the metabolic acidosis resulting from a ureterosigmoidostomy.
