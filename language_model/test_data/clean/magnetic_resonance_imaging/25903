Acquired syringomyelia was diagnosed in an 11-year-old Fox Terrier with progressive paresis in the left pelvic limb. Myelography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed an intramedullary lesion involving the left dorsolateral portion of the spinal cord at the level of L-2 and L-3 vertebrae. Clinical signs improved after surgical syringotomy. Microscopic evaluation of a biopsy specimen from the cyst wall did not establish a definitive histologic diagnosis. The cyst was decreased in size on magnetic resonance imaging 7 months later.
