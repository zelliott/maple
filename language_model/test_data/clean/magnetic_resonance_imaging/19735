We present a variant of a split cord malformation with coexisting segmental spinal dysgenesis. CT myelography showed the left hemicord with a small remnant of subarachnoid space running through an intravertebral cleft in a spine anomaly. The left hemicord had no apparent intradual connection to the upper cord on any radiologic examination, though functional electrical stimulation studies revealed an intact efferent pathway that connected the left hemicord to the main spinal cord.
