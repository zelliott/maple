A case of cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma is reported. This tumor occurs typically in the first two decades of life and is seldom reported in adults. The 42-year-old patient presented with occipital headaches, nausea, and unsteady gait. Nystagmus and right dysmetria were noted. A CT scan showed a hypodense, nonenhancing, voluminous, right hemispheric cerebellar cyst. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a nodule in the wall of the cyst which became hyperintense with gadolinium. The mass was resected through a small occipital craniotomy. Neuropathological examination revealed a juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma.
