Isolated fourth ventricle (IFV) is a rare complication in patients who undergo shunt placement, and it is not easily corrected by surgical procedures. The authors report a case of IFV that was successfully treated with an aqueductal stent placed under direct visualization by using a neuroendoscope. This 36-year-old suffered meningitis after partial resection of a brainstem pilocytic astrocytoma, and subsequently developed hydrocephalus for which a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Nine months later, the patient presented with progressive cerebellar ataxia, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed slitlike supratentorial ventricles and a markedly enlarged fourth ventricle, which were compatible with the diagnosis of IFV. The surgical procedure described was performed under visualization through a styletlike slim optic fiberscope inserted into a ventricular catheter. The catheter, with the endoscope inside it, was passed through the foramen of Monro and then through the aqueduct to reach the enlarged fourth ventricle, where membranous occlusion of the foramen of Magendie was clearly visualized. The tip of the catheter was placed in the fastigium of the fourth ventricle. After the procedure, the size of the fourth ventricle was reduced and the patient's symptoms improved. Thus, it is concluded that endoscopic aqueductal stent placement is a simple and safe surgical procedure for treatment of IFV.
