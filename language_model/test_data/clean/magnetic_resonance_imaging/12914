To determine the prevalence of specific cerebral lesions of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and neurological outcome in cases diagnosed prenatally with cardiac rhabdomyomas.

We reviewed all fetuses diagnosed prenatally with cardiac rhabdomyomas which had undergone detailed ultrasound evaluation and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and which were recorded in the database of a single institution covering the period January 1992 to December 2005.

Fifty-one fetuses were included in the study. MRI was performed at a mean +/- SD gestational age of 30 +/- 3 gestational weeks and showed specific lesions of TSC in 49% of cases. Termination of pregnancy was chosen by the parents in 26 cases. Neurological development was studied in 20 cases, follow-up lasting 4.8 +/- 2.9 years. Neurodevelopmental events occurred during the follow-up period in 45% of cases. Neurological complications occurred in 67% of patients who had cerebral lesions at MRI and in 33% of patients with normal MRI results. There was no significant difference between the two groups of patients (P = 0.2).

In fetuses with cardiac rhabdomyomas detailed ultrasound examination and third-trimester cerebral MRI are able to diagnose most TSC cerebral lesions, but fail to determine neurological outcome.
