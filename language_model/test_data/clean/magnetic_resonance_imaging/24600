We previously reported that hippocampal volume was associated with current, but not lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that like the hippocampus, the volumes of other brain regions previously implicated in PTSD, are also negatively related to current, but not lifetime PTSD symptom severity. One hundred ninety-one veterans underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on a 4T scanner. Seventy-five veterans were trauma unexposed, 43 were trauma exposed without PTSD, 39 were trauma exposed with current PTSD, and 34 were trauma exposed veterans with remitted PTSD. Hippocampal, amygdala, rostral and caudal anterior cingulate, insula, and corpus callosum volumes, quantified with Freesurfer version 4.5, were analyzed by group using multivariate analysis of covariance. Veterans with PTSD had smaller hippocampal, caudal anterior cingulate, insula, and corpus callosum volumes than the unexposed controls (p≤0.009); smaller hippocampal, caudal anterior cingulate, insula (p≤0.009) and marginally smaller corpus callosum (p=0.06) than veterans with remitted PTSD; and smaller hippocampal and caudal anterior cingulate volumes than veterans without PTSD (p≤0.04). In contrast, there was no significant volume differences between veterans with remitted PTSD compared to those without PTSD or unexposed controls. The finding that current but not lifetime PTSD accounts for the volumes of multiple brain regions suggests that either smaller brain volume is a vulnerability factor that impedes recovery from PTSD or that recovery from PTSD is accompanied by a wide-spread restoration of brain tissue.
