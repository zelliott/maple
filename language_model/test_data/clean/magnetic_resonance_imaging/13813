Spontaneous haematomas of the iliac psoas muscle are rare lesions seen in patients receiving anticoagulant agents or suffering from clotting disorders. We report the rare case of a spontaneous iliac psoas haematoma causing femoral neuropathy in a patient not undergoing anticoagulant treatment or suffering from a coagulopathy. After conservative treatment the patient was entirely asymptomatic, and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated complete dissolution of the haematoma. Spontaneous iliac psoas haematomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of leg pain in otherwise healthy patients.
