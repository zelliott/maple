We report a case of massive ovarian edema due to left adnexal torsion. On initial magnetic resonance (MR), unusual hemorrhages were demonstrated as several hypointense areas on T2-weighted images. The lack of contrast enhancement was also observed in the left adnexa. Abdominal pain resolved spontaneously, and then follow-up MR demonstrated the recovery of enhancement and hemorrhages as hyperintense signals on T1-weighted images.
