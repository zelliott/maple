Although benign, pituitary adenomas may not always be curable by surgery alone. This is usually owing to dural infiltration and the technical problems of removal of involved dura in the sellar region. In such circumstances, some form of adjuvant therapy may be needed to address residual tumour and forestall recurrence. Radiotherapy and drugs, such as bromocriptine or octreotide, although effective are far from ideal adjuvant therapies and this has led to the study of the effects of photodynamic therapy on pituitary adenomas. It has been shown that photodynamic therapy using the photosensitising drugs haematoporphyrin derivative and aluminium phthalocyanine is active experimentally against these tumours. This could provide another useful weapon to use against these challenging lesions.
