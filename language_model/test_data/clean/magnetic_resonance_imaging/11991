Fourty-five subjects--10 normal volunteers and 35 patients with valvular insufficiency were examined with MRI and [20 of them with mitral (MI) and 15 with aortic (AI) insufficiency] were evaluated with MR imaging and with Doppler echocardiography (echo-Doppler); 22 of these patients were also studied with angiocardiography. The extent of regurgitation jet was classified as follows: minimal (1+), mild (2+), moderate (3+), and severe (4+), according to the max distance of regurgitant jet signal from valvular leaflets. In our series, MR imaging with FFE sequences always showed the regurgitant jet. High agreement was found between MR and echo-Doppler results (80% for MI, and 86% for AI). In 22 patients who underwent angiocardiography, we observed 73% agreement. Cine-MR imaging proved to be an accurate and sensitive technique to recognize and to evaluate severity of regurgitant valvular flow in patients with AI and MI. This technique may be useful in those patients in whom Doppler echocardiography is inadequate or impossible to perform.
