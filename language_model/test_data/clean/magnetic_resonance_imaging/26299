We report a case of intrahepatic biliary calculi. A localized dilated intrahepatic duct of the left lateral segment of the liver was filled with material that showed marked hyperintensity on T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images. These MR findings are unusual for intrahepatic stones. Pathologically, the stones were muddy bilirubin calculi, the chemical and physical characteristics of which are surmised to have been the cause of the unusual MR findings.
