The neurological manifestations of twenty-one Japanese patients with Sj√∂gren's syndrome (SjS) were evaluated. All patients were women, and sixteen of the twenty-one cases (76%) demonstrated objective abnormal neurological symptoms, the most frequently observed of which was trigeminal neuropathy (50%). Multiple mononeuropathy was seen in almost one-third of the examined cases (31%). Central nervous system (CNS) involvement was observed in three cases (14%). All of these values differed greatly from those previously reported. Therefore, this study revealed characteristic features of Japanese SjS and also implied the existence of different immunopathological mechanisms associated with SjS in Japanese patients.
