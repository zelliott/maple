A case of intraosseous xanthoma in a patient with a normal lipid profile is reported. Hyperlipidemia is present in most patients with xanthomas. Intraosseous xanthomas are rare, particularly in normolipidemic patients, in whom the presenting symptom is pain without skin lesions. A lytic lesion with a rim of sclerosis is seen on radiographs. Histology shows foam cells, giant cells, and fibrosis. Intraosseous xanthoma is a benign tumor, and other diagnoses must be ruled out (histiocytosis X, Erdheim Chester disease, clear cell carcinoma metastasis). Surgical excision of the lesion is the elective treatment.
