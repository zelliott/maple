We describe a 44-year-old woman with a primary retroperitoneal serous cystadenocarcinoma as the fourth report in the world literature. A contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the abdomen demonstrated a mass with enhanced solid mural nodules and septa in the left retroperitoneum. Serum CA19-9 was elevated at 181 U/ml. The patient underwent a complete resection of the retroperitoneal tumor with a partial resection of the psoas major muscle and its fascia. Pathological examination showed a well-differentiated papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma of ovarian type and locoregional lymph node metastases. Seven months after surgery, the patient developed a pelvic recurrence, and underwent a total hysterectomy, a left salpingo-oophorectomy and a resection of the metastatic mesenteric mass. Two months after the second surgery, serum CA19-9 and CA125 increased to 1,114 U/ml and 218 U/ml, respectively. A solitary liver metastasis was confirmed on a computed tomographic scan. The patient is now being treated with weekly docetaxel and carboplatin.

The present case illustrates the clinically aggressive nature of a primary retroperitoneal serous cystadenocarcinoma.
