Proximal pole scaphoid nonunion with a small necrotic proximal fragment presents therapeutical problems. Cannulated screw fixation as a modification of the Russe II procedure combines the advantages of minimal surgical exposure and trauma, preserving the blood supply of the distal fragment, and at the same time achieving rigid fixation of the autogenous bone graft. Six out of seven patients had satisfactory subjective and objective results after a mean follow-up of 12.9 years, although radiographic findings were less favorable.
