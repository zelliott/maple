The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of dynamic MR hepatocholangiography with the Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced SIP Fast GRE sequence in the hepatobiliary system. The SIP Fast GRE sequence was used for sequential imaging of the hepatobiliary system with a frame rate of 3 sec in a 256 x 192 matrix. Dynamic sequential acquisition was performed for 51 min before and after the injection of 30 mu mol/kg of Gd-EOB-DTPA in a rabbit. Dynamic images of the hepatobiliary system were obtained in the rabbit study. Dynamic MR hepatocholangiography provides better functional information than conventional MR cholangiography.
