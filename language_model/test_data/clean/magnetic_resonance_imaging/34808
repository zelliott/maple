Quantitative diffusion measurements were performed in tumors arising from inoculation of nude mice with two human breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and T47D) to evaluate the specificity of this technique for characterizing solid tumors. ADC maps were compared to histology and correlated well with gross tumor morphology. Measured ADCs were highly specific for viable and necrotic tumor in the five T47D tumors included in this study (P < 0.02), while only two of the five MCF7 tumors studied developed distinguishable areas of necrosis. No statistically significant difference was observed in ADCs from viable tumor between the different cell lines (P > 0.05).
