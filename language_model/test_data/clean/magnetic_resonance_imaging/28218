In his 1990 Presidential Address Professor C R Hill posed the question of whether, given the ethos of the late 20th century, there was a future for radiological science. To answer his question he reviewed the scientific basis of current major branches of radiology, demonstrating progress resulting from initial physical discovery, combined with engineering and medical inventiveness. In the process of the development of radiological science, small-scale speculative research, outside mainstream areas, has proved to be an important element. This address complements Professor Hill's by examining the role of a small-scale speculative research (the niches of the field). Examples are taken from the early pioneers of radiological science and the first British Institute of Radiology Congress. Finally some lesser known research activity in this category, being presented at the Golden Jubilee Congress, is reviewed.
