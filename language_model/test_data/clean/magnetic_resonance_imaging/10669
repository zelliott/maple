An 18-month-old white boy, observed by his parents at 1-2 months age to have poor visual attentiveness and nystagmus, underwent an ophthalmological evaluation. The patient also underwent unsedated 5-channel flash visual evoked potentials (VEP) and sedated electroretinogram (ERG) testing as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits. The VEP in response to monocular stimulation demonstrated occipital asymmetry and was clearly suggestive of crossed asymmetry and also showed right optic nerve hypoplasia. The MRI and fundoscopic examinations supported the findings of achiasmia and probable optic nerve hypoplasia. The patient also had decreased Teller card visual acuity, nystagmus and a variable right esotropia. Neurological examination was normal. The ophthalmological and MRI findings in this 18-month-old male patient support the diagnosis of isolated non-decussating retinal-fugal fibre syndrome as well as hypoplasia of the optic nerve.
