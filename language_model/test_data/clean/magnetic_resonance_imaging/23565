A 25-year-old woman was admitted for vomiting, hypertension and seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging was compatible with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and a transcranial Doppler/vasomotor reactivity study (TCD/VMR) demonstrated loss of vasomotor reactivity. The clinical recovery was concomitant to improvement in the TCD/VMR.
