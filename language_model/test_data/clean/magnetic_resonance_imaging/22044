Chondroid chordoma is a rare variant of chordoma and is usually located in the sphenooccipital region. This tumor shows clinical and histologic features common to both conventional chordoma and low grade chondrosarcoma and has a better prognosis than either of those lesions. To our knowledge, there has been no English language report describing its cytologic features.

The cytologic features of skull base chondroid chordoma observed in intraoperative crush and touch preparations from a 33-year-old female are reported. Touch cytology revealed round or stellate cells distributed in a mucoid background without a typical epithelial cordlike arrangement. The cells had variably vacuolated cytoplasm and round or oval nuclei and showed slight cellular pleomorphism. May-Giemsa staining was superior to Papanicolaou staining in demonstrating the mucoid matrix and vacuolated cytoplasm of the tumor cells. Additionally, crush preparations were effective in demonstrating well-differentiated chondroid elements. Immunocytochemistry with positivity for S-100 protein and cytokeratins was an essential adjunct in the cytologic diagnosis of chordoma and helped in distinguishing it from other chondrogenic tumors.

It is possible and advantageous to diagnose chondroid chordoma with a combination of cytologic and immunocytochemical studies of intraoperative crush and touch preparations in conjunction with clinical and radiographic information.
