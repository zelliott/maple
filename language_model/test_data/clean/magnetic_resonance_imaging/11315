Two-dimensional phase-contrast MRI measurements of complex unsteady flows have been assessed for accuracy, together with procedures used to improve the precision of the measurements. Velocity measurements of single harmonic sinusoidal flow in a rigid bypass graft model with a fully three-dimensional geometry were compared to an accurate numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations for the same flow. Axial velocity profiles from the MRI were compared with the computational data, and instantaneous root mean square (rms) differences were calculated. Despite the complexity of the flow, with the aid of phase angle dynamic range extension, a spatially and temporally averaged rms error of between 7.8% and 11.5%, with respect to the spatially and temporally averaged velocity, was achieved. Spin saturation primarily and phase dispersion secondarily in complex transient recirculation zones were found to be significant contributors to overall error. Cross flow effects were also investigated but were of lesser significance. The result confirms the suitability of the technique for measuring complex unsteady flows.
