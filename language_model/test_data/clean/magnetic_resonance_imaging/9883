A 38-yr-old woman reported intermittent pain, paresthesia, and weakness in the right upper limb and sweating on the right side of her face and ipsilateral upper limb during the last 4 yrs. Eventually, she was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, whereby sympathetic nervous system involvement was thought to ensue because of idiopathic tumoral calcinosis in the neck region. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of such a concomitance.
