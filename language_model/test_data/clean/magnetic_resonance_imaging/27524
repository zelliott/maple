Primary myxomas of the temporal bone are rare tumors. If misdiagnosed, they can grow into locally aggressive expansile masses resulting in hearing loss, facial paralysis, dural invasion, and mass effect on the adjacent brain parenchyma. This case demonstrates the natural history of an extraordinarily rare tumor over a longer period not previously described. The importance of correlating histopathologic findings with diagnostic imaging features to enable an accurate diagnosis is also emphasized.
