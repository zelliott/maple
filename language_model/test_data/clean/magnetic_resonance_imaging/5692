Wolfram syndrome (WFS), also known as DIDMOAD, is an infrequent cause of diabetes mellitus. WFS is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by various clinical manifestations such as diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, diabetes insipidus, deafness, neurological symptoms, renal tract abnormalities, psychiatric disorders, and gonadal disorders. The majority of patients with WFS carry the loss of function mutations in the WFS1 gene. The exons 2-8 of the WFS1 gene from one Chinese WFS patient were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), subcloning techniques and direct sequence determination was applied to the amplified fragments. The compound heterozygous mutation of a 3-bp (GAC) deletion (V434del) and another compound heterozygous mutation (G-->N)(W666X) in exon 8 of WFS1 gene was identified in the patient. Other seventeen members of her family were investigated. Four cases with heterozygotes had been found through screening for the mutation V434del and five cases for the mutation W666X in the whole family. This is the first report of WFS with the mutation V434del and W666X in the WFS1 gene.
