Cavernous haemangiomas arising in the paranasal sinuses are very rare. Even though the lesion is benign in nature, its imaging features are non-specific, leading to an incorrect pre-operative diagnosis in most patients. We present a case of a maxillary sinus cavernous haemangioma in a young male. The clinical presentation and imaging characteristics of this entity are reviewed.
