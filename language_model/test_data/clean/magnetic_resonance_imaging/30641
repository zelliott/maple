We compared neural substrates of two-dimensional shape processing in human and nonhuman primates using functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in awake subjects. The comparison of MR activity evoked by viewing intact and scrambled images of objects revealed shape-sensitive regions in occipital, temporal, and parietal cortex of both humans and macaques. Intraparietal cortex in monkeys was relatively more two-dimensional shape sensitive than that of humans. In both species, there was an interaction between scrambling and type of stimuli (grayscale images and drawings), but the effect of stimulus type was much stronger in monkeys than in humans. Shape- and motion-sensitive regions overlapped to some degree. However, this overlap was much more marked in humans than in monkeys. The shape-sensitive regions can be used to constrain the warping of monkey to human cortex and suggest a large expansion of lateral parietal and superior temporal cortex in humans compared with monkeys.
