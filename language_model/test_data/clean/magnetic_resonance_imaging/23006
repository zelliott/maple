Follicular dendritic cell sarcomas of the tonsil are very rare tumors. Only 10 cases have been published in the English-language medical literature. We present an additional case that occurred in a 27-year-old woman. She presented with a tumor of the right tonsil. Histological sections of tonsillar biopsies and tonsillectomy suggested that this tumor was a nerve sheath tumor or a malignant melanoma. Histological examination and immunohistochemical study were reviewed. The final diagnosis was follicular dendritic cell sarcoma. She underwent a transoral resection of the right oropharynx with ipsilateral selective neck dissection and postoperative irradiation. We emphasize the difficulties in diagnosing this type of tumor. The use of monoclonal specific markers is required to avoid misdiagnosis. We discuss therapeutic methods for this rare tumor for which optimal treatment has not yet been defined.
