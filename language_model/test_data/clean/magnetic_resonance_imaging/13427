A case of Raeder's syndrome caused by metastatic malignant lymphoma was reported. The patient was 67-year-old male. He had complained of diplopia, ptosis and frontal headache at the left side. Neurological examinations revealed left incomplete Horner's syndrome (miosis and ptosis, but normal facial sweating) and left abducens palsy, which was considered to be Raeder's syndrome Group 1 (Boniuk and Schlazinger's classification). CT scan, MRI and angiography demonstrated a mass lesion in the left cavernous sinus extending to the sphenoparietal sinus, and a mass lesion in the anterior part of the superior sagittal sinus. During his hospitalization, enlargement of the left cervical lymph nodes was noticed. "Malignant lymphoma (non-Hodgkin)" was diagnosed on the basis of biopsy. Group 1 of Raeder's syndrome is rare, but it is important to define the site of lesion, which is located around the paratrigeminal region at the middle cranial fossa. Because these lesions are very small and metastatic in many cases, various neuroradiological investigations, especially MRI, are necessary for early diagnosis and early treatment.
