Our aim was to better understand and improve the accuracy of the preoperative diagnosis of intraspinal MM by a combined analysis of MR imaging and pathologic findings. All 5 patients had undergone unenhanced and contrast-enhanced MR imaging examinations. All tumor samples had immunohistochemical reactions to HMB-45, vimentin, S-100, EMA, and Leu-7 antibodies. All 5 cases were located in the intradural extramedullary compartment. Two cases had multifocal lesions, and 3 cases were solitary. Two cases showed homogeneously strong enhancement, and 3 cases showed moderate enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1WI. The tumor cells had positive reactions to HMB-45, vimentin, and S-100 antibodies. MR imaging plays an important role in the detection and diagnosis of intraspinal MM. Final diagnosis should be based on histopathology and IHC examinations.
