Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is rarely located in the central nervous system, and sella turcica involvement was reported in only two patients. We report the case of a 28-year-old man with a SFT of the sella turcica mimicking a pituitary nonfunctioning macroadenoma. He presented with optic nerve compression caused by a heterogeneous tumor located in the sellar and suprasellar area. At surgery, the tumor was hard and infiltrated the sellar diaphragm, so that resection resulted in a cerebrospinal fluid fistula. His postoperative course was also complicated by complete central diabetes insipidus, hypopituitarism, and two episodes of meningitis. After surgical resection, the diagnosis of SFT was reached on the basis of histological and immunohistochemical studies. He was discharged after 49 days. Ten months after surgery, he was clinically well, and magnetic resonance images showed no evidence of residual or recurrent tumor. SFT should be considered in the differential diagnosis of sellar and parasellar tumors.
