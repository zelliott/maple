Texaphyrins are pentaaza expanded porphyrins with the ability to form stable complexes with a variety of metal cations, particularly those of the lanthanide series. In biological milieus, texaphyrins act as redox mediators and mediate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this review, newer studies involving texaphyrin complexes targeting several different applications in anticancer therapy are described. In particular, the preparation of bismuth and lead texaphyrin complexes as potential Î±-core emitters for radiotherapy is detailed, as are gadolinium texaphyrin functionalized magnetic nanoparticles with features that make them of interest as dual-mode magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents and as constructs with anticancer activity mediated through ROS-induced sensitization and concurrent hyperthermia. Also discussed are gadolinium texaphyrin complexes as possible carrier systems for the targeted delivery of platinum payloads.
