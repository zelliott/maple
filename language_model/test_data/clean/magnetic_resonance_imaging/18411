Multiple small lesions of low intensity on T2-weighted images identified by MR imaging were observed in four patients. There were no definite associations between the patients' clinical symptoms and the lesions. MR imaging showed multiple, small areas with slightly high and/or low-intensities on T1-weighted images, and low intensities on T2-weighted images. IN two patients these low intensity areas were increased in size with field echo images. These MR studies indicate that multiple ruptures and/or hemorrhagic infarctions of microaneurysms may occur in the brain without any clinical manifestations.
