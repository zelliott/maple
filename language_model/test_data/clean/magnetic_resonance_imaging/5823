To identify the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of periocular topotecan in patients with relapsed or resistant intraocular retinoblastoma who are facing imminent enucleation.

For this phase I study, a starting dose of 0.5 mg of periocular topotecan administered through a 25-gauge needle was given with intrapatient escalation at a rate of 0.5 mg/cycle according to toxicity, up to a maximum dose of 2 mg. Two courses separated by 2 weeks were scheduled. Plasma levels of topotecan were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in patients with available intravenous catheters.

Seven eyes of five patients were treated with a total of 14 courses of periocular topotecan. Only mild orbital edema occurred, and grade 1 vomiting developed in the first patient that was controlled with ondansetron for the following courses. Dose-limiting toxicity was not reached and the maximum tolerated dose was set at the target dose of 2 mg (n=5 eyes). Lactone topotecan systemic exposure was lower than 55 ng/mL x h and it correlated linearly with dose in this small cohort. Even though the study was not designed to assess response, one eye was preserved after a partial response, but the remaining six were enucleated, either after a short period of disease stabilization followed by further therapy with other agents in five patients or by rapidly progressive disease in one.

The dose limiting toxicity was not reached. Up to 2 mg of periocular topotecan could be given safely, but further studies are necessary to determine its effect on retinoblastoma (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00460876).
