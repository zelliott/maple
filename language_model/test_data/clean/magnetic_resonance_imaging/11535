A case of spontaneous regression of a large herniated disc at the lumbar level is presented. The disc regression correlated with clinical improvement and was documented on serial MRI studies. Although the phenomenon of spontaneous disappearance of decrease in size of herniated disc fragments is well known, the exact mechanism underlying this process remains unclear. This report discusses three possible explanations for disc regression: retraction into the intervertebral space, dehydration/shrinkage, and resorption due to inflammatory reaction.
