Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease, is a vascular disorder characterized by multiple mucocutaneous and visceral arteriovenous malformations. There is little in the literature about the anaesthetic management of parturients with this condition. We report the anaesthetic management for caesarean section of two such parturients. One patient, with significant pulmonary involvement, received neuraxial anaesthesia for caesarean delivery. The second patient had general anaesthesia because investigations could not rule out neurological involvement. We review and discuss the anaesthetic considerations for obstetric patients with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia.
