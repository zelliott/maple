In order to study the chemical constituents of the leaves of Tripterygium wilfordii and provide references for the bio-active study, we isolated nine compounds from the dried leaves of Tripterygium wilfordii. Their structures were determined by application of spectroscopic (NMR, MS) and chemical methods. These compounds were isolated and identified as (+)-lyoniresinol (1), (+)-isolariciresinol (2), burselignan (3), dibutyl phthalate (4), cyclo-(S-Pro-R-Phe) (5), cyclo-(S-Pro-R-Leu) (6), cyclo-(S-Pro-S-Ile) (7), 3-hydroxy-1-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-propanone (8) and daucosterol (9). Compounds 1-3, 5-8 were isolated from this plant for the first time.
