A 4-year old pygmy goat with chronic paraparesis of the hindlimbs was referred to the Ruminant Clinic of the University of Berne. The causative lesion was localized to the thoracolumbar spinal cord after a thorough clinical examination. Because a radiographic examination of the spine had not been diagnostic, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. A mass compressing the spinal cord in the region of L2-L5 was detected. The goat was euthanized and autopsied, which allowed for the definitive diagnosis of lymphosarcoma. In addition to the changes in the lumbar area, further neoplastic masses were detected in the region of the thoracic vertebrae, near the thoracic aperture, on the lungs and on the pericardium. However, these processes had not yet caused clinical signs. MRI investigation allowed for the ante mortem diagnosis of an infiltrative mass in the spinal canal of this goat.
