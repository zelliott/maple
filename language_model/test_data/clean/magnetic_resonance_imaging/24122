To investigate positron emission tomography (PET) with (fluorine-18)-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) for detecting recurrent ovarian carcinoma.

Wholebody FDG-PET scanning was performed on five patients before surgical exploration. All five patients were suspected of having recurrence based upon clinical findings and underwent surgery after scanning.

In all five patients, PET images demonstrated increased FDG uptake in a distribution that correlated with surgical-pathologic findings (100%); computer tomography can detect 60% of such patients with malignant disease. Two cases with unexplained elevated serum CA-125 had lesions localized by PET.

Recurrence of ovarian carcinoma was clearly imaged with FDG-PET and was confirmed by surgical pathology. FDG-PET might be a fairly effective tool for detecting recurrent ovarian carcinoma.
