We report two cases of adamantinoma of the tibia, for which an MR examination was performed. Each patient was initially investigated with plain radiography and in case 2, a computerized tomography was also performed. The MR characteristics of this tumor are scarcely documented in the even few case reports of this tumor. MRI does not add to the (differential) diagnosis but does have significance in the preoperative staging because it allows adequate delineation of tumor, which is essential for a complete and curative resection of the tumor.
