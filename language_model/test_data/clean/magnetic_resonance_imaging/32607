Therapies aimed at inhibiting tumor necrosis factor, a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in autoimmune disease, are effective for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Crohn's disease. We report two patients who newly developed multiple demyelinating lesions in the central nervous system in the course of infliximab therapy for active RA. Neurological symptoms and the number of gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced lesions in magnetic resonance imaging gradually diminished with steroid treatment.
