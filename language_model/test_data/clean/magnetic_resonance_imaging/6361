Potentialities of MR-tomography of the heart were studied in 20 healthy persons. Synchronization with the cardiac cycle on ECG was used in 15 cases. The VMT-1100 MR-tomograph (Brucker, FRG) was employed. The spinecho technique was used. MR-tomography of the heart was performed in axial, sagittal, frontal and oblique planes with relation to the anatomical heart axes. All major heart structures and mediastinal vascular bundles were clearly visualized on MR-images obtained by means of synchronization with the cardiac cycle. In some cases pericardial zones and fragments of coronary arteries were seen. MR-tomography permitted imaging of the heart in a desired phase of the cardiac cycle. This method was shown to be highly informative, providing quality images of the cardiac chambers and walls in different planes, permitting their quantitative and qualitative assessment. Further improvement of the method and programs for it will permit raising its diagnostic potentialities in studies on the heart.
