Myocardial fibrosis, progressive over-accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components in cardiac muscle, defined as a key component of heart failure and since then various studies showed a strong connection between fibrosis and progression of heart failure. The impaired left ventricular diastolic and systolic functions that are originated by fibrosis are used to predict poor clinical outcome in dilated cardiomyopathy. Even though endomyocardial biopsy is still considered as a gold standard, various noninvasive imaging techniques have been used to detect presence, location and extend of myocardial fibrosis. Cardiac magnetic resonance emerged as a crucial noninvasive imagining technique because of its high accuracy and high fidelity in detection of fibrosis. The noninvasive assessment of fibrosis is advantageous in early prediction of possible adverse outcomes and creates an opportunity to utilize new therapeutic approaches that target fibrosis in heart failure.
