The author presents the different imaging modalities that are now available for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic pancreatitis. These methods are indispensable although they do not preclude clinical examination and laboratory studies. The classical examinations such as plain abdominal film, upper GI studies and barium enema, cholangiography and arteriography are still of interest, especially in the diagnosis of complications and preoperative cartography. ERCP is still the only means of visualizing the many ducts, and often serves to differentiate pancreatitis from certain neoplastic lesions. CT is now the most effective method, even though a negative scan does not exclude the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Sonography maintains its usefulness in initial screening as well as in follow-up evaluation. Magnetic resonance imaging does not offer an advantage over CT, but future prospects are encouraging. Percutaneous diagnostic or therapeutic procedures under radiological guidance now belong to the current medical arsenal. Under fluoroscopic, sonographic or CT control, percutaneous drainage is often offered as an alternative or a complement to surgery.
