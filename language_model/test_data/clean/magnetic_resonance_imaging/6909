A 45-year-old man presented with progressive deterioration of vision. Visual acuity test revealed no light perception in both eyes. The fundoscopic examination demonstrated pale optic discs, consistent with secondary optic atrophy. Preoperative neuroimaging studies revealed a well-defined contrast-enhancing mass, 3 cm in diameter, at the left parietal region. Its radiologic appearances simulated those of cerebral metastases. A totally removed lesion was verified pathologically as an anaplastic clear cell ependymoma, which is rare in this location. A brief review of clinical features and neuroimaging of supratentorial lobar ependymoma is also included.
