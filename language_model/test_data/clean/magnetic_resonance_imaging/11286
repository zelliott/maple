June 2004: Over the past year, this man in late-60s had complained about progressive weakness of concentration and memory disturbances, associated with word finding difficulties. MRI examination revealed an extra-axial, parasagittal tumor 3 cm in diameter located in the left frontoparietal region. Five years ago, a meningioma in the same region, with radiographic appearance comparable to the present tumor had been totally removed. The histological picture of the current tumor was dominated by sheets of large rounded pleomorphic tumor cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei (rhabdoid cells). Cytoplasmic inclusions were frequent; occasionally,multinucleatedtumorcellswereseen. Mitoticfigures were absent and the MIB was 3%. Meningothelial lobules were scarce, and regions with fibroblastic appearance were absent. There were no psammoma bodies, necrosis or brain invasion. Moderate immunoreactivity for EMA was found. Additionally, strong cytoplasmic immunoreaction for vimentin within the rhabdoid cells was observed. Review of the previous material showed small islets of rhabdoid cells. Rhabdoid meningioma is an uncommon meningioma variant. It has been suggested that rhabdoid meningiomas are highly aggressive tumors (WHO grade III)and that the rhabdoid phenotype represents a marker of malignant transformation in meningiomas. Histologically, rhabdoid meningiomas usually exhibit signs of anaplasia, a high mitotic activity, and a markedly increased MIB-1 labeling index. Extracranial metastases may occur in the course of the disease. However, not all rhabdoid tumors appear to have anaplastic features (as this case illustrates). Another interesting feature of rhabdoid meningiomas is that in a significant number of cases, the rhabdoid cells appear only at the time of recurrence. Alternatively, as seen in this case, the rhabdoid cells may be already present in the primary meningioma, but not as the predominating histological feature.
