Since most cases of urachal cyst are asymptomatic, they are frequently detected after complication by infection. Ruptured urachal cysts are frequently detected after complication by severe infections such as sepsis. We report on a 31-year-old man who was diagnosed preoperatively as having an infected urachal cyst and the decision was made to follow the patient because primary excision was scheduled to be performed a few days later. Symptoms were transiently relieved, but the cyst ruptured during medical palliation. We treated this case with a two-stage surgical procedure.
