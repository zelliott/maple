Spontaneous regression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a rare phenomenon. We report a case of complete disappearance of intrahepatic, peritoneal and splenic metastases in HCC after hepatectomy using treatment with tegafur and uracil (UFT). The effect of UFT alone was not likely to have caused the disappearance of this tumour because HCC recurrence advance markedly within 5 months of surgery despite oral administration of UFT. This case demonstrates a unique postoperative clinical course that suggests spontaneous regression of HCC. This is the first case of complete disappearance of unresectable HCC with peritoneal seeding and splenic metastasis.
