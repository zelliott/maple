A 3D projection reconstruction (3DPR) method was used to obtain in vivo 11B images in a large canine brain tumor model and in a human infused with borocaptate sodium (BSH). Studies were performed in dogs with and without gliosarcomas implanted and grown to a size of 2-3 cm. The 3DPR method demonstrates a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that allows qualitative kinetic studies of the boron compound in normal and tumor tissue of the head. The measurements indicate initial uptake of the BSH compound in tumor to be less than that in muscle with no uptake in normal brain tissue. Moreover, uptake of BSH in tissue was found to lag the boron concentration in blood with delays that depend on tissue type. In addition, the first human boron images were obtained on a patient who underwent surgical resection and volumetric debulking of a large (7 cm) glioblastoma multiforme. BSH was readily taken up in residual tumor tissue, while diffusion into the resection volume was slower.
