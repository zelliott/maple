To add a further contribution to the literature supporting the relationship between previous head trauma and development of glioma.

We report on four patients who developed brain gliomas in the scar of an old brain injury.

All cases fulfilled the widely established criteria for brain tumors of traumatic origin. In all of our cases there was radiological evidence of absence of tumor at the time of the injury.

We believe that in specific cases it is reasonable to acknowledge an etiological association between a severe head trauma and the development of a glioma. This assumption is further sustained if there is radiological and surgical documentation of the absence of neoplasia at the moment of the trauma.
