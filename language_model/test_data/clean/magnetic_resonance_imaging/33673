Two patients affected by severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) were investigated by MRI and image-guided 31P MRS. In one case, 1H MRS was additionally performed. In both cases the diagnosis of AD was confirmed, post mortem, by the pathologist. The spectral parameters of the 31P MR spectra were estimated by fitting the 31P MR signals in the time domain. Our 31P MRS results suggest that it is possible to detect the membrane catabolism, as indexed with the level of PDE resonances visible in in vivo 31P MRS, at least in severe AD cases. The 1H spectrum from AD brain showed a marked decrease of NAA signal respect to choline.
