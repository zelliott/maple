Alpha fetoprotein (AFP)-producing gastric cancer is relatively rare and meningitis carcinomatosa is similarly a rare manifestation among the neoplastic diseases. There have been no previous reports of meningitis carcinomatosa originating from AFP-producing gastric cancer. A 68-year-old man with AFP-producing gastric cancer was treated with cisplatin and doxifluridine because of multiple liver metastases. Although the liver lesion was reduced to 30% of pretreatment size after 6 courses of chemotherapy, meningitis carcinomatosa subsequently occurred. Immunostaining of AFP and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were useful in the diagnosis of meningitis caused by AFP producing cancer cells.
