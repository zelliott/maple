Recently, there has been considerable interest in the application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the management of breast cancer. In women with a genetic predisposition for breast cancer, MRI screening is more sensitive than mammography screening. However, it is not known if the greater sensitivity of MRI screening has any impact on breast cancer mortality. Some investigators also have suggested that in women with primary breast cancer, MRI might be useful in determining suitability for breast-conserving surgery. However, the application of MRI in this manner may increase mastectomy rates without necessarily improving outcomes. Clearly, additional studies are needed to determine the optimal role of MRI in the management of breast cancer. In the meantime, patients should be informed of its potential for benefit and harm.
