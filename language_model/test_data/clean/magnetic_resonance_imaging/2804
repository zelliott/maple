Analysis of roentgenograms by location, pattern of destruction, classification of tumor matrix and periosteal new bone formation, together with clinical data, preserves valuable information for discrimination of neoplasms in the foot. Furthermore, specific information on tumor histology and tumor extension in the bone marrow and soft tissues can be obtained by CT and MRI. Preoperative staging, guided biopsy of tumor tissue, monitoring of chemotherapeutic response and postoperative observation are further indications for MRT and other modern imaging modalities.
