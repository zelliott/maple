A 50-year-old male with the complaints of lumbago and voiding disturbance was diagnosed to have malignant mesothelioma. Serum CA-125 was found to be elevated. The tumor was stained positive immunohistochemically only for CA-125 and epithelial membrane antigen. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvic demonstrated a large mass extending from the right external obturator muscle to the perineum. He was treated by two courses of methotrexate given intra-arterially (2,000 mg) followed by external beam irradiation at a total dose of 60 Gy. Disease progression was not apparent 15 months after treatment.
