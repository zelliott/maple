Pallidal hyperintensity at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlates to blood manganese (Mn) levels and parkinsonian signs in patients with cirrhosis. Similarly, metabolite changes in the basal ganglia (BG) at proton spectroscopy are related to these neurological signs. The evolution of these abnormalities after liver transplantation (OLT) is incompletely described. We evaluated 14 unselected consecutive patients with cirrhosis (minimal hepatic encephalopathy [HE] n=8, no HE n=6) before and 4 months after successful OLT for the evolution of parkinsonism using a validated scale (the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, or UPDRS). Pallidal intensity at MRI, spectroscopic changes in the BG at magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and whole blood manganese concentrations were measured. After OLT in patients with preoperative minimal HE, the UPDRS scores improved, but mild parkinsonism persisted (16.1+/-3.6 to 6.2+/-4.8, P<0.05). Pallidal hyperintensity remained abnormal in 5/8 of cases, but spectroscopic changes normalized in all patients. Blood Mn remained elevated in 4/6 patients. In patients without HE, UPDRS values remained negligible (2.42+/-1.5 to 2.5+/-1.4). Pallidal hyperintensity normalized in 7/8 patients and spectroscopic changes normalized in all patients. Blood Mn remained elevated in 5/6 patients. Four months after successful OLT, patients with preoperative minimal HE and severe pallidal hyperintensity showed persistent mild parkinsonism. The role of blood manganese determination appears limited in the monitoring of MRI and parkinsonian signs changes after OLT.
