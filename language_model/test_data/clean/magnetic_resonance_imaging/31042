We report the use of vincristine to treat a large steroid resistant haemangioma of the lower face and neck. At the time of treatment the lesion had shown no signs of involution. The haemangioma was not life threatening but extension within the mouth was associated with bleeding and ulceration, which was impairing feeding and speech development. A significant improvement was seen with vincristine treatment.
