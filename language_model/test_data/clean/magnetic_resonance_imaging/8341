Detection and characterization of liver lesions often present a diagnostic challenge to the radiologists. Liver lesions may be classified as hypovascular and hypervascular based on degree of hepatic arterial blood supply. Common hypervascular liver lesions include hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, fibrolamellar carcinoma, and metastases from primary tumors such as islet cell tumor, carcinoid, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and thyroid carcinoma. In this review article, we discuss the spectrum of imaging features of hypervascular liver lesions.
