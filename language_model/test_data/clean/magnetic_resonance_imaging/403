A UK multicenter study compared the performance of contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging with X-Ray Mammography in women at high-risk of breast cancer commencing in 1997. Selection criteria were used to identify women with at least 0.9% annual risk of breast cancer.

Women at high breast cancer risk, with a strong family history and/or high probability of a BRCA1/BRCA2/TP53 mutation, were recruited from 22 centers. Those not known as gene carriers were asked to give a blood sample, which was tested anonymously for mutations. Women ages 35 to 49 years were offered annual screening for 2 to 7 years. Study eligibility at entry was assessed retrospectively by detailed examination of pedigrees and overall eligibility accounting for computer risk assessment and mutation results.

Seventy-eight of 837 (9%) women entered for screening were ineligible using the strict entry criteria. Thirty-nine cancers were detected in 1,869 women-years in study (incidence 21 per 1,000). Including 3,561 further years follow-up, 28 more breast cancers were identified (12 of 1,000). Incidence rates for 759 eligible women were 22 of 1,000 in study and 13 of 1,000 in total follow-up, compared with 9 of 1,000 and 4 of 1,000, respectively, in 78 ineligible women. Breast cancer rates were higher for BRCA2 than BRCA1 after testing anonymized samples in this selected population at 65 of 1,000 in study and 36 of 1,000 in total follow-up for BRCA2 compared with 44 of 1,000 and 27 of 1,000 for BRCA1.

Strict enforcement of study criteria would have minimally improved the power of the study, whereas testing for BRCA1/2 in advance would have substantially increased the detection rates.
