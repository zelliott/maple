Computed tomography-guided high-level percutaneous cordotomy has been used unilaterally or bilaterally for the treatment of localized intractable pain in malignancies.

A 57-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with the complaint of intractable pain involving the left side of the chest, axillary region, and shoulder. He was operated for small cell lung cancer on the left side in December 2003 and received radiotherapy and chemotherapy. His neurological examination was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the thorax revealed contrast-enhancing lesions on the left side extending to mediastinum and pleura. His pain was relieved completely after the first cordotomy procedure, and he was discharged from the hospital on the second postoperative day. The patient was readmitted to the hospital with the complaint of severe unilateral chest pain like the initial pain on the right side 4 days after cordotomy. The CT-guided bilateral high-level percutaneous cordotomy was performed with a 15-day interval.

The CT-guided bilateral high-level percutaneous cordotomy can be used in the treatment of intractable upper trunk pain in patients with cancer without pulmonary dysfunction.
