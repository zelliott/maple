MR performed with thin, contiguous sections has replaced CT for the study of the cerebellopontine angle and for diagnosis of acoustic neuromas. In our experience large acoustic neuromas are well seen in all pulse sequences. Tumors with small extracanalicular components are seen in the T1- and spin-density-weighted sequences whereas purely intracanalicular lesions are often visualized only in the T1-weighted images. Small acoustic neuromas producing thickening of the nerve are easily recognizable in narrow internal auditory canals but may be missed in large canals because of partial volume averaging. Since further enhancement of the signal intensity of tumors can be obtained by IV injection of paramagnetic agents, we foresee the use of such agents in the near future in the diagnosis of acoustic neuromas.
