Intracranial tuberculoma is an infectious disorder, occurring with or without tuberculous meningitis. Although intracranial tuberculoma is rare in developed countries, its frequency has increased in recent years in association with aging and immunocompromised hosts. Because of the low sensitivity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures or of DNA detection from cerebrospinal fluid, diagnosis of intracranial tuberculoma is often difficult. Conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the tuberculoma yields variable results and is indistinct from other inflammatory lesions or brain tumors. We report the case of a 74-year-old woman with progressive neurologic deterioration. MR imaging of the brain showed multiple ring-like enhancing lesions in the supra- and infra-tentorial regions, mimicking multiple metastatic brain tumors. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the brain showed homogeneous high signals in each lesion. A cavity in the lung suggested systemic involvement of tuberculosis. Despite extensive examination, tuberculosis could not be detected. Nevertheless, anti-tuberculosis treatment was administered. The patient's neurologic condition initially deteriorated for 4 weeks, then gradually improved. MRI showed marked improvement of the lesions after anti-tuberculosis treatment. Whereas conventional MRI is not specific in such cases, DWI might be useful for early assessment of intracranial tuberculosis.
