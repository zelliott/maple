Giant atypical intraventricular meningioma is very rare in childhood. Atypical meningiomas are characterised by an increased mitotic ratio and MIB-1 expression, and demonstrate more aggressive tumour behaviour compared with typical meningiomas.

We present the case of an 11-year-old girl who presented to the eye clinic complaining of reduced vision, and was diagnosed with a giant atypical intraventricular meningioma.

Five years after surgical resection, there has been no recurrence of the tumour. Goldmann visual fields show a left incongruous homonymous hemianopia.

This case highlights the importance of ophthalmic examination in diagnosing brain tumours in children. Such a large tumour located in the lateral ventricle may cause obstructive hydrocephalus, compression of brain tissue, seizures and loss of vision, and is potentially fatal.
