Here we report a case of primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma with cortical laminar hemorrhage. The present case showed an acute onset of focal neurologic signs and bilateral cortical lesions surrounded by peripheral white matter edema on magnetic resonance imaging. A part of the left frontal cortical lesion was hyperintense on T1-weighted images and hypointense on T2-weighted and T2-weighted gradient-echo images, suggesting subacute laminar hemorrhage. The patient was initially diagnosed with multiple hemorrhagic infarctions, but a biopsy specimen revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with hemosiderin deposits. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that the tumor cell cytoplasm and membrane stained positively for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody. The present case reconfirms the danger of making a specific lymphoma diagnosis based on magnetic resonance imaging findings alone and that histopathologic examination following brain biopsy is necessary for a correct diagnosis. Vascular endothelial growth factor expression might be associated with the intratumoral hemorrhage.
