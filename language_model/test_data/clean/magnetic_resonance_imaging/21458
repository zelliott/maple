To identify any correlation between the distribution of occult bone lesions and meniscoligamentous injuries, magnetic resonance images of 333 patients with traumatic knee joint disease were reviewed. Bone lesions of the knee were commonly associated with medial meniscal injuries and/or anterior cruciate ligament injuries. While knees with bone lesions showed a higher incidence (P < 0.05) of anterior cruciate ligament injury than knees without bone lesions, the presence of a lateral femoral condylar lesion resulted in a significantly higher incidence of anterior cruciate ligament injuries (P < 0.01). However, no significant positive correlation was found between other occult bone lesions and meniscoligamentous injuries.
