Using a new method based upon the measurement of four angles, we analyzed the corpus callosum of 23 adult male dyslexics and 25 age-matched controls on MRI sagittal scans. Two out of the four angles measured showed significant differences between the groups that are consistent with previous findings concerning the size of the corpus callosum in dyslexics. In particular, posterior regions are concerned, displaying a lowered corpus callosum in dyslexics. These findings are discussed in relation to cortical parietal asymmetries and possible hormonal events, referring to the testosterone hypothesis, that could occur in utero or in the perinatal period in the dyslexic population.
