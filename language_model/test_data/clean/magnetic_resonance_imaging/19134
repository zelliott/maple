A 79-year-old man complained of anorexia and weight loss. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a solitary mass in the left renal sinus. Left nephrectomy was carried out under a clinical diagnosis of renal pelvic tumor. The pathological diagnosis was plasma cell type of Castleman's disease. The patient suffered from lymph node swelling in the right neck at age 75 and the lymph node was resected. The pathological diagnosis was lymphadenitis but it proved to be plasma cell type of Castleman's disease. The patient also had had a lymphadenectomy in the supraclavicular fossa and in the supraorbital area at age 76. Both had been diagnosed as lymphadenitis pathologically but they proved to be plasma cell type of Castleman's disease. The final diagnosis was multicentric Castleman's disease. We reviewed multicentric Castleman's disease.
