A general anaesthesia service for magnetic resonance scanning is described and figures for scans under general anaesthesia for the past 5 years are presented together with a description of the anaesthesia service related to the environment, the equipment and the techniques employed. The involvement of a representative from the department of anaesthesia is necessary in the design of scanner suites if general anaesthesia services are to be provided, as they will almost certainly need to be. The revenue costs of such a service are also briefly considered.
