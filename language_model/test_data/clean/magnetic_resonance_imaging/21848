Type II decompression sickness (DCS) usually manifests as myelopathy; however, there are no reports of Brown-Sequard syndrome in association with diving accidents. We report a 35-year-old man who developed type II DCS presenting as partial Brown-Sequard syndrome. MRI of the thoracic spine revealed two punctate foci of increased signal intensity in the right T6 spinal cord.
