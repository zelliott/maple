Gelatinous degeneration of the bone marrow is rare, and its pathogenesis is unknown. A 61-year-old man with rectal cancer, who was treated successfully with surgery and chemotherapy 1 year ago, underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT for restaging, which showed a focal hot spot in the left scapula mimicking osseous metastasis. Excision bone biopsy revealed gelatinous degeneration of the bone marrow.
