Hydatid cyst can be found in many organ systems, but is rarely in the heart. Echocardiography is an important tool in diagnosing cardiac involvement of a hydatid cyst. A history of extracardiac hydatid cyst should raise suspicion whether there is cardiac involvement. We report a case of spinal hydatid cyst with left ventricular hydatid cyst, yet without any hepatic or pulmonary involvement.
