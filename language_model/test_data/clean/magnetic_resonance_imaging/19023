The planum temporale (PT) has been of interest because of (1) its consistent left greater than right asymmetry among right-handed and most left-handed normal individuals; and (2) its relation to language, another variable shown to be highly left-lateralized in normal subjects. Individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders have been reported to show abnormal PT asymmetry (either reversed or absent asymmetry). Several studies have been conducted measuring the PT on MRI scans, although the results do not always concur. We review some of these studies and discuss methodological differences between them. Additionally, we propose a method that has proved to be highly reliable for the measurement of both temporal PT and its parietal extension (PT+).
