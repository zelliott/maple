We describe here a case of vulvar epithelioid sarcoma. Epithelioid sarcoma is a malignant appendicular skin tumor that is rarely of vulvar origin. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a solid mass with an ulcer-like lesion and multilobulated contour. To our knowledge, this is the first case of vulvar epithelioid sarcoma described in the MRI literature.
