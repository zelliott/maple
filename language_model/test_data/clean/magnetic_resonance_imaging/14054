We present a patient with a left atrial hemangioma associated with shortness of breath and irregular heart-beats. Imaging modalities used to evaluate this rare tumor demonstrated characteristic features of its vascular nature. After successful surgical excision of the tumor under cardiopulmonary bypass, there were no clinical or echocardiographic evidence of recurrence at 18 months.
