A 22-year-old soldier presented with mild anterior knee pain. Routine knee radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging revealed bony fragments that suggested an osteochondral defect in the medial femoral condyle. Arthroscopy revealed the fragment originated from a posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) avulsion and a well-located intercondylar notch with a connection to the PCL fiber. An initial attempt was made to fix the fragment at the original avulsion site. However, the fragment was deformed, and the avulsion site was incongruent after reduction. The fragment was debrided accordingly, and the defect site was filled with an osteochondral graft from a nonweight-bearing portion of the lateral femoral condyle. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was able to participate in military training without discomfort.
