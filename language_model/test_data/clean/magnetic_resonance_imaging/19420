We report a case of schwannoma of the chorda tympani. This is a very rare benign tumour and only five other cases have been found in the literature. This is the first case to mimic a cholesteatoma presenting as a pearly tumour in the postero-superior segment of the drum with aural discharge and conductive deafness. Diagnosis is usually by biopsy and treatment is surgical with preservation of facial and auditory function. A summary of the other presentations of this tumour together with a review of the histopathology of the disease is presented.
