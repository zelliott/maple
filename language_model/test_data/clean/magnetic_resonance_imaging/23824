The neuroanatomic and pathologic basis of Tourette's syndrome or related disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder remains unknown. Although a substantial body of neuroimaging and other data implicate basal ganglia and some point out specifically the globus pallidus in the etiopathogenesis of these three related disorders, no clear or pathologically significant isolated lesions restricted to this region have yet been demonstrated, with the exception of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

A seventeen-year-old male case of Tourette syndrome with comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, stuttering and gait disturbance, who had negative family history is presented.

The patient has failed to respond to drug treatment and his MRI scan revealed bilateral and symmetrical globus pallidus lesions with specific "tiger's eye" appearance of unknown etiology.

Well-localized lesions in the globus pallidus support growing data suggesting the involvement of this brain region in Tourette syndrome and related disorders.
