Since 1995 it is known that aversive and traumatic experiences in childhood, adolescence or adulthood correlate with measurable changes in the brain. Particularly, hippocampus-atrophies as well as reduction in amygdalae volumes have been investigated and documented. Furthermore, experiences of extreme form of early neglect have been associated with general reduction of brain volumes. Recent research documents neural correlates of dissociation.
