Authors report a case of parathyroid adenoma as lateral palpable cervical mass, with serious hypercalcemia. MRI and ultrasound investigations were performed preoperatively. No other pathological parathyroid gland was found. Surgical treatment did not include the exploration of the four parathyroid glands. Long term follow-up is necessary.
