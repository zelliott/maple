Increasing evidence suggests that iron deposition is present in the later stages of MS. In this study we examined abnormal phase values, indicative of increased iron content on SWI-filtered phase images of the SDGM in CIS patients and HC. We also examined the association of abnormal phase with conventional MR imaging outcomes at first clinical onset.

Forty-two patients with CIS (31 female, 11 male) and 65 age and sex-matched HC (41 female, 24 male) were scanned on a 3T scanner. Mean age was 40.1 (SD = 10.4) years in patients with CIS, and 42.8 (SD = 14) years in HC, while mean disease duration was 1.2 years (SD = 1.3) in patients with CIS. MP-APT, NPTV, and normalized volume measurements were derived for all SDGM structures. Parametric and nonparametric group-wise comparisons were performed, and associations were determined with other MR imaging  metrics.

Patients with CIS had significantly increased MP-APT (P = .029) and MP-APT volume (P = .045) in the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus compared with HC. Furthermore, the putamen (P = .004), caudate (P = .035), and total SDGM (P = .048) displayed significant increases in MP-APT volume, while MP-APT was also significantly increased in the putamen (P = .029). No global or regional volumetric MR imaging differences were found between the study groups. Significant correlations were observed between increased MP-APT volumes of total SDGM, caudate, thalamus, hippocampus, and substantia nigra with white matter atrophy and increased T2 lesion volume (P <  .05).

Patients with CIS showed significantly increased content and volume of iron, as determined by abnormal SWI-phase measurement, in the various SDGM structures, suggesting that iron deposition may precede structure-specific  atrophy.
