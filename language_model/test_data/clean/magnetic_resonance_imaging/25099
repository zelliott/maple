Cryoablation may be beneficial for selected patients with liver tumours. Two freeze-thaw cycles at the same location have been recommended during treatment as this potentiate the effect of ablation in experimental studies. However, single freeze ablations are used by some as double freeze procedures are time-consuming and have been associated with increased risk of complications. Estimation of ice-ball volume is difficult using regularly used monitoring techniques. Magnetic resonance imaging, however, allows excellent and multiplanar visualisation of the frozen region during ablation. We comment on the effect of double freeze cycles in regard to ice-ball volume as estimated from magnetic resonance imaging during percutaneous cryoablation of colorectal liver metastases. The ice-ball volume at the end of the second freeze cycle was median 42% larger than the volume at the end of the first freeze. Double freeze cycles may thus facilitate tumour destruction.
