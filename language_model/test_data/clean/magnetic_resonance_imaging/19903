The collection of fast imaging techniques that use multiple spin-echo (MSE) sequences relies on a precise phase relationship between spin echoes and stimulated echoes that form along the radiofrequency refocusing pulse train. Failure to achieve this condition produces dark banding artifacts that result from destructive interference between signal coherence pathways. Satisfying this condition on the microsecond timescale required is technically challenging for conditions involving strong diffusion-weighted gradients, for arbitrary orientation acquisitions and at large field strengths with high-resolution acquisitions. Two clinically significant MSE sequences, fast spin echo (FSE) and balanced steady-state free precession (b-SSFP), are investigated in this work using a 4-T whole-body scanner. We developed a readout-projection-based prescan technique that ensures coherent signal formation by utilizing banding artifacts to automatically adjust gradient balance. Subsequent image acquisition using the results of this prescan permits the formation of coherent-echo images, which are robust under challenging imaging conditions. The robustness of this approach is demonstrated for FSE and b-SSFP images obtained from the knees of human volunteers. We believe that the use of this prescan calibration technique for the alignment of signal pools in MSE sequences is critical at high fields and will facilitate the implementation of high-quality clinically significant sequences such as FSE and b-SSFP.
