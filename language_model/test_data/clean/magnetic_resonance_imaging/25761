A rare case of pleomorphic adenoma of the nasal septum is reported. A 48-year-old man complaining of nasal obstruction and nasal bleeding was referred to our hospital for treatment of a left nasal tumor. The tumor, including the nasal septum, was resected by the modified Denker operation and lateral rhinotomy. The tumor was firm, parenchymatous, pedunculated, and 24 x 22 x 14 mm in size. Pathological examination revealed pleomorphic adenoma with slight cellular atypism. Immunohistochemical observations suggested that characterization of this tumor might be similar to pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland.
