Hemibody tremor is an uncommon manifestation of stroke. We describe a case investigated by both brain magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose.

Three months after a pure motor stroke, a 65-year-old man developed a right arm and leg tremor. The tremor was of large amplitude, intermittent at rest; its frequency was 5 to 6 Hz. Neither rigidity nor akinesia was detected, and administration of L-dopa was ineffective. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed an ischemic lesion in the left centrum semiovale and a left caudate lacunar infarction. We suspected that the resting unilateral tremor was related to this lacunar lesion. Positron emission tomography demonstrated glucose hypermetabolism in the left sensorimotor cortex.

This case suggests that unilateral tremor may be related to a lacunar stroke in the caudate nucleus and may be accompanied by an increased glucose metabolism in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex.
