MRI has advantages as an imaging modality for drug development through its potential to provide information regarding localized morphological parameters, in addition to metrics of the structural and molecular state of cartilage. These metrics have the potential to provide earlier indications of pathology and may progress more rapidly than radiographic measures. These combined scans of localized morphology and matrix parameters will most likely provide a fuller assessment of cartilage state and will improve the cost and practicality of an overall evaluation of cartilage status by MRI. In the first part of this review, the relevant parameters are presented in terms of the information content they might provide in the drug development process. In the second part, applications of the MRI parameters in preclinical and clinical drug development are presented.
