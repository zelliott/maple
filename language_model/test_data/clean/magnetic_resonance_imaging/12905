Three cases of hemichorea-hemiballismus (HC-HB) associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia were reported. Of them two patients presented as HC-HB and the remaining one as generalized chorea-ballismus (CB). Brain MRI showed characteristic T1-weighted high-intensity lesions in the contralateral or bilateral striatum without edema or mass effect. They all had a prior history of respiratory or urinary infection. Cerebrospinal fluid test in two patients showed an elevation of protein concentration with normal cell and an increased IgG content and elevated IgG index or 24 h IgG intrathecal synthesis rate. These results suggested that inflammation within the central nervous system may participate in the pathogenesis of chorea and ballismus induced by NKH.
