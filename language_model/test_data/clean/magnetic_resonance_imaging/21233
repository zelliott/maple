Toddlers with Chiari malformations can present with common symptoms, such as cough or drooling, which are associated with respiratory illnesses, delaying a correct diagnosis. Presentation does vary with age, and therefore can be different in older children when compared to infants. We present two cases of unusual presentations in toddlers and review the literature with an emphasis on acute presentation of Chiari in different age groups in children.
