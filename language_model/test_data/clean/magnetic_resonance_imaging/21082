Genetic testing and management of the at-risk individual for neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is complicated by the well-documented risk of mosaicism that causes a milder later onset more asymmetrical disease course. Risks of NF2 were derived from genetic testing of over 1000 individuals through the Manchester NF2-testing service. Individuals are at risk of NF2 or have 'potential' NF2 if they have features of the disease that fall short of diagnostic criteria or are the first-degree relative of someone with NF2 or suspected NF2. The present protocol devised for the Nationally Commissioned Group (NCG) NF2 service in England addresses the risks, genetic testing and screening protocol for individuals at risk of NF2. Screening with cranial magnetic resonance imaging is advised until the risk of NF2 falls below a pragmatic threshold of 1%. Multiple case scenarios are shown to illustrate how to use the protocol.
