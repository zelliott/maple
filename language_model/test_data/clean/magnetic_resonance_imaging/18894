The purpose of this study was to determine whether a distinction could be made between benign and malignant urinary obstructions in moderately T(2)-weighted images obtained with the single-shot fast spin-echo technique. Forty-four lesions in 39 patients with urinary obstruction were evaluated with the single-shot fast spin-echo (SSFSE) technique with an effective TE of 90-100 ms and without fat saturation. Benign and malignant lesions were compared for the presence of ureteral wall thickening and a signal intensity relative to the proximal ureteral wall. Statistically significant differences were found between benign and malignant lesions in both morphologic change (P<0.0001) and signal intensity of the lesions at the obstruction position (P<0.0001). The combination of wall thickening and increased signal intensity as a predictor of malignant disease yielded a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 100%. Neither increased signal intensity nor wall thickening as a predictor of benign disease yielded a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 88%. The moderately T(2)-weighted SSFSE technique without fat saturation can accurately distinguish between benign and malignant urinary obstructions.
