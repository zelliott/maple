Maffucci's syndrome is a rare sporadic congenital disorder associated with multiple enchondromas and soft tissue hemangiomas. These bone and soft tissue tumors have the potential of malignant transformation to various histologic types: chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and angiosarcoma. We report a rare case of Maffucci's syndrome with soft tissue angiosarcoma of the leg to illustrate MRI findings with pathologic correlations.
