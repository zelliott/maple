The superior right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) septum and free wall are common locations of origin for outflow tract ventricular tachycardias (VT). We hypothesized that (1) unique ECG morphologies of pace maps from septal and free-wall sites in the superior RVOT could be identified using magnetic electroanatomic mapping for accurate anatomical localization; and (2) this ECG information could help facilitate pace mapping and accurate VT localization.

In 14 patients with structurally normal hearts who were undergoing ablation for outflow tract VT, a detailed magnetic electroanatomic map of RVOT was constructed in sinus rhythm, then pace mapping was performed from anterior, mid, and posterior sites along the septum and free wall of the superior RVOT. Pace maps were analyzed for ECG morphologies in limb leads and transition patterns in precordial leads. Monophasic R waves in inferior leads for septal sites were taller (1.7 +/- 0.4 mV vs 1.1 +/- 0.3 mV; P < 0.01) and narrower (158 +/- 21 msec vs 168 +/- 15 msec; P < 0.01) compared with free-wall sites; lacked "notching" (28.6% vs 95.2%; P < 0.05); and showed early precordial transition (by lead V4; 78.6% vs 4.8%; P < 0.05). A positive R wave in lead I also distinguished posterior from anterior septal and free-wall sites. Based on QRS morphology in limb leads and precordial transition pattern (early vs late), in a retrospective analysis, a blinded reviewer was able to accurately localize the site of origin of clinical arrhythmia (the successful ablation site on the magnetic electroanatomic map) in 25 of 28 patients (90%) with superior RVOT VT.

Pace maps in the superior RVOT region manifest site-dependent ECG morphologies that can help in differentiating free-wall from septal locations and posterior from anterior locations. Despite overlap in QRS amplitude and duration, in the majority of patients a combination of ECG features can serve as a useful template in predicting accurately the site of origin of clinical arrhythmias arising from this region.
