Determining the preoperative functional and aesthetic anatomy has been of critical importance to surgeons planning nasal procedures. Beyond skilled clinical examination, few objective studies exist to aid the surgeon. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents a potentially excellent method for precise anatomic imaging of the nose. Unlike computed tomography (CT) and conventional x-rays, MRI involves no radiation. Similar to CT, however, MRI can provide computer-enhanced three-dimensional and quantitative airway data. Full-head MRI has proven sensitivity in evaluation of tumors of the brain and sinuses and is the imaging modality of choice for many soft-tissue tumors. Due to the relatively high cost of conventional full-head MRI scanning ($600 to $1200 per scan), MRI of the nose utilizing full head scanning technique has been limited. The recent development of small field of view surface coils has enabled higher-resolution nasal scans at a fraction of the scanner time and cost ($200 to $500) of conventional MRI scans. We have developed a protocol utilizing a small field of view coil which results in reproducible high-resolution nasal scans requiring less than 6 minutes of scanner time. This protocol has been used in both the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with traumatic and congenital nasal and septal deformities. Image resolution obtained using the protocol is significantly better than with conventional coils. This technique is excellent for both diagnosing and documenting nasal anatomy and pathology.
