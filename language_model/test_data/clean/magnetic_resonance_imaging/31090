A male (30 years five months) who complained of mandibular prominence and masticatory dysfunction was diagnosed as a mandibular prognathic with acromegaly after cephalometric and endocrine examinations. The level of growth hormone (GH) subsequent to a transsphenoidal hypophysectomy had been controlled by medicines for about five years. Surgical orthodontic correction improved his occlusion and profile, but magnetic resonance imaging detected a recurrent adenoma in the cranial base during the retention period. The recurrence resulted in slight prognathic changes of the patient with a high level of GH. This is a case report of the treatment of an acromegalic patient discussing growth considerations that could influence the orthodontic treatment plan and long-term stability.
