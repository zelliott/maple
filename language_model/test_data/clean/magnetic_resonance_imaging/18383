This investigation is a retrospective study of 12 patients with spinal dysraphism. There were 5 males and 7 females in the cohort. Their ages ranged from 4 to 13 years at the time of their last assessment. Initial presentation included one or more of the following--a blemish on the back in the midline (lump, hairy patch, sinus and/or angioma), abnormal neurological signs and symptoms in one or both legs, and in one case dribbling of urine. Investigations performed included plain X-rays of the spine, CT scans alone or in combination with a myelogram and MR scans. Findings included thickened filum terminale, low lying cord, lipoma, syringomyelia, diastematomyelia, spina bifida occulta and sacral agenesis. The children were followed up for between 2 and 10 years. During the period of observation, none developed new symptoms or signs, and there was no progression of existing neurological deficits. This preliminary report suggests that there is no justification for prophylactic surgery in this group of patients.
