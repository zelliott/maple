The syndrome of heart failure is prevalent and a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) offers a unique method to quantify the extent of left ventricular dysfunction and also characterize the myocardium, particularly according to the presence and distribution of late gadolinium enhancement. The prognostic value of late gadolinium enhancement in various etiologies of heart failure has been demonstrated. Newer techniques that non-invasively assess the extracellular volume may also add to the prognostic value of CMR in heart failure. Management decisions in patients with heart failure can often be complex. CMR can provide useful information when planning cardiac device therapy and the CMR assessment of viability is key when planning revascularization.
