Since the description by Smellie in 1764, in a French midwifery text, that first suggested an obstetric origin for upper limb birth palsy, great strides have been made in both diagnosis and early and late treatment. This report presents an overview of selected aspects of this complex and extensive subject. Early treatment options are reviewed in the context of the present controversies regarding the natural history and the indications for and timing of microsurgical intervention in infants with brachial plexus birth injuries.
