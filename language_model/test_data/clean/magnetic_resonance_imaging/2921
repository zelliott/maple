A case of facial nerve neurilemmoma within the temporal bone is reported. The patient is a 47-year-old female complaining of 10 years' history of left facial palsy. CT and MRI examinations showed an enlarged mass of the tympanic cavity protruding into the petrous bone, mastoid cavity and external auditory meatus. An open biopsy of the tumor at the external auditory meatus revealed neurilemmoma. The tumor was totally removed by a retroauricular approach. Five months after surgery, both the cross nerve graft using the peroneal nerve and the temporal muscle transfer, method modified by Johnson were performed for the functional recovery of facial palsy.
