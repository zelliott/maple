Evaluation of a peak at 3.55 ppm in a long echo time (TE) recognized as glycine (Gly) in the WHO grade II gliomas and central neurocytomas by means of 1H MRS.

Retrospective analysis of 19 patients with histopathologically confirmed WHO grade II glioma and 2 patients with central neurocytoma was conducted. 1H MRS (TE = 135 ms and TE = 144 ms) was performed with 1.5 T and 3.0 T scanners. Gly/Cr, Gly/Cho and Gly/NAA ratios were compared between the analysed groups. Additional analysis of a brain of 61 healthy volunteers was conducted.

Glycine was distinguished in 12 out of 19 (63%) WHO grade II gliomas. Among those 12 WHO grade II gliomas only in 26% of a spectra Gly was recognized. In both central neurocytomas Gly was distinguished and in 43% of the spectra Gly was recognized. The ratio of Gly/Cr in central neurocytomas was higher than in WHO grade II gliomas (mean(CNC) 0.62 ± 0.18 vs. mean(WHO II) 0.37 ± 0.10; p < 0.001) but the ratio of Gly/Cho was lower (mean(CNC) 0.18 ± 0.04 vs. mean(WHO II) 0.24 ± 0.07; p < 0.001). There was no difference between analysed groups in terms of Gly/NAA ratio (mean(CNC) 0.36 ± 0.09 vs. mean(WHO II) 0.36 ± 0.14; p = NS). Only in 0.3% of the spectra of normal brain Gly was distinguished.

Glycine is found in WHO II grade gliomas as well as in central neurocytomas, but only in a part of a tumor volume. It is necessary to perform 1H MRS of the whole tumor volume to confirm/exclude the presence of glycine. Glycine in a normal brain can not be identified by means of conventional 1H MRS performed by means of 1.5 T or 3.0 T scanners.
