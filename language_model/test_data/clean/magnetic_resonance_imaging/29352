Using single slice two-dimensional spectroscopic imaging (SI), nine acute head injury patients and six controls have been successfully scanned. The problems presented by the need for ITU monitoring of these patients during MR scanning was overcome using MR compatible monitoring equipment. In previous studies of head injury which used proton spectroscopy, single voxel localisation procedures have meant that the spatial extent of the spectral data has been limited. With spectral data from a whole axial slice, we have been able to identify NAA abnormalities in regions remote to any T2 visible lesions. This suggests that SI (of NAA in particular) will be useful for the diagnosis of diffuse axonal injury.
