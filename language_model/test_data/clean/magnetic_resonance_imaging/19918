The partial tear of the scapholunate ligament (pre-dynamic stage of SLD) as well as the complete tear (dynamic stage) does not lead to carpal malalignment. However, if the completely ruptured ligament is accompanied by lesions of the extrinsic ligaments, both the scaphoid and the lunate are malaligned already at rest (static stage of SLD). Later, osteoarthritis will develop, beginning in the radioscaphoid compartment, progressing to the midcarpal joint, and ending in a carpal collapse (osteoarthrotic stage of SLD). Dynamic SLD is detectable only in stress views and in cinematography. The high utility of MRI for directly visualizing the injured ligament is emphasized: reparation tissue is focally enhanced at the rupture site by intravenously applied contrast agent; the individual segments of the scapholunate ligament can be visualized in direct MR arthrography, therefore allowing differentiation of partial and complete ligamentous tears.
