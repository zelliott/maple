Neural correlates of reorienting across visual hemifields have been extensively studied, however, those of reorienting within hemifields and if there are any differences remain unclear. Here, we performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging study to identify neural correlates of reorienting within and across hemifields using a variant of the cueing paradigm. Behavioral results showed that reorienting across hemifields showed significant validity effect, but reorienting within hemifields did not. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data revealed dissociable activations in the right posterior parietal region between reorienting within and across hemifields. The present results suggest that reorienting within hemifields differs from the 'classical reorienting' to some extent, whereas reorienting across hemifields does not.
