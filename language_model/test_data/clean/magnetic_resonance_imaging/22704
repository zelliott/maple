An unusual case of an extensive intramedullary lipoma of the cervicodorsal spinal cord with intracranial extension causing compression of spinal cord and brainstem is described.

A 3-year-old child with lack of limb movement since birth, the cause of which had remained obscure, developed opisthotonos and episodes of severe respiratory difficulty with brief periods of apnea. Craniospinal computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were diagnostic of lipoma. Urgent occipitocervical decompression and subtotal removal of the posterior fossa and cervical spinal cord lipoma resulted in lasting resolution of symptoms.

Extensive spinal cord lipomas with intracranial extension can present with alarming spinal cord/medullary compression and respiratory symptoms. Computed tomographic scan and MRI are diagnostic. Total removal is not feasible, or necessary, because subtotal removal and decompression give long-lasting resolution of symptoms.
