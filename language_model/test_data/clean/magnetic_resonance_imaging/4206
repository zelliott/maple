The authors determine the feasibility of dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the diagnosis of groin hernia.

Ten volunteers and 10 patients with clinically evident and surgically proven herniations were evaluated using T1-, and T2-weighted sequences and two dynamic sequences. The visibility of anatomic structures that are crucial for the assessment and the differentiation of inguinofemoral herniations was evaluated.

The inguinal rings could be identified in all subjects. The inferior epigastric vessels could be identified in 85%. In 10 patients, 11 hernias were found at MR imaging, whereas at surgery and physical examination 13 herniations were diagnosed (84.6%). The two hernias that were missed initially could be identified retrospectively on MR imaging. One volunteer showed a small bilateral inguinal hernia on MR imaging that could be confirmed on physical examination.

The anatomic structures that are crucial for the assessment and the differentiation of inguinofemoral herniations can be identified prospectively with MR imaging.
