Our purpose was to describe the morphologic appearance of musculoskeletal lesions in patients with cystic echinococcosis shown by CT and MR imaging.

Patients with musculoskeletal lesions of cystic echinococcosis typically have cystic structures in adjacent soft tissues. These cysts morphologically resemble abscesses, with peripheral uptake of contrast medium and variable signal intensities on T1-weighted MR images. The absence of calcifications or endovesicular daughter cysts does not exclude the diagnosis of cystic echinococcosis.
