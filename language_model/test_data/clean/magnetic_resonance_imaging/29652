Recent progress in the development of noninvasive imaging technologies should allow molecular imaging to play a major role in the field of gene therapy. These tools have recently been validated in gene therapy models for continuous quantitative monitoring of the location(s), magnitude, and time variation of gene delivery and/or expression. This article reviews the use of radionuclide, magnetic resonance, and optical imaging technologies, as they have been used in imaging gene delivery and gene expression for gene therapy applications. The studies published to date lend support that noninvasive imaging tools will help to accelerate preclinical model validation, as well as allow for clinical monitoring of human gene therapy.
