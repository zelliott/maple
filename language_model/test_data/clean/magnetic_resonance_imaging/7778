A 76-year-old man presented with a 4-year history of a progressive parkinsonian syndrome. It started with slowness of gait and mood dysfunction. Symptoms slowly progressed and further included occasional unexplained falls. On examination, he showed a severe parkinsonian syndrome featuring bradykinesia, rigidity (axial &gt; appendicular), and positive pull-test finding. Moreover, there was an upgaze supranuclear palsy and slow saccades on vertical plane. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed that revealed significant basal ganglia lesions and white matter hyperintensities, including periventricular regions and both frontal and temporal subcortical areas, along with moderate widespread atrophy and ventricular enlargement. Here, we reveal the pathological diagnosis and discuss the approach to the clinical data.
