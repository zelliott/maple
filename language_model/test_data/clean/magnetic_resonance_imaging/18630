We describe an 11 year old girl with progressive paraparesis from a spinal tumour. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an intradural, extramedullary mass extending from the C7 level to T1. Neither osteolytic nor osteosclerotic changes were seen in the vertebral bodies. Extraskeletal Ewing's sarcoma was diagnosed histopathologically.
