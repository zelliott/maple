We report here the first described case of utilizing gadolinium-based contrast material as the contrast agent during a catheter intervention treatment for pulmonary artery stenosis. The patient, a male infant with complex heart disease associated with a right isomerism, had a history of severe allergic reaction to iodine-containing contrast agents. A combination of digital subtraction angiography and a gadolinium contrast agent, however, provided us with good-quality images both before and after balloon angioplasty without any associated complications. This method should therefore be considered as an alternative angiographic procedure in children with a high risk of iodine-related allergic complications.
