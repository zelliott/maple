Susac syndrome is a rare disease of unknown pathogenesis. It is caused by a microangiopathy affecting the arterioles of the brain, retina, and cochlea, giving the classic clinical triad of subacute encephalopathy, visual loss secondary to retinal branch occlusions, and sensorineural hearing loss. The features of four cases of this syndrome are presented. MR imaging, retinal fluorescein angiography, and audiography findings enable diagnosis. Early therapy may reduce sequelae and improve recovery.
