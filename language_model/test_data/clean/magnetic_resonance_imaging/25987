A 10-year-old child with neurofibromatosis-1 was evaluated for progressive lumbar scoliosis, back pain, and foot numbness. Magnetic resonance imaging showed several lumbar intraspinal and extraspinal masses consistent with neurofibromas. The mass at L3-L5 compressed the thecal sac and was thought to be the source of the symptoms. On operative exploration, a lumbar epidural arteriovenous malformation was found, which was removed in its entirety. The child's back pain and foot numbness resolved. Epidural arteriovenous malformations in patients with neurofibromatosis-1 are rare and have been reported only in the cervical spine. Our finding of a lumbar epidural arteriovenous malformation in a child with neurofibromatosis-1 demonstrates that vascular anomalies can be present throughout the spine of patients with neurofibromatosis-1 and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any neurofibromatosis-1-related epidural mass.
