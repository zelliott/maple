Reflex seizures are a rare form of epilepsy, the pathogenesis of which is unclear. They have been reported in the setting of non-ketotic hyperglycemia (NKH) and are considered to be neuroendocrine in origin. We report a diabetic patient with movement-induced seizures whose presentation suggests that brain ischemia may be the precipitating event in focal seizures seen in the setting of NKH. We recommend that in such instances a focal lesion such as stroke should be ruled out.
