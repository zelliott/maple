This study described the imaging features of a distinctive pattern of biopsy-proven benign non-traumatic vertebral collapse (VC) that can mimic malignancy. Among 240 patients referred with painful VC over a 10-year period, we retrospectively selected 15 cases of benign VC which simulated malignancy, due to cortical bone destruction on radiographs. The diagnosis of benign origin was documented by percutaneous biopsy and 12-months of follow-up. Radiographs, CT and MR images of the spine were reviewed. Findings suggestive of malignancy included destruction involving the anterolateral cortex, posterior cortex and pedicles of the vertebral body (46%,15% and 15% respectively) at CT, epidural soft-tissue masses on CT (23%) and MR images (21%), and diffuse low signal-intensity (SI) of the vertebral body (50%) and pedicles (79%) on T1-weighted images. Features suggestive of a benign origin included an intravertebral vacuum phenomenon on radiographs and CT (13%), fracture lines within the vertebral body (92%) or pedicles (62%) at CT and presence an intravertebral area of high SI on T2-weighted images (93%). Benign non-traumatic osteolytic VC can simulate malignancy on radiographs. The features, above mentioned on CT and MR suggestive of a benign VC, are useful in interpreting biopsy results of such lesions and avoiding unnecessary repeat biopsy.
