Eighteen cases of cerebral cavernous angiomas are reported, and their histopathological, clinical and radiological features are reviewed. MR complements TC in characterizing cavernomas and in distinguishing them from similar-appearing lesions. However, when such lesions are seen with atypical features, discrimination from hemorrhagic tumors remains problematic. More malignant lesions present, on MRI, a much larger area of abnormality and make themselves obvious in a shorter period. Gadolinium administration may allow a more specific interpretation of small lesions.
