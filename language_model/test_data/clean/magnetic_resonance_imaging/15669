In this paper we report the preparation and characterization of [Gd(dtpa)](2-) intercalated layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanomaterials. [Gd(dtpa)](2-) (gadolinium(III) diethylene triamine pentaacetate) was transferred into LDH by anionic exchange. The intercalation of [Gd(dtpa)](2-) into LDH was confirmed by X-ray diffraction for the new phase with the interlayer spacing of 3.5-4.0 nm and by FTIR for the characteristic vibration peaks of [Gd(dtpa)](2-). The morphology of the nanoparticles was influenced by the extent of [Gd(dtpa)](2-) loading, in which the poly-dispersity quality decreased as the [Gd(dtpa)](2-) loading was increased. Compared with the morphology of the original Mg(2)Al-Cl-LDH nanoparticles (hexagonal plate-like sheets of 50-200 nm), the modified LDH-Gd(dtpa) nanoparticles are bar-like with a width of 30-60 nm and a length of 50-150 nm. LDH-Gd(dtpa) was expected to have an increased water proton magnetic resonance relaxivity due to the intercalation of [Gd(dtpa)](2-) into the LDH interlayer that led to slower molecular anisotropic tumbling compared with free [Gd(dtpa)](2-) in solution. Indeed, LDH-nanoparticle suspension containing approximately 1.6 mM [Gd(dtpa)](2-) exhibits a longitudinal proton relaxivity r(1) of approximately 16 mM(-1) s(-1) and a transverse proton relaxivity r(2) of approximately 50 mM(-1) s(-1) at room temperature and a magnetic field of 190 MHz, which represents an enhancement four times (r(1)) and 12 times (r(2)) that of free [Gd(dtpa)](2-) in solution under the same reaction conditions. We have thus tailored LDH-nanoparticles into a novel contrast agent with strong relaxivity, promising for great potential applications in magnetic resonance imaging.
