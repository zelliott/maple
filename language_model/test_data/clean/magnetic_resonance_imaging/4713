To evaluate the bone SPECT findings of vertebral hemangioma and their relationship to symptoms and MRI findings, the authors reviewed planar and SPECT bone scans and MR images of 15 vertebral hemangioma in 10 patients. All planar bone scan images demonstrated normal findings, except one, SPECT images demonstrated normal findings in 11 vertebral hemangioma less than 3 cm in diameter. Three of four vertebral hemangioma that were 3 cm or larger showed abnormally increased or decreased uptake on SPECT images. There was a disparity between SPECT imaging and MRI.
