The role of magnetoencephalography (MEG) in neurology has been established for basic research, epilepsy, and functional brain mapping. The presurgical localization of functionally important brain areas has evolved as an important application of MEG. Both neurologists and neurosurgeons can use this method for decision-making and planning of nonsurgical or surgical treatment in brain tumors. The integration of functional brain mapping data into neuronavigation systems may help to minimize postoperative morbidity. This is especially important in low-grade gliomas, in which a potential benefit of surgery is only achieved when the tumor has been resected completely, whereas neurological deterioration means a substantial loss of quality of life during the survival time. This report addresses the utility of MEG combined with neuronavigation in the treatment of brain tumors adjacent to eloquent brain areas.
