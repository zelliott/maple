The growth of renal angiomyolipomas in adult tuberous sclerosis patients has not been previously reported. We report one such case of the growth of an angiomyolipoma in a previously documented angiographically normal appearing kidney after the contralateral kidney was removed for angiomyolipoma 15 years earlier.
