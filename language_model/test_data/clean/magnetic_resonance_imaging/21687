The authors report a case of dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica. This is a benign osteochondromatous epiphyseal overgrowth affecting most commonly the inferior limbs. The cartilage cap of the lesion can be demonstrated very accurately by MRI (gradient echo sequence). Early diagnosis and treatment is vital in preventing articular malformation and malfunction.
