MR imaging of the bladder can now be routinely and easily performed with consistent quality. The latest techniques provide high-resolution images of the soft tissue contrast and the ability to perform dynamic contrast imaging and functional pelvic floor studies. MR imaging fits in as a complimentary tool to cystoscopy and to conventional pelvic floor dynamic studies and can provide a unique imaging perspective of the bladder. It is important, however, to remain cognizant of the limitations of its use in tumor detection and discrimination.
