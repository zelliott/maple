Injuries to the tarsometatarsal or Lisfranc joint, though rare, are often undiagnosed or inadequately treated, resulting in poor long-term outcomes. Clinical and radiographic data are needed to recognize and treat these injuries for optimal outcomes. In this article, we review the anatomy, biomechanics, injury mechanisms, clinical presentation, radiographic evaluation, injury classification, treatment, outcome, and complications of Lisfranc joint injuries.
