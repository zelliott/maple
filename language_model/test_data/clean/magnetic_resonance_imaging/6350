Although magnetic resonance imaging has a high sensitivity for cerebral and spinal tumors, demonstration of small lesions can be difficult. In a patient with multiple extra- and intraspinal tumors due to neurofibromatosis generalisata, the use of the MRI contrast agent Gadolinium-DTPA resulted in a better differentiation especially of small lesions. High tumor contrast facilitated a safe localisation of the widespread disease using a fast imaging sequence (FLASH).
