The spatial distribution of cortical neural clusters activated during movement of either hand ('bilateral' population), or only of one hand, was investigated in healthy right-handed volunteers performing a sequential finger opposition task, using echo-planar functional magnetic resonance imaging. 'Bilateral' clusters were found in the mesial premotor, perirolandic and adjacent lateral premotor cortex of the two hemispheres, and in the left superior parietal lobule. In the precentral gyrus, their spatial extent was larger on the left hemisphere. Clusters activated exclusively during contralateral finger movements were equally distributed in the left and right perirolandic cortex. No cluster activated exclusively during ipsilateral finger movements was detected. These findings support a role of the motor/lateral premotor cortex of the dominant hemisphere in bilateral motor control.
