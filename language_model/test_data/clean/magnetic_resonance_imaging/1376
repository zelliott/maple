Second look operations in colorectal cancer after curative resection were undertaken for liver metastasis or local recurrence. In our 247 curative cases, 35 were operated for liver metastasis and 18 for local recurrence. In 35 cases of liver metastasis, 25 had local disease amenable to resection and one had palliative resection. Among 21 pelvic recurrences, 11 had curative re-resection and 2 had palliative resection. The survivors generally experienced relief from various clinical distress, and most of those previously employed could return to work. The actual 3-year survival rate is 51.9% in the group of resected liver metastasis, and 9 of 13 cases resected for local recurrence are alive without evidence of re-recurrence. In conclusion, selected patients with recurrence may recover and resume ordinary living with the second look operation.
