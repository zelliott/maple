The incidence of malignant bone tumor increases every year. Because the application of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for the treatment of bone tumors is still at a nascent stage, it is essential to study the effectiveness of this technique in ideal animal models in order to obtain a beneficial reference for imaging studies. In this study, we established a VX2 malignant bone tumor model and evaluated this model by contrast-enhanced sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The results show that all tumors were enhanced after injection of SonoVue. A contrast-enhanced MRI scan revealed obvious enhancement within the tumors. Histological examination revealed the presence of a large number of tumor cells. The model can serve as an ideal experimental model for the study of HIFU therapy in the treatment of malignant bone tumors and as a reference for imaging studies during follow-ups.
