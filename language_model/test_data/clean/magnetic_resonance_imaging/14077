Standard methods for the evaluation of human optic nerve perfusion provide limited information. In this pilot study, the authors investigated the feasibility of qualitative perfusion imaging, a recently developed neuroradiologic technique, as a method of assessing human intraorbital optic nerve blood flow.

Qualitative perfusion imaging (based on magnetic resonance fast spin-echo sequences) was used to study the optic nerves of 7 healthy volunteers and 5 patients with known optic nerve disease. Data regarding both study subject background and alteration in optic nerve signal intensity were statistically analyzed.

Control group subjects were significantly younger than study group subjects. No significant differences in optic nerve signal patterns were found within the control group. Comparison of patients with optic neuropathy against the normal composite revealed substantial differences in enhancement characteristics.

Qualitative perfusion imaging of the human optic nerve is feasible and may serve as the basis for more advanced neuroradiologic studies of optic nerve blood flow abnormalities.
