The effect of the antiepileptic medication sodium valproate (VPA) on the concentrations of cerebral metabolites was studied longitudinally in ten patients with epilepsy using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Myo-inositol was found to be lower while taking VPA, although no relationship between the change in metabolite concentration, VPA dose or seizure control was observed. MRS findings should be interpreted in the light of administered medications.
