The diagnosis and therapy of pericardial diseases are still a physician's challenge. Advanced CT and MR imaging technologies can display the complete morphology of the heart and the pericardium and of the adjacent thoracic structures with a spatial and contrast resolution below 1 mm. All the macromorphologic determinants of pericardial constriction and their functional sequels may be identified by these remarkable technologies. A careful systematic image analysis defines not only a precise diagnosis but also determines the optimal surgical or conservative therapy for the individual patient and minimizes the risk of perisurgical mortality.
