To present a case of a primary orbital leiomyosarcoma and the corresponding magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance.

Observational case report.

Correlation of MRI with clinicopathologic findings.

A 56-year-old woman presented with a 10-month history of diplopia in left gaze and left exophthalmos. An enhanced MRI of the left orbit revealed an extraconal, peripheral-enhancing mass measuring 2 cm in maximal diameter with displacement of the medial rectus muscle. The mass was excised, and the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma was made by pathologic examination.

Although computed tomography scan and ultrasound have been the imaging modalities used previously to evaluate cases of primary orbital leiomyosarcoma, MRI can provide important additional information regarding tumor characterization that is useful in the diagnosis and treatment of this rare malignancy.
