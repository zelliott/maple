Spontaneous unilateral haemorrhage of the adrenal gland during the third trimester of pregnancy is a rare event. The diagnosis may be suspected on the basis of echographic or MRI explorations. There is no sign of endocrine dysfunction. The pregnancy may be conducted to term when the diagnosis is probable but echographic monitoring shows the absence of further development. Only one analogous observation based on MRI diagnosis was found in the literature.
