We experienced a case of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) complicated with depressed consciousness after its treatment. A 56-year-old woman developed postural headache, and her MRI revealed bilateral chronic subdural hematoma (CSH). After treatment with epidural autolongous blood patch, her headache resolved completely. However, two days after, the patient developed depressed conciousness, and MRI showed brain sagging and downward brain displacement. After management with conservative treatment, including second epidural blood patch and hematoma drainage, the patient became alert and other symptoms resolved gradually. We demonstrated that caution should be taken for the management of SIH, especially in the case associated with CSH.
