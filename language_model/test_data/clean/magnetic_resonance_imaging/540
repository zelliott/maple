Epidermoid cysts are slow growing benign tumors that represent < 1-2% of all intracranial tumors and rarely present as supratentorial, intraparenchymal masses. We present the first report of a supratentorial, hemorrhagic, intraparenchymal epidermoid cyst with its presentation, our operative approach, post-operative course, radiographic features, and a literature review.
