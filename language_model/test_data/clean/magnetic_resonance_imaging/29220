A 36-year-old woman experienced an excruciating right retro-orbital paroxysmal headache after a stroke of the anterior two-thirds of the right hemicord at the C1 level (anterior spinal artery territory) and the dorsal medulla (posterior spinal artery territory). A right vertebral artery dissection was demonstrated. This unusual infarct mimicked a cluster headache attack or paroxysmal hemicrania.
