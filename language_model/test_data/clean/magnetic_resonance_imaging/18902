We report a case of central neurocytoma that manifested tumor recurrence with craniospinal dissemination. Imaging studies before surgery showed a markedly enhanced tumor with small cysts and calcification, which invaded the adjacent brain parenchyma, located in the posterior horn of the right lateral ventricle. Proton MR spectroscopy showed markedly elevated choline and lactate peaks with a strongly diminished N-acetylaspartate peak. Two years after neurosurgical intervention, the tumor showed multiple craniospinal dissemination in the middle cranial fossa and the intradural extramedullary space of the spine.
