The diagnostic value of magnet resonance imaging for the diagnosis of pathological abdominal conditions has been limited sofar because of artefacts due to movement susceptibility. The current indications comprise: liver: differential diagnosis of metastases, cysts and hemangiomas, identification of small metastases, demonstration of malignant vascular invasion, evaluation of hemochromatosis; kidneys: evaluation of transplant rejection, analysis of complex cysts, demonstration of malignant tumoral invasion. The application of magnetic resonance will be greatly extended by the introduction of rapid image sequences and the application of specific contrast media.
