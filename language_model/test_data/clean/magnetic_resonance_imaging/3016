Despite advances in the neuroimaging of the brain, an accurate diagnosis of intrinsic lesion of the brain requires tissue sampling and histological verification. Seventy-one patients with intraparenchymal lesion of the brain underwent CT or MRI-directed stereotactic biopsy at Okayama University Hospital between June, 1987 and March, 1995. There were 32 men and 39 women whose ages ranged between 7 and 78 years (mean 46.1 years). All patients underwent preoperative cerebral angiography, high resolution contrast enhanced CT and MRI. The lesions were located in the hemisphere in 40 cases, the thalamus or basal ganglia in 14, the midline (corpus callosum or ventricle) in 11, the pineal region in 4, the suprasellar in one and multiple sites in one. A Brown-Roberts-Wells (BRW) CT-directed stereotactic system was used for biopsy under CT guidance. For MRI-directed biopsies a prototype modification of the BRW frame was employed. Target localization was performed using either CT or MRI. Usually one or two targets within the lesion were chosen and target coordinates were calculated using the CT or MRI scan soft ware. Positive diagnosis was obtained in 67 cases and the accuracy of the histological diagnosis was 94.4%. There were 53 gliomas, 4 metastasis, 5 germinomas, 3 malignant lymphomas, one pineoblastoma, one infarction and 4 negative biopsies. Bleeding as a complication due to stereotactic intervention occurred in one patient (1.4%). To patients with potentially inoperable lesions or lesions which might be best treated by chemotherapy or irradiation, modern techniques of neurosurgery now offer the option of precise stereotactic biopsy through small twist-drill burr holes as opposed to open biopsy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
