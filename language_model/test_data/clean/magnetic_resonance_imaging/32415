The origin of subretinal fluid in eyes with optic pit remains controversial.

The authors found that silicone oil, implanted into an eye that developed proliferative vitreoretinopathy after surgery for optic pit-related macular detachment, has migrated into the subarachnoid space.

As this case shows, cerebrospinal fluid may migrate into the submacular space in eyes with optic pits.
