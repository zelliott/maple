Atypical patterns of language activation in functional MRI (fMRI) are not unusual, particularly in patients with severe epilepsy. Still, the functional significance of these activations is under debate. We describe a case of a right-handed patient affected by drug-refractory right temporal lobe epilepsy in whom pre-surgical fMRI showed bilateral language activations, greater in the right hemisphere (RH). After surgery, a right subdural hematoma caused epileptic status and severe aphasia. This post-surgical complication of a crossed aphasia confirmed the prior fMRI findings of RH language thus stressing the value of pre-surgical fMRI evaluations, even when surgery is planned in the RH of a right-handed patient.
