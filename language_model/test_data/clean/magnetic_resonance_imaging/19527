A 72-year-old man presented with a mediastinal mass on chest radiograph. Computed tomography and MR imaging showed that the mass consisted of both fatty and small nodular soft tissue components, highly suggestive of an extramedullary hematopoiesis or a myelolipoma. A CT-guided needle biopsy was next performed and confirmed the diagnosis. We discuss the CT and MR imaging appearances es of this tumor and usefulness of a CT-guided needle biopsy to avoid surgery in asymptomatic patients.
