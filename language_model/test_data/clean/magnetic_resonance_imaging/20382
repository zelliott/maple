Mutations of the CASK gene are associated with X-linked mental retardation with microcephaly and disproportionate brain stem and cerebellar hypoplasia in females. The areas of the cerebrum, corpus callosum, pons, midbrain, and cerebellar vermis and hemisphere and a ratio of cerebrum/corpus callosum areas were measured in 5 female patients with CASK mutations, 67 female controls, and 5 patients with pontine hypoplasia. MR imaging in patients with CASK mutations revealed a normal size of the corpus callosum and a low ratio of the cerebrum/corpus callosum with a reduced area of the cerebrum, pons, midbrain, and cerebellar vermis and hemispheres. The 5 patients with pontine hypoplasia showed thinning of the corpus callosum and a high ratio of the cerebrum/corpus callosum, irrespective of the size of the cerebrum. The normal size of the corpus callosum, which gives an impression of callosal thickening at first glance, may be an imaging clue to detect patients with CASK mutations.
