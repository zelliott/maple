Capillary haemangioma is a benign tumour frequently encountered in the skin and other soft tissues. Histologically, these vascular lesions are characterised by nodules of capillary-sized vessels lined by flattened endothelium, each of which is subserved by a feeding vessel. Capillary haemangioma of the central and peripheral nervous system is extremely rare. Less than 20 of these lesions have been described as occurring within the confines of the spinal dura mater, in close relation to the conus medullaris and nerve roots of the cauda equina. The presenting symptoms are similar to those of more common intradural tumours at the conus-cauda region. Magnetic resonance imaging is the imaging modality of choice, and homogeneous enhancement following administration of Gd-DTPA is a useful clue to the diagnosis. Complete resection is the treatment of choice, and during surgery the vascular tumour is usually found encapsulated and sharply bordered from the surrounding parenchyma of the spinal cord and affected nerve roots. In the present account we give an overview of the clinical features, neuroradiological findings, therapeutic options and histopathological differential diagnostic aspects of spinal intradural capillary haemangioma. In general, vascular lesions of this entity are preoperatively misdiagnosed as neoplasms, and a higher level of clinical and radiological suspicion may avoid surgical overtreatment of these benign tumours.
