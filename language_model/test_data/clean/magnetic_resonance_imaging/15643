Evaluate the usefulness of MRI in local staging of Paget disease of the breast.

Clinical, radiological (mammographies, MRI), and histological data were analyzed in six female patients presenting Paget disease of the breast. The criteria for analysis in MRI were the following: morphology of the aureola-nipple plaque (thickening, regularity of the contour) and the type of enhancement after injection of contrast medium (signal intensity/time curve), detection of abnormal enhancing in the mammary gland, and ganglion areas.

None of the patients presented a palpable mass or a suspicious anomaly on mammography. On MRI, the aureola-nipple plaque was morphologically abnormal in four cases, with suspicious enhancement in two cases (two cases of ductal carcinoma in situ) and normal enhancement in two cases (one case of ductal carcinoma in situ). In the two other cases, the aureola-nipple plaque was normal (one case of ductal carcinoma in situ). Distant abnormal enhancement of the aureola-nipple plaque was noted in two cases (one case of ductal carcinoma in situ and one benign lesion).

The MRI aspect of the aureola-nipple plaque in Paget disease shows little concordance with the histological results. MRI can be useful in detecting distant lesions when there is no clinical sign nor a suspicious mammography.
