Technical complications are relatively common after pancreatic transplantation, and most require radiological evaluation. Ultrasonography and computed tomography are helpful in the identification of peripancreatic and intra-abdominal fluid collections. Sterile fluid collections can be effectively treated by percutaneous catheter drainage, whereas most intra-abdominal infections require surgical intervention. Angiography is performed primarily for diagnosis of vascular thrombosis. Recent results suggest that magnetic resonance imaging may be a useful non-invasive method for the detection of pancreatic transplant rejection. Further imaging studies are needed to better define the development of progressive fibrotic atrophy in long-term functioning pancreatic transplants.
