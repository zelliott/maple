Total meniscus resection usually leads to osteoarthritis of the knee joint. Preservation and refixation of the injured menisci are therefore of great clinical importance.

The present study examines 40 meniscal injuries in 37 patients that were arthroscopically treated with Clearfix meniscal screws (Mitek, Norderstedt, Germany) in the period from August 1999 to December 2002. The mean patient age was 27.7 (range 16-62) years. Nine patients were female. A total of 24 patients (27 meniscal tears) also had an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) lesion, and 5 patients had cartilage injuries. Twenty-two patients were treated within the first 2 weeks following the trauma, 10 patients within 8 weeks, and 5 patients after 8 weeks. The lesions were a bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus in 11 cases and a bucket-handle tear of the lateral meniscus in 2 cases. The posterior horn of the medial meniscus was torn in 13 cases, and the pars intermedia in 3 cases. The posterior horn of the lateral meniscus was torn in 8 cases, and the pars intermedia in 3 cases. The mean tear length was 2.9 (+/- 1.5) cm and was fixed with an average of 1.8 (+/- 0.7) screws. In 7 cases, the anterior horn was treated with an additional meniscal suture. A total of 35 patients were examined after an average of 18 (range 7-45) months.

In the event of a moderate outcome, MRI was performed as part of the follow-up investigation. The average Lysholm score was 93 (+/- 7.4), the Tegner activity index was 6.3 (+/- 2.0) before the accident and 5.8 (+/- 2.0) at the follow-up, the Marshall knee score was 47 (+/- 3.8). The VAS pain assessment was 1.6 (+/- 1.3) and the VAS function assessment was 7.9 (+/- 1.6). Of the 7 patients with a moderate result, 2 patients without additional ligament lesions suffered re-ruptures after and 13 months, respectively. The other 5 patients with a moderate result each had multiple accompanying injuries or pre-existing damage to the affected knee joint.

The Clearfix screws achieved a clinical success rate of 82% in isolated meniscal tears in stable knee joints and a clinical success rate of 100% with additional ACL reconstruction. In view of the good clinical results and the simple procedure for use, the implant should be recommended for meniscal refixation.
