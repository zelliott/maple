Spontaneous spinal-epidural hematoma is uncommon and rare during pregnancy. We were presented with a 31-year-old patient who developed back pain with lower extremity paralysis at 36 weeks of gestation. A magnetic resonance imaging scan demonstrated an acute spinal-epidural hematoma and therefore, an emergency cesarean delivery was performed followed by hemilaminectomy with hematoma removal. Anesthesia was initiated with a volatile-based technique which, following delivery of the baby, was changed to target-controlled infusions of propofol and remifentanil. Postoperatively, dopamine was infused to maintain the blood pressure within the high-normal range to optimize spinal cord perfusion. Successful anesthetic and postoperative management is described together with a review of the literature.
