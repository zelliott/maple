A case of congenital bladder rupture with urine ascites and bilateral hydronephrosis secondary to a sacrococcygeal teratoma obstructing the bladder outlet is presented. As no evidence of pulmonary hypoplasia and renal dysplasia was present, with rapid recovery of renal function after decompressive surgery, the infravesical obstruction probably occurred late in the fetal period. The bladder rupture resulting in internal decompression may have constituted an additional protective mechanism for the preservation of renal function.
