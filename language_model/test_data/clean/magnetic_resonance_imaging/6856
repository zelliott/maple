We experienced a case of paraurethral leiomyoma in a 36-year-old woman. She had been complaining of dysuria. She had noticed the presence of a mass in anterior vagina. That mass was about 3 x 3 cm, floating moderately firm with a smooth face sited in a paraurethral region. Magnetic resonance imaging showed medium-signal intensity on T1-weighted images and a homogeneous low signal on T2-weighted images. We diagnosed it as a paraurethral leiomyoma and enucleated it by surgery. At histological examination the tumor resulted in being a leiomyoma. The diagnosis and the treatment of female paraurethral leiomyoma are discussed.
