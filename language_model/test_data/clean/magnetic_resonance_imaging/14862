An artificial patch can be used in open and arthroscopic surgery in a massive rotator cuff tear but there is no evidence of biological attachment between the artificial patch and the cuff or bone tissue. We used an artificial polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) patch for the arthroscopic treatment for a massive rotator cuff tear. One year after surgery, we could undertake second-look arthroscopy to evaluate whether the PTFE patch was attached to cuff tissue and humeral bone with regard to histological features. We found a tight connection between the PTFE patch and bone, and also recognized smooth attachment to cuff tissue without proliferation of inflammatory cells in the synovium. We assessed the outcome of surgery using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scale and range of motion before and after surgery: A score of 24 before surgery improved to 75 after surgery. MRI after surgery showed continuous low intensity from the PTFE patch to cuff and bone. This is the first report to describe the histological findings of PTFE patch reconstruction of massive rotator cuff tear after 1 year: A major biological reaction was not observed in this respect.
