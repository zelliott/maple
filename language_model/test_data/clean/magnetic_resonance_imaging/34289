A 70-year-old man presented with increasing swelling of 2 years' duration, on the dorsal aspect of the forefoot. Imaging studies revealed a heavily calcified surface lesion of bone with early invasion of the underlying second metatarsal. Both imaging findings and the subsequent resection histology were consistent with a parosteal osteosarcoma, which is particularly rare at this site and at this age. The differential diagnosis of a mineralizing surface lesion of bone arising in the foot is discussed.
