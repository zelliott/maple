In a study of 22 patients with 60 coronary artery bypass grafts, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correctly assessed graft patency or occlusion in 90% of cases when compared with selective coronary graft angiography and computed tomography. It is concluded that MRI can detect a normally functioning coronary artery bypass graft and could be used as a non-invasive technique to assess graft patency in patients presenting with post-operative angina.
