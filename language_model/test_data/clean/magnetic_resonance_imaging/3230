Angiographic vasculitis affecting the spine has been rarely described. The use of immunosuppression as a primary treatment and a review of the literature is presented.

Case report.

A 61-year-old female presented with sudden onset back pain and headache. The patient was found to have acute spinal epidural hemorrhage and subsequent work-up demonstrated angiographic spinal vasculitis. Immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide resulted in clinical and radiographic improvement.

Immunomodulating therapy should be considered in the management of select patients with spinal vasculitis which may lead to improved clinical outcome and potentially disease resolution.
