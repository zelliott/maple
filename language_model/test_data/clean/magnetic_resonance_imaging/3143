This case illustrates that space-occupying lesions beneath the heavily collagenated portion of the deltoid can produce a confusing clinical picture mimicking subluxation. This patient's clinical presentation was quite extraordinary in its resemblance to glenohumeral instability. The case also illustrates the importance of imaging studies in confirming questionable diagnoses. Such studies should be read by the surgeon, and any discrepancies from the radiologist's reading should be addressed.
