A 42-year-old female presented with right hemiparesis. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a slightly heterogeneous high density mass over the left frontal convexity with peritumoral edema, with homogeneous enhancement by contrast material. Magnetic resonance imaging showed the left frontal convexity tumor as a heterogeneous low intensity area on the T1-weighted image and a heterogeneous high intensity area on the T2-weighted image, with homogeneous enhancement and dural tail sign after intravenous administration of gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid. After admission, the patient suddenly lost consciousness. CT demonstrated aggressive increase in the bulk of the tumor and large peritumoral hemorrhage. The tumor was totally removed. The histological diagnosis was rhabdomyosarcoma. Combined immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy techniques should be used to differentiate rhabdomyosarcoma from malignant meningioma.
