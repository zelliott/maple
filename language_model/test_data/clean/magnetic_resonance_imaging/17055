Evaluate the efficacy of endoscopic treatment in maxillary inverted papilloma (IP).

Between July 2002 - April 2008, 20 patients affected by maxillary localization of IP were treated in our Clinic. All patients underwent endoscopic treatment consisting of an endoscopic medial maxillectomy (simple or extended), or attachment-site endoscopic tumour surgery.

The cohort was composed of 20 patients (male: 15, female: 5), mean age 58 years, and included 21 endoscopic resections of maxillary IP. Minimum follow-up: 24 months, mean follow-up: 50 months. We registered only 1 case of tumour persistence/recurrence after 15 months, which underwent a second endoscopic treatment. No association with malignant lesions was noted. The efficacy of the endoscopic treatment was 95% (19/20 cases) after primary surgery, and 100% after endoscopic revision.

Our experience demonstrates the efficacy of endoscopic treatment in maxillary IP. Based On its reduced morbidity in comparison to external approaches and its good control of the disease, we consider it our standard treatment for maxillary-originated inverted papilloma.
