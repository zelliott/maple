Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of pituitary adenoma is usually carried out in dynamic studies with bolus contrast material injections, with the result that few strong images are obtained. Dynamic studies using a slowly injected contrast material were carried out in 14 cases of pituitary adenomas. The examinations were performed with a 1.5 Tesla superconducting MR imaging system using the spin-echo technique. Gd-DTPA (0.1 mmol/kg) was slowly injected (within 90 sec) by hand, providing seven to nine dynamic images during 350 sec from the start of injection. The average time to reach the maximum signal intensity was 170.6 sec in adenoma and 156.2 sec in normal gland tissue. The maximum contrast signal intensity ratio of adenoma to normal gland was 0.527 in the fifth image. The contrast of adenoma to normal gland tissue was calculated by the following formula: ASII (adenoma signal intensity index) = (adenoma signal intensity-tissue signal intensity)/tissue signal intensity. The most remarkable contrast between adenoma and normal tissue was obtained from the fourth to eighth images. In other words, we could obtain the strongest contrast at 144.8 sec to 299.6 sec from the start of contrast injection. Our results with slow injection suggest that stronger images can be obtained a longer period after contrast injection.
