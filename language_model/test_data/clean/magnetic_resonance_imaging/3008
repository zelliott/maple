A knowledge of the cervical spine anatomy provides the basis for understanding and interpreting magnetic resonance imaging studies. Because magnetic resonance imaging provides multiplanar images, this article describes anatomic relationships in multiple planes. The anatomic relationships of the spinal nerves and the neural foramina and spinal cord in the central canal are emphasized, and the location of fluid and fat, which have distinctive appearances in magnetic resonance imaging, is noted.
