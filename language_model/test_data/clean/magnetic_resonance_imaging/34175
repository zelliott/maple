A case of fibrous dysplasia of the frontal bone in a 51 year-old male is described. He was admitted to our hospital with a hard, painless growing mass in the left frontal region. A symmetrical protrusion of his forehead has been observed since several years before. Neurological examination and laboratory data revealed no abnormalities. Skull x-rays demonstrated two different lesions. One showed a ground glass appearance in the supraorbital region, and the other showed a radiolucent lesion with marginal sclerosis crossing the left coronal suture CT scan revealed an intradiploic multilocular mass. T1 and T2 MR images showed an abnormal low-intensity mass, and heterogeneous gadolinium-enhancement was noticed in both lesions. Selective external carotid angiography showed tumor stain in the left coronal mass fed by middle meningeal and superficial temporal arteries mimicking intraosseous meningioma. On the other hand, a supraorbital hyperostotic lesion showed no apparent vascularity. An operation was performed on the left coronal lesion to verify the nature of the progressively enlarging mass, which was histologically confirmed to be a fibrous dysplasia rich in numerous vessels. Postoperative course was uneventful. Correlation with clinical activity and enhancement pattern was not known, however, careful observation is required in hypervascular fibrous dysplasia such as was observed in this case.
