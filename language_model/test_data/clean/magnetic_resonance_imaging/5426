A 26-year-old man developed acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) after Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, and was admitted after developing disturbed consciousness. Magnetic resonance images revealed lesions in the midbrain, bilateral internal capsules, left corona radiata, white matter of the left occipital lobe, and thoracic spinal cord. He was diagnosed with subclinical measles infection since no anthema was observed despite the fact that his serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples were positive for measles IgM antibodies. ADEM following mixed infection with measles and M. pneumoniae is rare, and it is not clear whether an additional infection with measles influenced the onset of ADEM after M. pneumoniae infection. Symptoms did not improve with steroid or immunoglobulin treatment, but improvement in symptoms was observed after plasmapheresis.
