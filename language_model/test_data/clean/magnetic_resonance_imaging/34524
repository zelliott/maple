To evaluate pituitary gland size in cases of dural arteriovenous (AV) fistula in the cavernous sinus and to correlate the size with the degree of AV fistula.

Magnetic resonance images in 21 patients with angiographically proved dural AV fistula of the cavernous sinus were retrospectively reviewed. In four patients, findings obtained before and after embolization therapy were compared.

The 21 patients were divided into group 1 (severe AV fistula) and group 2 (moderate or mild AV fistula). The superior contour of the pituitary gland was convex or flat in group 1 and flat or concave in group 2. The mean height of the pituitary gland was 9.4 mm +/- 1.5 (standard deviation) in group 1 and 6.7 mm +/- 1.2 in group 2 (P = .0002). After embolization therapy, pituitary gland height decreased and signal intensity voids improved in the four patients and no AV fistula was observed in three.

In cases of severe dural AV fistula in the cavernous sinus, the pituitary gland is enlarged, which should not be misdiagnosed as pathologic.
