We report an unusual case of cavitary choroidal melanoma. The results of ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and immunohistochemical studies are presented for a 38-year-old woman who developed an amelanotic tumor in the posterior choroid. B-scan ultrasonography disclosed intratumoral cavitations. Systemic and extraocular extension studies were negative. Enucleation was performed and histopathologic examination showed a choroidal melanoma of spindle cell type, with intratumoral cavitations lined by flattened tumor cells.

The majority of previous reports of intraocular cavitary tumors describe cavitary ciliary body tumors. Uveal melanoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of choroidal cavitary lesions. As far as we know, this is the second documented clinicopathologic correlation of a cavitary choroidal melanoma.
