Cerebral white matter lesions are frequently observed on magnetic resonance imaging of elderly, nondemented persons. There is evidence that white matter lesions are involved in the pathophysiology of cognitive decline and dementia. White matter lesions can be divided into those in the periventricular and those in the subcortical region. Pathological and epidemiological studies suggest that atherosclerosis is involved in the pathogenesis of these lesions. Our study reports on the association between atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries and white matter lesions in a population-based study among 1077 elderly subjects. We randomly sampled 1077 subjects aged between 60-90 years from two prospective population-based studies. All subjects underwent ultrasonography of the carotid artery. In addition, 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging was performed; white matter lesions in the subcortical and periventricular regions were rated separately. With increasing number of plaques in the carotid artery the severity of periventricular white matter lesions increased (Ptrend = 0.03), but not the severity of subcortical white matter lesions (Ptrend = 0.19). In addition, an increase in intima media thickness was borderline significantly associated with an increased severity of periventricular white matter lesions (Ptrend = 0.09), but not of subcortical white matter lesions (Ptrend = 0.68). These findings suggest that partly dissimilar pathogenetic mechanisms are involved in the etiology of periventricular and subcortical white matter lesions.
