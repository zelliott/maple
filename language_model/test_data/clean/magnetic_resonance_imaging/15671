Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) depicts in exquisite detail the supporting structures of the posteromedial corner of the knee. This musculoligamentous unit plays a central role as a dynamic stabilizer of the knee joint and the recognition of injury to the posteromedial corner carries important implications in terms of management and prognosis, most particularly in the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee. This article provides a resum√© of the functional anatomy of the posteromedial corner of the knee as seen with MRI and follows with a review of the MRI appearances of injury to the posteromedial corner.
