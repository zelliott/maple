Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men in Europe, North America, and in some African states. Early diagnosis in an asymptomatic stage is possible through the combination of digitorectal examination, PSA serum testing, and systematic biopsy. However, general screening is so far not recommended by the Urologic Societies, because the efficiency is not yet proved. Imaging is also not recommended for first-line screening. Novel functional methods of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and endorectal MRI can improve accuracy of tumor detection to more than 90% and can be used for TRUS- and now also MRI-guided biopsy leading to two- to threefold higher tumor detection rates. There is general agreement that all men over 50 years of age should be informed about the possibilities, benefits, and risks of the available methods for early tumor detection.
