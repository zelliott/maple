The popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) is a frequent disease of especially young patients, often following a muscular exertion. To avoid the complications, the diagnosis must rapidly be done. According to this report of a 12 year old child, we think that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is very accurate to diagnose the abnormalities of the popliteal artery course, the muscular hypertrophies and can relieve of more invasive procedures such as the arteriography associated with known morbidity in young patients.
