To perform true three-dimensional activation experiments in the human brain, dedicated localized echo-volume imaging (L-EVI) methods were developed. Three-dimensional acquisition allows generation of activation maps with minimal vascular enhancement related to inflow effects. The rapid acquisition of the L-EVI (approximately 100 msec) reduces signal instabilities caused by motion, facilitating the detection of the small intensity changes expected with brain activation. Single-shot L-EVI was performed on normal volunteers at 1.5 T, imaging a three-dimensional predefined volume (240 x 45 x 45 mm3) in the superior portion of the brain with a spatial resolution of 3.75 x 5 x 5 mm3. Increased brain coverage was achieved with a multi-volume imaging (three-shot) version, which simultaneously achieved effective suppression of signals from cerebrospinal fluid. In addition, both asymmetric spin-echo (ASE) and spin-echo (SE) versions of the technique were used to detect blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal changes in the motor cortex with a finger-tapping paradigm. Images obtained by the L-EVI sequence were qualitatively comparable to standard multislice two-dimensional echo-planar images. Both ASE and SE functional MRI (fMRI) experiments showed consistent activation in the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex. Furthermore, significant differences in location and magnitude of activation was observed between the two methods, confirming theoretical predictions.
