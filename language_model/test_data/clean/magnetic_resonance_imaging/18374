MR images and three dimensional surface images (3-D images) using N-isopropyl-p-[I-123] iodoamphetamine (I-123 IMP) were obtained in a patient who acknowledged using thinner and amphetamine. While MR images could not find any definite abnormality, 3-D images with I-123 IMP demonstrated multifocal defects. 3-D images with I-123 IMP might be able to detect an early abnormality in brain perfusion in a drug abuser.
