An anatomical study was carried out to determine the extent to which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could delineate inner ear structures. Anatomical preparations of human petrous temporal bone were examined and compared with the results of MRI in 20 healthy subjects to see whether the structures of the inner ear could be visualized. Imaging of the subjects was carried out in a 1.0-T MRI scanner (Siemens Magnetom Impact). Two strongly T2*-weighted sequences were used: a 3D-PSIF sequence and a 3D-CISS sequence. The 3D data sets were postprocessed using a Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) program. Our investigations show that it is possible to obtain accurate visualization of structures with a diameter of under 1 mm. In all 20 subjects it was possible to identify both the endolymphatic duct and the endolymphatic sac.
