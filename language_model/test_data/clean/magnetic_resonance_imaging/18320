Recently experienced were two cases of postnatally diagnosed intracranial teratoma, one a mature teratoma and the other an immature teratoma, both extending into the extracranial structures. In each case, tumor resection was performed in which a barrier was created between the intracranial and extracranial spaces with a temporalis muscle flap. The technical aspect of skull base reconstruction is described, and previously reported cases of intracranial teratoma involving the skull base are reviewed.
