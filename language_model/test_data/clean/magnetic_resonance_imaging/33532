Our purpose was to know more about the symptoms and clinical and radiological outcome of spontaneous dissections of the internal carotid artery in a retrospective study of 68 patients aged 20 to 71 (mean 46).

The diagnosis of dissection was based on angiographic findings. Nine percent of patients had minor symptoms such as a subjective bruit or painful Horner's syndrome, without an ischaemic event. Cerebral ischaemia was present in 90% of cases and occurred within a month of the initial event in all cases but one and was the first symptom in 53% of cases.

Magnetic resonance imaging performed in 21 cases showed haemorrhage in the vessel wall. Resolution of the angiographic appearances occurred in 65% of cases after 3 months. In cases of stroke, more than half of the patients had poor functional outcome, factors conveying poor prognosis were massive stroke, embolic mechanism and lack of local recanalization.

Spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery is not a rare cause of cerebral ischaemia and can present with minor symptoms without an ischaemic event. Doppler ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imagery are helpful in diagnosis and follow-up.
