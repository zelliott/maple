In this era of modern neurosurgery, we are able to provide adequate amelioration of disabling symptoms for the small subset of patients who have conditions that may make them unacceptable candidates for invasive stereotactic neurosurgical intervention. Gamma Knife radiosurgical thalamotomy is an effective and useful alternative to invasive radiofrequency techniques for patients at high surgical risk. The mechanical accuracy of the gamma unit combined with the anatomical accuracy of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging makes radiosurgical lesioning safe and precise.
