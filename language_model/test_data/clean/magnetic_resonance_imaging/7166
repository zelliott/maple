There has been a renewed interest in diseases of the temporomandibular joint over recent years due to a better understanding of the pathophysiology improvement in surgical techniques and, most importantly, the development of multidisciplinary teams. The indication for surgery is still essentially clinical, although medical imaging is increasingly informative. Arthrotomography provides the most reliable information. However, continuing progress in magnetic resonance imaging will probably provide surgeons with the best indications in the future. In this article, the authors clearly distinguish between intra-articular disk and muscular diseases. The operative indications are discussed in relation to the clinical signs and the condition of the joint.
