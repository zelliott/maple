We studied a 53 year old right-handed patient who presented isolated myoclonus of right facial muscles induced exclusively by language. Twitching significantly hindered speaking and reading performance. MRI and CT-scan revealed no brain lesion. Conventional EEG showed a few spike-waves predominantly in the left hemisphere. Spike-waves increased during drowsiness. An EEG-EMG polygraphic study was performed during stimulation tests which included linguistic tasks and non-verbal/non-linguistic tests. Myoclonus was triggered by speaking and writing but not by non-linguistic tasks. The severity of myoclonus was dependent on the complexity of the language task. Back-averaging of right facial EMG bursts failed to show a reliable EEG-EMG correlation. However, the facial reflex myoclonus might have originated from the left rolandicopercular cortex, as it was triggered by complex language activities. Findings in this case are compared with those reported for other forms of reflex seizure and myoclonus.
