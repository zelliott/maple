The authors used serial gradient-echo MRIs to detect new small hemorrhages in patients with previous lobar hemorrhage. Of 24 lobar hemorrhage patients (17 diagnosed with probable and 7 with possible amyloid angiopathy) who prospectively underwent repeat MRI 1.5 years after initial study, 9 (38%) demonstrated additional hemorrhages at follow-up. Interrater agreement was high. New hemorrhages were more frequent in patients with probable amyloid angiopathy (8 of 17, 47%) with more hemorrhages at baseline (p < 0.01). These results suggest a role for gradient-echo MRI in assessing disease progression in amyloid angiopathy.
