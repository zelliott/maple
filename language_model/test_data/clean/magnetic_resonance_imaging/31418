To determine if anthropometric factors obtainable on routine examination can be used to estimate premorbid knee total subchondral bone area (tAB), cartilage surface area (AC), cartilage thickness (ThC), and cartilage volume (VC).

Young individuals (21-39 years old) without history of knee joint pain, injury or disease were studied. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right knee was used to determine tAB, AC, ThC and VC for knee cartilage. Multilinear regression and curve fitting by variance minimization were used to model the data.

VC and AC closely depended on tAB(1.5) in both men and women. This relationship subsumed all dependency on sex, height, weight and body mass index. In females, VC depended on height cubed and tAB on height squared. The relationship was much weaker in males. ThC was poorly related to tAB and VC. Confidence limits for VC standardized to tAB(1.5) were narrower than standardization to tAB or height.

The absence of a tight relationship of VC and tAB with height in males suggests that the factors stimulating bone and cartilage growth may be different between sexes. The high correlation between tAB and VC across both sexes suggests, however, that (opposite to measures from routine clinical examination) tAB(1.5) can provide individual reference values for VC, against which changes with age and disease can be estimated with high confidence.
