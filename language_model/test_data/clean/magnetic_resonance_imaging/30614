A 43-year-old female with a huge myoma uteri was scheduled for a simple total hysterectomy. However, there was massive penetration of the tumor into the retroperitoneum, and her first operation failed because we had no advance information on its posterior aspect. Angiography was done to obtain this information. She rested on bed until the day after the first operation and angiography. MRI, performed again due to early growing tumor, revealed deep vein thrombi in the left iliac vein to the left femoral vein which the last MRI had not shown. Therefore, just before the second operation a temporary vena-cava filter was inserted, to prevent acute pulmonary thromboembolism. The operation was performed without incident. The filter captured some thrombi, and these were resolved by urokinase postoperatively. No symptomatic pulmonary thromboembolism was recognized during the perioperative period. The postoperative course was uneventful.
