Posterior instability is becoming an increasingly recognized problem with today's contact athletes. Although not as common as anterior Bankart lesions, posterior capsulolabral pathology can lead to significant instability and pain. Open posterior repair is difficult and results in the literature have been inconsistent. However, there is recent evidence to support arthroscopic repair with capsular placation as a promising solution. Our technique for arthroscopic posterior capsulolabral repair will be reviewed with emphasis on the key aspects for a successful outcome.
