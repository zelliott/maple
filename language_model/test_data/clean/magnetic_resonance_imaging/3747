Aplasia of the major salivary glands is a rare condition due to an alteration in the development of the ectodermal tissue of the oral cavity often related to other craniofacial abnormalities or alteration of structures deriving from the first or second archial branch, in particular the lacrimal glands; it can be total or partial and determine clinical states ranging from an asymptomatic condition to a severe xerostomia. The accessory parotid tissue is similar to normal parotid tissue, completely independent from the main gland and susceptible to the same pathological disorders. We describe a very unusual case of an inflammatory disorder of accessory parotid tissue in a 44-year-old male patient with concomitant, and previously unknown, aplasia of the main ipsilateral parotid gland. We also discuss the role of imaging and conservative therapeutic modalities such as botulinum toxin therapy and, in the future, minimally invasive endoscopic-assisted resection in the management of such salivary disorder.
