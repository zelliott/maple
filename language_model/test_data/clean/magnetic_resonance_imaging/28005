The Authors report their limited series of neoplasms of the adrenal cortex, and underline the decisive role of the modern diagnostics based on imaging techniques (US--TC--NMR). These, in fact, often allow a good definition also in the non-functioning adrenal masses incidentally discovered (incidentalomas). The authors emphasize the high quality of such diagnostic methods offering a good reliability in discriminating the nature of the adrenal mass. These undeniable diagnostic advantages have a positive impact on the surgical strategy, allowing together with a careful morphological study of the lesion, to program in detail possible demolitive operations. The authors finally underline the importance of the surgical access: they are persuaded the best is the bilateral under-rib incision. This surgical approach assures a complete exploration of the abdominal and pelvic cavity; moreover, it allows to face every complication.
