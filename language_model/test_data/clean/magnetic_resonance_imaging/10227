This communication presents the results of T2-weighted nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of a water saturated porous volcanic rock using a fast single point imaging technique (turboSPI). Imaging porous materials with heterogeneously distributed mineral products, and air voids, using conventional imaging methods, which introduce T2-weighting by increasing the time between the excitation and refocusing pulses, often results in high diffusive signal losses and susceptibility distortion. T2-weighted images acquired of a water saturated porous rock using turboSPI with an effective echo time of 8.1 ms (actual inter-echo time of 0.9 ms) exhibit significantly decreased diffusive attenuation, compared to analogous images obtained with an inter-echo time of 8.1 ms.
