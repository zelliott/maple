Precise brain regions are activated when a subject gives a judgment on himself. Those are the medial parietal cortex, essentially related to episodic memory processing, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, recruited for evaluating the personal valence of an information. These regions are not activated in Alzheimer's disease. The decrease of awareness for own deficits in a patient with Alzheimer's disease would depend on a reduction of episodic memory capacities and a worsening of judgment for self significance.
