On-resonant radio frequency (RF) sequences composed of a train of short rectangular pulses of the same kind were optimized in order to obtain selective saturation of protons with short transverse relaxation times for magnetization transfer purposes. It is demonstrated that the sequences regarded allow a good adaptation to different requirements for magnetization transfer examinations on whole-body imagers. The sequences presented here provide relatively strong saturation of protons with very short transverse relaxation times T2 approximately less than 50 microseconds, whereas signals from protons with long T2 to be recorded are hardly influenced in a broad frequency range. The sequences are especially advantageous for applications in pulse files with limited numbers of support points.
