A dysfunction of the orexin (hypocretin) system in the hypothalamus has recently been linked to the pathogenesis of narcolepsy. The authors used in vivo proton MR spectroscopy to assess the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) content in the hypothalamus of narcoleptic patients. Hypothalamic NAA/creatine-phosphocreatine was reduced in narcoleptic patients compared with control subjects (p < 0.01). Hypothalamic neuronal loss/damage is a central pathogenetic feature in narcolepsy.
