We report a case of atreric cephalocele. A 13-year-old boy who was developmentally normal was admitted to our hospital, complaining of scalp mass located at the midparietal region. He was noticed to have had it since his birth. Physical examination revealed 2.5 x 2.5cm, round, skin-covered midline subscalp mass with a hairless top. Bone 3D-CT showed bone defect at the base of the mass. MRI and MR venography showed the embryonic positioning of the straight sinus. He was treated with surgical excision of the mass, and fibrous tract extending intracranially at the base of the lesion was identified. Pathologic examination showed it to be meningocele.
