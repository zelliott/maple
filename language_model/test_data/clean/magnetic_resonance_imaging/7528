Hand osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disease frequently affecting middle-aged women. Prevalence estimates for OA vary widely depending on the age and sex of the population studied, the assessment tools used, and the specific joint sites analyzed OA is characterized by the degradation of articular cartilage, subchondral bone changes and osteophyte formation at the joint margins leading to joint failure. The pathogenesis of the disease and its evolution are multifactorial involving biomechanical, metabolic, hormonal, and genetic factors. Moreover, the role of inflammation has recently been advanced as pivotal in OA onset and progression. In particular, an uncommon variant of hand OA, erosive hand OA, is characterized by inflammatory and degenerative interphalangeal proximal and distal joints. The diagnosis of different types of hand OA is centered on clinical and laboratory investigations which can distinguish the peculiar aspects of these forms. Joint and bone assessments in hand OA are widely studied but there is no agreement with regard to established parameters to make a definitive diagnosis. This report focuses on the laboratory and clinimetric assessments that can be used to distinguish hand OA subtypes and addresses the debatable association with low bone mineral density in osteoporosis.
