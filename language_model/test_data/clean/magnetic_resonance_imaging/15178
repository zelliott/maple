We report a 28-year-old man who suffered from episodic muscle pain, stiffness and weakness. His serum creatine kinase (CK) levels were found to be elevated. He presented with slight proximal muscle weakness and calf hypertrophy. Muscle biopsy revealed fiber size variation and tubular aggregates (TA). Muscle magnetic resonance imaging showed areas of edema. Other muscle pathologies known to be associated with TAs or myoedema were ruled out.
