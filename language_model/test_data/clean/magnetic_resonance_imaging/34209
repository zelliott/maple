We present a patient with translocation (snapping) of a portion of the triceps over the lateral epicondyle with elbow flexion. This condition is in many ways analogous to its counterpart at the medial aspect of the elbow, snapping of the medial head of the triceps, a clinical entity that is being increasingly recognized.
