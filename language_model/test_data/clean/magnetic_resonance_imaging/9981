Leiomyosarcomas of adrenal origin occur infrequently, always present as huge abdominal masses, and are associated with poor prognoses when other organs are invaded. Radiologic images of small adrenal leiomyosarcomas have not been published. This report presents magnetic resonance images of a 3-cm left adrenal leiomyosarcoma from a 49-year-old male. Ten months after adrenalectomy, the patient was alive without tumor recurrence.
