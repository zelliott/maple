To analyze the clinical outcome of 934 primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with conventional external beam radiotherapy alone.

34 patients were treated from Jan. 1, 1999 to Dec. 31, 1999. The radiation fields were delineated according to the CT/MRI imaging findings on disease extent. Two lateral opposing isocentric portals with customized blockings were used for the nasopharynx and upper neck. The dose delivered to tumor in the nasopharynx was 68-70 Gy/2 Gy fraction/7 weeks. The doses delivered to the neck was 60-70 Gy/6-7 weeks for patients with positive lymph nodes and 50 Gy/5 weeks for the patients with negative lymph node.

The 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-year overall survival rate (OS) was 89.5%, 81.9%, 78.1% and 75.7%, and metastasis-free survival rate (MFS) was 84.0%, 77.2%, 74.4% and 72.0%, respectively. The 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-year disease-free survival rate (DFS) was 80.8%, 73.1%, 68.5% and 65.1%, and the relapse-free survival rate (RFS) was 95.5%, 92.7%, 90.3% and 87.3%, respectively. The overall failure rate was 30.9% (289/934). At the end of the radiotherapeutic course, the percentage of residual disease was 14.6%. The 4-year loco-regional recurrence and distant metastasis rates after radiotherapy were 7.2% and 9.2% with a median time of 19.3 months and 12.8 months.

It may be helpful to improve radiotherapy curative effect when the target is individually designed through improving irradiation technique according to CT/MRI findings and by shortening the overall course time, enhancing irradiation dose and strictly implementing QA/QC measures.
