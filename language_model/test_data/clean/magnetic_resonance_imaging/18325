A 74-year-old male with the chief complaint of painless enlargement of a mass in the scrotum was diagnosed as having a giant epidermoid cyst on July 8, 1991. He had no past history of injury or pain of the scrotum. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the scrotum demonstrated a well-circumscribed homogeneous mass, and was distinguished from both normal testes. Under the diagnosis of intrascrotal epidermoid cyst, the mass was resected surgically. The mass measured 23 x 15 x 15 cm, and it contained liquids. The pathological diagnosis was epidermoid cyst of the scrotum.
