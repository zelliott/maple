Calcifying fibrous (pseudo) tumour (CFP) is an uncommon and distinct pathological entity, which is usually occurring in the soft tissue of the extremities, trunk, axilla, pleura, mediastinum and peritoneum. We report a case of CFP of the adrenal gland. A 29-years-old previously healthy woman complained the left lumbago. A solid mass was found on computed tomography on the left adrenal gland. There were no abnormalities in physical examination and laboratory studies. Only urinary noradrenalines and dopamines levels were slightly high. Laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was performed. Pathological findings of the left adrenal tumor showed dense hyalinized fibrous tissue containing bland spindle-shaped cells, calcifications, and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. Our case seems to be the first case of CFP to be published in the Japanese literature.
