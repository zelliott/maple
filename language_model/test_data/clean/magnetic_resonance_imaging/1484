The growing use of highly sensitive but only moderate specific breast MRI requires the development of both minimal-invasive as well as precise biopsy systems. The aim of the study was to prove the accuracy and feasibility of a biopsy procedure carried out in prone position in a vertically opened MR imager.

The biopsies were carried out in 21 women with lesions visible on MRI alone using an open breast coil with an integrated biopsy device. A 14 G coaxial needle was placed under near real-time MRI-guidance. After the tip of this needle was verified in contact with the lesion, we used a non MR-compatible, but MR-safe biopsy gun with a 16 G canula to take four to eight cores.

We found eight malignant and 12 benign lesions. In one patient the procedure was not successful. In case of malignancy, the operation confirmed the diagnosis in all cases. The 12/21 patients with benign lesions have been followed without evidence of lesions growth over eight to 28 months.

The described procedure allows MRI-guided minimal invasive core biopsy of small breast lesions (five to 17 mm) with a high degree of accuracy.
