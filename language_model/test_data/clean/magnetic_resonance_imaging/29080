This article presents a miniaturized electron spin resonance (ESR) probe for deducing the position of a surgical instrument on an MR image. The ESR probe constructed was small enough to fit inside a 14-G biopsy needle sheath, and position information of the sheath could be acquired using a simple gradient sequence. The position accuracy was estimated from needle trajectories as inferred from the needle artifact, the actual physical trajectory, and measured coordinates. The probe was able to track the tip of a biopsy needle quickly (10 samples/sec) and precisely with accuracy better than +/-2 mm. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 1999;10:216-219.
