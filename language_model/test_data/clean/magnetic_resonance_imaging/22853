Monitoring of oxygen saturation in jugular venous blood gives an estimate of the balance of global oxygen delivery and cerebral oxygen consumption. We present a noninvasive approach to measure oxygen saturation in vivo in the internal jugular vein using MR susceptometry by exploiting the characteristic susceptibility of deoxyhemoglobin, and demonstrate the feasibility of performing such measurements in a group of subjects. We assessed the sensitivity of the method for detecting small changes in oxygen saturation by monitoring the variations observed during breath-holding and hypoventilation experiments. Unlike alternative methods, the susceptometric technique does not require calibration.
