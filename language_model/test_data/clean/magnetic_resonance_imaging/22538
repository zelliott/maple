"Ancient schwannomas" of the mouth floor are rare, benign neoplasms derived from the nerve sheath of peripheral nerves. They show many degenerative changes such as necrosis and vascular thrombosis. Ancient schwannomas show histopathological features, such as degenerative changes and atypical nuclei, and may easily be confused with malignant neoplasms. B-scan sonography for the mouth floor and MRT imaging may be helpful in differential diagnosis. Here, we report on a patient with ancient schwannoma of the floor of the mouth.
