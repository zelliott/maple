The authors report a case of middle cranial fossa neurinoma arising from the left greater superficial petrosal nerve in a 21-year-old woman who presented with a left-sided otitis media that chronically recurred over a period of 5 years. On examination, the patient had a left-sided mild conductive hearing impairment and a slight disturbance in tear secretion on the left side, with sensory disturbance in the left palate. Three-dimensional computerized tomography scans clearly demonstrated the enlargement of the foramen lacerum and foramen ovale, and heavily T2-weighted magnetic resonance images revealed the tumor's location along with the course of the greater superficial petrosal nerve and its extension into the tympanic cavity. Following complete surgical excision of the tumor and tympanoplasty via a middle cranial fossa approach, the patient retained useful hearing without facial palsy.
