The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of 6 commercially available magnetic resonance contrast media (CM) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and the induction of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) in dermal fibroblasts (HSF) as a possible model for the pathogenesis of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.

HUVECs were incubated with 10× and 20× of the molar standard blood concentration achieved with CM applications for magnetic resonance imaging examinations (10× and 20× concentration) for 24 hours using gadolinium-based CM Gadovist, Magnevist, Multihance, and Omniscan, as well as Teslascan (Manganese-based), and Resovist (Iron-based). Proliferation kinetics (PK), colony formation, and viability assays were performed. Additionally, human dermal fibroblasts (HSF) were incubated for 24 hours with 1× and 20× concentration in all 6 CM, and TGF-β levels were assessed directly after the incubation period as well as on days 3 and 8 postincubation.

HUVEC PK data show similar gains in cell numbers for all 6 CM in both concentration groups over the 17-day assessment period. Only cells incubated with Omniscan and Teslascan differed from the other groups on days 3 and 7 postincubation (P < 0.05). After day 7, a cell regain occurred in the Omniscan and Teslascan groups reaching the numbers of the other groups in sequel. Differences in colony formation were consistent with PK results with a statistically significant reduction in clonogenic activity for Teslascan and Omniscan in HUVEC cells, P < 0.05. No reduction in viability was seen for all groups and conditions. TGF-β expression of HSF cells incubated with 1× concentration and all CM did not differ significantly from control cells for any point in time investigated. At 20× concentration directly after incubation, TGF-β was significantly reduced for the Teslascan and Resovist group as 3 compared with control and all other CM groups, P < 0.05. On day 3 postincubation, only Resovist-incubated HSF cells showed a significant reduction of TGF-β (1.614, standard deviations: 89) as compared with the control group (2.883, standard deviations: 30) and the other CM. TGF-β was slightly reduced for all CM groups 8 days after incubation (not statistically significant, P > 0.05).

After 24 hours of incubation with Omniscan and Teslascan (10× and 20× concentration), considerable short-term antiproliferative effects in HUVECs were observed. HSF cells (20× concentration) showed a reduction of TGF-β for Resovist and Teslascan directly after incubation, whereas TGF-β levels in HSF cells were slightly reduced for all CM 8 days after incubation. Therefore, TGF-β-mediated proliferative effects on fibroblasts or on collagen synthesis potentially leading to nephrogenic systemic fibrosis may mainly be triggered by tissue monocytes and macrophages in the peripheral blood instead of dermal fibroblasts.
