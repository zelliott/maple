We describe the successful laparoscopic resection of a functional paraganglioma in the organ of Zuckerkandl. A 47-year-old man with hypertension and diabetes mellitus was found to have an abdominal mass beside the aorta. The tumor was diagnosed as a functional paraganglioma by diagnostic imaging and biochemical tests. We then performed a transperitoneal laparoscopic resection for removal. After freeing the left ureter, resecting the inferior mesenteric artery, and dividing the small blood vessels, the tumor was isolated and found to be preserved in its capsule. It was retrieved in a bag through an enlarged incision. The operation time was 450 min and blood loss was 410 ml. The postoperative course was uneventful and there has been no local recurrence or distant metastasis during the 18-month follow-up period. Laparoscopic resection of functional extraadrenal paragangliomas is technically feasible and safe if adequate pre- and intraoperative medical management and a careful, steady surgical technique are used.
