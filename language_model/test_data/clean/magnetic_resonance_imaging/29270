The objective of this study was to illustrate the magnetic resonance (MR) image appearance of the structures of the posteromedial "corner" of the knee with particular emphasis on the anatomy and differentiation between the medial collateral ligament and the posterior oblique ligament.

Six cadaveric knee specimens underwent MR imaging, before and following instillation of intra-articular contrast material. The knees were sectioned in the axial, coronal, and coronal oblique planes and the gross morphology of the posteromedial corner and surrounding structures was studied and correlated with the MR images.

The human cadaveric specimens were from two female and four male patients (age at death, 72-86 years; average, 78 years).

The contrast-enhanced sequences and the coronal oblique images allowed for improved visualization of the structures.
