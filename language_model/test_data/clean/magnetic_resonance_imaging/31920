Endoscopic endonasal approaches are being used with increasing frequency to provide access to virtually any anterior cranial base, clival, or anterior craniocervical pathology. The radiographic evaluation of skull base anatomy and its relationship to associated tumors is critical for both preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance, to ensure the safety and efficacy of these techniques. CT and MRI play a complementary role in guiding endoscopic endonasal procedures.
