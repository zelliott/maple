Primary leiomyoma is a rare, benign tumour of the ovary. We describe the MRI features of an ovarian leiomyoma identified in a 51-year-old woman after hysterectomy. The tumour appeared as a well-circumscribed low signal intensity mass on T(1) weighted imaging, with mixed signal intensity on T2 weighted imaging. Areas of high signal intensity on T2 weighted imaging corresponded to degeneration of leiomyoma. Dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging revealed early enhancement of the lesion. MRI appearance was thus similar to that of uterine leiomyoma. This case suggests the potential usefulness of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI for the diagnosis of ovarian leiomyoma.
