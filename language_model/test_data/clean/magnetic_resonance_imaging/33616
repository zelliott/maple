Neurologic complications of malignancy can result from paraneoplastic manifestations, cerebral metastases or leptomeningeal involvement. Radiologic evaluation by computerised tomography (CT) has proven to be an invaluable tool in cancer patients with neurologic symptoms. Myelography and CT myelography have been the main modalities for evaluating leptomeningeal metastases. The advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast has provided an alternative modality for evaluation of leptomeningeal disease. MRI as compared to CT myelography is non-invasive and at least as sensitive. The findings in two patients with leptomeningeal involvement are reported to illustrate the value of MRI.
