To examine the pattern of immediate enhancement with gadopentetate dimeglumine on dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) images of the spleen, this study was divided into two parts: In the first part, the authors retrospectively reviewed the dynamic MR images obtained with a fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence in the abdomen immediately after injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine in 137 patients. In the second part, dynamic gadolinium-enhanced FLASH images were prospectively compared with contrast material-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scans in 17 patients with focal splenic lesions discovered on CT scans. In the first part, 108 patients (79%) had an arciform pattern of contrast enhancement; 22 patients (16%), a uniform pattern of high signal intensity; and seven patients (5%), a uniform pattern of low signal intensity. Most patients had arciform enhancement of the spleen; uniform enhancement occurred in some patients with underlying malignant or inflammatory disease. In the second part, all focal lesions seen on CT scans were seen on dynamic MR images (75 lesions), significantly more than were seen on FLASH images (15 lesions) (P < .001).
