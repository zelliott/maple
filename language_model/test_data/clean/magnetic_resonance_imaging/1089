We present a surgically proven case of infradiaphragmatic pulmonary sequestration combined with cystic adenomatoid malformation. Prenatal magnetic resonance imaging revealed a well-defined hyperintense mass with a hypointense septum in the left infradiaphragmatic region. Postdelivery computed tomography (CT) and 3-month follow-up CT showed replacement of intralesional cystic areas by solid content. Such unusual postnatal CT changes, to our knowledge, have not been previously documented.
