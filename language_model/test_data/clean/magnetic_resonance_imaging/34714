In a case of alobar holoprosencephaly, a neonate who died several minutes after birth was found to have multiple facial and intracranial malformations, including cyclopia. Postmortem MR and CT findings included a single midline orbit, with two globes that contained separate lenses supplied by a single optic nerve. There were two separate superior orbital fissures and two separate lateral rectus muscles.
