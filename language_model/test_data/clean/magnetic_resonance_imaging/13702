We report two cases of primary cardiac hydatid cyst in which hydatid materials caused recurrent embolizations in pulmonary arteries and pulmonary parenchyma. Cardiac hydatid cysts may stay asymptomatic for a long time, until they reveal themselves being perforated into cardiac chambers and/or pulmonary artery or systemic circulation. The role of imaging techniques in diagnosis is discussed and the importance of dynamic enhanced CT, MR imaging, and enhanced MR angiography (MRA) is reported. Imaging findings were confirmed by surgery and pathology. Early diagnosis is essential because delayed treatment increases the morbidity and mortality rates.
