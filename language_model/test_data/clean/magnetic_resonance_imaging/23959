One of the most exciting methodological advances for brain research field arises in functional brain imaging, which enables us to localize and characterize neural activity and biochemical events in the living human brain. Recently developed event-related functional MRI makes it possible to visualize the brain activity associated with cognitive processes with the temporal resolution of the hemodynamic response. In addition, the high sensitivity and selectivity of positron-emission tomography allow us to probe the neurochemical processes at the molecular level. Positron-emission tomography also has been applied to investigate the effects of therapeutic drugs as well as the effects of drugs of abuse.
