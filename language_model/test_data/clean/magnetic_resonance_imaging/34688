We observed simultaneous changes in lactate level and regional blood flow (rBF) in the brain of the anesthetized rabbit by using localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) and laser Doppler flowmetry. The volume of interest of 0.5 ml for 1H MRS contained mostly thalamic nuclei. During hypoxia peak area for lactate increased up to 57% of that from N-Acetylaspartate. While the rBF increased during hypoxia up to 260% of the control, oxygen delivery (rBF x arterial oxygen content) decreased. In the normoxic recovery period following hypoxia, the rBF recovered slowly and a consequent overshoot of oxygen delivery was observed. The multiple and stepwise linear regression analyses revealed that the averaged decrease in oxygen delivery during hypoxia was the most significant independent variable for the increase in lactate during hypoxia (correlation coefficient; r2 = 0.68) and also that the increase in lactate during hypoxia was the most significant independent variable for the time for half-recovery of rBF (r2 = 0.75). These results suggest that the increase in lactate during hypoxia is due to the deficiency of oxygen delivery and that the increase in lactate during hypoxia prolongs the period of enhancement of rBF during recovery from hypoxia.
