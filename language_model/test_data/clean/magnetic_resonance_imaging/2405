The authors examine the use of CT and MR comparatively in tumours of nose, paranasal sinuses and facial bones. Both CT and MR are much more useful to assess the real extent of the pathology than to give specific diagnose. The resolution of the images and the possibility of examining them on many different planes give evident advantage to MR as regards the evaluation of tumors in this region. Nevertheless, CT with bone algoritme gives better details about bone structure.
