Ossification of the Achilles tendon is the result of a traumatic, hypoxic injury of the tendon. The usually asymptomatic ossification has a clinical importance only in case of a new trauma. We report about a patient with an isolated fracture of the ossification without an accompanying rupture of the Achilles tendon. Because of the radiologically "occult" fracture the diagnosis could only be verified by MRI. With a conservative treatment without resection of the ossification we could reach painless recovery.
