A theoretical model is described for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radio-frequency resonator (an MRI "coil") that is useful at ultrahigh frequencies. The device is a "TEM resonator," which is based on a concept originally proposed by Röschmann (1988). The coil comprises a circular cavity-like structure containing several coaxial transmission lines operating in a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) mode. The model developed herein treats the empty coil and is based on multiconductor transmission line theory. This work generalizes and extends similar analyses of the device by Röschmann (1995) and Chingas and Zhang (1996). The model employs explicit calculation of per-unit-length parameters for TEM lines having arbitrary geometries. Calculations of the resonator's frequency response are found to compare well with measurements. Fields produced by linear (single-point) and quadrature drive are also computed and compared to images of low-permittivity phantoms.
