Prospective clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were performed over a period of 2-3 years on 51 MS patients. Comparing cerebral MRI and neurological evaluation for sensitivity in detecting disease activity, follow-up MRI turned out to be superior to standardized clinical assessment. In particular, an interval during which the clinical findings remain stable may not necessarily indicate that there is no florid inflammatory activity during this time. The morphological progression demonstrated a preference towards periventricular localization around the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles, and non-periventricularly in the frontal white matter. Longitudinal MRI studies of the disease activity can be an aid in obtaining a more definite diagnosis. Patients having had the disease for a longer period showed a more rapid clinical and morphological progression. Clinical progression and an increase in periventricular involvement were observed more often in the primary unremitting-progressive form of MS than in the relapsing-remitting form.
