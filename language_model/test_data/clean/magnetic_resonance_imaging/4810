A previous study showed the possibility of the dependence of the T2 maps measured by Siemens Magnetom MR imager 1.5 T on the viability of the cadaveric kidney. For the T2 relaxometry study the pig model was used. Ten pig renal allografts were examined during 68 h after removal. Significant differences were found in the change of the initial Tini2 values in the histogram within the first 20 h [delta 1 = Tini2 (2) - Tini2 (20)] or 8 h [delta 2 = Tini2 (2) - Tini2 (8)] after removal between the groups of the damaged kidneys (delta 1 = 20.2 +/- 6.8 ms, delta 2 = 19.4 +/- 3.0) and the kidneys without apparent damage (delta 1 = 9.4 +/- 8.5 ms, delta 2 = 5.4 +/- 5.8).
