Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disease that results in cartilage degeneration in the joints and is a disabling condition for millions of individuals. Poor sensitivity and specificity of standard diagnostic methods have relegated treatment options to mitigating pain or surgical replacement. The advent of disease-modifying drugs holds the potential for reversing the normal course of OA and rebuilding cartilage. To aid these therapies, novel magnetic resonance imaging-based tools are required for detecting subtle early changes in cartilage physiology due to OA that may provide improved diagnoses and clinical management of patients. Some of the techniques reviewed here such as T1œÅ and T2 relaxometry, magnetization transfer, chemical exchange saturation transfer, and Na magnetic resonance imaging are all biomarkers of cartilage pathological diseases that are sensitive to early biochemical changes in the extracellular matrix of cartilage. These techniques have the potential to noninvasively detect early pathological changes with the goal of aiding clinical decision making as well as contributing to the development and evaluation of potential disease-modifying therapies.
