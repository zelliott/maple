Multiple meningeomas in the absence of Recklinghausen's disease are rare and usually occur in a single compartment of the neuroaxis. Multiple meningeomas in different neuroaxial compartments are an even rarer condition, only a few cases having been reported. We describe four cases, each with two meningeomas in different compartments of the neuroaxis. Their peculiarity consists in the fact that the different tumours developed at different times and locations in the supratentorial and spinal regions. The radiological and operative findings are described. The possibility of dissemination via the cerebrospinal fluid or blood or of a multifocal origin or genetic predisposition is discussed.
