In this paper, a novel sensitivity mapping method is proposed for the image domain parallel MRI (pMRI) technique. Instead of refining raw sensitivity maps by means of conventional image processing operations such as polynomial fitting, the presented method determines coil sensitivity profiles through an iterative optimization process. During the algorithm implementation the optimization cost function is defined as the difference between the raw sensitivity profile and the desired profile. The minimization is governed by the physics of low-frequency electromagnetic and reciprocity theories. The performance of the method was theoretically investigated and compared with that of a traditional polynomial fitting, against a range of system noise levels. It was found that, the new method produces high-fidelity sensitivity profiles with noise amplitudes, measured as root mean square deviation an order of magnitude less than that of the polynomial fitting method. Using the sensitivity profiles generated by our method, SENSE (sensitivity encoding) reconstructions produce significantly less image artefacts than conventional methods. The successful implementation of this method has far-reaching implications that accurate sensitivity mapping is not only important for parallel reconstruction, but also essential for its transmission analogy, such as Transmit SENSE.
