The aim of the study is to present a computerized database of the Neurology department of Limoges University Hospital and the main results obtained from data of 340 patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), diagnosed between 1984 and 1997. It is a user friendly and can be accessed by all neurologists at any level of computer knowledge. This database is modular (6 modules) and flexible according to need. The software used, Access 7, is an open relation database, which allows export of data to statistical or other compatible software. One of the reasons, which led to the elaboration of this database was to develop a means of collecting data in an analyzable manner for therapeutic trials. During these trials, a great number of data can be collected during each clinic visit for the evaluation of the degree of impairment, disability, and handicap. We present part of the data from the patients followed, some of whom were treated with riluzole, the current reference molecule for ALS.
