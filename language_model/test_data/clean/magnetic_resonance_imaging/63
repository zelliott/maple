Left ventricular noncompaction is a congenital cardiomyopathy, which is often first diagnosed in adults. The condition can be found in isolation, but it has also been described in association with other cardiac anomalies. We report here the 4th documented case of left ventricular noncompaction associated with a bicuspid aortic valve and the 1st of these cases in which the patient underwent aortic valve surgery.
