Eighteen extreme rock climbers underwent primary clinical and MRI examination because of recent closed injuries to the flexor tendon pulleys. Follow-ups were after approximately 36 months on the average. The recent injuries, which are difficult to diagnose clinically, could be ascertained by means of MRI: This type of injury seems to occur more frequently than is currently diagnosed. Eight patients with overuse syndrome and eight patients with a short pulley rupture were treated conservatively. In two patients with long pulley rupture, the pulleys were reconstructed by means of a tendon graft using Kleinert's technique. Clinically manifest bowstringing or flexion contracture after treatment could not be ascertained on any one of the patients. All except for one showed an almost normal range of motion. By means of control MRI it was, however, possible to ascertain minor bowstringing and scars in most patients. Clinically, this partial instability manifested by lasting swelling. What was most disturbing, however, was reduced strength and the subjective feeling of insecurity during climbing.
