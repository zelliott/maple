We present the clinical, anatomic, and laboratory findings in a 4-month-old child with desmosplastic infantile ganglioglioma. Microtubule-associated protein-2 (AP18) and neuron-specific B-tubulin (TUJ-1) were more sensitive in detecting immature neural elements than synaptophysin. Despite the immature neuroblastic component, focal intermediate proliferation indices, microinvasion, presence of secondary features (extension into Virchow Robin spaces, perineuronal satellitosis), and subtotal resection, the child has done well, with striking improvement of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image, head size improvement, no tumor recurrence, and minimal neurological deficits.
