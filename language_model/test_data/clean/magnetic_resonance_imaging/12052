A 12-year-old boy had a long history of headache since the age of 4 years. Numbness and weakness of the upper extremities and chest tightness, especially in the morning, were noted since 2 years ago. The headache became more severe and frequent and attacked even in sleep since one year ago. Arnold-Chiari type 1 malformation, cervical syringomyelia and mild hydrocephalus were demonstrated by MRI scan of the central nervous system. Headache and other symptoms disappeared immediately after surgical intervention. The formation of syringomyelia may be multifactorial, but Arnold-Chiari type 1 malformation and uneventful birth history play an important role in the underlying cause of this case. We presented this youngest case who had Arnold-Chiari type 1 malformation and onset of headache from the age of 4 years, discussed the pathogenesis of syringomyelia and reviewed the literature.
