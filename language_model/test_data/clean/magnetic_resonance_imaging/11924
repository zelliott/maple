We present a case of a symptomatic subependymoma (SE) in a young. The patient was a 20-year-old female who suffered from severe headache and vomiting. Precontrast CT scans revealed a large spotty-calcified isodensity mass lesion in the right anterior lateral ventricle, showing scarce contrast enhancement at the center of the mass and with marked hydrocephalus. MRI demonstrated the lesion as slightly hypo-intensity on T1-weighted image, hyper-intensity on T2-weighted image. On FLAIR imaging, the lesion indicated remarkable hyperintensity and was clearly distinguishable from surrounding brain parenchyma and the cerebrospinal fluid. After Gd-DTPA infusion central vein was revealed, but no tumor enhancement was seen. The tumor was totally extirpated through the transcortical approach. Histological diagnosis was SE, and high MIB-1 staining index (9.3%) was seen. FLAIR imaging is useful for the preoperative diagnosis and the postoperative assessment of SEs.
