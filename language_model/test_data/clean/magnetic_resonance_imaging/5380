Dislocation of the shoulder joint is an unfortunate consequence of trauma to the shoulder girdle. It can occur in varying age groups with a complication of an impaction injury to the posterior aspect of the humeral head, termed a Hill-Sachs lesion. This can pose further problems leading to instability of the glenohumeral joint and recurrent dislocations. Varying surgical techniques have been developed to address this issue especially in young, active individuals. We describe another technique that can be used to treat Hill-Sachs lesions in patients with recurrent dislocations of the shoulder.
