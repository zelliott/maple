Hemangiomas of the skull base are rare neoplasms and are easily misdiagnosed as acoustic neuromas when occurring in the internal auditory canal. Among these tumors, ossifying hemangiomas are characterized histologically be newly formed bone tissue within their substance. We describe a 26-year old female patient who presented with left-sided sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a bright space-occupying lesion of the internal auditory canal with extension to the geniculate ganglion. Bony erosions of the internal auditory canal were proved by high-resolution computed tomography. A hemangioma was suspected preoperatively and was resected via a middle cranial fossa approach. Histologically, new bone formations were found in a cavernous hemangioma. In general, radiologic findings can suggest a hemangioma of the internal auditory canal and help to differentiate it from acoustic neuroma. Based on the histological findings of intratumoral bone formation, the hemangioma in our patient was classified as an ossifying hemangioma. However, reactive bone formation at the borders of a tumor in the internal auditory canal can also be mistaken as new intratumoral bone formation.
