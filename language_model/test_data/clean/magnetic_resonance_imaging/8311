Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a tumor of the soft tissues arising from the vascular endothelium. It is considered an intermediate grade malignancy. A 42-year-old female patient presented with pain and tingling down her right arm and a mass at the right medial upper extremity. MRI revealed an oblong mass along the course of the neurovascular bundle. Given the clinical and MR findings, a nerve sheath tumor was suspected. At surgery, the mass was adherent to both the brachial artery medially and the median nerve posteriorly. Pathology revealed epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. The imaging characteristics of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma on ultrasound, CT, and MRI are reviewed. Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma can mimic a nerve sheath tumor clinically and radiologically and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of tumors involving or adjacent to a neurovascular bundle.
