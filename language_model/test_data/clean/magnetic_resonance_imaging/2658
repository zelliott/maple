To postulate a causal relation between optic nerve hypoplasia and a suprasellar teratoma.

Case report.

A 6-month-old infant with suprasellar teratoma was visually inattentive and had searching nystagmus. He had moderately severe, bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia with the left eye being somewhat worse than the right eye.

Optic nerve hypoplasia is a major cause of impaired vision in children and rarely has been attributed to an intracranial tumor. Our case, involving a patient with a suprasellar teratoma and optic nerve hypoplasia, supports a causal relation between the two.
