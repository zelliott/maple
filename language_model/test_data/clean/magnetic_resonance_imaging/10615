The rarity of the superior sulcus tumor has led to varying treatment techniques. Generally, radiation therapy followed by surgery has been used. En bloc resection combined with lobectomy and nodal dissection remains standard therapy. The unique location of this tumor, surgical approach thought to be important. Involvement of the anterior areas such as subclavian vessels can be resected by anterior transcervical approach, and vertebral body or brachial plexus through the classic Shaw Paulson approach. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is beneficial to the evaluation of the vessels, nerves, and surgical planning. Recent studies showed that induction concurrent chemoradiation therapy improved the resectability and curability. This article reviews the treatment of superior sulcus tumor.
