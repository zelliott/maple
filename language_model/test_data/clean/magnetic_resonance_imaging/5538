The aim of this study was to evaluate lesion enhancement (LE) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) properties of P846, a new intermediate sized, high relaxivity Gd-based contrast agent at 3 Tesla in a rat brain glioma model, and to compare this contrast agent with a high relaxivity, macromolecular compound (P792), and a standard extracellular Gd-chelate (Gd-DOTA).

Seven rats with experimental induced brain glioma were evaluated using 3 different contrast agents, with each MR examination separated by at least 24 hours. The time between injections assured sufficient clearance of the agent from the tumor, before the next examination. P792 (Gadomelitol, Guerbet, France) and P846 (a new compound from Guerbet Research) are macromolecular and high relaxivity contrast agents with no protein binding, and were compared with the extracellular agent Gd-DOTA (Dotarem, Guerbet, France). T1w gradient echo sequences (TR/TE 200 milliseconds/7.38 milliseconds, flip angle = 90 degrees , acquisition time: 1:42 minutes:sec, voxel size: 0.2 x 0.2 x 2.0 mm, FOV = 40 mm, acquisition matrix: 256 x 256) were acquired before and at 5 consecutive time points after each intravenous contrast injection in the identical slice orientation, using a dedicated 4-channel head array animal coil. The order of contrast media injection was randomized, with however Gd-DOTA used either as the first or second contrast agent. Contrast agent dose was adjusted to compensate for the different T1 relaxivities of the 3 agents. Signal-to-noise ratio, CNR, and LE were evaluated using region-of-interest analysis. A veterinary histopathologist confirmed the presence of a glioma in each subject, after completion of the imaging study.

P792 showed significantly less LE as compared with Gd-DOTA within the first 7 minutes after contrast agent injection (P < 0.05) with, however, reaching comparable LE values at 9 minutes after injection (P = 0.07). However, P792 provided significantly less CNR as compared with Gd-DOTA (P < 0.05) for all examination time points. P846 provided comparable but persistent LE as compared with Gd-DOTA (P < 0.05) and demonstrated significantly greater LE and CNR when compared with P792 (P < 0.05). No statistically significant differences between CNR values for Gd-DOTA and P846 were noted for all examination time points (P < 0.05), with P846 administered at one-fourth the dose as compared with Gd-DOTA.

The intravascular contrast medium P792 showed significantly less LE and CNR in comparison to Gd-DOTA and P846, suggesting that it does not show marked extravasation from tumor neocapillaries and does not significantly cross the disrupted blood brain-barrier in this rat glioma model. In distinction, P846 provides comparable enhancement properties at a field strength of 3 Tesla to the extracellular contrast agent Gd-DOTA, using the adjusted dose, suggesting that it crosses the disrupted blood-brain-barrier and tumor capillaries, most likely based on the decreased molecular weight as compared with P792. At the same time, the high relaxivity of this compound allows for decreasing the injected gadolinium dose by a factor of 4 whereas providing comparable enhancement properties when compared with a standard extracellular Gd-chelate (Gd-DOTA) at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight.
