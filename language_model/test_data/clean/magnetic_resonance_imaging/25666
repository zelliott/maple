A patient with renal cell carcinoma extending into the inferior vena cava presented to our institution. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the superior extent of the thrombus to be at the level of the hepatic veins. Preoperative venacavography showed extension into the right atrium. The need for both studies in evaluating patients with Stage 3A disease is reviewed.
