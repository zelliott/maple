The authors developed and tested a dual stress magnetic resonance (MR) imaging protocol to evaluate myocardial perfusion, function, and hibernation. The technique was well tolerated, and high-quality images were achieved. The comprehensive information obtained can be used to guide clinical management decisions regarding coronary artery revascularization procedures. This protocol offers a one-stop assessment of patients with coronary artery disease with use of a clinical MR imager.
