An inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMFT) is recognized as benign tissue proliferative response comprising a variety of inflammatory and mesenchymal cells, and presents commonly at a young age. Although it occurs most frequently in the lung, it has also been observed in other organs and tissues such as the liver, spleen, bladder, and lymph nodes. However, IMFT of the heart is rare, and previously only 38 cases have been reported in the English literature. We herein report the case of a 65-year-old woman with asymptomatic IMFT in the right ventricular outflow tract. Previously reported cases are reviewed.
