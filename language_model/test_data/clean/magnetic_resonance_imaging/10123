Image contrast between tissue types can be generated based on their T1/T2 ratio using spin-lock MRI techniques. An interesting application of such a concept would be to generate contrast in tissue with tissue relaxation times modified using exogenous contrast agents. An amplitude-modulated adiabatic waveform has been shown in the past to perform spin-lock MRI. However, implementation of this waveform may not prove to be efficient and practical in research or a clinical setup due to high radiofrequency power deposition. Recent advancement in software and hardware MR technology allows implementation of amplitude- and phase-modulated adiabatic waveforms on MR systems. The aim of this work was to explore role of adiabatic waveforms in performing rho imaging and demonstrate that amplitude- and phase-modulated waveforms [e.g., hyperbolic secant, B1 independent rotation-4 (BIR-4) waveforms] can be used to distinguish materials that differ in T1/T2 ratio.

MR simulation was performed using computer routines implemented in MATLAB environment (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Modified Bloch equations with trapezoidal, hyperbolic secant and BIR-4 waveforms were used to perform MR simulation. Trapezoidal waveforms were only used for comparison to other waveforms. Gadolinium DTPA (Gad-DTPA) (T1/T2 approximately 1) and manganese chloride (MnCl(2)) (T1/T2 approximately 10) were used as examples of contrast agents due to their routine use in clinical and research setups and more importantly because they provide good examples of materials differing in T1/T2 ratios. Results of spin locking using trapezoidal waveform agree very well with the previously published results, thereby validating the computer routines used in this MR simulation. Plots of M(rho) (magnetization vector in rho domain) vs. offset frequency show distinct curves for these materials differing in T1/T2 for the three waveforms. BIR-4 waveform demonstrated a 40% difference in M(rho) ( approximately 150 Hz) for the materials. Rate of spin lock with hyperbolic secant waveform was rapid compared to other waveforms.

MR simulation using contrast agents Gad-DTPA and MnCl(2) provided a useful way to demonstrate that amplitude- and phase-modulated adiabatic waveforms can be used to perform spin-lock imaging. Future work involves implementation of these waveforms on MR scanners and performing in vivo imaging to generate tissue contrast based on relaxation times ratio.
