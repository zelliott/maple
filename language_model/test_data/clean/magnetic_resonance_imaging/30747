To describe the treatment of cystic facial neuroma with drainage and marsupialization as an alternative to tumor removal and facial nerve grafting.

Retrospective case review.

Tertiary referral hospital.

Two cases of cystic facial neuroma.

Maintenance of facial nerve function at or better than preoperative function.

Both cases were managed with cyst drainage. Case 1 retained House-Brackmann Grade I facial nerve function. Case 2 retained Grade II function.

Cyst drainage provides a useful alternative to tumor removal and nerve sacrifice in patients with predominantly cystic facial neuromas and serviceable facial function.
