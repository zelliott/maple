The phase-encoded echo-planar (PEEP) technique, a variant of echo-planar imaging, is used to achieve simultaneous high-speed spatial and chemical-shift data acquisition. This technique is the 2DFT equivalent of the projection reconstruction echo-planar method for chemical-shift imaging. Examples of images and spectra obtained using the PEEP method are presented.
