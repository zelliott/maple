A polymorphism (PM) in the microsatellite of the promoter region of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), modulating its expression, could play a role in susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS). MMP-9 PM was determined in 95 patients with MS (MS Group) and 95 age- and sex-matched controls (Control Group). Comparison of allelic frequencies showed that a higher number of CA repeats characterized the MS group (P<0.0001) and prevalence of carriers of > or =22 CA repeats was higher in the MS than in the Control Group (OR 3.4, 95% CI: 1.7-6.8, P<0.0001). An earlier age at disease onset was a characteristic of patients with >22 CA repeats (33+/-10 vs. 28+/-10, P=0.027). No differences were found in the main MRI parameters.
