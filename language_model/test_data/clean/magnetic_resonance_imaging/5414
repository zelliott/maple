Persistent ulnar-sided wrist pain after treatment of triquetral dorsal chip fracture even after union is a matter of concern. There could be various reasons for this persistent pain like arthritis, instability, fractures and non-union. We correlate our findings of physical examination and wrist arthroscopy as triangular fibrocartilage complex injury to be one of the causes of this persistent pain.

Six subjects who had persistent ulnocarpal joint pain and tenderness after triquetral dorsal chip fracture, despite 2 months of conservative treatment, were subjected to physical tests. If the physical examination yields positive results, then magnetic resonance imaging followed by arthroscopic treatment was performed. The six patients were then evaluated using the visual analogue scale, the Mayo modified wrist score, and the grip strength test.

Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injury was observed in all six cases and partial TFCC resection and synovectomy were performed. Analysis of the visual analogue scale, Mayo modified wrist score, and grip strength test data revealed statistically significant improvements (P < 0.05).

In addition to several causes reported in the published literature, TFCC injury can be a cause of persistent ulnar pain after treatment of triquetral dorsal chip fracture. Arthroscopic partial TFCC resection can be considered to be a suitable treatment for such cases.
