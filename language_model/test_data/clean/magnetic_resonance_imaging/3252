In our institute, an MR apparatus, MAGNETOM VISION (Siemens) was replaced by ECHELON Vega (HITACHI). Z-score data acquired by MPRAGE (VISION) was compared with those by radio frequency-spoiled steady-state acquisition with rewinded gradient echo (RSSG) and gradient echo inversion recovery (GEIR) (ECHELON). For this study, ten normal volunteers were recruited and their data ware obtained within two months using both apparatuses. In addition, the difference of the contrasts of the images of these apparatuses was compared. There was a significant difference between Z-scores of MPRAGE and RSSG while there was no difference between MPRAGE and GEIR. As for the contrast, data of MPRAGE were similar to those of GEIR. To compare Z-scores acquired with MAGNTOM VISION (Siemens), it seems appropriate to use GEIR in ECHELON Vega.
