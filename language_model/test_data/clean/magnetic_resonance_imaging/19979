Patterns of bimanual coordination in which homologous muscles are simultaneously active are more stable than those in which homologous muscles are engaged in an alternating fashion. This may be attributable to the stronger involvement of the dominant motor cortex in ipsilateral hand movements via interaction with the non-dominant motor system, known as neural crosstalk. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural representation of the interhemispheric interaction during bimanual mirror movements. Thirteen right-handed subjects completed four conditions: sequential finger tapping using the right and left index and middle fingers, bimanual mirror and parallel finger tapping. Auditory cues (3 Hz) were used to keep the tapping frequency constant. Task-related activation in the right primary motor cortex was significantly less prominent during mirror than unimanual left-handed movements. This was mirror- and non-dominant side-specific; parallel movements did not cause such a reduction, and the left primary motor cortex showed no such differential activation across the unimanual right, bimanual mirror, and bimanual parallel conditions. Reducing the contralateral innervation of the left hand may increase the fraction of the force command to the left hand coming from the left primary motor cortex, enhancing the neural crosstalk.
