The nervous system involvement of 8 patients with end-stage liver disease was evaluated by means of clinical neurological, neuropsychological, neurophysiological and neuroradiological investigation before and 6-12 months after a successful liver transplantation. Preoperatively, all subjects (7 women, 1 man; mean age 40 years, range 30-54 years) exhibited decreased muscle strength and 2 patients manifested clinical signs of polyneuropathy. In neuropsychological tests, slight visuoconstructive apraxia, and disturbances of verbal memory and cognitive function were observed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed cerebral lesions in two patients. After transplantation, muscle strength reverted to normal in all patients, polyneuropathy improved and in all but 2 patients recovery of neuropsychological functioning was observed. Clinical signs of encephalopathy had disappeared. All patients were emotionally better adjusted after transplantation. Four subjects showed new, albeit mild changes in neurophysiological and neuropsychological tests postoperatively. We conclude that the majority of neurological impairment disappeared after liver transplantation. We want to stress that evaluation of neurological sequelae of liver transplantation needs to be based on assessments both before and after liver transplantation.
