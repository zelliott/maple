In this report, the authors discuss the case of a patient with a mixed cerebrovascular malformation in which an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) was associated with a capillary telangiectasia. Recent reports have contained reviews of various subsets of mixed malformations. To the authors' knowledge, however, this is the first report of a mixed vascular malformation with both arterial and capillary components. The patient underwent complete resection of the AVM after presenting with a clinical hemorrhage. She required a second operation to resect the capillary telangiectasia after new symptoms developed several months following the first procedure. The authors conclude that a mixed AVM-capillary telangiectasia is a rare but distinct entity.
