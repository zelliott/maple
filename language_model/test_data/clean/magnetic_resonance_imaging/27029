We report the case of a 31-year-old male with enlarged kidneys and glomerulocystic kidney disease (GCKD). The patient had no family history of renal disease or other diseases. On initial presentation he complained of poor eyesight, and hypertensive retinopathy and elevated serum creatinine (5.0 mg/dl) were found at that time. Renal biopsy showed cystic dilatation of Bowman's capsule and atrophy of the glomerular tuft. Thus, an adult case of sporadic GCKD was diagnosed. Based on previous reports, kidney size in patients with adult type GCKD varies from small to large. Our patient's kidneys are the largest ever reported (right kidney was 22 cm×10 cm, left kidney was 19 cm×10 cm). A review of the literature dealing with sporadic adult GCKD suggested that it is difficult to diagnose this disease early in its course.
