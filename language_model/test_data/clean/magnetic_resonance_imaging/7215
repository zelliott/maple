An NMR model for the study of drug interactions with solid tumour is described. It is based on the use of packed cells in a simple medium. The system is capable of dealing with cellular biochemistry at a molecular level through experiments conducted in a homogeneous field by 1H spin-echo NMR spectroscopy. However, through a simple imaging technique, it is also possible to introduce a spatial element into the chemistry of the packed cells. The use of these complementary NMR methods are illustrated by the action of the cytotoxic agent doxorubicin on cellular glycolysis. A pattern of signals observed in a homogeneous field experiment following oxidative stress are duplicated in the imaging experiment to illustrate the toxins' ability to penetrate the model tumour.
