Renal lymphangiomatosis is an extremely rare disease characterized by developmental malformation of the lymphatic system surrounding the kidneys. We present the case of a 22-year-old pregnant female discovered because of worsening. Ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging studies were performed. An 18 × 11 × 10 cm voluminous cystic subcapsular lesion compressing the left kidney and subcapsular cysts of the right kidney were found. After the delivery, marsupialization was performed and the pathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of lymphangiomatosis. A review of the literature is proposed.
