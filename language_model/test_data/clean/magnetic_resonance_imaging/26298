We present an unusual case of hepatocellular carcinoma presenting as massive portal vein thrombosis with progression to the intrahepatic bile ducts without demonstrable primary hepatic tumor. Ultrasound, magnetic resonance, and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography findings are described. The histologic diagnosis was achieved by means of percutaneous forceps biopsy of the endobiliary mass.
