Pasteurella multocida, a gram-negative coccobacillus, is a commensal in the nasopharynx of many animals. P. multocida infections most commonly involve the skin, soft tissues, and respiratory tract, particularly in immunosuppressed patients. The present case illustrates a severe articular infection caused by this bacterium, leading to septic shock, in an elderly, otherwise healthy woman, after a simple scratch of a cat.
