Complete pelvimetry can be easily performed via MR. As shown by comparing the measurements of 4 observers its reproducibility is acceptable. The reference diameters obtained on 53 patients by MR are in 7 out of 9 dimensions larger than those of anatomical and obstetrical textbooks, which have not changed in the last 100 years. Hence, with the general increase in population size an increase in pelvic diameters has taken place.
