We assessed the efficiency of attentional shifts across the horizontal and vertical axes of the visual field in a patient with Balint's syndrome caused by bilateral parieto-occipital infarctions. This was performed using an adaptation of Posner's peripheral cueing paradigm. In contrast to normal controls and patients with unilateral parietal lesions previously reported, this patient did not benefit from cues directing attention to the left or right visual field. She appeared to benefit only when the cues directed attention to the upper visual field. This suggests a defect in shifting attention that may occur following bilateral parietal lesions. We discuss the implications of these findings for the role of the parietal lobes in attentional processes and for our understanding of the behavioral abnormalities observed in Balint's syndrome.
