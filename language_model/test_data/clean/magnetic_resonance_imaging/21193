Intraventricular meningiomas (IVM) are rare tumors, constituting only 0.5 to 2% of all intracranial meningiomas, and meningiomas localized within the foramen of Monro are exceptional, with only a very few cases reported in the literature. We report the case of a 41-year-old man, admitted to our department for headaches. MRI found a mass tissular well enhanced after gadolinium injection, arising in the region of the foramens of Monro, and extended to the lateral and the third ventricles. Histological examination revealed a meningioma.
