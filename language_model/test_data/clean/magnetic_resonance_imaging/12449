Maternal virilization in pregnancy with or without fetal female pseudohermaphroditism has several etiologies. Of these, pregnancy luteoma is the most common cause of maternal virilization during pregnancy, and approximately 20 cases have been reported in recent years. Moreover, four cases of pregnancy luteomas with female pseudohermaphroditism have been reported. However, the extremely rare steroid cell tumor, not otherwise specified (NOS), has been reported only once as a cause for maternal virilization. Herein, the authors report the first case of maternal virilization with female pseudohermaphroditism associated with steroid cell tumor-NOS along with the clinical course, pathological features, and a review of the literature.
