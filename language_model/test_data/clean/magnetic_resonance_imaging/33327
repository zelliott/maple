Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is an uncommon condition characterized by obstruction of the hepatic venous outflow tract. Presentation may vary from a completely asymptomatic condition to fulminant liver failure. BCS is an example of postsinusoidal portal hypertension. The management can be divided into three main categories: medical, surgical, and endovascular. The purpose of this article is to present an overall perspective of the problem, diagnosis, and management.

BCS requires accurate, prompt diagnosis and aggressive therapy. Treatment will vary depending on the clinical presentation, cause, and anatomic location of the problem. Patients with BCS are probably best treated in tertiary care centers where liver transplantation is available.
