Miniaturization of echocardiographic transducers, improved crystal technology, and enhanced digital processing of ultrasound signals have resulted in newer, more sophisticated equipment and imaging techniques. These technologic advances include transesophageal echocardiography, stress echocardiography (both pharmacologic and exercise), intravascular and intracardiac ultrasound, and three-dimensional echocardiography. Magnetic resonance imaging is also becoming increasingly important in the visualization of specific pathologies. These advances in cardiac imaging are discussed, with prime emphasis placed on present and future clinical applications in congenital heart disease.
