Tuberculosis is uncommon in the nasopharynx. The purpose of this study was to investigate the CT and MRI features of 36 cases of tuberculosis in this area.

CT (n=15) and MRI (n=21) scans from 36 patients with histologically proved tuberculosis of the nasopharynx were reviewed by two experienced radiologists, paying particular attention to the lesions' distribution, location, extent, size, internal architecture, pattern, and degree of enhancement, and cervical lymphadenopathy.

Twenty-nine patients exhibited a polypoid mass pattern and seven had diffuse mucosal thickening. The roof of the nasopharynx was involved in all cases. The mean size of the lesions was 11.4mm. Striped pattern was detected in 19 cases. Adjacent muscle invasion or bone destruction was not detected. Heterogeneous enhancement was detected in all patients, and necrosis in the nasopharyngeal lesions was detected in 16 cases. Poor, moderate, and marked enhancement was detected in one, 27, and eight cases, respectively. Thirty-four patients had involvement of the cervical lymph nodes. Twenty-two and 28 cases were associated with bilateral lymphadenopathy or necrosis, respectively. The retropharyngeal lymph node was the most commonly involved site (94.1%).

The presence of necrosis and striped pattern in nasopharyngeal lesions, site predilection, no invasion of regional structures, and central necrosis with peripheral rim enhancement of cervical lymphadenopathy may suggest the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal tuberculosis.
