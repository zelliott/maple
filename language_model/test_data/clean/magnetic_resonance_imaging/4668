A 22-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital because of an abnormal shadow on a chest X-ray taken for routine examination. Preoperative diagnostic work up including chest computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging suggested that the tumor would most likely to be a posterior mediastinal lipoma. Through a right thoracotomy the tumor was removed successfully. Histologically it proved to be a mature teratoma. The incidence, etiology and diagnostic procedure of the mediastinal teratoma was discussed.
