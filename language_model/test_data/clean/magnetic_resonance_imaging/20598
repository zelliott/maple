Brain imaging enables the investigation of brain morphology and function in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Innovative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have recently been established as a new research tool in PD. They are based on the investigation of neuronal tissue properties (MR relaxometry, SWI, DWI, DTI, VBM) and of cerebral perfusion and neuronal activity (ASL, fcMRI). Besides a better understanding of the pathophysiology of PD, these innovative MR techniques might be suitable for measuring progression of PD and the effect of therapeutic interventions on brain functioning. In the clinical setting, they could help to advance the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders.
