The authors report a case of grade I-II giant-cell tumour of the ribs extending to the thorax and the vertebral column. The tumour was treated by surgical resection followed by vertebral curettage in two stages and adjuvant regional radiotherapy. Giant-cell tumours of the ribs are exceptional and rarely found in the literature. They raise a therapeutic problem (surgery is essential, but radiotherapy is controverted), and a prognostic problem (there is always a potential risk of recurrent malignancy).
