A 51-year-old woman with a history of migraine headaches was found to have an incidental right orbital mass on MRI during neurologic evaluation for headaches. The orbital mass was a well-defined, lobulated, intraosseous soft tissue lesion with circumscribed margins. Clinically, there was noted proptosis, tenderness to palpation, and slight limitation to right abduction. An orbitotomy with incisional biopsy revealed a lesion arising within the lateral orbital rim extending to the subperiosteal space. Intraoperative frozen sections indicated a low grade sarcoma, possibly metastatic. The extraosseous component was excised, and the bone was curetted until all visible tumor was removed. A diagnosis of chondromyxoid fibroma was made. The patient did well until 5 months postoperatively, when right-sided proptosis returned due to recurrent tumor. Repeat surgical resection with removal of the lateral orbital rim was performed. Histopathology was consistent with recurrent chondromyxoid fibroma.
