Endomyocardial disease is a restrictive cardiomyopathy that includes LÃ¶ffler endocarditis, which is characterized by hypereosinophilia, and endomyocardial fibrosis, which is not. Echocardiography enables cardiac function and anatomy to be assessed and the differential diagnosis of other causes of restrictive disease, but magnetic resonance imaging provides information about the tissue itself. Furthermore, paramagnetic contrast agents are useful in detecting myocardial abnormalities. We report three cases of endomyocardial disease and the typical findings of magnetic resonance imaging.
