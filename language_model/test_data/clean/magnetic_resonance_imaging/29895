This study describes the MR imaging appearances of the supporting ligaments of the thumb carpometacarpal joint in asymptomatic volunteers and in a group of patients following joint injury. Fourteen patients with 11 acute and three chronic injuries underwent MR imaging. The anterior oblique ligament was the most commonly injured ligament, usually on the metacarpal side where it was disrupted, or allowed dislocation because of subperiosted stripping from the base of the thumb metacarpal. The dorsal radial ligament was occasionally avulsed or partially torn from the trapezoid. Following chronic injury, MR imaging can evaluate ligamentous laxity, ganglion cyst formation or osteoarthritis. Accurate evaluation of ligament injury may identify patients who would benefit from surgery.
