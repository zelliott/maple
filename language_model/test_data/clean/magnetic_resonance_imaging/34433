Cervical and endometrial carcinomas are the most frequent cancers of the female genital tract. Accurate staging of these diseases is crucial in determining the prognosis and the mode of treatment. Clinical evaluation is often inaccurate. Magnetic resonance (MR) using conventional SE sequences (T2 and contrast-enhanced T1 weighted imaging) has become the imaging technique of choice for pretreatment staging of such cancers. Transvaginal and transrectal sonography with Doppler are of limited value. Helicoidal scanner has to be evaluated especially for endometrial carcinomas.
