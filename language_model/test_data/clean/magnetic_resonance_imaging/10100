We describe two patients complaining of vertigo associated with a small supra-tentorial convexity meningioma. Symptoms disappeared after tumor removal, providing evidence for an association between the vertigo and the cerebral cortical lesions. Tumors were located in the central and parietal areas, respectively, which are probably analogous to the vestibular cortex in the areas designated 3av, 2v, and 7 in animal studies.
