To compare the long-term outcome after uterine artery embolization (UAE) versus magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MR-g HIFU) for symptomatic uterine fibroids.

Seventy-seven women (median age, 39.3 years; range, 29.2-52.2 years) with symptomatic uterine fibroids, equally eligible for UAE and MR-g HIFU based on our exclusion criteria underwent treatment (UAE, N = 41; MR-g HIFU, N = 36) from 2002 to 2009 at our institution. Symptom severity (SS) and total health-related quality of life (Total HRQoL) scores were assessed by the uterine fibroid symptom and quality of life (UFS-QoL) questionnaire before treatment and at long-term follow-up after UAE (median 61.9 months) and after MR-g HIFU (median: 60.7 months). Re-intervention rates were assessed for each therapy and compared.

Re-intervention was significantly lower after UAE (12.2%) than after MR-g HIFU (66.7%) at long-term follow-up (p<0.001). After UAE changes in SS (50 pre-treatment vs. 6.3 post-treatment) and Total HRQoL (57.8 pre-treatment vs. 100 post-treatment) were significantly better than changes in SS (42.2 pre-treatment vs. 26.6 post-treatment) and Total HRQoL score (66.4 pre-treatment vs. 87.9 post-treatment) after MR-g HIFU (p = 0.019 and 0.049 respectively).

Improvement of SS and Total HRQoL scores was significantly better after UAE resulting in a significant lower re-intervention rate compared to MR-g HIFU.
