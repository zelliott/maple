The value of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the examination of the function of transplanted kidneys was examined. Dynamic MRI was performed on 14 renal transplant patients. After the injection of Gd-DTPA (dimeglumine gadopentetate), we used small tip angle gradient echo (STAGE) technique with a flip angle of 20 degrees. The cortex was higher in signal intensity of well functioning grafts than the medulla before the injection in Gd-DTPA. Signal intensity of the cortex decreased after 30 seconds. After 1 minute the signal intensity of the cortex recovered and low intensity band meaning passage of Gd-DTPA at corticomedullary differentiation was displayed. Signal intensity of the medulla decreased after 3 minutes. Signal intensity of the parenchyma of transplanted kidney after 5 minutes was much the same as that before injection. Image of poor functioning grafts displayed unclear figures. Time-intensity values of both cortex and medulla in well functioning grafts decreased rapidly after about 2 minutes, and rose thereafter. Time-intensity curves of both cortex and medulla were almost flat on and after 5 minutes. Time-intensity curves of both cortex and medulla in poor functioning grafts were almost flat through out the examination. We concluded that effective parameters of the graft function for the time-intensity curve were delta I1 and delta I2. Dynamic MRI was suggested to be useful in the evaluation of kidney graft function.
