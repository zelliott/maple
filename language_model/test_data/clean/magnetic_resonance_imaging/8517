The aims of this study are to document the occurrence of a cavernous hemangioma of the tympanic membrane (TM) and external auditory canal (EAC) that invaded the middle ear spaces and to review the relevant literature.

The clinical presentation, imaging studies, operative report, and histologic findings of this new case of cavernous hemangioma are reviewed.

A cavernous hemangioma of the TM and EAC involving the middle ear spaces was surgically excised without complications. The pulsatile tinnitus, which affected our patient at the same ear where the lesion was situated, disappeared after surgery. Our case represents the first documented cavernous hemangioma of the TM and EAC that invaded the middle ear spaces and the eighth case of cavernous hemangioma of the EAC/TM. Computed tomography is the method of choice in evaluating this lesion.

Hemangiomas of the EAC and/or TM are extremely rare entities amenable to surgical excision. With magnetic resonance imaging, there is difficulty in defining the exact location of the tumor and degree of soft tissue involvement.
