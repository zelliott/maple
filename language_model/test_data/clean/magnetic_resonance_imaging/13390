The authors report 16 cases of lumbosacral lipoma in children studied by MRI. The exact position of the cord and its relationship to the lipoma were well demonstrated in all cases but one. There was as high incidence (25%) of syringomyelia in the terminal conus. Arnold Chiari malformation was never associated, which differentiates lumbosacral lipomas from myelomeningoceles. However, the nerve roots and their relationship to the lipoma were rarely visualized. Despite these drawbacks, MRI is the examination of choice if lumbosacral lipoma is suspected in children.
