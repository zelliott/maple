We used a neuromelanin-magnetic resonance imaging technique to investigate abnormalities in the locus ceruleus in depression. We examined 20 patients with major depression and 43 age-matched controls using a 3 T scanner with a neuromelanin-sensitive sequence. The signal intensities of the areas corresponding to the rostral, middle, and caudal portions of the locus ceruleus were measured, and the contrast ratio relative to the adjacent pontine tegmentum was calculated. In controls, the contrast ratio in the middle portion was higher than in the rostral and caudal areas. In patients, contrast ratios in the rostral and middle portions were significantly decreased in comparison with controls, suggesting dysfunction of the ascending noradrenergic system. Neuromelanin-magnetic resonance imaging can be used to visualize abnormalities in the locus ceruleus of depressive patients.
