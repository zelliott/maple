In myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2/PROMM), cardiac muscle involvement is usually more benign than in DM1, but clinically severe cardiomyopathy has been reported in some patients. Using a novel method of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), we examined the left ventricular myocardium and the left gastrocnemius muscle in 11 unselected DM2/PROMM patients without overt cardiac disease. Data on cardiac morphology and function were obtained by gradient echo two-dimensional cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); no significant differences were found between DM2 patients and healthy controls, but using a median split approach older patients showed mildly increased left ventricular (LV) volumes, i.e., 59% increase of end-systolic volume index (ESVI) and 35% increase of end-diastolic volume index (EDVI), and an increase of LV mass (26%). On cardiac MRS, DM2/PROMM patients showed a reduction of phosphocreatine (PCr) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by 25 and 20% compared to matched healthy controls. No significant differences were found between younger and older patients. In skeletal muscle of the DM2 patients, no significant decrease of PCr and ATP concentrations was found. However, in older patients, who commonly show overt hip flexor muscle weakness, we observed reduced values for PCr and ATP. Our MRS and MRI findings reveal evidence for subclinical cardiomyopathy in DM2/PROMM patients without overt heart disease. Future prospective studies are needed to clarify the risk of developing overt cardiac disease in DM2 and to define prognostic factors.
