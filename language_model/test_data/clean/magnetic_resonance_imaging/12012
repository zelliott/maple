Solitary fibrous tumor or pleural fibroma is a rare tumor. It grows slowly and has a good prognosis after surgical resection. Pleural features, staging and even the fibrous nature are analysed by radiological findings. Ultrasonic diagnosis, CT-Scan and MR Imaging are very useful but non specific: the differential diagnosis between benign and malignant tissue is still based on histological study of the whole surgical specimen.
