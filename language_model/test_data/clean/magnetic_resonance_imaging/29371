Patients with acute brain pathology requiring ferromagnetic bio-medical implants for on-going invasive monitoring are largely excluded from the benefits of MRI scanning. We evaluated the behaviour of a thermal diffusion cortical blood flow (TD-CBF) sensor both in vitro (phantom gelatin model) and in vivo environments in a high field strength MRI system. Two baboons underwent cranial subdural implantation of 2 TD-CBF sensors/hemisphere and a single left parietal sensor was implanted subcortically to determine any deleterious effects. Using standard MRI sequences, artefact size, thermal effects, current generation, movement and reliability of recordings were assessed during scanning. The deflection forces were negligible, no observable thermal effects were demonstrated, while wide fluctuations in cerebral blood flow recordings were recorded. Mean image artefact size for implanted sensors was 6 times larger than in vitro. Patients with an implanted TD-CBF sensor may be safely imaged provided the device is disconnected. The MRI images obtained are of an acceptable quality.
