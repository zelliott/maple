Hematospermia is an anxiety provoking but otherwise generally benign and self-limited condition that is infrequently associated with significant underlying pathology, and is most often considered to be idiopathic in nature. Management with routine clinical evaluation, watchful waiting, and reassurance generally suffice without further diagnostic workup or treatment. Noninvasive imaging may play an important role in the diagnostic workup of men with hematospermia, particularly in those who are >40 years old, have other associated symptoms or signs of disease, or have persistence of hematospermia. Many entities may be encountered in association with hematospermia at imaging, and specific therapeutic interventions may be used if certain treatable underlying pathologies are coincidentally detected. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the potential etiologies, diagnostic workup, imaging techniques, relevant male pelvic anatomy, imaging appearance of specific associated pathologies, and treatment for hematospermia.
