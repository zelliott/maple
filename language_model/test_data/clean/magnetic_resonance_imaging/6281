In bacterial infection of the spine the intervertebral disc and its adjoining vertebral bodies are usually involved in continuity with narrowing of the disc and indistinct irregular vertebral end plates. We report a case in which the MR imaging examination demonstrated intact vertebral end plates, although the adjacent vertebral bodies and disc were involved with anaerobic streptococcus infection extensive enough to cause paravertebral inflammatory masses. Thus, intact vertebral end plates do not exclude vertebral osteomyelitis in favor of metastatic disease on MR imaging studies.
