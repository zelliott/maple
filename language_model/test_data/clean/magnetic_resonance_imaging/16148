A 55-year-old man evaluated for syncope had mild and gradually progressive left ventricular systolic dysfunction on initial workup. Although not identified initially, repeat cardiac magnetic resonance one year later demonstrated the presence of trabeculations in the left ventricle consistent with the diagnosis of isolated non-compaction of the left ventricular myocardium. This case highlights the need for increased awareness of this entity among primary care physicians, cardiologists, and radiologists in order to enhance its identification. This case also demonstrates the advantages of cardiac magnetic resonance for diagnosis and provides insight into this rare type of cardiomyopathy in adults.
