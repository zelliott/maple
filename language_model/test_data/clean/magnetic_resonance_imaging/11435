We present the clinical, neurophysiological and radiographic findings in a boy with coexisting multiple pterygium syndrome, bilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia (BPNH), mental retardation and epileptic seizures. This constellation has not been previously reported. We discuss the possibility of a new BPNH syndrome associated with multiple pterygium syndrome in our patient.
