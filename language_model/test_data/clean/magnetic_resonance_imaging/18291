Preretinal neovascularization is a well-described feature of advanced diabetic retinopathy. In this study, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine blood-retinal barrier breakdown associated with preretinal neovascularization in three subjects with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Using a standard imaging protocol, a varying degree of vitreous enhancement was observed in these eyes. The location and severity of enhancement, judged by visual inspection of the images, corresponded to the fluorescein angiographic and/or clinical appearance of preretinal neovascularization. This result suggests that contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging may prove a reasonable approach to the identification of preretinal neovascularization in eyes with significant media opacities.
