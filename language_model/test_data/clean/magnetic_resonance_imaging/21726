With the use of MRI, 20 pathologically proved cases of mediastinal tumor were analysed, of which 13 cases were also studied with CT. Compared with CT, the three-dimensional morphological study of the lesions by MRI provided better evaluation of their location and of their characteristics. The abnormal signals on T1WI, PDWI and T2WI images, particularly of lipoma, fluid-contained cyst, lymphoma and cystic teratoma, were highly accurate in diagnosing mediastinal tumors; in addition, MRI was ideal for demonstrating the tumor capsule in neurogenic tumor or fibrous septa within the lipoma. Specific MRI findings facilitate the diagnosis of an aneurysm. Finally, the limitations of MRI were also discussed.
