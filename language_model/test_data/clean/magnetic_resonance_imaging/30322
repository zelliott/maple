The assessment of three-dimensional (3-D) mitral valve geometry in patients with chronic functional ischemic mitral valve regurgitation (FIMR) has been hampered by a lack of adequate imaging techniques. The study aim was to use a clinically applicable cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique to assess the 3-D mitral annular, leaflet and papillary muscle geometry in pigs with chronic FIMR.

Ten pigs with moderate chronic FIMR induced by catheter-based coiling of the circumflex artery, were examined using cardiac MRI. The reconstruction of 3-D data from two-dimensional cardiac MRI scans allowed the mitral annulus and leaflet geometries to be assessed. Using 3-D morphology scans, the spatial position of the posterior papillary muscle (PPM) relative to the anterior papillary muscle (APM), mitral annulus and anterior (A-trig) and posterior (P-trig) trigones was assessed. Using dedicated software for image analysis, data were transferred to a Cartesian coordinate system (x,y,z) for geometric analysis. Ten healthy pigs served as controls.

Compared to controls, at end-systole in the chronic FIMR group the PPM was significantly displaced (p <0.05) from the APM (38 +/- 2 versus 23 +/- 1 mm), A-trig (48 +/- 2 versus 36 +/- 1 mm) and P-trig (41 +/-1 versus 33 +/- 1 mm). There was no significant apical PPM displacement (20 +/- 2 versus 20 +/- 1 mm). The annular area (1,240 +/- 90 versus 850 +/- 90 mm2), septolateral distance (36 +/- 2 versus 26 +/- 1 mm), commissure-to-commissure distance (38 +/- 2 versus 33 +/- 1 mm), mean tenting height (8 +/- 1 versus 5 +/- 0 mm), maximum tenting height (10 +/- 1 versus 7 +/- 0 mm), tenting volume (2,600 +/- 400 versus 1,500 +/- 200 mm3), and occlusional leaflet area (1,820 +/- 110 versus 1,120 +/- 70 mm2) were each significantly increased.

This clinically applicable cardiac MRI modality permitted a detailed geometric insight to be made into the mitral annular, leaflet and PPM geometries that cause FIMR. Such a reliable tool for geometric mitral valve analysis has previously been demonstrated only by using invasive techniques. Hence, this approach holds promise for further clarifying the pathogenesis of chronic FIMR and improving preoperative surgical planning.
