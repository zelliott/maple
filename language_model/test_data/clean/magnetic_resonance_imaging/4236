Corpora amylacea have been reported in around 60% of hippocampal sclerosis specimens. The aim was to determine whether there are clinical and quantitative hippocampal MRI differences between hippocampal sclerosis with and without corpora amylacea. Corpora amylacea density was determined in 46 resected hippocampi of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, using a three dimensional microscopical counting technique. Forty one hippocampi had hippocampal sclerosis. Twenty six of the 41 (63%) hippocampal sclerosis specimens contained corpora amylacea, which were found in highest numbers in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus. Corpora amylacea density in the CA1 correlated inversely with the neuronal density in CA1. Hippocampal sclerosis with corpora amylacea had the same clinical and quantitative hippocampal MRI characteristics as hippocampal sclerosis without corpora amylacea, and did not affect seizure outcome after surgery adversely. In conclusion, formation of corpora amylacea seems to be a pathological response to neuronal cell loss in most hippocampal sclerosis specimens, with no clear clinical and quantitative hippocampal MRI correlates.
