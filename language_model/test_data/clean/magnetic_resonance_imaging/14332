The clinical, radiologic and pathologic features of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx are reported in a 16-year-old girl. In particular, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are correlated with histopathological findings. It was found that the combined use of CT and MRI enabled an accurate identification of laryngeal tissue components and a precise delineation of extent of cancer spread. This diagnostic approach is emphasized as well as the need to suspect carcinoma of the larynx in any child unrelenting or recurring hoarseness.
