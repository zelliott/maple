There is clinical and experimental evidence involving the insula in the control of the autonomic system and cardiac function, with differential participation of right and left brain hemispheres, and these differences could influence mortality in the acute phase of brain hemisphere ischemic infarcts.

We have analyzed retrospectively the mortality during initial hospitalization in a series of 504 consecutive, unselected patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemic infarcts to detect potential differences between right (220 patients) and left (284 patients) lesions.

Factors associated with a higher mortality were the infarct size, the occurrence of nosocomial respiratory infection, age and a history of diabetes mellitus or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The laterality of the infarct did not have a significant influence on stroke mortality during the admission period for the acute stage.
