Microsurgical resection, stereotactic aspiration and VP shunt have for years been the choice options for the treatment of colloid cysts of the third ventricle. Recently, endoscopic approaches have aroused increasing interest and gained acceptance. Although safer, this minimally invasive approach is considered less efficacious than microsurgery. Relatively long-term results are now available and some conclusions might be inferred on the usefulness of this procedure.

Between 1994 and 2005, 61 patients harbouring a colloid cyst of the third ventricle were treated with neuroendoscopic technique in 11 Italian neurosurgical centres. Cyst diameters ranged from 6 to 32 mm. A flexible endoscope was used in 34 cases, a rigid one in 21, both instruments in six. The technique consisted in cyst fenestrations, colloid aspiration, coagulation of the internal cyst wall and, occasionally, capsule excision. Mean postoperative hospital stay was 6.7 days. Early postoperative neuroimaging revealed a cyst residue in 36 cases (mean diameter 4.3 mm). There were two complications (3.2%). Follow-up varied between 1 and 132 months (mean 32 months, more than 5 years in 17 patients). There were seven asymptomatic recurrences, three of them evolving from a previous residue.

The endoscopic approach to the treatment of colloid cysts is safe, effective and well accepted by patients. Although asymptomatic, recurrences (11.4%) cast a persisting shadow on the long-term results, and, therefore, the controversy with the traditional microsurgical treatment remains open.
