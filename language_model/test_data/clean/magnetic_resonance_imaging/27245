The specificity of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) is determined spatially by the vascular architecture and temporally by the evolution of hemodynamic changes. The stimulus duration has additional influence on the spatiotemporal evolution of the HRF, as brief stimuli elicit responses that engage only the local vasculature, whereas long stimuli lead to the involvement of remote vascular supply and drainage. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebral blood volume (CBV) HRF to ultrashort forelimb stimulation in an anesthetized rodent model. The HRFs to a single 333-μs-long stimulus were robustly detected and consisted of a rapid response in both CBF and CBV, with an onset time (OT) of 350 ms and a full width at half-maximum of 1 s. In contrast, longer stimuli elicited a dispersive transit of oxygenated blood across the cortical microvasculature that significantly prolonged the evolution of the CBV HRF, but not the CBF. The CBF and CBV OTs suggest that vasoactive messengers are synthesized, released, and effective within 350 ms. However, the difference between the BOLD and CBV OT (∼100 ms) was significantly smaller than the arteriolar-venular transit time (∼500 ms), indicating an arterial contribution to the BOLD HRF. Finally, the rapid rate of growth of the active region with stimulus elongation suggests that functional hyperemia is an integrative process that involves the entire functional cortical depth. These findings offer a new view into the spatiotemporal dynamics of functional hemodynamic regulation in the brain.
