To compare the sensitivity of conventional spin-echo, fast spin-echo, fast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and turbo gradient spin-echo MR sequences in the detection of multiple sclerosis lesions.

Conventional spin-echo, fast spin-echo, fast FLAIR, and turbo gradient spin-echo sequences were performed on a 1.0-T MR imager in seven patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis. The images in each sequence were evaluated by two raters and consensus was reached by agreement.

In comparing conventional spin-echo with fast spin-echo sequences, five lesions were seen only by conventional spin-echo and 63 were seen only by fast spin-echo; in comparing conventional spin-echo with fast FLAIR sequences, 18 lesions were seen only by conventional spin-echo and 109 only by fast FLAIR; in comparing conventional spin-echo with turbo gradient spin-echo sequences, 51 lesions were seen only by conventional spin-echo and seven only by turbo gradient spin-echo; in comparing fast spin-echo with fast FLAIR sequences, 45 lesions were seen only by fast spin-echo and 52 only by fast FLAIR.

Fast spin-echo and fast FLAIR sequences improve the sensitivity of MR imaging in the detection of multiple sclerosis lesions with reduced acquisition time as compared with conventional spin-echo sequences. These sequences should therefore be considered for serial studies in patients with multiple sclerosis. The sensitivity of turbo gradient spin-echo was inferior to the other sequences, but its reduced acquisition time could make this technique the ideal choice for patients who cannot tolerate longer examination times.
