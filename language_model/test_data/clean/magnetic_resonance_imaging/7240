Chondrosarcomas of the jaws and facial region are very rare tumors when compared with other bony tumors. It may show growth for several months or it may present as a rapidly growing tumor causing facial deformity, nasal obstruction, epistaxis, visual disturbances and teeth dislocation. Tumor radiologic evaluation must be done very carefully with conventional techniques, CT or M.R. Treatment must be surgical with wide an block excision. Treated patients should have a long-term follow up, because may recur, even after years.
