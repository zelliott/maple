To study the sensitivity and specificity of two-dimensional echocardiography in the diagnosis of left ventricle thrombosis which often attends myocardial infarction and to define diagnostic potentialities of the new research methods (digital subtraction ventriculography and MR tomography), 449 patients with acute transmural myocardial infarction were examined. Based on the comparison of the echocardiographic readings and morbid anatomy data it has been shown that the sensitivity of two-dimensional echocardiography in revealing left ventricle thrombosis amounts to 89%, specificity to 88%. Digital subtraction ventriculography has a lower (77%) sensitivity, with the specificity being satisfactory enough (88%). Meanwhile MR tomography enables a highly precise diagnosis of left ventricle thrombosis and can be used as a supplementary diagnostic method in questionable cases and in thrombi small in size or in unsatisfactory ultrasonic visualization of the heart structures.
