Mutagenic and co-mutagenic effects of static, pulsed bipolar gradient, and high-frequency magnetic fields, as well as combinations of them, were examined using the Ames test. The Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium bacteria, wild-type strain RTA, preincubation assay, without metabolic activation, was performed. All combinations of magnetic fields were tested with and without co-exposure to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and benzo[a]pyrene-4,5-oxide, ethylene oxide, carboplatin, or cisplatin. As expected, chemical mutagens caused a clear-cut increase of the revertants in the Ames test. However, neither the static fields nor a combination of a static magnetic field with the time-varying bipolar gradient field or a pulsed high-frequency magnetic field caused an alteration in the number of revertants in the Ames test. No co-mutagenic effect of any magnetic field combination was observed. In conclusion, magnetic fields used during clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were neither mutagenic nor co-mutagenic.
