A case of rapidly destructive disk degeneration in which imaging studies were performed over a two-year period is reported. Rapidly destructive disk degeneration is a clinicopathological entity recently redefined by Revel et al.. It is analogous to conditions characterized by peripheral chondrolysis, such as rapidly destructive hip osteoarthritis. Its pathogenesis remains obscure.
