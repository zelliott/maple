A study conducted by researchers at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center showed that using a cardiac MRI in the ED's observation unit enabled providers to manage most patients without admitting them, resulting in lower cost at the hospital of about $588 per patient. It also allowed diagnosis and prevention of all cardiac events that might have occurred within 30 days of the visit. Cardiac MRI can reveal edema, allow a view of wall motion, allow profusion testing at rest and during stress, and offer delayed enhancement looks at areas of cardiac scarring or recent infarction. Placing moderate and high-risk patients in the observation unit frees up beds in the ED. Cardiac MRI allows the opportunity to bill for observation care, which is higher in terms of professional fees.
