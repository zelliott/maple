During an epidemic of influenza A infection in Japan, a 7-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital because of high fever, convulsions, coma, and liver dysfunction on the 2nd day of a cold-like illness. His serum CPK was markedly elevated, but there was no hyperammonaemia or hypoglycaemia. His CSF showed an increased protein level, but the cell count and glucose level were normal. CT and MRI of the brain showed symmetrical thalamic lesions, and he was diagnosed with acute necrotizing encephalopathy in childhood. He had a significant increased in antibodies to influenza A H1N1 in serum and CSF, but the CSF was negative for influenza virus using virus isolation and a polymerase chain reaction assay.

Antibody production without detectable levels of influenza virus in cerebrospinal fluid suggests that virus infection occurred, but the virus did not replicate in sufficient numbers in his central nervous system. The thalamic lesion, the hallmark of acute necrotizing encephalopathy in childhood, may be initiated by a local virus infection and develop with subsequent local changes such as breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and the extravasation of blood.
