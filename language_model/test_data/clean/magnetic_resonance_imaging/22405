Vascular malformations are common lesions accounting for approximately 7% of all benign tumours, the majority of which develop in the head and neck region. Generally, vascular malformations such as lymphangiomas, haemangiomas, and arteriovenous communications in the head and the neck represent only an aesthetic problem. However, when localized in the tongue, these lesions can create clinical problems consisting, in the majority of cases, in spontaneous haemorrhage from the mouth. Although uncommon, progressive asymmetric growth of the tongue (macroglossia) can be also observed. Three consecutive cases of vascular malformations of the tongue have been studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Neither contrast medium administration nor angio-MR technique was used. In our experience, MR appears to be the ideal technique to define the site, extension and origin of vascular malformations, due to its ability to depict the typical signal flow voids in the lesions and to differentiate slow-flow lesions from high-flow ones.
