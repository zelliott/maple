To establish a protocol for image-guided minimally invasive surgical access to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).

This study involved 2 patients with TMJ pain and mandibular motion dysfunction. Axial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the TMJ was obtained and loaded into an intra-operative navigation system to guide joint space injection. With a navigated syringe, 1 mL synvisc Hylan G-F 20 was directly injected into the superior and inferior joint spaces under navigation guidance.

With the assistance of an intraoperative navigational system, the TMJ MRI images were visualized in 3 dimensions and enabled guiding a needle into the superior and inferior joint spaces for therapeutic injection. The treatment outcome for both patients was satisfactory with improvement in pain score and mandibular motion.

A protocol for image-guided minimally invasive surgical access to the TMJ was established. This could provide the technical basis for evaluation of accurate joint space intervention as a form of treatment of appropriate TMJ disorders.
