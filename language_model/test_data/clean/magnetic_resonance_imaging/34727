Mycotic aneurysms of the abdominal aorta are potentially fatal but uncommon. We report the MRI and MRA features of an abdominal aortic mycotic aneurysm in a patient who presented with nonspecific low back pain. By delineating the saccular nature of the aneurysm and identifying the coexistence of vertebral enhancement, MRI was crucial for the final diagnosis. A potential pitfall of contrast-enhanced MRA is also demonstrated.
