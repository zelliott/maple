The spontaneous rupture of a craniopharyngioma is an extremely rare condition confined to adults. This is the first report of a patient younger than 10 years who experienced spontaneous reduction (possibly rupture) of a craniopharyngioma.

An 8-year-old female patient with a recurrence of a craniopharyngioma experienced fever, headache, and visual disturbance that lasted a few days. Concurrent with the improvement of these symptoms, marked reduction in the size of the tumor was revealed using magnetic resonance imaging, suggesting the occurrence of a rupture.

Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging of the hypothalamic-pituitary region was performed while the patient received growth hormone therapy.

There was no increase in the size of the tumor 1 year after the reduction occurred. Prompt evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary region using magnetic resonance imaging is warranted to rule out the possibility of spontaneous reduction (including rupture) of the tumor in a situation in which the patient with a craniopharyngioma shows meningeal signs or a rapid change of neurological symptoms (such as headache, fever, or visual disturbance).
