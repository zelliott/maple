We report four patients with slowly progressive cervical myelopathy. The four patients had several features in common; 1) progressive cervical myelopathy with a duration of several months to years, 2) abnormal lesions in the cervical to upper thoracic cord levels with or without gadolinium enhancement, 3) anti-HTLV-I antibodies were positive both in serum and CSF, 4) high levels of HTLV-I proviral load in PBMC. The calculated risk of HAM/TSP in two patients showed a high value, comparable to those of HAM/TSP, and higher than those of healthy HTLV-I carrier. Because the clinical and laboratory findings of these four cases show similarities to those of HAM/TSP, we propose that these four cases may be a variant form of HAM/TSP.
