A 40-year-old woman from Ecuador diagnosed with a complex congenital heart disease was admitted complaining of fever chills, night sweats, and productive cough 6 months after surgical correction of the anomalies. An echocardiography showed vegetations located on the interatrial pericardium patch. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of postoperative infective endocarditis on this location.
