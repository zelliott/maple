Eight patients with acoustic tumor were studied with a superconductive MR imaging. T1-weighted images with Gd-DTPA most accurately showed the margin of the seventh and eighth nerves in the internal auditory canal and were most sensitive in detecting small tumors. T2-weighted images were inferior to T1-weighted images, that could fail to detect small tumors. High resolution, thin slice, MR imaging using surface coil is particularly useful for small acoustic tumor because of its higher specificity compared with air-CT, cisternography.
