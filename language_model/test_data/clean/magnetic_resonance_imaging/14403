Within the past two decades brain imaging techniques have given the clinician access to new anatomical and functional findings for dealing with affective disorder in the older age group. Despite the proliferation of such technology, the significance of findings on computerized axial tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) remains unclear in this patient group. The literature covering old age depression and imaging techniques is reviewed, and problems related to methodology, sample selection, and implications for the direction of future research are discussed. Current evidence particularly suggests that subcortical atrophy may be an important factor in the genesis of affective disorder in old age. The question of cognitive decline in the setting of affective disorder is examined. The use of brain imaging techniques may have particular bearing upon identification of etiology of affective disorder, prediction of treatment response, or risk of relapse.
