An enterogenous cyst of the craniocervical region producing anterior medullary compression is reported. The patient presented with quadriparesis with greater involvement of the upper limbs. Computed tomography showed a high attenuation intradural extramedullary mass located anteriorly. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a high intensity mass extending from the pontomedullary junction to the second cervical vertebra, flattening the medulla and upper cervical cord. Complete recovery ensued following total excision of the cyst.
