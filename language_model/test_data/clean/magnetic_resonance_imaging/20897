For the separate visualization of endolymph, perilymph, and bone on a single image after intravenous injection of single-dose gadodiamide, we fused gray-scale inverted positive endolymph (PEI) with native positive perilymph (PPI) images, that is, we subtracted PEI from PPI. Subtraction significantly improved the contrast noise ratio between endolymph and perilymph and the subjective visibility score for endolymphatic space. The 24 patients with the suspect of Ménière's disease were included.
