Hearing and/or balance disorders are symptoms that may be associated with tumors of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). Between March 1988 and May 1995, 22 patients had diagnosis or evaluation of CPA tumors at Cleveland Clinic Florida. The most common presenting signs or symptoms included unilateral low-frequency tinnitus, unsteadiness, and/or asymmetric hearing loss. On the basis of our experience, we have constructed an algorithm to help identify and manage acoustic nerve dysfunction. We compare our findings with national epidemiologic data and current medical reports.
