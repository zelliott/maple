The broad category of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma includes a large variety of different diseases including indolent as well as aggressive lymphomas. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma arises in the extranodal mucosal lymphoid tissue and has only been recognised as a distinct entity in recent years. It affects one or several extranodal structures such as the stomach, the lung, the eye and salivary glands. The lymphoma is generally of low grade and has indolent course. The aim of this article is to exemplify the most common radiological patterns of MALT lymphoma.
