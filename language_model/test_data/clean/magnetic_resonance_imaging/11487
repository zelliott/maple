Vertiginous syndrome appears in more then 100 diseases, therefore subject of intensive investigation. Insufficient research has been done on vertiginous syndrome in patients on chronic program of haemodialisis. The aim of this study is to search anatomical and structural changes on blood vessels of the brain by neuroimaging techniques, as well as increased circulatory resistance on TCD, in patients on chronic program of haemodialysis.

The research has been done on 30 patients with vertiginous syndrome, 22 males and 8 females, average age 45.9 years, average duration of haemodialysis 5.83 +/- 4.5. In all patients relevant diagnostic procedures had been done (EEG, TCD, audio vestibulogram, X-ray of cervical spine), and in 14 patients with increased circulatory resistance TCD we have done MRI and MRA of the brain. Pathological EEG has been found in 10%, 40% of the patients have had normal EEG finding, while 50% had slowing (non-specific disfunction) in EEG record.

MRI and MRA had been done in 14 patients of average age 51.21 +/- 10.82. In 13 patients we had a pathological finding of MRI and MRA, while in one patient only we had normal finding of MRA, and another one patient with normal MRI scan. In 64.2% of the sample we have had cortical cerebral atrophy, in 57.1% cortical atrophy of cerebellum, while in 35.8% apart from the mentioned changes atrophy of cerebellar vermis had been found. In 71.4% of all patients cerebrovascular disease (stroke) could be identified. Atherosclerosis changes in blood vessels of anterior or posterior circulatory segment were found in 78.5% of the patients, while spasm of arteries had been registered in 21.4% of the sample.

MRI and MRA of the brain brought light on aethiological aspect of vertigo in these patients. Results of our research indicate vascular aethiology of vertiginous syndrome in patients on chronic program of haemodialysis.
