In three patients with focal epilepsies, focal akinetic seizures that were characterized by ictal paresis of the contralateral arm during preserved consciousness were recorded with EEG and video. MRI and ictal/interictal EEG revealed a frontal or central focus in all patients. Focal akinetic seizures are probably due to epileptic activation of negative motor areas.
