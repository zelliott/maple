The objective of this study was to assess the value of adding MR arthrography to standard MRI for patients with chronic wrist disorders. Thirty consecutive patients (age range, 19-73 years; mean, 36.2 years) were included in the investigation. The images were evaluated blindly and separately by two radiologists with regard to lesions of the scapholunate (SL) and lunotriquetral (LT) ligaments and the triangular fibrocartilage (TFC). Conventional two- or three-compartment arthrography was used as the standard of reference. For TFC lesions, standard MR images had a sensitivity of 92.3% (reader 1) and 84.6% (reader 2) and a specificity of 41.2% (reader 1) and 52.9% (reader 2). For MR arthrography, sensitivity was 84.6% (reader 1) and 84.6% (reader 2) and specificity was 88.2% (reader 1) and 100% (reader 2). For SL ligament tears, standard MRI had a sensitivity of 33.3% (reader 1) and 11.1% (reader 2) and a specificity of 47.6% (reader 1) and 57.1% (reader 2). For MR arthrography, sensitivity was 66.7% (reader 1) and 55.6% (reader 2) and specificity was 52.4% (reader 1) and 81.0% (reader 2). For LT ligament tears, standard MRI had a sensitivity of 28.6% (reader 1) and 35.7% (reader 2) and a specificity of 93.8% (reader 1) and 81.3% (reader 2). For MR arthrography, sensitivity was 35.7% (reader 1) and 23.1% (reader 2) and specificity was 93.8% (reader 1) and 94.1% (reader 2). In conclusion, the diagnostic performance of MRI in suspected lesions of the TFC and the SL and LT ligaments is improved by adding MR arthrography to the standard examination.
