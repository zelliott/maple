We describe a 63-year-old woman with a diagnosis of breast cancer who relapsed with multiple bone lesions 18 years later. The biological characteristics were estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor positive, and HER2-positive cancer. Lapatinib and letrozole was the treatment of choice as a manageable and active first-line therapy for this patient.
