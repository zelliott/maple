The purpose of this article is to review the biological classification system of vascular anomalies and present a comprehensive treatment approach to hemangiomas.

An extensive literature review was performed for the classification of vascular anomalies. Emphasis was placed on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of hemangiomas, including the authors' preferred algorithm.

The authors' comprehensive management of vascular anomalies as described in this article has resulted in high patient satisfaction and an excellent outcome in a majority of patients.

The authors believe that knowledge of proper classification is not just their personal preference but a functional necessity to aid in the treatment of these complex and large lesions. Proper use of the biological classification is inherent to understanding and treating these common vascular lesions optimally.
