Most injuries to the femoral nerve are iatrogenic in origin and occur during resection of large retroperitoneal tumours. When the defect is considerable a nerve graft is mandatory to avoid tension across the suture line. We describe two cases of iatrogenic femoral nerve injury which recovered well after reconstruction with long sural nerve grafts. The probable reasons for success were that we performed the grafting soon after the injury, the patients were not too old, the nerve repairs were reinforced with fibrin glue and electrical stimulation of the quadriceps was administered to prevent muscle atrophy. Good functional results may be obtained if these conditions are satisfied even if the length of a nerve graft is more than 10 cm.
