The aim of this study is to present our experience in treating paediatric sinonasal and skull base malignancies with exclusively endonasal endoscopic approach and measure its feasibility.

This study is a retrospective review of seven patients under age of 19 years who have sinonasal and skull base malignancies and treated with endoscopic endonasal approach. The main outcome measures are the surgical resection, complications, survival rate, recurrence and gross facial growth.

Radical tumour resection was achieved in all cases with negative margins; no major complications were observed. Mean follow-up was 65 months and no evidence of recurrences. Facial growth assessment showed no gross changes.

In selected cases, endoscopic endonasal approach of paediatric sinonasal and skull base malignancies could be an alternative approach. Despite of our few cases, it showed a feasibility of this technique with satisfactory oncological control. A further collaborative study with larger number is needed to have more valid conclusion.
