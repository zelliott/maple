Long term clinical and hemodynamic benefits of dynamic cardiomyoplasty (DC) have been reported. However, no information is available about long-term morphological changes in the wrapped latissimus dorsi (LD) muscle in humans.

The latissimus dorsi muscle flap was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 5 patients submitted to DC for treatment of severe dilated cardiomyopathy. All patients were studied from 24 to 52 months after the surgical procedure at the time of the cardiomyostimulator replacement. In the interim, LD was stimulated with burst of 6 pulses (burst duration 185 msec, burst freq 30Hz) synchronized to every cardiac contraction with a maximum of 100 LD contractions/min. Images were acquired on a GE Sigma 1.5 T system (TE = 25ms, TR = R- Rx2, slice thickness 8mm).

The thickness of was 7.6 +/- 0.8mm. In addition, the signal intensity of the LD was compared with that of thoracic skeletal muscle and was found to be increased (2.19 +/- 0.42). The signal intensity was similar to that of subcutaneous fat in those images.

Morphologic changes in the wrapped LD muscle consistent with fatty degeneration occur after DC and can be detected by MRI. Further studies will be necessary to demonstrate the clinical significance of such LD muscle flap changes.
