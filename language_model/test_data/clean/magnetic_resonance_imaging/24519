Ewing sarcoma is a primary bone tumor that rarely occurs in the hand. We present a case involving the thumb metacarpal with long-term follow-up. Carpometacarpal and metacarpophalangeal arthrodeses with autograft are relatively simple procedures that stabilized the thumb and preserved satisfactory function.
