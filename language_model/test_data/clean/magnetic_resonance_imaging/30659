A 73-year-old man with a history of malignant orbital melanoma and prostate carcinoma was admitted for progressive visual disturbance. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a suprasellar enhancing nodular lesion with major impingement on the anterior optical ways and sellar invasion. The extensive imaging work-up could not demonstrate with certainty its origin. Surprisingly, the transphenoidal biopsy of this patient revealed a prostate cancer metastasis outlining the importance of a histopathological diagnosis of cerebral metastases in patients with multiple malignancies when there is a doubt about the nature of the lesion.
