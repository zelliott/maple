A 28-year-old woman suffered from frequent headaches. She had a history of a dilatation and curettage for hydatidiform moles. This admission showed markedly elevated levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and lactate dehydrogenase. Brain MRI showed a hemorrhagic mass in the left temporal area, with rapid growth. Histology of tumors obtained from multiple areas including retroperitoneum was consistent with choriocarcinoma.
