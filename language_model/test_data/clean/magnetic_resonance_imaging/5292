It is well known that carotid body tumors (CBTs) are rare and almost nonfunctional, and that functional CBTs are even less frequently seen, with or without catecholamine-induced symptoms. Objective of this study is to make comparison between the treatment effects on functional and nonfunctional CBTs.

The medical records of 46 patients (16 men and 30 women) of our unit who underwent surgical intervention for CBTs were retrospectively reviewed from January 2005 to July 2010. Patients were divided into two groups by function: group A (n = 5, functional CBTs) and group B (n = 41, nonfunctional CBTs). Perioperative and postoperative details were compared accordingly.

All the patients successfully underwent tumor resection. Although symptoms were nonspecific, intraoperative hypertension (5/5, 100%) and persistent postoperative hypotension (3/5, 60%) were found in group A. No statistical difference was found in perioperative details and complications between two groups. No recurrence occurred in two groups during the follow-up period for a mean of 35.3 months (with a range of 12-60 months).

Surgical resection is safe and effective even if the CBT is functional. Besides routine preparation, preoperative measurement of serum catecholamine, treatment with α- and β-adrenergic blockade and gentle manipulation during operation are necessary.
