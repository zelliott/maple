One hundred sixty-six patients presented to a cancer center with malignant spinal cord compression (SCC) proven by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The majority of patients (92%) were treated with radiotherapy. Changes in functional capability over time were assessed using performance (PS) and neurological status (NS). Over the course of treatment, there was no significant change in PS or NS. The median survival from confirmation of SCC was 82 days (range 1-1349 days). Survival was significantly better for those presenting with good functional status. One hundred thirteen patients (68%) were discharged from hospital; 88 (78%) were discharged home, 11% were sent to another hospital, 4% were transferred to a rehabilitation unit, and 5% went to a hospice. Fifty-three patients (32%) died before discharge. The confirmation that PS and NS have prognostic significance in the functional outcome of patients with SCC may prove helpful in decisions regarding care planning for individual patients with SCC who are discharged from hospital.
