Paragangliomas, also known as glomus tumors or chemodectomas, are tumors arising from chemoreceptor tissue (paraganglia), which are neural crest in origin and found in higher concentration along the glossopharyngeal and vagal cranial nerve. Three types of paragangliomas are related with the temporal bone: glomus tympanicum, glomus jugulare, and glomus vagale. The role of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in diagnosing these types of tumors is discussed, along with the importance of arteriography in aiding the diagnosis and treatment. This article discusses the choice between CT and MR based on clinical symptoms and tumor location, and illustrates the newest CT, MR, and angiography applications. A brief discussion on treatment options is given.
