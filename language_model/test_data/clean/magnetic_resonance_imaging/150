Cervical ectopic thymus presenting as a neck mass is rare in a neonate. Just more than 100 cases have been reported in the literature with less than 10% occurring in infants. We report a case of solid cervical ectopic thymus in an asymptomatic 2-month-old boy. We review the literature and discuss the embryology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of an infantile ectopic thymus.
