A case of an 11-year-old boy with rapidly progressing quadriparesis with bowel and bladder incontinence is reported. MRI of the spine revealed an intramedullary tuberculoma at the level of C5-7. Investigations further revealed evidence of tuberculosis in the brain and lungs as well. The child made a rapid recovery with medical management alone.
