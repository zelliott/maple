To clarify immunological disturbances in the central nervous system (CNS) in multiple sclerosis (MS) by linking to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, 22 patients with relapsing remitting MS were studied. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were analyzed during a total of 27 independent MS stages (20 active, 7 inactive) on 25 occasions during which gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced MRI scans were performed. The number of Gd-enhanced lesions was significantly correlated with CSF cell counts, as well as the number of CD4(+)CD29(+) helper inducer and IL-2 receptor (CD25)-positive activated helper T cells. In contrast, T(2) lesion load in the brain showed a trend of association with elevated IgG index.
