We describe a 58-year-old asymptomatic woman with subtotal developmental absence of the cerebellum. MRI evaluation showed minute remnants of cerebellar tissue corresponding to the anterior quadrangular lobules. These findings identified the anomaly as subtotal cerebellar agenesis, and excluded other diagnostic possibilities.
