A case of magnetic resonance imaging of adrenocortical carcinoma extending into the inferior vena cava is presented. Magnetic resonance was able to outline the intraluminal extent of tumor thrombus accurately. Signal intensity ratios (mean 0.98 +/- 0.02) of tumor thrombus/primary tumor on T1- and T2-weighted sequences were useful for tissue characterization of tumor thrombus. Time course of the signal intensity of thrombus before and after intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid was identical to the primary tumor which aided in differentiation from nontumor thrombus.
