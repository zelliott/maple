Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (ioMRI) provides immediate feedback and quality assurance enabling the neurosurgeon to improve the quality of a range of neurosurgical procedures. Implementation of ioMRI is a complex and costly process. We describe our preliminary 16 months experience with the integration of an IMRIS movable ceiling mounted high field (1.5 T) ioMRI setup with two operating rooms.

Aspects of implementation of our ioMRI and our initial 16 months of clinical experience in 180 consecutive patients were reviewed.

The installation of a ceiling mounted movable ioMRI between two operating rooms was completed in April 2008 at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis. Experience with 180 neurosurgical cases (M:F-100:80, age range 1-79 years, 71 gliomas, 57 pituitary adenomas, 9 metastases, 11 other tumor cases, 4 Chiari decompressions, 6 epilepsy resections and 22 other miscellaneous procedures) demonstrated that this device effectively provided high quality real-time intraoperative imaging. In 74 of all 180 cases (41%) and in 54% of glioma resections, the surgeon modified the procedure based upon the ioMRI. Ninety-three percent of ioMRI glioma cases achieved gross/near total resection compared to 65% of non ioMRI glioma cases in this time frame.

A movable high field strength ioMRI can be safely integrated between two neurosurgical operating rooms. This strategy leads to modification of the surgical procedure in a significant number of cases, particularly for glioma surgery. Long-term follow up is needed to evaluate the clinical and financial impact of this technology in the field of neurosurgery.
