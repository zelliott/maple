Intradural nonneoplastic cysts compressing the spinal cord are rare lesions. We retrospectively analyzed a series of patients harboring this entity with regard to clinical and radiological features, surgical management, and follow-up results.

In a retrospective study, we reviewed the medical charts, radiological investigations, and follow-up data of 11 women and 10 men (mean age, 43.6 yr) with intradural juxtamedullary spinal cysts, which were consecutively treated microsurgically at our institutions between January 1995 and January 2003. All lesions were approached via a laminectomy, hemilaminectomy, or laminoplasty at the corresponding vertebral levels and histopathologically verified. The patients were routinely scheduled for clinical follow-up 2 and 6 months after surgery. Baseline postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was ordered 6 months after surgery. Thereafter, follow-up was performed at 1-year intervals, with neurological examination and MRI.

According to presenting symptomatology, two main patient groups could be differentiated: one group with a myelopathic syndrome (10 patients) and another group with a predominant radicular pain syndrome (8 patients). Histopathological examination revealed 16 arachnoid cysts, 4 neuroepithelial cysts, and 1 cervical nerve root cyst. Most arachnoid cysts (12 cases) were located on the dorsal aspect of the thoracic spinal cord. The mean craniocaudal extension of these cysts was 3.7 vertebral levels, and complete resection was performed. In four patients, the arachnoid cyst was situated ventral to the spinal cord and involved up to 17 vertebral levels. These patients had a history of major spinal trauma, and the cyst was generously fenestrated at its greatest circumference as depicted on preoperative MRI scans. The four neuroepithelial cysts and the cervical nerve root cyst were located on the ventral or ventrolateral aspect of the spinal cord, and their maximum sagittal extension was two spinal vertebral levels. Symptoms in all but two patients demonstrated major improvement; in particular, radiating pain disappeared immediately after surgery. There was no cyst recurrence on MRI after a mean follow-up period of 3.2 years.

Intradural cysts should be considered in the differential diagnosis of lesions causing myelopathy and/or a radicular pain syndrome. Microsurgical resection or generous fenestration in cysts with large craniocaudal extensions effectively ameliorated patients' symptomatology. A description of the first documented case of a surgically treated intradural cervical nerve root cyst is provided.
