Os acromiale, failure of fusion of the secondary centers of ossification of the acromion process, has been noted as a contributing factor in shoulder impingement syndrome and rotator cuff tears. Treatments for symptomatic os acromiale with or without rotator cuff tears have been reported in the literature and range from excision of small fragments to fusion of larger, fragments with internal fixation and bone grafting. Generally, rotator cuff repairs have been performed when possible. We report an acromion splitting approach through an existing os acromiale to gain exposure for the repair of a massive rotator cuff tear. Subsequent to this repair, the acromion was repaired with internal fixation. Good functional use of the patient's upper extremity was obtained and the patient expressed satisfaction with the surgical outcome. The acromion splitting approach is a viable approach in patients with an os acromiale and a coexistent rotator cuff tear.
