Functional MRI techniques were used to map the position of visual cortex in an awake and a sedated child with congenital anomalies of the posterior hemispheres. In one subject with cortical heterotopia, an activated cortex was found distinct from the structurally abnormal area detected on conventional MRI. In a sedated patient with holoprosencephaly, activated cortical areas in the posterior-medial portions of the hemispheres were identified. This study demonstrates the utility of functional MRI in such patients, both awake and sedated.
