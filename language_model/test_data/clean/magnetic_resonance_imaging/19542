The preoperative localization of pharmaco-resistant focal epilepsies before surgery and the prognosis concerning seizure outcome are both of importance. In addition to conventional MRI diagnostics for the detection of small epileptogenic lesions, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (HMR spectroscopy) can be useful for assessing the bilaterality of pathological changes in cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsies. The technique and findings of HMR spectroscopy are reported in patients with cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsies. The findings indicate that chemical shift imaging (CSI) investigations of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres provide important information for the prediction of seizure outcome after epilepsy surgery.
