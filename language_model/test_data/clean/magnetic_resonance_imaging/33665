This paper describes a robust method for flow field mapping by multi-zone adiabatic fast passage (AFP). It provides a quick and simple way to simultaneously acquire flow profiles at several locations and arbitrary orientations inside the field-of-view. The flow profile is the time-averaged evolution of the labeled flowing material. Results obtained using a carotid bifurcation and jet phantoms are similar to the previous experimental studies employing Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA), and other flow visualization techniques. In addition, the preliminary results obtained with a human volunteer support the feasibility of the technique for in vivo flow quantification.
