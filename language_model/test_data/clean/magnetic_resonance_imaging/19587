We report a case of chronic spinal, ossificans, thoraco-lumbar arachnoiditis, associated with an arachnoidal cyst at the level of TH7, and revealed by a rapidly progressive thoracic myelopathy. Two years ago, he had presented with a spinal intrathecal haemorrhage of unknown etiology. There was no evidence of spinal traumatism, arterial hypertension or coagulation disorder. The finding of several small cysts and angiomas in the liver of this patient lead us to suspect an associated spinal vascular malformation, not detected on the spinal magnetic resonance imaging. A partial neurologic improvement was observed after laminectomy and cysto-peritoneal derivation.
