Hip injuries in young athletes are being diagnosed with increasing frequency. Improvements in diagnostic imaging and surgical technologies have helped facilitate the diagnosis of intra- and extra-articular derangements that were previously untreated in this age group. Athletic injuries of the hip in the young athlete encompass both osseous and soft-tissue etiologies, which can be the result of a single traumatic event or repetitive microtrauma or may be associated with an underlying pediatric hip disorder. Without accurate diagnosis and management, these injuries may result in debilitating consequences. This article will review the more common causes of hip and groin pain in the adolescent athlete, as well as advances in diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.
