Oxidative stress has been the object of considerable biological and biochemical investigation. Quantification has been difficult although the quantitative level of products of biological oxidations in tissues and tissue products has emerged as a widely used technique. The relationship between these products and the amount of oxidative stress is less clear. Imaging oxidative stress with electron paramagnetic resonance related magnetic resonance imaging, while not addressing the specific issue of quantification of initiating events, focuses on the anatomic specific location of the oxidative stress. Moreover, the relative quantification of oxidative stress of one location against another is possible, sharpening our understanding of oxidative stress. This promises to improve our understanding of oxidative stress and its deleterious consequences and enhance our understanding of the effectiveness of interventions to modulate oxidative stress and its consequences.
