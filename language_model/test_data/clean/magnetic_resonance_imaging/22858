The characteristics of an MRI technique that could be used for direct detection of neuronal activity are investigated. It was shown that magnitude imaging using echo planar imaging can detect transient local currents. The sensitivity of this method was thoroughly investigated. A partial k-space EPI acquisition with homodyne reconstruction was found to increase the signal change. A unique sensitivity to the position of the current pulse within the imaging sequence was demonstrated with the greatest signal change occurring when the current pulse coincides with the acquisition of the center lines of k-space. The signal change was shown to be highly sensitive to the spatial position of the current conductor relative to the voxel. Furthermore, with the use of optimization of spatial and temporal placement of the current pulse, the level of signal change obtained at this lower limit of current detectability was considerably magnified. It was possible to detect a current of 1.7 microA applied for 20 ms with an imaging time of 1.8 min. The level of sensitivity observed in our study brings us closer to that theoretically required for the detection of action currents in nerves.
