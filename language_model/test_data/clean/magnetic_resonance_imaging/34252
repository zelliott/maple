Survival and integration into the host brain of grafted tissue are crucial factors in neurotransplantation approaches. The present study explored the feasibility of using a clinical MR scanner to study striatal graft development in a rat model of Huntington's disease. Rat fetal lateral ganglionic eminences grown as free-floating roller-tube cultures were grafted into the quinolinic acid-lesioned striatum, and T1- and T2-weighted sequences were acquired at 2, 7, 21, and 99 days posttransplantation. MR images were then compared with images of corresponding histological sections. The lesion-induced striatal degeneration caused a progressive ventricle enlargement, which was significantly different from controls at 21 days posttransplantation. Seven days posttransplantation, T1-weighted images revealed a defined liquid-isointense signal surrounded by a hyperintense rim at the site of graft placement, which was found unaltered for the first 21 days posttransplantation, whereas a hypointense graft signal was detected at 99 days posttransplantation. At 2 days posttransplantation, T2-weighted images showed the graft region as a hyperintense area surrounded by a rim of low signal intensity but at later time-points graft location could not be further verified. Measures for graft size and ventricle size obtained from MR images highly correlated with measures obtained from histologically processed sections (R = 0.8, P < 0.001). In conclusion, the present study shows that fetal rat lateral ganglionic eminences grown as free-floating roller-tube cultures can be successfully grafted in a rat Huntington model and that a clinical MR scanner offers a useful noninvasive tool for studying striatal graft development.
