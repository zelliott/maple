Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the diagnostic gold standard in vestibular schwannoma. Sensitivity and specificity are both close to 100%. MRI detects the tumour and describes its extension, thereby giving the potential surgeon prognostic clues. Prediction of tumour growth, however, is not possible. Careful analysis of imaging findings almost always enables differentiation from various other disease entities. Follow-up of surgical as well as non-surgical patients is another important role of MRI. Computed tomography (CT) is restricted to pre-surgical workup and to the immediate postoperative period.
