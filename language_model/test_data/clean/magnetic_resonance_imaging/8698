The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature on facial nerve schwannoma and make practical recommendations based on best practices for the management of this difficult but benign neoplasm.

Facial nerve schwannoma can be asymptomatic or can present with progressive or acute facial nerve palsy. Associated otological symptoms such as conductive and/or sensorineural hearing loss can occur. The tumor is usually slow-growing and can involve multiple segments of the nerve. Radiographic imaging and facial nerve electrical testing can be helpful in treatment planning. Options for management can include observation, decompression, stripping, resection with grafting, and possibly radiotherapy. Future adjunctive therapies to improve facial nerve function may include electrical stimulation, steroid hormones, and possibly stem cell therapy.

Treatment of facial schwannoma is individualized based on patient symptoms, history, and clinicoradiographic evaluation. Not all patients require surgery. As the tumor can involve multiple segments of the nerve, the surgeon attempting removal should be familiar with modern neurotological surgical techniques. Ongoing translational research will hopefully allow us to decrease facial nerve morbidity in these patients.
