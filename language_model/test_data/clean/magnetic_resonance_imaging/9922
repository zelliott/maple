Neck and shoulder pain are common complaints among the general population, being the second and third most common musculoskeletal complaints, respectively, after back pain in the primary care setting. Differentiating between neck and shoulder pain can be challenging, as both share symptoms and physical examination findings. The differential diagnoses of neck and shoulder pain are extensive. Providers are encouraged to develop a systematic, comprehensive, and reproducible approach, including thorough history taking and physical examination along with focused diagnostic testing.
