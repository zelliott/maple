Hemangiomas of the urinary tract can arise anywhere along the system. Although rare, these lesions can result in significant hematuria, with potential for patient morbidity. We report a case of an isolated bladder hemangioma identified in a 3-year-old girl presenting with recurrent high-volume gross hematuria. The lesion was not amenable to endoscopic resection because of its size. We present our operative management strategy as a potential method for other urologists who may be presented with similar scenarios.
