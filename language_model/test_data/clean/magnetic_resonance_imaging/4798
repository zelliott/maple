Many previous investigators have reported the findings of ganglion cysts on the surface of the anterior cruciate ligament. The cysts reported in the literature were either symptomatic or only of incidental findings. So far, however, there has not yet been a report of a ganglion cyst within the substance of the anterior cruciate ligament. This is the first report of a ganglion cyst within the substance of the anterior cruciate ligament, which caused intermittent swelling and pain in the right knee of a 13-year-old girl without any history of trauma. The cyst was treated successfully with an arthroscopic debridement and arthroscopically guided needle aspiration.
