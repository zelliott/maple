Thirty-two patients with symptoms referable to the brachial plexus were evaluated with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Sixteen patients had undergone concurrent computed tomography (CT). MR imaging demonstrated normal findings in 16, 12 neoplasms, three cases of trauma, and one case of possible neural edema. Of the 16 patients with normal findings on MR images, eight had CT scans that were also normal. In one patient, MR images showed that the "mass" seen on CT was actually a tortuous blood vessel. In six of the 12 cases of neoplasm in which CT scans were available, MR imaging revealed more extensive disease. In the other six cases of tumor, MR imaging provided sufficient clinical information to obviate the need for CT or any other imaging modality. MR imaging provided definitive diagnoses in the three cases of trauma without further imaging. In one patient with paresthesia, MR imaging showed high signal intensity of the nerves on T2-weighted images, which was compatible with neural edema. A concurrent CT scan was normal.
