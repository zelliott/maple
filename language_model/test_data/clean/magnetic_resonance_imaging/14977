Patients with deficit schizophrenia (D-SZ) differ from patients with the non-deficit form of schizophrenia (ND-SZ) in several aspects such as risk factors, neurobiological correlates, treatment response and clinical outcome. It has been debated if brain morphology could differentiate D-SZ from ND-SZ. Anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) region regulates cognitive and emotional processing and past studies reported structural changes in this region in patients with SZ.

1.5-T 3D MRI scans were obtained from 18 D-SZ patients, 30 ND-SZ patients and 82 healthy controls (HCs). We used FreeSurfer-initalized labeled cortical distance mapping (FSLCDM) to measure ACG gray matter volume, cortical thickness, and area of the gray/white interface. Furthermore, cortical thickness was compared among the 3 groups using the pooled labeled cortical distance mapping (LCDM) method.

The ACG cortex of the D-SZ group was thinner than the ND-SZ group. Pooled LCDM demonstrated that the ACG cortex was bilaterally thinner in both the ND-SZ group and the D-SZ group compared with the control group. The right ACG gray matter volume was significantly reduced in D-SZ patients as compared with healthy controls (p=0.005 CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that qualitative, categorical differences in neuroanatomy may distinguish between deficit and non-deficit subtypes of schizophrenia.
