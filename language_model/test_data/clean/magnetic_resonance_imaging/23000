A 55-year-old female patient presented with a painless swelling in the palm of the right hand, causing restriction of the third finger. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a synovial lesion in the flexor tendon sheath of the third finger, showing heterogenous contrast. Open biopsy and histopathological studies showed a granulomatous infectious reaction of the synovial tissue. A diagnosis of tuberculosis was made, after which antituberculosis treatment was instituted. Total regression was achieved after nine months of medical treatment without further extensive surgical measures. At the end of nine months, the movements of the finger were found to be normal and painless.
