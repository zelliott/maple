Carrying a prenatal diagnosis of a left-sided intraabdominal mass, a term female newborn underwent postnatal imaging that confirmed a left suprarenal mass. Urinary normetanephrine levels were elevated. Given a preoperative diagnosis of neuroblastoma, the baby underwent an uneventful resection of the mass en bloc with the left adrenal gland. The pathologic examination returned pulmonary sequestration and a normal adrenal gland. Postoperative urinary catecholamines were normal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a newborn with an intraabdominal pulmonary sequestration presenting with elevated urinary catecholamines.
