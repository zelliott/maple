In this report, we describe the appearance of the spinal vertebral body and epidural abscesses in a patient who underwent diffusion-weighted imaging of the spine and CT-guided aspiration of one of the abscesses. The abscesses were hyperintense relative to the surrounding tissues on diffusion-weighted images, and they appeared dark on apparent diffusion coefficient maps; these findings were consistent with those of published reports of the brain and liver.
