In the current literature on the imaging modalities of the spine, several papers deal with the diagnostic evaluation of the postoperative spine. Particular attention is focused on the use of MR imaging in evaluating the postoperative spine in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Other papers discuss application of different radiologic modalities such as conventional tomography, CT, sonography, and scintigraphy. The effectiveness of various imaging techniques in evaluating the postsurgical changes in the spine is the subject of this review.
