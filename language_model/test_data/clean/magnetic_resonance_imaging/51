A case of ovarian autoamputation in an asymptomatic neonate is presented. An abdominal cyst was detected in a 30-week-gestation fetus on an antenatal ultrasound scan (USS). Postnatal USS confirmed the presence of a cyst in the right pelvis and revealed it to be 3.2 cm in diameter. CT and MRI revealed cyst wall calcification and intracystic hemorrhage. To confirm the diagnosis and treatment, the cyst was surgically removed. During the operation, a free autoamputated right ovarian cyst was found and removed from the abdomen. Ovarian cyst autoamputation is an extremely rare complication. In this article, we review the infantile ovarian autoamputation cases reported in the literature and assess their diagnosis and therapeutic management.
