The aim of this study was to evaluate utilization trends of the diagnostic imaging examinations during the past decade in a university hospital in Turkey.

Patient registries of a university hospital were used for the years 1995 and 2003. The data set consisted of patients' admissions, social security status, and diagnostic imaging tests.

When compared with 1995 data, the total number of diagnostic imaging examinations and patient admissions increased 65.9 percent and 81.6 percent, respectively, in the year 2003. Although the total number of diagnostic imaging tests decreased 9.0 percent, there was a 145.4 percent increase in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. Nevertheless, radiological diagnostic procedures consisted of 12.8 percent of the total hospital revenues in 1995 and 9.4 percent in 2003.

This study shows that approximately one third of inpatients underwent MRI and computed tomography examinations in 2003. The utilization rates of diagnostic imaging procedures, especially new technologies, need to be considered carefully with respect to appropriateness of procedures and planning of services.
