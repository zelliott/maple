5-Aminolevulinic acid has been used successfully to facilitate resection of adult malignant gliomas. The authors report their experience in the treatment of a 9-year-old girl who underwent fluorescence-guided resection of a right temporal lobe pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma using 5-aminolevulinic acid. Intraoperatively, the residual tumor fluoresced, allowing for better visualization. No serious side effects or complications occurred.
