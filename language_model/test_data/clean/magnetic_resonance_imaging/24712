A liquid crystal display was modified for use inside a 7 T MR magnet. SNR measurements were performed using different imaging sequences with the monitor absent, present, or activated. fMRI with a volunteer was conducted using a visual stimulus.

SNR was reduced by 3.7%/7.9% in echo planar/fast-spin echo images when the monitor was on which can be explained by the limited shielding of the coated front window (40 dB). In the fMRI experiments, activated regions in the visual cortex were clearly visible. The monitor provided excellent resolution at minor SNR reduction in EPI images, and is thus suitable for fMRI at ultra-high field.
