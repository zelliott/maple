To compare black-blood multicontrast carotid imaging at 3T and 1.5T and assess compatibility between morphological measurements of carotid arteries at 1.5T and 3T.

Five healthy subjects and two atherosclerosis patients were scanned in 1.5T and 3T scanners with a similar protocol providing transverse T1-, T2-, and proton density (PD)-weighted black-blood images using a fast spin-echo sequence with single- (T1-weighted) or multislice (PD-/T2-weighted) double inversion recovery (DIR) preparation. Wall and lumen signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and wall/lumen contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were compared in 44 artery cross-sections by paired t-test. Interscanner variability of the lumen area (LA), wall area (WA), and mean wall thickness (MWT) was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis.

Wall SNR and lumen/wall CNR significantly increased (P < 0.0001) at 3T with a 1.5-fold gain for T1-weighted images and a 1.7/1.8-fold gain for PD-/T2-weighted images. Lumen SNR did not differ for single-slice DIR T1-weighted images (P = 0.2), but was larger at 3T for multislice DIR PD-/T2-weighted images (P = 0.01/0.03). The LA, WA, and MWT demonstrated good agreement with no significant bias (P 0.5), a coefficient of variation (CV) of < 10%, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of > 0.95.

This study demonstrated significant improvement in SNR, CNR, and image quality for high- resolution black-blood imaging of carotid arteries at 3T. Morphologic measurements are compatible between 1.5T and 3T.
