To evaluate and compare thoracic vertebrae morphology between patients with idiopathic and normal adolescents through MRI.

Two-dimensional sagittal MRI of the spine was performed in 10 normal adolescent, 10 patients with mild idiopathic thoracic scoliosis (Cobb angle 15 degrees - 39 degrees ) and 10 patients with moderate thoracic scoliosis (Cobb angle 40 degrees - 75 degrees ), all of them were female and between 13 - 14 years old. Sagittal imaging was reconstructed on image working station (Easy Vision, Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands). Anterior height, posterior height and width of vertebral body as well as length between spinous process were measured on each thoracic spine.

Anterior height, posterior height and width of vertebral body increased from T(1) to T(12) with the values from scoliotic groups larger than normal group. The anterior height/width ratio and anterior/posterior column ratio were also larger in scoliotic group especially at apical area.

The thoracic vertebrae are higher and slimmer in scoliotic patient than in normal age-matched girls which implied that there is abnormal endochondral ossification on spine during adolescent growth spurt.
