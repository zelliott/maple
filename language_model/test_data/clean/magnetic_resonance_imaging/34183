The complication of cholecystocutaneous fistula secondary to calculus cholelithiasis is an extremely rare occurrence. The incidence has further decreased with the advent of broad-spectrum antibiotics, ultrasonography, and safe and early surgical treatment of biliary tract disease. We are reporting a rare cholecystocutaneous fistula presenting in the right-side gluteal region below the iliac crest.
