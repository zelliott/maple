The Schatzker classification system for tibial plateau fractures is widely used by orthopedic surgeons to assess the initial injury, plan management, and predict prognosis. Many investigators have found that surgical plans based on plain radiographic findings were modified after preoperative computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The Schatzker classification divides tibial plateau fractures into six types: lateral plateau fracture without depression (type I), lateral plateau fracture with depression (type II), compression fracture of the lateral (type IIIA) or central (type IIIB) plateau, medial plateau fracture (type IV), bicondylar plateau fracture (type V), and plateau fracture with diaphyseal discontinuity (type VI). Management of type I, II, and III fractures centers on evaluating and repairing the articular cartilage. The fracture-dislocation mechanism of type IV fractures increases the likelihood of injury to the peroneal nerve or popliteal vessels. In type V and VI fractures, the location of soft-tissue injury dictates the surgical approach and the degree of soft-tissue swelling dictates the timing of definitive surgery and the need for provisional stabilization with an external fixator. CT and MR imaging are more accurate than plain radiography for Schatzker classification of tibial plateau fractures, and use of cross-sectional imaging can improve surgical planning.
