The purpose of this investigation was to derive and validate circumference and skinfold equations for estimating the anatomical cross-sectional area (CSA) of the quadriceps, hamstrings, and total thigh muscles. Forty-three adult male (mean age +/- SD = 25 +/- 5 yr) volunteers underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine the CSA of the thigh muscles at the midfemur level as well as midthigh circumference and anterior thigh skinfold assessment. Multiple regression analyses were used to derive equations for predicting quadriceps, hamstrings, and total thigh muscle CSA of the dominant limb from the anthropometric dimensions on a random sample of 30 of the subjects. Cross-validation (CV) analyses were performed for each equation on: (a) the nondominant thigh of the derivation group (N = 30); (b) the dominant thigh of the CV group (N = 13); and (c) the nondominant thigh of the CV group (N = 13). The CV total error values for the quadriceps, hamstrings, and total thigh muscle CSA ranged from 5.4 to 14.4, 3.3 to 5.5, and 10.0 to 25.4 cm2, respectively. The anthropometric equations are recommended for one-time estimates of muscle CSA values in healthy, well-nourished young adult males when more sophisticated procedures are not available.
