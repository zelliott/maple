Magnetisation Transfer Contrast (MTC) is an important MR contrast-generating mechanism to characterise the MR-invisible macromolecular protons using an off-resonance pre-saturation RF irradiation pulse (or MT pulse). MTC MRI is normally implemented at a fixed magnetic field; however, it may be useful to evaluate changes of the MT effect as a function of external magnetic field strength (B₀). In order to conduct field-dependent MTC experiments with a single MR system, two techniques are crucially needed. B₀ should be able to be switched between levels during irradiation of the MT pulse. At the same time, the resonance frequency of the RF coil (f₀) should also be able to be shifted to the corresponding value. Switching B₀ is attained by the fast field-cycling technique, while in order to switch f₀, a specially designed multi-tunable RF coil is required. Here, we designed and constructed an actively frequency-switchable RF coil for frequencies at and below 2.5 MHz. The design employed PIN diodes, and enabled switching f₀ between five different values, with excellent impedance matching (approximately -37 dB S₁₁ reflection) and Q-factor of about 100 at each configuration.
