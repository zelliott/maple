Seminal vesicles and their adjacent structures were studied using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 7 normal volunteers and 15 patients with hematospermia. Normal seminal vesicles are depicted on T2-weighted images either as a mixture of high- and low-signal granules or as a convolution of tubules with a diameter of less than 0.5 cm. Fourteen of the 15 patients with hematospermia exhibited abnormalities on MRI. Dilatation or cyst formation in the seminal vesicle was observed in 13 patients, and a dilatation of the midline structure was seen in 3 patients. Abnormal signal intensity of the seminal vesicles was seen in 11 patients and was thought to be due to subacute hemorrhage.
