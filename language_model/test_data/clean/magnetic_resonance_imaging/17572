Aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of proton MR Spectroscopic (MRS) imaging in the detection and localization of prostate cancer, prospectively compared with histopathologic findings. Magnetic Resonance (MR) and MRS imaging were performed in 65 patients with high levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and suspicious areas at the transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). At MR areas of interest were reported as normal, equivocal or suspicious. At MRS imaging, cancer was diagnosed as "possible" if the ratio of choline plus creatine to citrate exceeded 2 SDs above mean normal peripheral zone values or as "definite" if the ratio exceeded 3 SDs. All patients underwent a TRUS 10-core biopsy within 30 days of the imaging study. MR alone showed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative predictive values and accuracy for detection of prostate cancer of 85%, 76%, 53%, 91% and 65%, respectively, whereas MRS alone showed 89%, 77%, 78%, 69% and 83%, respectively. These values were 71%, 90%, 89%, 74% and 80% when the prostate was evaluated combining MR and MRS. The addition of MRS to the MR imaging provides a higher specificity in tumour detection and can be recommended as a problem-solving modality for patients with elevated PSA levels and suspicious TRUS before biopsy.
