Early identification of the potentially salvageable penumbra is critical for the determination of therapeutic intervention strategies in acute focal cerebral ischemia. This study differentiates the ischemic penumbra from the core on the basis of the dynamics of lactate formation. This was tested in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia by infusion of [1-13C]-glucose, using lactate-edited magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging techniques. The authors detected essentially no enrichment of lactate with 13C-label from the infused 13C-glucose in the ischemic core. However, in borderzone areas, 13C was incorporated into lactate, which could point toward compromised but potentially viable tissue. The authors' findings suggest that this combination of 13C-glucose infusion with the proposed magnetic resonance methods may aid in differentiating the penumbra from the core in cerebral ischemia.
