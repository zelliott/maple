This paper presents a review of various complications of multifetal gestations identified on MR imaging and highlights findings of those complications unique to monochorionic twinning. The goal is to illustrate the potential of MR as a useful application in these clinical circumstances. A total of 32 women with multifetal gestations and suspected complication detected initially by US underwent T2-weighted MR imaging. Additional T1-weighted images were obtained when intracranial hemorrhage was suspected. MR and US findings were compared in all cases. Of 32 cases, six demonstrated fetal complications specific to monochorionic twinning; the findings consisted of conjoined twins (n=2), twin-twin transfusion syndrome (n=1), co-twin demise with embolic disease (n=2), and twin-reversed arterial perfusion. (TRAP) syndrome (n=1). MR imaging confirmed US findings in all cases and was particularly helpful in delineating the extent of intracranial complications of monochorionic twins. The technique also showed improved anatomical detail in cases of conjoined twins. MR imaging provided additional information in cases of complicated monochorionic twinning, making it a useful complementary technique when combined with initial sonographic assessment.
