The authors report on two patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis in whom cervical myelopathy was caused by calcification related to the cervical dural sac. The lesions were demonstrated on plain computerized tomography (CT) scans as dotted curvilinear bands outlining the dural sacs in almost the whole of their cervical spines. During posterior decompressive surgery in both cases, the CT scanning--documented curvilinear bands were identified as calcified plaques infiltrating the fibrous membranes beneath the ligamenta flava, constricting the cervical dural tube. In each case, the spinal cord could not be decompressed by merely enlarging the osseous spinal canal; rather, it required removal of the calcified membrane from the posterior surface of the dura. Based on the operative findings, the lesion should be described as cervical peridural calcification.
