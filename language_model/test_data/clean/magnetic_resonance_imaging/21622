In order to obtain timed pregnancies in squirrel monkeys and to monitor development of the size of the fetus and its brain, tests were made of various combinations of vaginal examination, bioassay of chorionic gonadotropin (CG), measurement of maternal body weight and uterine fundus height during pregnancy, and determination of fetal biparietal diameter by ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. The usefulness of these methods in developmental and teratological studies is discussed.
