Pharyngo-vertebral fistula (PVF) associated with cervical (C) spinal fracture is an extremely rare event that may lead to life-threatening infectious complications if not recognized promptly. Successful management of PVF depends on the physicians' awareness of the causes, prompt recognition of the symptoms and clinical findings, and immediate institution of treatment. I report a case of PVF after C3 vertebral body fracture that was initially neglected and subsequently developed into osteomyelitis involving adjacent vertebrae. On computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a PVF. Despite conservative care, spontaneous closure of the fistula was not achieved. Removal of PVF and surrounding granulation was achieved without any complication. To the best of my knowledge, PVF as a complication of C spine fracture has not hitherto been reported in the English literature.
