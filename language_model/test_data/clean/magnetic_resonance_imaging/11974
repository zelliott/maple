Fifty-three autism patients ranging in age from 2 to 22 yr with a mean age of 9 yr were evaluated by MR imaging over a 3-yr study period. Sagittal, axial, and coronal spin-echo and short TI inversion recovery scans were performed on a 0.5 Tesla (Picker Inc., Cleveland, OH) system. Results were compared to 32 control patients age range 1 to 17 yr, mean 8.5 yr. MR scans were evaluated by three neuroradiologists. Measurements of midsagittal vermian height and AP diameter were performed. Subjective estimates were made of ventricular size, amygdala size, fourth ventricular size, and vermian shape. Results were correlated with clinical presentation, course, and lab analyses by a pediatric neurologist. MR findings did not present a single pattern capable of predicting the presence or severity of autism. The constellation of MR findings in this group of 53 patients was highly variable, thus we advise caution in the interpretation of MR images in autistic patients. Autism is a heterogeneous disease entity containing different clinical subgroups, which do not manifest similar radiologic pictures.
