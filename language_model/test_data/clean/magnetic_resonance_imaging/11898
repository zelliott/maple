A 15-year-old girl presented with an extremely rare anomalous origin of the internal carotid artery (ICA) from the common carotid artery, associated with an arteriovenous malformation in the brain and aberrant course of the ICA in the temporal bone. These anomalies, which were found on the same side, may be due to a maldevelopment of the vascular network including the aortic arches.
