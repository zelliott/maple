Cauda equina syndrome occurring as a result of spontaneous spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from a spinal tumor is reported to be rare.

A 28-year-old woman presented at our clinic with a history of severe back pain for 10 days, progressive paraparesis, and urinary retention. Her physical examination revealed a mass located intradurally at the level of L1-2 and a massive SAH. An L1-L2, laminectomy and a hemilaminectomy from D9 to D12 were performed and the SAH was evacuated and the cord was decompressed.

At the first year follow-up, her restricted dorsal and plantar flexion continued. Post-gadolinium magnetic resonance imaging revealed no mass.
