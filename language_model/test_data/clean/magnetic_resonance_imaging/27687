To evaluate the usefulness of three-dimensional ultrasound (3D US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and three-dimensional power Doppler angiography (3D-PDA) in the preoperative assessment of myometrial invasion in endometrial carcinoma.

A prospective observational study.

University hospital.

Twenty consecutive patients diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma.

Preoperative 3 T MRI and 3D US examinations were performed, and the depth of myometrial invasion was assessed. The vascularity indices, vascularization index, flow index and vascularization flow index, were calculated by 3D-PDA.

The results were compared with the final histopathology report after a surgical staging.

In detecting deep myometrial invasion, the sensitivity of 3D US, MRI and their combination was 50, 91.7 and 100%, respectively. The specificity was 87.5, 50 and 50%, respectively. There were no significant differences in the 3D-PDA vascularity indices between the two groups.

MRI appears to be more sensitive than 3D US in detecting deep invasion, while 3D US has a better specificity.
