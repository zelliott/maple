Intracerebral neuroblastoma is an exceedingly rare manifestation of intracranial neuroblastoma and has been described as a solid lesion. Cystic metastatic intracerebral neuroblastoma has not been described. We report a case of histologically proven metastatic intracerebral neuroblastoma presenting in a cystic form 1 year after diagnosis and treatment of a solid intra-abdominal neuroblastoma. The imaging and clinical appearance of this case was indistinguishable from that of intracerebral cystic lesions caused by infection or inflammation. It has been suggested that, due to more aggressive treatment of neuroblastoma, patients are surviving longer and consequently intracranial involvement is becoming more frequent. It is important to be aware of this cystic manifestation of the disease.
