Recent data indicate that the auditory brainstem response (ABR) fails to identify a significant number of retrocochlear lesions. Although the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan with paramagnetic enhancement is highly accurate at detecting these lesions, it is time consuming and expensive. We report on our prospective evaluation of a cohort of 155 patients who underwent T2-weighted, fast-spin echo MRI scans designed to screen for retrocochlear lesions. This imaging technique is rapidly performed and provides superb visualization of the relevant anatomic structures at a global cost of $475. Four tumors were identified with this technique. Cost analysis indicates that supplanting ABR with this limited MRI may well represent a cost-effective approach for evaluating patients with suspected retrocochlear lesions.
