To determine the trends in utilization of non-neurologic (ie, body) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and of MR angiographic examinations performed from 1993 to 1998, the trends in non-radiologist participation in MR imaging, and the relative reimbursements for these examinations compared with those for all other noninvasive imaging studies performed in 1998.

By using the 1993, 1996, and 1998 nationwide Medicare Part B databases, utilization rates per 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries and physician reimbursements were determined for seven MR angiography and 14 body MR imaging CPT-4 (Current Procedural Terminology, version 4) codes. Medicare specialty codes were used to categorize physicians as radiologists or non-radiologists.

The utilization rate per 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries for all 21 MR angiography and body MR imaging codes increased from 649 in 1993 to 1,253 in 1996 and to 1,876 in 1998--a 189% increase. These rates represented 0.55% of the total noninvasive imaging volume in 1998 and 2.8% of physician reimbursements. Musculoskeletal MR imaging utilization increased 142% from 1993 to 1998 compared with a 58% increase in the utilization of other body MR imaging studies. Non-radiologist participation in musculoskeletal MR imaging increased from 2.9% in 1993 to 3.6% in 1996 and to 5.6% in 1998.

MR angiography and body MR imaging utilization rates increased substantially from 1993 to 1998. However, these studies still account for a minor fraction of all noninvasive imaging examinations performed and fees reimbursed. MR angiography and musculoskeletal MR imaging utilization has increased rapidly. Non-radiologist participation in musculoskeletal MR imaging is increasing.
