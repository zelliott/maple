A family is described with a history of both hereditary nephritis (Alport syndrome) and chronic psychosis in multiple family members. Although the disorders do not segregate together in all cases, the finding of this family may provide a clue for the location of a psychosis gene. Alport syndrome has been mapped to the long arm of the X chromosome. Some studies also support a genomic locus on the X chromosome in at least some cases of manic-depressive disorder and schizophrenia.
