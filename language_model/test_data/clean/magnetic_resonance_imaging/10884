We have conducted a study to compare the diagnostic yields of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and capsule endoscopy for the detection of small-bowel polyps in patients with inherited polyposis syndromes.

MRI was performed in 20 patients, with either Peutz-Jeghers' syndrome (PJS; n = 4) or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP; n = 16), and capsule endoscopy was done the next day. The number, size, and location of polyps were analyzed.

Overall, 448 polyps ranging from about 1 mm to 30 mm in size were detected in eight patients by capsule endoscopy, whereas with MRI only 24 polyps all bigger than 5 mm could be seen in the four PJS patients.

Polyps bigger than 15 mm were detected similarly with capsule endoscopy and MRI, whereas smaller polyps were seen much more often with capsule endoscopy. Polyps smaller than 5 mm were exclusively seen with capsule endoscopy. However, location of the detected polyps and determination of their exact sizes was more accurate by MRI.
