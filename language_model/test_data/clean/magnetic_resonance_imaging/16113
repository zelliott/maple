A 42-year-old woman presented with chest pain and ECG changes suggestive of acute myocardial infarction. However, a coronary angiogram showed no significant epicardial coronary stenosis. Nonetheless, abnormal Tc-99m pyrophosphate activity accumulated within the inferolateral wall, consistent with acute necrosis. Cardiac magnetic resonance revealed near transmural extent of late gadolinium-enhancement with mild hypokinesis in the mid to basal inferolateral segments. Dipyridamole Tl-201 single photon emission computed tomography 6 months later demonstrated stress-induced ischemia in the corresponding area, with subendocardial scar in the mid level. Nuclear perfusion scintigraphy is needed for accurate assessment of infarct size and coronary flow after the acute stage of a myocardial infarction has passed.
