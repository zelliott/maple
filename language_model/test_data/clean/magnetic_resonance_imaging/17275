Schwannoma is rarely encountered as an intraocular tumor arising from uveal tract. We describe a case of choroidal schwannoma.

A 74-year-old woman presented with rapidly decreasing visual acuity and proptosis for 2 months. To further delineate the tumor, she underwent enucleation of the eyeball. The tumor was examined by light microscopy, electron microscopy and immunohistochemical study.

Microscopically, the tumor was composed of a mixture of cellular solid component (Antoni A) and loose myxoid component (Antoni B). Immunohistochemical study revealed a positive reaction for S-100 protein. Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells showed prominent, continuous basal lamina.

We enucleated the eyeball with a clinical diagnosis of choroidal amelanotic melanoma, but the tumor was finally diagnosed as schwannoma. We think that currently available ancillary studies are still little value in definitely differentiating schwannoma from other choroidal tumors.
