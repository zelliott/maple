The most important rendering methods applied in medical imaging are surface and volume rendering techniques. Each approach has its own advantages and limitations: Fast surface-oriented methods are able to support real-time interaction and manipulation. The underlying representation, however, is dependent on intensive image processing to extract the object surfaces. In contrast, volume visualization is not necessarily based on extensive image processing and interpretation. No data reduction to geometric primitives, such as polygons, is required. Therefore, the process of volume rendering is currently not operating in real time. In order to provide the radiological diagnosis with additional information as well as to enable simulation and preoperative treatment planning we developed a new hybrid rendering method which combines the advantages of surface and volume presentation, and minimizes the limitations of these approaches. We developed a common data representation method for both techniques. A preprocessing module enables the construction of a data volume by interpolation as well as the calculation of object surfaces by semiautomatic image interpretation and surface construction. The hybrid rendering system is based on transparency and texture mapping features. It is embedded in a user-friendly open system which enables the support of new application fields such as virtual reality and stereolithography. The efficiency of our new method is described for 3-D subtraction angiography and the visualization of morpho-functional relationships.
