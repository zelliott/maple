A case report on a 30-year old female patient who underwent resection of a haemangiopericytoma followed by radiation therapy in 1988 is presented. 6 months ago a space-occupying lesion was detected within the radiation field, which was classified as a plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumour (PFT). On MRI PFT showed the similar signal intensities as the muscles in T1, as well as T2-weighted images. After gadolinium-DTPA no enhancement within the tumour could be measured. Based on its exclusively dermal and subcutaneous location, and its signal behaviour uncommon for a malignant soft tissue mass, PFT must be included in differential diagnosis in any examining for local tumour recurrence.
