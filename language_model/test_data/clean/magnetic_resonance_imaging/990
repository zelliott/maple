Recent advances in the technology of MR imaging are beginning to transform the fundamental methodology of diagnostic evaluations in neuromuscular disorders. When properly implemented, MR neurography is capable of providing high-quality information about nerve compression, nerve inflammation, nerve trauma, systemic neuropathies, nerve tumors, and recovery of nerve from pathologic states. Muscle MR imaging can identify denervation on a precise anatomic basis, document the progression of various conditions causing myopathy and myositis; and even provide insight into abnormal patterns of muscle activation. There is an essential role for the neurologist as well as for the specialist radiologist that requires a high level of familiarity of the various new types of image findings in this steadily advancing field.
