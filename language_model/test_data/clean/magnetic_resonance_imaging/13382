Seventy-eight patients were investigated by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging using optimal scan parameters and a surface coil. Forty-two patients were also examined by computer tomography (CT). Sixteen patients underwent laryngectomy. MR imaging of cancerous tissue in the larynx, and particularly of non-invaded and invaded cartilages, was examined by comparing MR images with sliced surgical specimens. Pre-operative CT and MRI findings were evaluated by comparing them with postoperative histopathological findings. MR T1-weighted images demonstrate localisation and extent of cancerous tissue. With combined use of T1-weighted and proton-density images MR imaging is superior to CT for showing cartilage invasion. Unfortunately, gross movement artifacts, which resulted in non-diagnostic images, occurred in 16% of the examinations.
