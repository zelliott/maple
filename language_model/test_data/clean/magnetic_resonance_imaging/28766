The purpose of this research was to examine the relationship between horizontal condylar angulation and position and joint status in an adolescent population. Submentovertex (SMV) radiographs and MRI (magnetic resonance images) of 95 subjects (56 females and 39 males) between the ages of 10-17 years (mean age 13.3 years) were used for this study. Horizontal condylar angulation as well as A-P and transverse condyle position were determined in relation to a cranial base reference (a line formed between the two foramina spinosa) from SMV images. Joint status variables consisted of disk length and disk displacement measurements taken from medial, central and lateral sagittal MRI slices of each joint. Additional joint status variables were derived through a principal component analysis which was used to calculate a single disk length, disk displacement, and internal derangement variable for each joint. The results were: 1. No significant correlations (p = .05) were found between any of the joint status variables and horizontal condylar angulation; 2. Statistically significant correlations (r = .14 to .22, p = .05) were observed between certain joint status variables (anterior disk displacement in medial and central joint slices, disk displacement variable, and TMJ internal derangement variable) and transverse condyle position; and, 3. Statistically significant correlations (r = -.22 to .25; p = .05) were observed between condylar angulation and both A-P and transverse condyle position.
