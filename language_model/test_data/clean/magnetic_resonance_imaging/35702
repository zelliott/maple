Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has been largely restricted to patients who are neurologically and hemodynamically stable. The strong magnetic field and radiofrequency transmissions involved in acquiring images are potential sources of interference with monitoring equipment. A method of support and physiological monitoring of critically ill neurosurgical and neurological patients during MR imaging using a 0.6-tesla MR system is reported. This technique has not caused degradation of the MR image due to electrical interference. Adequate preparation and precautions allow many critically ill neurosurgical and neurological patients to safely undergo MR imaging.
