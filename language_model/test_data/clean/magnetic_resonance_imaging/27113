Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) is a rare X-linked disorder characterized by a female body habitus and male genotype. The MÃ¼llerian duct derivatives are absent or rudimentary, and the testes are undescended. Microtia is characterized by a malformed auricle; and in some cases it is genetically transmitted with a non-sex-linked inheritance pattern. The presence of CAIS with microtia has not been documented previously, and this is the first case to describe the radiological findings of this rare presentation.
