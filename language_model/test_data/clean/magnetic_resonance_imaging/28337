Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have been utilized to experimentally measure the velocity profile of fluid/particulate mixtures as a function of flow rate, particle loading, and particle size. The experimental velocity profiles in tube flow were described by a power law model; the power law parameter decreased as flow rate, particle loading, and particle size increase. This work is relevant to aseptic processing of particulate foods.
