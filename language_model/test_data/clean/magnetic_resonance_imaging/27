A primary fibroxanthoma of the central nervous system is very rare. We present a case of an infantile fibroxanthoma that arose from the cranial dura mater in a six-month-old girl with US, MRI and PET/CT features that mimicked a meningioma. The tumor appeared as a large, well-circumscribed echogenic mass in the right parieto-occipital area on US. The tumor was seen as isoattenuated to slightly hypoattenuated on pre-contrast CT scan and as hypometabolic on PET/CT. As seen on T2-weighted image, the mass was heterogeneously hyperintense to the gray matter. The mass was isointense on T1-weighted image and homogeneously strongly enhanced on contrast enhanced T1-weighted image.
