We describe a case of cerebral deep venous and venous sinus thromboses with anti-cardiolipin antibody. A 62-year-old male with no previous illness of thrombosis but with alcohol abuse was admitted with acute onset unconsciousness. He recovered two days after with no severe sequela. Laboratory findings suggested the preceding conditions of dehydration and inflammation. X-ray CT of the head revealed symmetrical low density areas in the thalami and basal ganglia, high density signs in the cerebral deep veins, and dilation of the lateral ventricles. MRI on the second hospital day showed abnormal intensities in the thalami and basal ganglia (high signal on T 2-weighed and FLAIR image, low signals on T 1-weighed image, but almost isointensity on diffusion weighed image) and acute to subacute phase thrombus in the superior sagittal sinus. Abnormal intensities observed on MRI disappeared gradually in the following studies. Venous phase images of cerebral angiography performed in chronic phase disclosed occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus and stenosis of the vein of Galen. These radiological findings support the diagnosis of cerebral deep vein and venous sinus thromboses. Hematological examination revealed positive anti-cardiolipin IgG antibody. Several cases of cerebral deep venous thrombosis with anti-cardiolipin antibody have been reported. In our case, dehydration induced by alcohol abuse would have been the trigger of thrombosis, while the existence of anti-cardiolipin antibody might contribute to the risk of thrombosis as an underlying condition.
