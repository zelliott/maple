Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes a deterioration in functional status which may best be understood as a multi-dimensional concept. Results of multi-modal functional assessment in two patients with probable AD and comparable Mini-Mental State Examination scores demonstrated the heterogeneity of disease profiles and individual variations in functional status. Measures included direct assessment of ADL performance (SAILS), self and family perception of "current" and "best ever" functioning (NBFADL-60), neuropsychological test battery, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). The multi-modal assessment yielded complementary information, and permitted correlation of physiological and behavioral data. Future studies should examine the potential heuristic and clinical utility of this approach.
