Two patients with cervical diastematomyelia are reported here. A nineteen year-old-man (patient 1) admitted to our hospital because of muscular weakness of right upper limb. He noted muscular atrophy of right upper limb at 16 years old, and then paresthesia was gradually aggravated in the ulnar side of the right hand. Physical examination showed muscular atrophy of right upper limb and hypesthesia in the right eight cervical and first thoracic dermatomes. The deep tendon reflexes were decreased in the right upper limb and were increased in the lower limb without pathological reflexes. In electromyographic examination, neurogenic motor units were observed in the upper right limb, dominantly in 1st interosseous muscle (between the fourth cervical and the first thoracic dermatome). Metrizamide computed tomographic (CT) myelography revealed sagittal splitting of the spinal cord from the third to the sixth cervical vertebra, producing two asymmetrical hemicords. A osseous or fibrous septum were not seen. The right hemicord was smaller than the left one. Patient 2 was a twenty-four-year-old woman. She visited our hospital because of muscular weakness of the right upper limb. In physical examination, there were the muscular atrophy of right hand and hypesthesia in the right eighth and first thoracic dermatomes. The deep tendon reflexes were decreased in the right upper limb and were increased in the right lower limb without pathological reflexes. The EMG studies revealed the neurogenic NMU in the right upper limb (between the fourth cervical and the first thoracic dermatome). Magnetic resonance imaging showed marked narrowing of the dural sac in flexion of the neck.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
