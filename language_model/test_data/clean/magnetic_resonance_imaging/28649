MRI can accurately define the extension of cervical carcinoma to the parametria. However, in patients with cervical carcinoma clinical stage IB, the definition of the dimensions of the tumour, prior to surgery, and may also modify the treatment procedure. Recently pre-operative neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been proposed for patients with bulky tumours. Multiple factors may influence the prognosis of clinical stage IB and survival varies greatly among these patients. In particular the maximum dimensions of the tumour seem to have a prognostic relevance. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the potential of MRI to measure tumour size, in order to discriminate between patients needing surgery alone or pre-operative therapy followed by surgery. In 20 patients with clinical stage IB cervical carcinoma we performed MRI to measure the radius of the cervix, the radius of the tumour and their ratios. The measurements obtained have been compared with the corresponding data from histopathology of the operative specimens. The close correspondence between these linear measurements allows us to propose MRI as a reliable method to define tumour size in clinical stage IB patients before surgery.
