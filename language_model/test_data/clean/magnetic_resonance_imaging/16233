The paper underlines the importance of the imagistic examination in the diagnosis and the therapeutical orientation in an orbital injury in a four-year-old child. The orbital injury ends with a foreign body (fragment of a pencil) in the orbit. The situation and the orientation of the foreign body was revealed by the computer tomography and the MIMICS program. Afterwards, the MRI exam ruled out a muscular injury and permitted a correct strabological diagnose and a correct strabismus surgery.
