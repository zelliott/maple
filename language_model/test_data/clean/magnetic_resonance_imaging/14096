A homogeneous spherical volume conductor is used as a model system for the purpose of calculating electric fields induced in the human head by externally applied time-varying magnetic fields. We present results for the case where magnetic field gradient coils, used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), form the magnetic field, and we use these data to put limits on the rates of gradient change with time needed to produce nerve stimulation. The electric field is calculated analytically for the case of ideal longitudinal and transverse linear field gradients. We also show results from computer calculations yielding the electric field maps in a sphere when the field gradients are generated by a real MRI gradient coil set. In addition, the effect of shifting the sphere within each gradient coil volume is investigated. Numerical analysis shows similar results when applied to a model human head.
