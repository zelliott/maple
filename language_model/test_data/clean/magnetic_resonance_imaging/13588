Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivation in the brain caused encephalitis in a 2-year-old immunocompetent child who had chickenpox 20 months before. Radiologic findings were consistent with large to medium-vessel-vasculitis. VZV-DNA was detected in cerebrospinal fluid. Early acquisition of VZV may predispose to major neurologic complications that can occur years after the primary infection.
