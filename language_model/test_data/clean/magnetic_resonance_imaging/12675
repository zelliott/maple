Pelvic floor function and structure are complex, and imaging (integrated with an understanding of physiology) is central to guiding the clinician in managing patients with incontinence, constipation, difficult rectal evacuation and pelvic organ prolapse. Multimodal imaging techniques such as static and dynamic imaging techniques (sometimes combined in a single sitting) have revolutionised our understanding of functional anatomy. The advent of endo-luminal imaging has increased our spatial resolution by its closer proximity to the area of interest. Dynamic imaging gives us a near physiological data set which helps us to simulate what is likely to happen in real life and gives us a better understanding of the multifactorial causes, and consequences, of pelvic floor dysfunction.
