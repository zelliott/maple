To evaluate a slow-flow MR sequence in normal CSF flow and in CSF flow disturbance in cases of spinal stenosis.

The method was tested for flow sensitivity and applied to 67 sites of spinal canal compromise.

Phantom studies show that flow can be depicted at a velocity of 0.5-1 mm/sec. On clinical images, stagnant CSF is black, flowing CSF is bright. Typically, in high-grade (90%-100%) stenosis, CSF above and below the site of spinal canal compromise (SCC) is black. With intermediate stenosis (50%-89%), CSF above the SCC remains white but becomes black distal to the SCC. Low-grade stenosis shows only localized flow disturbances.

This easy-to-use sequence can solidify the MR diagnosis of high-grade stenosis when a distinct flow pattern is recognized. Flow patterns for intermediate and low-grade stenosis are less reliable.
