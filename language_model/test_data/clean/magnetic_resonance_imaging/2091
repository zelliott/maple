The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk of visual outcome after acute optic neuritis (ON) in relation to clinical and MRI findings. Fifty cases of acute ON within one month were retrospectively studied. MRI with Short Tau Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequence of the optic nerve were obtained with a median time onset of 9 days after ON. Mean age of patients was 32.8 years, mean initial visual acuity was 3/10 and orbital pain was present in 86 percent100 of patients. The STIR sequence revealed lesion in 88 percent 100 of acutely symptomatic optic nerves. An initial low visual acuity (less than 2/10), the absence of orbital pain and involvement of the intracanalicular portion of the optic nerve on STIR sequence were statistically correlated with a poorer visual outcome (respectively p=0.0041, p=0.035 and p=0.011).
