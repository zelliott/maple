To study the feasibility and risk of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for children in clinic, and to evaluate the effects of ERCP in diagnosis and treatment of the pancreatic diseases in children.

Totally 98 patients under 14 years of age who underwent ERCP from 1994 to 2011 were enrolled in the study. The data of diagnosis, anesthesia type, treatments, and postoperative complications were collected.

The 98 patients were 4 to 14 years old, of whom 32 cases suffered from acute pancreatitis (30 cases with biliary disease and 2 with hyperlipidemia); 42 cases had chronic pancreatitis, of whom 36 had calculus of pancreatic duct, pancreatic pseudocyst was seen in 6 cases. Pancreas divisum was found in 20 cases, choledochopancreatic junction anomaly in 6 cases,and annular pancreas in 1 case. The operations of dissection of pancreatic duct and biliary duct, calculus removal, insertion of endoprosthesis and draining tube in pancreatic duct or biliary duct were performed. No patients died from ERCP complications. In observation of postoperative complications, acute pancreatitis after ERCP occurred in 1 case, with the incidence rate of 1%, 1 case had bleeding (1%), and 5 cases had hyperamylasemia (5%). All the complications were cured within 1 week. The average hospital stay was 5.51 d.

ERCP is useful and safe in children under suitable condition of doctors and equipments, and no high rates of complications were observed.
