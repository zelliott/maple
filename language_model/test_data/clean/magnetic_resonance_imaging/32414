A 36 year-old man suffered from fever, fatigue, pleurodynia and precordial discomfort. His family physician suspected febrile tracheobronchitis and treated it with ampicillin for 5 days. Because symptoms persisted an ECG was done which suggested acute myocardial infarction. The patient underwent an emergency coronary angiography which excluded coronary artery disease and aortic dissection. Pericarditis was suspected and the patient put on aspirin, 500 mg/d. Because of persisting cardiac symptoms an echocardiography was performed which revealed systolic separation between epi- and pericardium, characteristic of a small pericardial effusion after acute pericarditis. The symptoms improved after one week of treatment with diclofenac and the ECG had become normal. Two months later the patient was seen at our cardiac outpatient clinic. He had night sweats, sporadic precordial pain and severe dyspnoe.

Further investigations revealed tachycardia (120/min), hypotension (95/70 mm Hg), pulsus paradoxus and jugular vein sustension. Echocardiography revealed a large pericardial effusion ("swinging heart"), which explained the low voltage and the electrical alternans in the ECG.

Pericardiocentesis was carried out the same day to relieve the tamponade. It was followed by pericardioscopy and epi- as well as pericardial biopsy. 485 ml of a serous effusion were drained. Cytology and histology demonstrated a lymphocytic fibrinous pericarditis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on viral and bacterial RNA and DNA of potentially cardiotropic agents remained negative. The pigtail catheter was left in place and 80 mg of gentamycin were given intrapericardially on day 1 and 2, followed by 500 mg of crystalloid triamcinolone acetate after the PCR was found to be negative. Oral treatment with 0.5 mg colchicine three times a day (off-label use) was started and maintained for 6 months. After 9 months no effusion was detected and the patient was free of symptoms.

After exclusion of bacterial and viral pericardial infection, a high single dose of intrapericardial triamcinolone combined with long-term oral colchicine has proven to be a highly efficacious treatment of autoreactive pericarditis which will avoid relapses in most cases.
