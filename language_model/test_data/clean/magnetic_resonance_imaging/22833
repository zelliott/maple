Paucity of studies on neurological manifestations in dengue virus infection prompted this study. We aim to correlate clinical, radiological and neurophysiological changes in dengue patients with neurological manifestations.

Consecutive IgM seropositive dengue patients admitted in neurology ward during 2003-2005 have been prospectively evaluated. They were subjected to detailed clinical evaluation, blood counts, coagulation profile, serum chemistry including creatine kinase (CK), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), cranial CT and/or MRI, electroencephalogram (EEG), nerve conduction and needle electromyography (EMG).

There were 17 patients, aged 5 to 56 years; 11 presented with encephalopathy and 6 with acute motor weakness. In the patients with encephalopathy, seizures were present in 3, myoclonus in 1, CSF pleocytosis and EEG slowing in 8 each and globus pallidus and thoracic spinal cord involvement on MRI in 1 patient each. In the pure motor weakness group, CK was elevated in 5 and EMG and muscle biopsy were consistent with myositis in 1 patient each. The patients with pure motor weakness improved completely but in the encephalopathy group 3 died, 2 had partial, 1 poor and 5 complete recovery by 1 month.

Dengue patients presenting with encephalopathy had more severe illness and worse outcome compared to acute pure motor weakness.
