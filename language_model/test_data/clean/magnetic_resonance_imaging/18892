Findings of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a case of testicular lymphoma are presented. The tumor was lower intensity than the normal testis on T2-weighted images. Coronal images clearly showed the tumor extending to the spermatic cord. Compared with seminoma, lymphoma more often invades the epididymis and spermatic cord. MRI is a useful method for differentiating between testicular lymphoma and seminoma because it clearly shows tumor extension to the epididymis and spermatic cord.
