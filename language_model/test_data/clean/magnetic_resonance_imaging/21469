Amaurosis of the right eye occurred in an 18-year-old woman. 17 years later the healthy patient was referred for diagnosis, showing an amaurotic pupil, no protrusion, normal motility and corneal sensitivity, normal morphology of the anterior segment. In ophthalmoscopy optic atrophy with typical retinociliary collateral vessels, calcified and obliterated vessels throughout to the posterior pole and a macular scar. In fluorescein angiography normal choroidal filling, greatly diminished retinal capillary filling, hypofluorescent optical disc with venous shunt to retinociliary collaterals, no preretinal neovascularizations. On cranial CT and nuclear magnetic imaging pathognomonic meningioma of the optic nerve sheaths with tram-tracking lines. Inspite of suprasellar extension no indication to surgical therapy because of normal hormone production.
