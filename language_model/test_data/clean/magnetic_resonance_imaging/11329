The negatively charged contrast agent Gd-DTPA2- distributes inversely to the cartilage fixed charged density. This enables structural cartilage examinations by contrast-enhanced MRI. In line with the development of a clinically applicable protocol for such examinations, this study describes the temporal pattern of Gd-DTPA2- distribution in femoral knee cartilage at three different doses in healthy volunteers. Nineteen volunteers (ages 21-28 years) were examined with a 1.5T MRI system. Quantitative relaxation rate measurements were made in weight-bearing central parts of femoral cartilage using sets of five turbo inversion recovery images with different inversion times. The cartilage was analyzed before and four times (1-4 h) after an intravenous injection of Gd-DTPA2- at single, double, and triple doses: 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mmol/kg body weight, respectively. The increase in R1 postcontrast was linearly dose-related at all times. The highest R1 values were registered at 2 and 3 h postcontrast, suggesting 2 h to be optimal in the clinical situation. The triple dose indicated a subtle compartmental difference in men, with higher contrast distribution medially than laterally. Results suggest that the triple dose is needed to detect minor cartilage matrix differences.
