To study the effect of laser irradiation on normal lumbar discs, a 2100 nm Holmium (HO)-YAG laser irradiation was applied to the 83 lumbar discs of 23 adult rabbits. The extent of disc vaporization, the temperature changes in the surrounding tissues, and changes in the radiograph and MRI findings were assessed after laser irradiation. When laser irradiation was delivered to the discs, the disc weight decreased linearly with the increase in total laser energy, indicating steady vaporization of disc material. The temperature was highest at the site of the guide needle. Laser irradiation was delivered at 0.5 J/pulse or 1.4 J/pulse x 5 pulses/sec to the intervertebral discs, and radiographs and T2-weighted MRI of the irradiated discs were investigated at 1, 4, and at 12 weeks after irradiation. At 1 week after irradiation at 0.5 and 1.4 J/pulse, the radiographs showed a decrease in the disc height. At 12 weeks after irradiation at 0.5 J/pulse, the disc height had restored to normal, while the decrease was persistent after irradiation at 1.4 J/pulse. At 1 week after irradiation, MRI showed a decrease in the signal intensity of discs treated at 0.5 J/pulse, but the decrease was recovered at 12 weeks. After irradiation at 1.4 J/pulse, the decrease in signal intensity was also recovered by 12 weeks, but the recovery was less than the recovery after treatment at 0.5 J/pulse. Laser irradiation is applicable for the treatment of intervertebral discs, but it is necessary to select the optimal operating conditions. It may also be necessary to change the power of irradiation according to the pathological condition of the disc being treated.
