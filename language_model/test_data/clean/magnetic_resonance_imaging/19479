In a seventy-five-year old man an optic nerve coloboma with generalised retinal degeneration associated with a cystic microphthalmia of the other eye is described. The MR imaging revealed the existence of a left microphthalmic eye with a lower lid cyst. From the other eye an optic nerve coloboma with a cystic ectasia of the coloboma area freely open to the vitreous cavity was apparent. The ERG recorded from this eye was extinguished.
