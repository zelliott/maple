This study evaluated the pathology and therapeutic results of seven patients with intraosseous ganglia of the carpal bone. The mean age at the time of surgery was 27.6 years. The lesions were localized in the proximal carpal row in six patients and in the distal carpal row in only one. Surgical treatment was performed in all patients with good bone union. None had pain during activity or at rest and no recurrence had occurred. The intraosseous ganglia in four patients was of the idiopathic type, and in the other three patients was of the penetrating type. Although intraosseous ganglia of the carpal bone is reported as a rare disease, there were 159 cases in the literature. The pathology was intra- or extraosseous development, showing variation, but most cases were localized in the proximal carpal row.
