The authors report a rare case of spontaneous left vertebrovertebral fistula associated with neurofibromatosis Type 1 in a young woman. The patient had undergone previous failed surgical attempts to close the fistula and presented to the authors with recurrence of the fistula and neurological deterioration. Successful obliteration of the fistula with combined transarterial and percutaneous coiling with Guglielmi detachable coils resulted in disappearance of the fistula and significant neurological improvement.
