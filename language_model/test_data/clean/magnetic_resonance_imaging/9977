Multiple sclerosis is now recognized as more than simply a disease of inflammation and demyelination in the brain and spinal cord. Conventional MRI has been established as the most important paraclinical tool in the diagnostic assessment of patients with suspected MS, and in the monitoring of treatment efficacy in clinical trials, at least in relapsing disease. Magnetization-transfer, diffusion-weighted MRI, 1H-MRS, and fMRI improve our ability to quantify the pathological changes in MS in vivo. Although we have gained some insight into the disease and are starting to uncover some of the structural and physiological substrates for the disability that develops in MS patients, we are far from understanding what causes MS and how to prevent its progression. Imaging can be used as a tool to better understand the pathophysiology of MS and ultimately improve on the treatment of MS.
