Case reports and review of the literature.

To review the clinical features, treatment, and outcome of juxtafacet cysts.

There have previously been 4 reported cases of thoracic juxtafacet cysts and 19 cases of cervical juxtafacet cysts. Cervical cysts have usually originated from the cruciate ligament and caused myelopathy. Thoracic cysts are usually signaled by myelopathy.

The records of the Neurosurgery Department of Royal Adelaide Hospital from 1980 through 1995 were reviewed for cases of intraspinal juxtafacet cysts.

Eight cases of intraspinal juxtafacet cysts were identified; six were in the lumbar spine. One patient had a cervical cyst related to a facet joint and had unilateral radiculopathy. A second patient with a thoracic cyst had the gradual onset of myelopathy. Both patients had surgical excision of the cyst without resection of the adherent dura. The symptoms and neurologic signs improved in each case.

Cervical and thoracic juxtafacet cysts are rare lesions that are usually signaled by myelopathy. Results of surgery are excellent in most cases, even if the cyst is not completely excised.
