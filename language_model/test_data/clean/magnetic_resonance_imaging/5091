Although they are one of the most common brain tumours in childhood, pilocytic astrocytomas are rare in adulthood. We report a series of three pilocytic astrocytomas presenting as an intra/suprasellar mass in the fourth to sixth decades of life. All three radiologically mimicked the  appearance of a craniopharyngioma, thus representing a potential radiological and diagnostic pitfall. In this series all three patients underwent successful operative management and have remained well throughout follow-up. The majority of information concerning pilocytic astrocytomas is derived  from paediatric populations and so only limited and often conflicting data exist for pilocytic astrocytomas developing in adulthood. Decisions regarding treatment of pilocytic astrocytomas in adults must be made on a multidisciplinary, case-by-case basis.
