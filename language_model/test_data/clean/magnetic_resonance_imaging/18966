To describe a new treatment modality of olfactory neuroblastoma consisting of endoscopic nasal and paranasal sinus surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery.

Retrospective review of three patients suffering from olfactory neuroblastoma.

Review of the charts, the computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging scans, the operation reports, radiosurgical data, and follow-up.

All three patients remained free of disease with excellent quality of life in respective follow-up periods of 71, 50, and 39 months.

The combination of two minimally invasive therapies, endoscopic sinus surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery, provide a reliable new approach to the treatment of a series of olfactory neuroblastomas that offers excellent quality of life, less injury to the patient, fewer side-effects, and fewer long-term effects than other treatment strategies.
