Neurosarcoma is a rare tumour originating from the sheath of peripheral nerves. Facial lesions have been reported in about 20 patients. We describe the MRI appearances of neurosarcoma with histological correlation in three patients. The lesions lay in the submandibular region, the left parapharyngeal space and the right orbit. MRI showed a well-defined mass with mixed components. The lesions were moderately heterogeneous on T1-weighted images in two cases and on T2-weighted images in all cases. Gadolinium enhancement occurred in all cases to variable degrees. In two cases, small high signal foci were seen on T2-weighted sequences. MRI appearances of neurosarcoma are not specific.
