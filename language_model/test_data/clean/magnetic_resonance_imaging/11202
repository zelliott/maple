The concept of interventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is based on the integration of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, favored by the combination of the excellent morphological and functional imaging characteristics of MRI. The spectrum of MRI-assisted interventions ranges from biopsies and intraoperative guidance to thermal ablation modalities and vascular interventions. The most relevant recently published experimental and clinical results are discussed. In the future, interventional MRI is expected to play an important role in interventional radiology, minimal invasive therapy and guidance of surgical procedures. However, the associated high costs require a careful evaluation of its potentials in order to ensure cost-effective medical care.
