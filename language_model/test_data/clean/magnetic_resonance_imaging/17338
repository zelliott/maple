A laryngocele is a cystic dilatation of the laryngeal saccule. The etiology of laryngoceles is unclear, but congenital and acquired factors are considered to play a role in their development. An acquired laryngocele may develop when the laryngeal ventricle becomes functionally obstructed as a result of an increase in intraglottic pressure, such as that caused by excessive coughing, playing a wind instrument, glass blowing or obstruction of appendicular ostium. We present a case of laryngocele in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis. To the authors' knowledge, and from a review of the literature, this combination has not been previously described. The laryngocele was also infected in this case. We believe that development of the laryngocele might be a result of increased intra-abdominal pressure, caused by rheumatoid arthritis, with associated increased intralaryngeal pressure.
