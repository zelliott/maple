Two cases of unilateral hip pain are reported in which MR arthrography demonstrated a prominent band medial to the ligamentum teres, running in the AP direction, consistent with a hip plica. Both patients underwent hip arthroscopy with resection of the band. No labral tear or additional intra-articular pathological features was identified in either case. Both patients became asymptomatic following surgery and have remained such. The pathology report demonstrated the specimens to be a synovial band with fibroconnective tissue. This is the first MR arthrographic report of the identification and resection of a symptomatic hip plica. The symptomatic plica may represent an alternative diagnosis for mechanical hip pain.
