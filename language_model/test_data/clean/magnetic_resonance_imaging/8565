Three-tesla MR imaging of the knee allows for fast, accurate high-resolution imaging. Three-tesla MR imaging is highly accurate in detection of meniscal tears. This detection aids referring physicians, because if a meniscal tear is not seen on three-tesla MR imaging, it is highly unlikely to be present. High field imaging allows for three-dimensional imaging of the knee. Referring doctors have found this "virtual arthroscopy" to be useful in presurgical planning.
