When a vascular disorder of the cochleovestibular system is considered, the diagnosis is based on exclusion of other diseases. As arteries of the cochleovestibular system cannot be directly visualized, physicians must deduce vascular cochleovestibular disease from the vascular risk factors and vascular lesions of other territories. With my colleagues at Semmelweis University, I analyzed neurootological and audiological examination results in 65 patients with vascular vertigo. Cochleovestibular system disorders can be considered to be of vascular origin if the examinations exclude other diseases, if the patients have vascular risk factors, and if other territories of the brain accessible for imaging methods show vascular disorders.
