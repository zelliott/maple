Hemosiderinuria caused by intravascular hemolysis is a characteristic clinical feature of an acquired hemolytic disorder, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). We examined the deposition of hemosiderin (iron) in the kidneys of 6 patients with PNH using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Three patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), a hemolytic disorder showing extravascular hemolysis, served as controls. In five of the six patients with PNH, a characteristic T2-weighted MRI of the kidneys, suggesting the deposition of iron (hemosiderin) predominantly in the renal cortex, was obtained. Hemosiderin-deposition was not revealed in the kidneys of any of the patients with AIHA. We conclude that MRI is a sensitive means of detecting hemosiderin deposited in the renal cortex of patients with PNH and that this feature is considerably specific for diseases showing intravascular hemolysis, as represented by PNH.
