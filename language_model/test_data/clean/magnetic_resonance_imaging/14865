Volar dislocation of the distal radio-ulnar joint is a rare clinical entity in the orthopaedic literature, and there is little to describe the patho-anatomy, investigative or treatment modalities. We describe the case of an irreducible locked volar dislocation with novel magnetic resonance imaging findings of an ulnar impaction fracture with cartilaginous injury and successful surgical stabilisation using a suture anchor technique.
