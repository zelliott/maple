A case of cerebral venous occlusion is reported. X-ray computed tomography showed a high-density lesion mimicking an intracerebral hemorrhage. In contrast, magnetic resonance images taken at the early clinical stage revealed a high-intensity lesion in both T1- and T2-weighted images. Follow-up magnetic resonance images at the chronic phase revealed that the intensity of this lesion had changed to low in the T1-weighted image, while still being high in the T2-weighted image. These findings suggest that the lesion might be due to venous congestion produced by cerebral venous occlusion rather than hemorrhage into the cerebral parenchyma.
