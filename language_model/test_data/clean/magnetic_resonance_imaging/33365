Sinonasal hemangiopericytomas are rare low-grade sarcomas. The role of endoscopic management has not been adequately studied.

This study was conducted through retrospective medical chart review of patients seen with sinonasal hemangiopericytomas at 2 institutions over a 19-year period. Demographic, clinicopathological, and surgical information was analyzed with descriptive statistics.

Thirteen patients with a diagnosis of sinonasal hemangiopericytomas were treated. The most common symptoms were obstruction (69%) and epistaxis (35%). All tumors were localized in the nasal cavity, and half had extension to 1 or more sinuses. Resection was performed endoscopically in 6 patients. Median intraoperative blood loss was 500 mL; median operative time was 165 minutes. Two patients received postoperative radiation. There were no recurrences with a median follow-up of 25 months. Three patients presented with recurrences, 2 local and 1 distant, up to 13 years after primary tumor removal.

Surgery for sinonasal hemangiopericytomas can be challenging; both endoscopic and open approaches may be used to treat these highly vascular tumors.
