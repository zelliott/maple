Apparent diffusion coefficient maps of two patients with cyclosporine-induced neurotoxicity showed areas of increased diffusion that corresponded to the characteristic regions of signal change on routine T2-weighted sequences. The majority of lesions subsequently resolved without residual T2 or diffusion signal alteration. These findings suggest that, in our patients, the neurotoxic effects of cyclosporine resulted in a partially reversible extravasation of fluid into the cerebral interstitium and were not associated with acute ischemia.
