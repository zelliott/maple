Chronic liver disease alters the gross architecture of the liver and its arterial and portal blood supply. The relative proportion of regenerative hepatocytes, necrosis, extracellular interstitial space, and fibrosis is responsible for liver enhancement after the administration of a contrast agent. Because contrast agents can be directed toward either the extracellular or the intracellular spaces, knowledge of the different parenchymal enhancement alterations seen after the administration of these agents is necessary to understand how chronic liver disease pathologic changes influence contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images. This article reviews the effect of chronic liver disease on MR contrast enhancement, as well as the effect of altered enhancement on lesion detection and characterization. Both extracellular and intracellular contrast agents are considered.
