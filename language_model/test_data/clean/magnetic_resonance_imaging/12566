There is a need for higly accurate non-invasive methods for assessing organ iron content in thalassaemia patients. This study evaluated the relation between serum ferritin level, liver enzyme levels and hepatitis C antibody and liver and heart iron deposition assessed by MRI T2*. Data were obtained from the medical records of 156 thalassemia major patients in Tehran. There was a moderate negative correlation between serum ferritin and liver MRI T2* relaxation time (r = -0.535) and a weak negative correlation between serum ferritin and heart MRI T2* relaxation time (r = -0.361). Hepatitis C infection and liver enzyme levels did not confound or modify the relation between ferritin and liver or heart MRI T2*. Liver and heart MRI T2* readings were poorly correlated (r = 0.281). Routine evaluation of liver and heart iron content using MRI T2* is suggested to better evaluate the haemosiderosis status in thalassemia patients.
