A 38-year-old man presented with personality change, postural tremor of the right arm and leg, and right hemidysesthesia. MR imaging (MRI) revealed left hemisphere dominant brain atrophy and leuko-araiosis in the deep white matter. Serological test of serum and cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated high titers of antibodies to Treponema pallidum. He was diagnosed as Lissauer's general paresis based on the clinical symptoms and signs, and MRI findings. This disorder is characterized by focal cerebral atrophy, corresponding to focal neurologic signs. Neuropathological features in Lissauer's general paresis are spongiform atrophy of the cerebral cortex and demyelination of the white matter. Leuko-araiosis on MRI in our case may represent demyelination of the white matter. Although MRI findings in general paresis are usually nonspecific, this is, as far as we know the first case report of general paresis with MRI showing focal cerebral atrophy and leuko-araiosis.
