A case of a primary lumbar epidermoid tumor is described. Intraspinal epidermoid tumors are rare. The differential diagnosis on this case was a nerve sheath tumor, such as aschwannoma, as the tumor entered the dural sac and caused dural ectasia. The diagnostic pitfalls of this feature of the tumor are discussed.
