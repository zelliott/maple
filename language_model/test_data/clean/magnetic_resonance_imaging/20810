Rhinosporidiosis is a chronic infection caused by the organism Rhinosporidium seeberi. It is endemic in parts of southern India and Sri Lanka, but rarely seen outside these areas. The infection predominantly affects the nasal mucosa; however, it can also affect the ocular surface and adnexa. We present a case of rhinosporidiosis initially involving the lacrimal sac, with recurrence in the periocular subcutaneous tissues, nasolacrimal duct and nasopharynx.
