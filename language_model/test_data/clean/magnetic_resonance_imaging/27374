Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is typically presented with severe headaches where, vascular imaging demonstrates multiple intracranial arterial narrowing. Variable triggers are related to RCVS, such as serotonin agents and bromocriptine. Thus, a detailed medication history is important. Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is not uncommon in RCVS. Repeat vascular imaging at 2-3 months with complete reversal of the narrowed vessels confirms the diagnosis of RCVS. The authors present a case where use of triptan along with multiple psychotropic medications, was associated with RVCS. Neuroimaging demonstrated focal SAH and diffuse beaded appearance involving the intracranial vasculature. The patient improved clinically with oral nimodipine treatment. Repeat angiography and a follow-up transcranial Doppler showed complete resolution of vasoconstriction. In the setting of acute severe headache, with any 'red flags', it is important to evaluate the medication use and other precipitating risks for RVCS. Vascular imaging is the key for diagnosis.
