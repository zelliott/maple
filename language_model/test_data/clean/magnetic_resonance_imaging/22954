To evaluate joints alterations, we performed clinical examination, X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Denver score) in 165 joints of 40 children with severe (n, 32) or moderate (n, 8) haemophilia A or B. All investigated joints had a history of more than three bleeds. At evaluation, 25 of 40 haemophilic patients were on prophylaxis for the last 1-8 years (mean: 3.5 years). MRI revealed chronic synovitis in 55.4% and 50% of joints, which were diagnosed, as normal by the clinical scale and plain radiography respectively. Moreover, MRI unmasked more profound alterations than those observed by plain radiography in 70% of cases. Statistical analysis showed that the clinical and Pettersson scores in contrast to the Denver score provide an underestimation of arthritic changes. Besides, Denver score did not provide resolution in differentiating stages of arthropathy, because of its inherent nature; however, a score of 6 expressing severe synovitis seemed to be the cut-off value for the distinction of severe cases. Based on MRI findings we intensified prophylaxis in nine children and initiated it in another nine children. Five children, who were already on prophylaxis complied with our recommendations and eliminated haemorrhages. Finally, three boys with severe haemophilic arthropathy in knees underwent successful chemical synovectomy with rifampicin.
