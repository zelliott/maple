Upside-down reversal of vision has rarely been reported in the literature. The reported causes are diverse, including posterior circulation stroke, tumors, trauma, and multiple sclerosis. The term seizure has been used in only two cases in the literature, the cause of which was stroke. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of cortical dysplasia in the posterior parietal cortex as the cause of complex partial seizures beginning with upside-down reversal of vision. As the pathophysiological characteristics of this phenomenon remain unclear, this case implies that the posterior parietal cortex is a possible anatomical localization of the central integrator of visual extra-personal orientation.
