(1) To determine whether functional MR can reliably map functional deficits in patients with stroke in the primary visual cortex; (2) to determine whether functional MR can reliably map perfusion deficits; and (3) to determine whether functional MR can give any additional diagnostic information beyond conventional MR.

Seven patients who had had a stroke in their primary visual system were examined using two functional MR techniques: (1) dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging, and (2) cortical activation mapping during full-field visual stimulation. Maps of relative cerebral blood volume and activation were created and compared with visual field examinations and conventional T2-weighted images on a quadrant-by-quadrant basis in five of these patients.

Visual field mapping matched with both T2-weighted conventional images and activation mapping of 16 of 18 quadrants. In two quadrants, the activation maps detected abnormalities that were present on the visual field examination but not present on the T2-weighted images nor on the relative cerebral blood volume maps, which may indicate abnormal function without frank infarction. In addition, the activation maps demonstrated decreased activation in extrastriate cortex and had normal T2 signal and relative cerebral blood volume but was adjacent to infarcted primary cortex, mapping in vivo how stroke in one location can affect the function of distant tissue.

Functional MR techniques can accurately map functional and perfusion deficits and thereby provide additional clinically useful information. Additional studies will be needed to determine the prognostic utility of functional MR in stroke patients.
