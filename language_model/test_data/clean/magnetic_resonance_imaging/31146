Magnetic resonance (MR) microimaging of the human is becoming increasingly common for studies of tissue microstructure and microfunction. In this study, we consider the constraints that such experiments place on the design of radio-frequency (rf) coils, and describe the advantages of multiring coils, which offer a locally uniform B(1) field. We show that these coils are particularly suitable for high-field imaging of a restricted region of larger experimental animals or humans, offering the same simplicity and efficient use of rf power as a simple surface coil but without requiring sequence modifications such as adiabatic pulses. Imaging results are shown from human brain and from the abdominal aorta of an experimental animal.
