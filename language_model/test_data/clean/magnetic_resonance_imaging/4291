Magnetic resonance imaging has revolutionized the noninvasive evaluation of degenerative disc disease and its complications. Compared with computed tomography and computed tomographic myelography, magnetic resonance allows specific determination of the nature of disc protrusions and other degenerative related soft tissues about the spine. Magnetic resonance offers the most complete evaluation of specific degenerative disorders including degenerative facet disease, spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, spontaneous lumbar epidural hematomas, and juvenile discogenic disease.
