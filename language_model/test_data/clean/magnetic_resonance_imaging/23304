Simultaneous EEG-fMRI measurements can combine the high spatial resolution of fMRI with the high temporal resolution of EEG. Therefore, we applied this approach to the study of peripheral vision. More specifically, we presented visual field quadrant fragments of checkerboards and a full central checkerboard in a simple detection task. A technique called "integration-by-prediction" was used to integrate EEG and fMRI data. In particular, we used vectors of single-trial ERP amplitude differences between left and right occipital electrodes as regressors in an ERP-informed fMRI analysis. The amplitude differences for the regressors were measured at the latencies of the visual P1 and N1 components. Our results indicated that the traditional event-related fMRI analysis revealed mostly activations in the vicinity of the primary visual cortex and in the ventral visual stream, while both P1 and N1 regressors revealed activation of areas in the temporo-parietal junction. We conclude that simultaneous EEG-fMRI in a spatial detection task can separate visual processing at 100-200 ms from stimulus onset from the rest of the information processing in the brain.
