Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) infection is a rare event in paediatric patients and often occurs under immunosuppression or after surgical intervention. We report what we believe to be the first paediatric case of ventriculitis due to VRE (in a 2-month-old infant) to be successfully treated with combined intravenous (i.v.) and intraventricular chloramphenicol after failure of i.v. linezolid and intraventricular gentamicin.
