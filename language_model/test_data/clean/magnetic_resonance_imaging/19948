Intravenous lipoleiomyomatosis (LPL) is a rare benign tumor composed of fat and smooth muscle. Intravenous LPL is a rare subtype of intravenous leiomyomatosis (IVL), of which only four cases have been reported. We report a case of intravenous LPL that extended into the inferior vena cava and right atrium. The imaging findings in this case were reported. A review of the world literature revealed no previous description of the imaging findings in a case of intravenous LPL. We discussed the reported imaging findings of typical IVL and briefly discussed relevant clinical features of intravenous LPL and IVL.
