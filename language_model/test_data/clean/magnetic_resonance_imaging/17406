Tumors and tumor-like lesions of the hand are more frequently benign lesions. Plain film X-rays must be obtained in all patients since they are extensive and panoramic. Ultrasound can accurately assess the internal structure of the mass and its relation with adjacent nerves and vessels. MRI is particularly sensitive to bone marrow and is highly effective in characterizing a wide variety of soft tissue conditions. However, CT remains the method of choice for evaluating bone involvement of soft tissue tumors and small bone tumors such as osteoid oteoma. Where a malignant tumor is considered, thoraco-abdominal and/or bone scintigraphy are essential to evaluate the presence of metastatic lesions.
