An improved homogeneity-spoiling local gradient insert has been constructed and built into the patient bed to reduce its impact on bore size and setup time. It allows the field of view to be reduced without introducing aliasing artifacts. Image quality and artifacts were evaluated for pulse sequences relevant to cardiac imaging. The utility of the insert is demonstrated by a contrast-enhanced perfusion study, in which the reduced field of view allowed a 25% increase in resolution and one more slice to be imaged per heartbeat.
