A liver transplant recipient with hepatitis C presented with unexplained dyspnea, fatigue and edema. Diagnostic evaluation revealed a pericardial effusion with echocardiographic features of tamponade. The patient underwent therapeutic pericardial drainage, resulting in symptomatic relief. The pericardial fluid tested positive for hepatitis C virus (viral quantitation of 200,000 copies/mL, genotype 1b) and negative for other plausible etiologies. Pericardial biopsy revealed normal tissue. This is the fifth case of hepatitis C virus-associated pericardial disease worldwide and the first case in North America. It is the first in a liver transplant recipient. In contrast to previous reports, this patient demonstrated tamponade in the absence of cryoglobulinemia or systemic extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis C.
