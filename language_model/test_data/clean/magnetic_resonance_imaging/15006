The purpose of this presentation is to allow the radiologist to discuss the diagnosis of retroperitoneal schwannoma, involving mostly a fortuitous discovery and a misleading clinical presentation. We present 4 cases of retroperitoneal schwannoma, two having benefited from a surgery and two others of a therapeutic abstention. The retropritoneal localization and the imaging are good indicator elements of this pathology. The constant improvement of the CT and MR imaging allows a better approach of this entity also by specifying its localization and its anatomical relationships to guide the therapeutic attitude which must be remain mutidisciplinary.
