We report on the magnetic resonance findings in two patients with hemorrhagic cystitis secondary to radiation therapy. One patient's bladder wall was high in signal intensity on T1-weighted fat-suppressed spoiled gradient echo and low in signal intensity on T2-weighted fat-suppressed spin echo images, findings consistent with intracellular methemoglobin in the setting of subacute intramural hemorrhage. The second patient's bladder wall had regions that were low in signal intensity on T1-weighted fat-suppressed spin echo and high in signal intensity on T2-weighted fat-suppressed spin echo, and other regions that were high in signal intensity on T1-weighted fat suppressed spin echo and on T2-weighted fat-suppressed spin echo images, findings that were consistent with active bleeding and late subacute hemorrhage, respectively. Imaging findings correlated with the patients' clinical picture. Our two cases illustrate that magnetic resonance images may demonstrate changes of hemorrhagic cystitis and may permit determination of disease acuity.
