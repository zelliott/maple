Color Doppler echocardiography has limitations, particularly in the assessment of valvular regurgitation and pericardial diseases. MRI, with the help of three dimensional morphologic data, dynamic acquisitions with cine techniques and functional evaluation with flow sensitive techniques can be envisioned as a complementary noninvasive procedure able to provide the complete information required for planning therapeutic options. Qualitative as well as accurate and reproducible quantitative information (volume measurements, cardiac function and flow velocity profiles) are unique for the evaluation of the severity of valve or pericardial diseases. Multislice CT is unique in precisely demonstrating valvular and pericardial calcifications. This article reviews both imaging techniques used in assessing valvular and pericardial disease and discusses the advantages and limitations of these techniques in current clinical applications.
