This article focuses on the evolution of deep brain stimulation (DBS) targets within the brain, beginning with the discovery of DBS's potential in non-Parkinson disease movement disorders. DBS has gained in popularity and applicability for a growing number of neuropathologic conditions with neural network disorders and dysfunction. Targets within the brain have been based frequently on historical sites used for ablative surgeries in years past, derived from experiment and experience but also have arisen via elucidation of neural networks, transmitter function and location, disease neuropathology, and also, fortuitous discovery.
