To define clinical and radiological characteristics of nasal septal schwannoma, and to propose endoscopic surgery.

We report a case of an isolated schwannoma of the anterior part of the nasal septum, without involvement of any local structure. The only preoperative symptom was nasal obstruction. Imaging study included a CT scan and an MRI study.

Schwannoma is a sheath tumor originating from Schwann cells of peripheral nerves. It rarely occurs in nasal and paranasal sinuses and its development on the nasal septum is extremely rare. Complete removal of the tumor was performed by endoscopic sinus surgery technique. Limits of the excision were free of tumor and the histological type was Antoni type A Schwannoma. After a year of follow up, the patient is free of recurrence.

The Schwannoma of the nasal septum is a rare tumour whose clinical and radiological diagnosis by CT scan and IRM is relatively easy. Its treatment is surgical and the endoscopic surgery can be proposed in the forms slightly extensive.
