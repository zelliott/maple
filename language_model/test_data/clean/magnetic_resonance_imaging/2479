The results are presented of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine in two cases of childhood Guillain-Barré syndrome. After injection of gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, MRI showed enhancement of the cauda equina in these patients. These MRI observations may help confirm the diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome. The nerve root enhancement resolved as the clinical symptoms improved. Serial imaging may be useful in monitoring the response to therapy and assessing new treatment regimens. It may also yield a better understanding of the disease process.
