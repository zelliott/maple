To describe 2 patients in whom squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva developed in the anophthalmic socket more than 44 years after enucleation and chronic use of an ocular prosthesis.

Retrospective case reports.

These 2 patients did not have known risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma, including solar ultraviolet radiation or exposure (since they wore their prosthesis full-time), HIV infection, chronic orbital inflammatory disease, or immune-compromising systemic disease. Both patients had an orbital exenteration and underwent a full work-up including evaluation of the regional lymph nodes and systemic work-up to rule out distant metastasis.

Squamous cell carcinoma of the anophthalmic socket can develop many years after enucleation. Regular inspection of the anophthalmic socket containing a prosthesis to rule out conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma is prudent.
