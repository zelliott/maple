Intra-osseous haemangioma is a rare, benign neoplasm that usually involves the vertebrae and craniofacial bones. Furthermore, its occurrence in the long bones is extremely rare. We report the findings of fluorine-18-fludeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT and MRI in a patient with intra-osseous haemangioma in the proximal tibia, who was initially misdiagnosed as having a malignancy based on (18)F-FDG PET/CT. (18)F-FDG PET/CT showed a well-marginated osteolytic lesion with abnormal FDG uptake. The mass demonstrated low signal intensity on T(1) weighted MRI. On T(2) weighted images, the lesion appeared as a cluster of high signal intensity lobules and showed strong enhancement on contrast-enhanced T(1) weighted images. Surgical curettage was performed and histopathological examination of the excised tissue confirmed a cavernous haemangioma.
