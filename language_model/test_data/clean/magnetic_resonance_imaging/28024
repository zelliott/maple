Severe neurological deficits directly related to intraoperative injury of the spinal cord and the nerve roots is a rare complication of anterior interbody fusion (AIF) in cervical spondylosis. A case of radiculopathy and Brown-SÃ©quard Syndrome caused by a bone fragment following AIF in which a late anterior decompression and fusion of the cervical spine was performed four years after the initial operation is presented. Immediate relief of the radicular pain, improvement of the spasticity, and better sphincter control could be achieved. Therefore, patients with chronic anterior compression of an incomplete spinal cord injury after AIF may benefit from a late anterior decompression and fusion.
