Primary angiosarcoma of the spleen is a rare entity, but it is the most common primary splenic malignancy. These tumors demonstrate an aggressive growth pattern and can be single or multiple. The diagnosis should be suspected in a patient who presents with splenomegaly but without evidence of lymphoma, malaria, leukemia, or portal hypertension. The tumor may also present with acute abdominal symptoms secondary to spontaneous splenic rupture. We describe two cases of primary angiosarcoma of the spleen with computed tomographic, magnetic resonance, and sonographic features.
