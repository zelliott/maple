The detection of inflammatory and tumorous conditions of the colon is one of the main topics in current abdominal radiology. The barium enema was introduced first in 1923 by Fischer, and has represented the workhorse of intestinal diagnostics for decades.

This article provides an overview of the most important entities of inflammatory and tumorous changes of the colon.
