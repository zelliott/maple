Myositis ossificans circumscripta is a benign pathology of soft tissue occurring in young patients often after localized trauma. Histological and radiological appearances may mimic a malignant neoplasm, mainly sarcoma. We report a case characteristic of myositis ossificans circumscripta, to illustrate diagnostic arguments which are based on their appearance on conventional radiographs, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging and on their changes with time.
