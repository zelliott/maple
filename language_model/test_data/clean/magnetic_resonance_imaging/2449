Infantile myofibromatosis is a mesenchymal tumor most commonly seen in infancy. The tumors have a variable appearance on CT/MR and often simulate a more aggressive neoplasm. This report describes CT/MR findings in cases of infantile myofibromatosis with pathologic correlation. Discussion into the success of imaging in suggesting the correct diagnosis is also addressed.
