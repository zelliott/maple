Magnetic resonance imaging is the modality of choice for investigation of internal derangement of the knee. The reporting radiologist must be familiar with both normal anatomy and anatomical variants within the knee, in order to avoid mis-diagnosis, over-investigation and unnecessary intervention. This article reviews the recognised anatomical variants of the non-ligamentous/musculotendinous structures of the knee, their anatomy, incidence and typical appearances on MRI.
