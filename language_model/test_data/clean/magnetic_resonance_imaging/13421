The radiographic findings of perirenal amyloidosis have not previously been described. A patient with multiple myeloma and primary amyloidosis (AL) with secondary hydronephrosis as examined on plain film, retrograde ureteropyelography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging is presented. This case illustrates perirenal amyloidosis and demonstrates the utility of CT and MRI in patient management and surgical treatment.
