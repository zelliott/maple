A 58-year-old female with pineocytoma developed intratumoral hemorrhage after ventriculoperitoneal shunting for hydrocephalus. Neurological examination revealed Parinaud's sign and papilledema. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed a pineal neoplasm and obstructive hydrocephalus. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid levels of human chorionic gonadotropin, alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, and placental alkaline phosphatase were negative or within normal limits. MR images after the ventriculoperitoneal shunting disclosed intratumoral hemorrhage and markedly smaller ventricles. The tumor was totally removed via the occipital transtentorial approach and was diagnosed histologically as a pineocytoma with astrocytic differentiation. The tumor probably shifted away from the surrounding structures following the marked reduction in ventricular size after ventriculoperitoneal shunting, resulting in changed venous circulation in the tumor and the formation of intratumoral hematoma.
