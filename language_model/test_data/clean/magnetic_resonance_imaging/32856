Bisphosphonates are widely used for prevention of fractures in patients at risk, mainly in the presence of osteoporosis and bone metastases. A number of adverse effects of prolonged bisphosphonate treatment have emerged. We would like to highlight the skeletal complications from which a radiologist may be the first healthcare professional to recognise the association with bisphosphonate therapy. We illustrate these complications (namely osteonecrosis of the jaw and less well-known atypical femoral shaft fractures), presenting radiological findings in our patients. Recommendations for safer use of bisphosphonates are included in the conclusion of our review.
