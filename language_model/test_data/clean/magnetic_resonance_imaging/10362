The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the anatomical variability of the superior labrum and to compare the value of MR arthrography and multi-slice CT arthrography in the diagnosis of variants of the labro-bicipital complex. Forty-three human shoulder specimens (age range and mean age at death, 61-89 years and 78.3 years) were examined with the use of MR arthrography and multi-slice CT arthrography prior to joint exploration and macroscopic inspection of the superior labrum and labro-bicipital complex. Two radiologists evaluated MR and CT arthrograms, and the results were compared with macroscopic assessments. Anatomical dissection of all shoulder specimens revealed a sublabral recess in 32/43 (74%) cases. The attachment of the superior labrum was categorised as type 1 in ten (23%) cases, as type 2 in eight (19%), as type 3 in ten (23%), and as type 4 in 14 (33%) cases. One superior labrum showed detachment consistent with a superior labral anteroposterior (SLAP) type 3 lesion. On MR arthrography and CT arthrography the attachment of the superior labrum was categorised in concordance with macroscopic assessments in 79% and 84% of cases, respectively. The anteroposterior extension of sublabral recesses was accurately determined with MR and CT arthrography in 59% and 81% of cases, respectively. The attachment of the superior labrum shows considerable variability. Thus, exact depiction of variants is essential in order to avoid the false positive diagnosis of a superior labral tear (SLAP or Andrews lesion). Both, MR arthrography and multi-slice CT arthrography were effective in the detection and classification of sublabral recesses.
