Pineocytoma and pineoblastoma are now recognised as a spectrum of the same disease. Three cases of pineocytoma (grade I-II) are presented, in which platinum-based chemotherapy was used with some success, either as part of primary therapy or at the time of relapse. With the recent reclassification of pineal parenchymal tumours into a grade I-IV continuum, the place of chemotherapy, previously only well-established in pineoblastoma, is discussed.
