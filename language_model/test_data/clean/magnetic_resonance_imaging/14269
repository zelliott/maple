Computed tomography was performed on 40 patients with recent hip trauma. Radiographs of 25 showed a fracture of the femoral neck with slight displacement; 24 of these had intra-articular fluid and 20 had a lipohaemarthrosis on the CT scan. In 15 patients, radiographs at the time of admission were normal but suspicion of fracture remained. A fracture was later verified in five patients, four of whom had lipohaemarthrosis on admission. In the remaining 10 patients no fracture could be detected; only one patient had a hip joint effusion but no free fat. Thus all 24 patients with lipohaemarthrosis had an intracapsular fracture of the hip. We suggest CT for patients with hip trauma and negative radiographs. The presence of a lipohaemarthrosis of the hip strongly suggests an intra-articular fracture of either the femoral neck or the acetabulum.
