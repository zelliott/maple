To investigate the role of screening magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the detection of synchronous contralateral breast cancer in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer.

Between January 1999 and July 2001, 182 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer (after either core or excisional biopsy with positive or close margins of resection) underwent bilateral contrast material-enhanced MR imaging at 1.5 T with a dedicated bilateral breast multicoil array. The contralateral breast was imaged for cancer screening. Family history of breast cancer, index cancer histology, breast density, and age at diagnosis of first breast cancer were assessed as potential risk factors for synchronous contralateral breast cancer.

Fifteen patients (8.2%) had a suspicious enhancing lesion depicted in the contralateral breast. Seven patients (3.8%) had malignant results: ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in four, invasive ductal carcinoma with DCIS in two, and invasive ductal carcinoma in one. Eight patients (4.4%) had benign results: fibrocystic changes in four, atypical ductal hyperplasia in two, atypical lobular hyperplasia and focal lobular carcinoma in situ in one, and ductal hyperplasia in one. Six patients with negative MR findings underwent prophylactic mastectomy; no malignancy was found. No significant differences were noted among patients with true-positive (n = 7), false-positive (n = 8), or negative (n = 167) MR findings with regard to family history of breast cancer (P <.27), index cancer histology (P <.19), breast density (P <.34), or age at diagnosis of first breast cancer (P <.10).

The preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of using MR imaging of the breast in a screening role, specifically to evaluate the contralateral breast in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer to detect mammographically and clinically occult synchronous breast cancer.
