To discuss the diagnosis of giant coronary aneurysms.

We describe three patients in whom initial echocardiographic findings suggested cardiac tumors in the right atrium. Additional examination proved the tumor-like structures to be giant atherosclerotic coronary aneurysms of either the right coronary artery or its saphenous vein coronary bypass graft.

Giant coronary aneurysms are an important differential diagnosis for cardiac tumors.
