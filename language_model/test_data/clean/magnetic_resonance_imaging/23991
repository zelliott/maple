The aim of this pictorial review is to describe applications of cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) using half-Fourier (HASTE) MR sequences.

350 patients were imaged over a four-year period with a 1.54 Tesla Siemens Vision scanner and a phased array body coil. The HASTE MR sequence was applied in multiple planes with an acquisition time of 13 seconds allowing breath hold techniques. In addition, a single-shot technique provided single slice acquisitions with a thickness of 20 mm. A chemical fat suppression algorithm reduced intra-abdominal MR high signal.

HASTE MRCP accurately determines the presence of level of biliary obstruction in up to 97% of patients. Common bile duct stones are detected with a sensitivity of 93%. Acute cholecystitis is depicted on HASTE MR as pericholecystic high signal in 41/45 (91%) patients and gall stones are detected with a 93% sensitivity.

HASTE MRCP offers a non-invasive, rapid imaging method to evaluate the gallbladder, common bile duct and pancreas. Its multi-planar, fluid sensitive capabilities are of particular value in detecting common bile duct stones and acute cholecystitis.
