Appreciating the complexity and evolving pathophysiology after palliation of CHD is critical to improving the outcome. Despite a growing patient population because of greater survival over the years, detailed data on the long-term outcomes of these patients is surprisingly sparse. The establishment in 2001 of the Pediatric Heart Network by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute has provided a collaborative multicenter platform to conduct large trials in CHD and to characterize outcomes. This chapter has emphasized how CHD care spans the continuum from fetal life to adulthood. Current research efforts aspire to better characterize short-term and long-term outcomes, continue advancement of technologies to better diagnose and treat CHD, and to elucidate the role of genetics and biomarkers in predicting outcome. Focused studies on variations in perioperative practice and quality will help us provide better clinical outcomes for CHD survivors.
