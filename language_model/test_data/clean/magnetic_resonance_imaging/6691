This article examines the injection of megavolumes of autologous fat cells as a means of buttock augmentation in 162 patients over a 7-year period. The author documents the use of magnetic resonance imaging in six patients to visualize the intramuscular location, integration, and duration of the injected fat. With the patient under epidural or general anesthesia, fat cells were harvested with a 5-mm blunt cannula and then stored in an empty sterile intravenous bag or bottle trap. Decantation was the only process used to separate the fat cells from the saline and serosanguineous components. Up to 1260 cc of fat cells were been injected into each buttock, the largest amount of fat grafting ever reported. Clinical assessment estimated a 20 percent loss of augmentation effect during the first 4 months. Patients were generally pleased with the final shape and volume of the buttock contour. In follow-up evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging supported the clinical indicators that the injection of large quantities of fat cells appears to be a safe and effective method for buttock enhancement. This process has inherent advantages; nevertheless, further research is required to clarify our understanding of the predictability and longevity of this technique.
