The N100m wave response of the auditory evoked magnetic field originates in the posterior part of the bilateral superior temporal planes for either contra- or ipsilateral ear stimulus. Cortical auditory function was evaluated in 14 patients with temporal lobe tumors using a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-linked whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) system. Before surgery, seven patients had normal N100m latency (within the range of the mean +/- 2 standard deviations of 37 normal volunteers) in both normal hemispheres and in those with lesions, and MR imaging indicated no tumor invasion or edema in the posterior one-third of the superior temporal planes, even when the sylvian fissure was shifted upward due to the mass effect. Seven patients had prolonged N100m latency or absence of N100m in the hemisphere containing the lesion, and the posterior portion of the superior temporal plane was involved by the tumor or perifocal edema. Prolonged N100m latency recovered to the normal range after removal of tumors in two of four patients investigated postoperatively. The MEG system can be used to evaluate cortical auditory function noninvasively before and after surgical treatment of temporal lobe tumors.
