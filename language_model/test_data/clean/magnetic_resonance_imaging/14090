Evaluation of accordance and reproducibility of the stroke volume assessment of fast flow measurement in breathhold technique in the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunc with fast right (RV) and left ventricular (LV) cine-MRI.

The correlation an accordance of stroke volumes (SV) were evaluated by flow measurements in the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunc and RV and LV volumetric cine-MRI in 33 cardiac healthy volunteers. Interobserver and intraobserver variability of the different measurement methods and locations were checked in 10 cardiac healthy volunteers.

With respect to the early systolic flow and the extrapolation of the endiastolic flow rate the difference in SV was smaller than 1,5 ml/m(2) for all possible combinations. The interobserver and intraobserver variabilities of flow measurements were significantly lower by approximately a factor of 2.5 than those of RV and LV cine-MRI.

The accordance of fast prospective triggered flow measurements in the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunc with RV and LV cine-MRI can be achieved with reasonable limits of agreement. Flow measurements are more reproducible than cine-MRI.
