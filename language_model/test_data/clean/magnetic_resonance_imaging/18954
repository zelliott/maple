The authors report on the case of a 29-year-old man who presented with new-onset, generalized tonic-clonic seizures 11 years after being treated with a halo orthosis for a neurologically intact C-7 fracture. Neuroimaging and surgical findings indicated that the epileptic focus was scar tissue, which developed secondary to halo pin penetration of the skull. This complication of halo orthosis has not yet been reported in the literature.
