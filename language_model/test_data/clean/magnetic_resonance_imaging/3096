A 71-year-old woman developed complete third nerve palsy and total blindness of the right eye one month after completing a course of radiotherapy for sphenoid sinus carcinoma over a 13-month period. Differential diagnosis included recurrence of the tumor, radiation-induced second neoplasm, empty sella with chiasmal prolapse and secondary chiasmal arachnoid adhesions, and radionecrosis. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated gadolinium contrast enhancement of the right intracranial optic nerve and chiasm, suggesting a radionecrosis process.
