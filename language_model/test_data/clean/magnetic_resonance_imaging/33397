The purpose of this study was to determine if a consistent relationship exists between (1) flow in the portal vein and superior mesenteric vein and (2) flow in the mesenteric arteries.

Cine phase-contrast methods were used to determine volumetric flow in the celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, portal vein, and superior mesenteric vein in 11 healthy volunteers.

The mean (+/- SD) volumetric flow rates in the celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, superior mesenteric vein, and portal vein were 9.9 +/- 3.2, 6.0 +/- 1.8, 5.7 +/- 2.0, and 13.7 +/- 1.8 ml/min per kilogram, respectively. A strong correlation was found between measured mesenteric arterial blood flow, defined as the sum of flow in the celiac axis and the superior mesenteric artery, and portal venous flow (r = .97, p = .00002). Good agreement was found between flow in the superior mesenteric artery and that in the superior mesenteric vein (r = .98; p = .00001; bias = 20 ml/min).

There is a consistent relationship between MR measurements of flow in the portal or superior mesenteric vein and the measured flow in the arteries supplying those veins. Flow in the superior mesenteric vein is an accurate predictor of flow in the superior mesenteric artery.
