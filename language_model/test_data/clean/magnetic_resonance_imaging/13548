Hemospermia or hematospermia is a common benign condition, but its prevalence remains unknown and can result from several causes. The aetiology is idiopathic in about 30-70% of the cases. The hemospermia is first of inflammatory origin, in the young patients, where it is due to uretroprostatitis or orchi-epididymitis, but in the older, it is due to a benign of malignant prostatic tumors. Transrectal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging can afforded the opportunity to best investigate the patients with hemospermia. Hemospermia is not an uncommon problem and in most instances has little clinical significance other than evoking much anxiety for the patient. In view of the literature, the authors discus the diagnostic and therapeutic approach of hemospermia through a series of seven cases.
