Spontaneous oesophageal dissection with intramural haematoma formation is an uncommon form of oesophageal injury with a characteristic imaging appearance. We report the clinical and radiological features of a 66-year-old woman presenting with acute onset chest pain, where computed tomography revealed a large haematoma within the wall of the thoracic oesophagus. The patient responded well to conservative management. Magnetic resonance imaging, performed seven days after the initial presentation, confirmed the resolution of the lesion.
