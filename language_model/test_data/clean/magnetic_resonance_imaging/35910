Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used in 45 renal transplant investigations (38 patients) using a Picker 0.15 T resistive system and a localized surface coil. An attempt was made to define optimal sequences in the evaluation of both normal and pathological transplants. Three sequences were found to be of value; a T1 weighted sequence (IR2180/700/40) to assess corticomedullary differentiation and its loss in acute rejection and acute tubular necrosis, a T2 weighted sequence (SE2000/80) for assessment of renal vessels and disturbances in blood supply, and a STIR (short tau inversion recovery) sequence (IR800/100/40) to define further the distended collecting system in obstruction and the presence of any perirenal collection. Encouraging results have been obtained, particularly in cases of acute rejection. It is suggested that the MRI scan is a useful screening test in cases of clinical doubt and may even obviate biopsy in some cases.
