Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) is particularly sensitive for the detection of acute stoke. Until recently, DWI was performed with EPI technology. We compared 18 patients with clinical suspicion of acute stroke on a standard 1.5T unit and an open low-field MR scanner. Eighteen patients with 20 lesions of acute stroke were studied retrospectively with DWI and ADC mapping on both systems. The technique used was a rotating fast-spin echo T2 at low-field and an EPI sequence at 1.5T. Both examinations were performed within 24 hours and analyzed by two neuroradiologists. We obtained the same results on DWI sequences on both systems, regarding high intensity lesions on DWI. Interpretation of the ADC maps proved to be difficult on low-field MR near the lateral ventricles (3/18). We experienced the same difficulty of interpretation at low and high field in the cerebellum, in the temporal fossa and in cortex situated near bone, due to susceptibility artifacts. Chronic lesions were better visualized at low than at high field. In our opinion, DWI on a low-field open MR scanner is a good technique to evaluate subacute stroke and was as reliable as when performed on a 1.5T MR system.
