To create a probe for investigating neural development in chicks using magnetic resonance, a C(3)F(7) tag was bonded to the indole ring of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). Immunoassays indicate that a low dose (5 microg/egg) administered in ova results in 0.5-1.0 microg accumulating in a 250 microL midbrain.

Given the potential for developmental neurotoxicity of a compound that replaces an endogenous neurotransmitter, we investigated the effects of acute exposure during development.

No qualitative differences were observed between treatment groups. Differences in mortality rates between treatment groups were not statistically significant [X(2)(obs)=2.30, X(2)(crit) (df=2)=5.99, P>.05].

The no-effect dose for in ova administration of C(3)F(7) tagged5-HTP is 5 microg/egg on Day 17.
