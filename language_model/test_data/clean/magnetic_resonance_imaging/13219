Acoustic short-term memory (ASTM) refers to the temporary retention of acoustic information. In the present study, we investigated the neural correlates of ASTM for pitch using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Both MEG and fMRI analyses revealed brain activations that varied with memory load in the vicinity of secondary auditory cortex (Brodmann's area, BA22) and superior parietal cortex (BA5/7), while analyses specific to MEG data revealed load-related activations in the frontal cortex (BA9/10).
