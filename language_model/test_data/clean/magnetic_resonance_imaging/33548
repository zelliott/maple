In this study, we report the synthesis and the evaluation as MRI contrast agent of a new compound (nitroxyl fatty acid, NFA), where a pyrrolidinoxyl radical (3-carboxy-proxyl, PCA) is linked to a fatty acid moiety. Fatty acids were selected as vector because they present a high affinity for the liver, their efficient cellular uptake being the result of a specific interaction with a transmembrane transporter (liver plasma membrane-fatty acid binding protein). The uptake of 3H-oleic acid is inhibited after the injection of 1 mmol/kg of NFA, suggesting that NFA recognizes the same transmembrane transporter as the natural fatty acids. The higher relaxivity R1 of NFA in albumin solutions, compared with PCA, was explained by the immobilization of the nitroxyl radical in the protein. MR imaging was performed using T1-weighted images on mice in order to compare the contrast effect obtained after the injection of 1 mmol/kg of radical. The % signal enhancement in the liver 5 min after intravenous injection was 49 +/- 4 and 14 +/- 5 for NFA and PCA, respectively. NFA allowed a better delimitation of some necrotic tumors (Novikoff hepatocarcinoma) due to its preferential uptake by the nontumorous tissue.
