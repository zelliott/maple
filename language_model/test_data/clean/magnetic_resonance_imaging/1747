In this study, we propose a quality control program for MR-guided focused ultrasound (FUS) ablation treatment to assess FUS beam positioning accuracy, FUS power delivery accuracy, MR imaging quality, and FUS ablation system safety. A total of 353 sonication points in Lucite cards were measured, the average placement errors were -0.06 mm in the SI direction and -0.04 mm in the LR direction. Temperature elevation was calculated from MR phase difference images and the measured water proton chemical shift (WPCS) temperature coefficient. WPCS temperature calibration for phantoms yielded a temperature coefficient of 0.011 ppm/degree C. Sixteen experiments were conducted using six different phantoms to test the reliability of FUS power delivery. SNR and RF power calculated from phantom images were analyzed and stored at the MR console. A computer program was developed to integrate the system power delivery and the MR image quality control into one automated process. In the clinical trial at our institution, we expect this quality control program to be carried out before each patient treatment. If measured quality control values exceeds or below the preset values, a system service and retest should be conducted before the treatment.
