Myofibroma is a benign fibrous tumour that may be found in the soft tissues, skeleton, and internal organs. It is a rare lesion but is the commonest fibrous tumour in infancy. Involvement of the skull has been reported in some 21 cases in the English-language literature. None of these, however, has arisen outside infancy. Here, we report a myofibroma arising from the temporal bone in a 17-year-old girl.
