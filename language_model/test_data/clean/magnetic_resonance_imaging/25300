In four patients, women aged 58, 63 and 42 years, and a man aged 25 years, tethered cord syndrome was diagnosed. These patients suffered from progressive neurological symptoms, notably radiating pain in the legs in the first three patients, and muscle weakness and atrophy in the lower legs in the fourth patient. All four were treated surgically. Nowadays, the phrase tethered (spinal) cord is used for both occult and open closure defects of the neural tube. New neurological symptoms and signs can develop not only in childhood, but also in adults. Neurosurgical release of the tethered cord prevents further deterioration and often leads to significant subjective improvement of symptoms.
