The clinical results of open surgical treatment for hemodialysis-related arthropathy in the shoulder were evaluated, and the pathology was investigated. Fifteen shoulders of 11 patients (6 female and 5 male) were treated during the past 6 years. The average age was 56.7 years. The duration of hemodialysis averaged 17.5 years. Simple curettage was performed in 7 shoulders, and curettage and bone graft were performed in 5 shoulders. Repair of the rotator cuff was performed in 3 shoulders. Pathologic foci always existed in the intertubercular sulcus and the greater tuberosity of the humerus. Marked proliferations of the bursa and multiple cystic bone lesions were found, and amyloid depositions were observed on histologic evaluation in all cases. Open surgical treatment was quite effective, and relief from the clinical symptoms was maintained for a satisfactory period of time. Enthesopathy induced by the amyloid deposition is considered the main pathology.
