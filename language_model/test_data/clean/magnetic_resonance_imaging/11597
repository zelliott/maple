MRI is increasingly being used for etiologic examination of scoliosis and for intervertebral disc disorder analysis, but until now has not been applied to geometric modeling. The aim of this study was to develop a new geometric model of intervertebral discs using MRI and to quantify the migration of the nucleus zone within scoliotic intervertebral discs. Fourteen lumbar scoliotic children (Cobb angles 22 +/- 7 degrees ) were examined using MRI. The protocol consisted of sagittal and coronal plane acquisitions of the entire spine. An image processing software allowed the outline detection of the nucleus zone (intervertebral high intensity portion). The vertebral bodies were also reconstructed. Using a pre-post processor, the nucleus zone migration and a wedging angle were quantified. Statistical tests showed the repeatability of the method (p > 0.4). Nucleus zone migration was correlated to the wedging angle (r(2) = 0.488, p < 0.0001) in the coronal plane. Our results were in agreement with the literature: when two vertebrae move deforming the disc, the nucleus moves into the convexity of the curvature. But should we talk about the nucleus? Despite image processing software allowing the highlighting of image features (automatic color lookup tables applied to grayscale images using pixel intensity measurements), it is impossible to differentiate the nucleus from the annulus on T2 weighting images of adolescent spine. This new geometric model of the intervertebral disc, used for the quantification of the nucleus zone migration, should be of interest for further investigation of stiffness parameters of spine.
