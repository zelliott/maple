This study was designed to determine whether neuropsychological function in HIV-infected persons is correlated with loss of brain volume (as measured by percentage of brain parenchymal volume [PBV]). We hypothesized that whole-brain parenchymal volume might correlate with neuropsychologic performance, even before overt clinical dysfunction is apparent.

A computer-assisted segmentation technique with thin section MR imaging was used for 15 patients with HIV infection (seven symptomatic, eight asymptomatic) and for five HIV-negative control participants to quantify whole brain and CSF volumes. To determine the degree of brain atrophy, the PBV relative to that of intracranial content was calculated. Neuropsychological performance was assessed by using a standard battery of eight tests (NPZ-8 test battery).

HIV-infected patients had significantly lower NPZ-8 scores (t[18] = 2.26, P <.05) and lower PBV (t[18] = 1.79, P <.01) than those of healthy control participants. With the Spearman rank order correlation coefficients, data analyzed for all 20 study participants (15 HIV-infected patients and five noninfected control participants) showed a significant (r = -0.50, P <.05) negative correlation between PBV and NPZ-8 test battery score. In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between subtest score of motor impairment and PBV (r = -0.69, P <.01) and between AIDS dementia complex score (r = -0.64) and PBV (P <.01).

These correlations suggest that quantitation of PBV may offer an objective, easily acquired surrogate predictor of neuropsychological impairment and clinically apparent cognitive/motor dysfunction among HIV-infected persons.
