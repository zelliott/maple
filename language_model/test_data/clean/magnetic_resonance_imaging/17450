This paper will briefly discuss the value of MRI in the detection and follow-up of bone marrow edema resulting from acute and chronic trauma in sports injuries. A meticulous pattern approach of the distribution of bone marrow changes around a joint can reveal in most instances the underlying mechanism of trauma. The use of fatsuppressed T2-weighted or STIR images is most appropriate to detect bone marrow edema.
