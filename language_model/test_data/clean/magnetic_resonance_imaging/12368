Anti-GQ1b syndrome includes Miller Fisher Syndrome (MFS), Guillain Barr√© Syndrome (GBS), Bickerstaff`s brain stem encephalitis (BBE) and Acute Ophtamoplegia (AO). We report four patients aged 16 to 76 years, with anti-GQ1b syndrome. All presented with MFS, one of them evolved to GBS pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant and other to GBS with BBE. All had a previous history of diarrhea or upper respiratory tract infection. All had positive anti-GQ1b serum antibodies. Both brain magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were normal. Electrophysiology studies were compatible with a demyelinating disease. Two patients needed airway protection with an orotracheal tube and developed dysautonomia. All four patients were treated with immunomodulation. On the sixth month follow-up, patients had only minimal alterations in the neurological examination.
