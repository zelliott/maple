Wavelet-based methods for hypothesis testing are described and their potential for activation mapping of human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is investigated. In this approach, we emphasise convergence between methods of wavelet thresholding or shrinkage and the problem of hypothesis testing in both classical and Bayesian contexts. Specifically, our interest will be focused on the trade-off between type I probability error control and power dissipation, estimated by the area under the ROC curve. We describe a technique for controlling the false discovery rate at an arbitrary level of error in testing multiple wavelet coefficients generated by a 2D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) of spatial maps of fMRI time series statistics. We also describe and apply change-point detection with recursive hypothesis testing methods that can be used to define a threshold unique to each level and orientation of the 2D-DWT, and Bayesian methods, incorporating a formal model for the anticipated sparseness of wavelet coefficients representing the signal or true image. The sensitivity and type I error control of these algorithms are comparatively evaluated by analysis of "null" images (acquired with the subject at rest) and an experimental data set acquired from five normal volunteers during an event-related finger movement task. We show that all three wavelet-based algorithms have good type I error control (the FDR method being most conservative) and generate plausible brain activation maps (the Bayesian method being most powerful). We also generalise the formal connection between wavelet-based methods for simultaneous multiresolution denoising/hypothesis testing and methods based on monoresolution Gaussian smoothing followed by statistical testing of brain activation maps.
