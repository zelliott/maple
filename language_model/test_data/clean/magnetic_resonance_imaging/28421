We examined 25 patients with thyroid eye disease, using both the STIR (Short Tau Inversion Recovery) sequence and cine MRI techniques. A number of characteristic features can be seen on the cine MRI. There is muscle enlargement with restriction of movement and, in the burnt-out phase of the disease, reduced elasticity of the muscles is manifest as their failure to stretch on eye movement. This is in contrast to the active phase of the disease, where although the muscles are enlarged, muscle stretching is clearly visible. The STIR sequence gives an assessment of muscle water content, and hence a high signal is seen in active disease. Combining these techniques is useful in assessing the level of disease activity in thyroid eye disease, and helps in planning further management.
