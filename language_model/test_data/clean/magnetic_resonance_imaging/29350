To identify pituitary iron overload in patients with transfusional hemochromatosis causing secondary hypogonadism, we prospectively evaluated signal intensity abnormalities of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland of 18 patients affected by transfusion-dependent thalassemia major and secondary hypogonadism. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is useful to assess pituitary iron overload in patients with transfusional hemochromatosis and secondary hypogonadism by detection of a significant decreased signal intensity of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland on GRE T2*-weighted images. The decreased signal intensity of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland on GRE T2*-weighted images was correlated to increasing serum ferritin level (r = -0.84, r2 = -0.70, P < 0.001). Indeed, the lower the signal intensity of the pituitary gland, the greater the serum ferritin level. However an exact quantification of pituitary iron overload by correlation with serum ferritin level is not allowed. No correlation was found between MR imaging results and hormonal status; however, the detection of pituitary iron overload on GRE T2*-weighted images is consistent with the hypothesis of hypogonadotrophic pituitary insufficiency due to iron-induced cellular damage.
