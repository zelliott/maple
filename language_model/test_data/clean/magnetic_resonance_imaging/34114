Congenital malformations of the brain often are complex disorders which display a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations. The presence of this diversity makes it difficult to correlate clinical findings with neuropathological abnormalities or through neuroimaging studies.

Furthermore, the complexity of the etiological problem creates difficulty to differentiate those disorders having a primary cause, usually implying a genetic origin, from those secondary to a intrauterine insult occurring during the developmental brain process. In this study we have made a approach to mental and motor development in patients with typical or isolated brain malformations. To provide focus, we purposely excluded patients with complex anomalies, neurological disease, chromosomal disorder, syndromic picture or those who had brain malformations secondary to a known insult.

Our exposition come from our review of the current related literature and our own clinical experience, and we have chosen to classify the brain malformations into these three groups: those occurring before the 20th week of pregnancy, those occurring after the 20th week of pregnancy, and the malformations of the posterior fossa [REV NEUROL 1999; 28: 130-5].
