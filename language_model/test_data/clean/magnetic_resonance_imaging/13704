The aim of this paper is to describe the diagnostic value of the different radiological modifications of the intervertebral disk in children. Usual disk modifications include: disk-space narrowing; disk space enlargement; intervertebral disk calcifications; intervertebral disc prolapse; and signal modification in MRI. The gamuts (which are provided in the paper) of these different images must take into account the association with bone changes and the possibility of several disks' involvement. Calcifications are usually related to benign disorders.
