Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with leptomeningeal involvement is a rare condition. We report a case in a 17-year-old woman.

The patient was admitted to hospital with the complaints of vertigo, nausea, vomiting, headache, diplopia, ptosis on the left and weakness of the left leg. A diagnosis of SLE was established, with diffuse leptomeningeal involvement demonstrated by cranial magnetic resonance imaging. When treated with steroids, the clinical problems resolved almost completely.

Although rare, leptomeningeal involvement can complicate SLE. Cranial magnetic imaging can demonstrate tissue involvement. The condition responds to steroid therapy.
