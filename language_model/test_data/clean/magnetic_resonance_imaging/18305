The association between spinal meningiomas and neurinomas without clinical signs of neurofibromatosis is very rare with only four cases reported in literature. A case of 70-year-old woman with a history of progressive paraparesis is presented. A cervico-dorsal magnetic resonance with contrast showed two tumors with different enhancement. The patient had examination negative for neurofibromatosis. At histological examination cervical schwannoma and a dorsal meningioma were found. The Authors debate the rarity of this association, the possible pathogenesis and the MR findings.
