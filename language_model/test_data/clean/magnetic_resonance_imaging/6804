The therapeutic potential of administering stem cells to promote angiogenesis and myocardial tissue regeneration after infarction has recently been demonstrated. Given the advantages of using embryonic stem cells and mouse models of myocardial infarction for furthering the development of this therapeutic approach, the purpose of this study was to determine if embryonic stem cells could be loaded with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles and imaged in a mouse model of myocardial infarction over time using MRI. Mouse embryonic stem cells were labeled with SPIO particles. When incubated with 11.2, 22.4, and 44.8 microg Fe/ml of SPIO particles, cells took up increasing amounts of iron oxide. Embryonic stem cells loaded with SPIO compared to unlabeled cells had similar viability and proliferation profiles for up to 14 days. Free SPIO injected into infarcted myocardium was not observable within 12 hr after injection. After injection of three 10-microl aliquots of 10(7) SPIO-loaded cells/ml into infarcted myocardium, MRI demonstrated that the mouse embryonic stem cells were observable and could be seen for at least 5 weeks after injection. These findings support the ability of MRI to test the long-term therapeutic potential of embryonic stem cells in small animals in the setting of myocardial infarction.
