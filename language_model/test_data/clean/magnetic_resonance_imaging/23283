Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with a considerably increased risk for suicide. There is evidence to suggest that a predisposition to suicidal behavior may exist which is independent of the disorder itself. Furthermore, suicide attempters with mood disorders have an up to sixfold higher rate of suicidal behavior in first-degree relatives than non-suicidal patients. Genetic and nongenetic factors may play a role in the familial transmission of suicidal behavior. One of these factors may be neurobiological alterations, the knowledge about which is still limited. The main goal was therefore to study morphometric brain abnormalities in the hypothesized fronto-limbic network in depressed patients with high risk for suicide in contrast to non-high risk depressed patients. 15 patients with MDD and with own suicidal behavior and/or with suicidal behavior in first-degree relatives defined as a high risk group, 15 depressed patients with non-high risk for suicide and 30 matched healthy controls participated in the study. We applied the voxel-based morphometry protocol to structural T1-weighted volumes. Patients with high risk for suicide showed significantly decreased gray matter density in a fronto-striato-limbic network in contrast to matched healthy controls and in caudate and rostral anterior cingulate cortex in contrast to non-high risk patients. In the latter patient group no significant gray matter alterations were detected. This new finding provides evidence for structural brain alterations in depressed patients with high risk for suicide in a brain network strongly involved in emotional and motivational control reflecting a potentially distinct neurobiological entity.
