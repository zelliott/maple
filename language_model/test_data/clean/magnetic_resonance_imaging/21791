Hemangiopericytoma is a rare vascular tumor originating from pericytes. The main manifestation is a growing mass. Although computed tomodensitometry and MRI are the best diagnostic procedures, the diagnosis is made only after microscopic examination. The malignancy of this tumor is not well established. In fact, there is a continuum between benign and malignant hemangiopericytoma. The malignancy is estimated by the number of mitoses and the cellularity. Recurrences occur in 60% of cases. The best treatment is surgical excision. The role of radiation therapy and chemotherapy is not well established. The history of a 51-year-old woman treated by internal hemipelvectomy is presented here.
