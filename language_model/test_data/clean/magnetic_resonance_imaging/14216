With developments in proton and sodium imaging on eyes and ocular lesions, MRI has been rapidly advancing into the field of ophthalmology. Although many intraocular lesions have been T1 and T2 characterized, and MRI may aid in their diagnosis, there remain a few problems with the technique. One is the presence of motion artifacts which sometimes occur with lengthy scanning times. A patient must be imaged on the order of minutes with MRI. In addition ambiguities exist even with the T1 and T2 characterizations, although the specificity surpasses that of CT. Eventually these problems may be solved, but even now proton coupled with sodium imaging and other diagnostic techniques appear promising in the evaluation of ocular disorders.
