To demonstrate their applications in biological and medical fields such as in immunoassays, magnetic separation of cells or proteins, drug or gene delivery, and magnetic resonance imaging, the template-free syntheses of water-soluble and surface functionalized magnetic nanomaterials have become essential and are challenging. Herein, we developed a facile one-pot template-free method for the preparation of amine-functionalized magnetite nanoparticles and hollow nanospheres by using FeCl(3)6 H(2)O as single iron source. These magnetic nanomaterials were characterized by TEM, SEM, XRD, and FTIR technologies. Their magnetic properties were also studied by using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer at room temperature. Then the amine-functionalized magnetite nanoparticles were applied to immunoassays and magnetic resonance imaging in live mice.
