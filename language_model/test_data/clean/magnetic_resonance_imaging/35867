The results of magnetic resonance imaging in 10 patients with dissection of the thoracic aorta are presented. In 8 patients, the intimal flap was clearly contrasted from flowing blood in both lumina. In 2 patients the lack of phase shift of the intraluminal signal indicated complete thrombosis of the false lumen. Oblique sagittal sections parallel to the aortic arch and coronal sections through the ascending aorta demonstrated the extent of the dissection and provided information about the involvement of the origins of the coronary arteries and the branch vessels of the aortic arch. In 7 patients, the proximal site of communication between both lumina could be localized.
