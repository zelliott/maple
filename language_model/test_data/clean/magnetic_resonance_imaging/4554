The excellent visualization and minimally invasive surgical technique of endoscopic sinus surgery was applied to the management of 40 patients with sellar lesions. Endoscopic management of sellar lesions offers, not only the advantage of improved visualization, but also magnification, and a panoramic perspective of the important relationships of the sella turcica. In the past year, we have managed 40 subjects with sellar lesions, endoscopically: 38 patients had pituitary adenomas and two a craniopharyngioma. At our hospital, the endoscope has replaced the operating microscope for surgery for pituitary adenomas and other sellar lesions. The endoscopic approach to the sphenoid sinus and the sella is performed by an ENT surgeon and the ablative surgery performed by a neurosurgeon. Our experiences, using the endoscope to perform surgery on sellar and parasellar lesions, are reported and the advantages, over the operating microscope, which is traditionally used are discussed. The technique for endoscopic management of sellar lesions is described.
