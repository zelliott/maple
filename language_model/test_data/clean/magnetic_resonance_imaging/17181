Chondroma is a benign bone tumour that usually occurs in the in carpal and phalangeal bones. The iliac involvement is very rare and should be differentiated from chondrosarcoma. The authors report a case of iliac chondroma revealed by an acetabular lytic area in a 13-year-old girl. The diagnosis of chondroma was confirmed after surgical biopsy.
