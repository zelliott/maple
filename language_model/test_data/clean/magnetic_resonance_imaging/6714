A 34-years-old floor-layer developed optic neuropathy and motor neuron disease after being accidentally exposed to a solvent mixture containing methanol and other substances. Optic neuropathy is a complication of methanol poisoning, but the onset of a motor neuron disorder resembling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis after the exposure to these substances has not been previously described. The temporal onset of the clinical symptoms, biological plausibility, young age of the patient and absence of neurological disorders in the family history raises suspicion of a possible causative relationship.
