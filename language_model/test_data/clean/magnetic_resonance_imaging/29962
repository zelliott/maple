Sprains are disruptions of the ligamentous anatomy about a joint. The ankle sprain is one of the most common injuries seen in podiatric and orthopedic practice. It usually is incurred from an inversion force on the ankle, but eversion forces also can traumatize the ankle. Many times, this injury is taken for granted because of the frequency of its presentation. The patient usually is given appropriate initial care, but the patient can experience continued or residual pain. Podiatrists have found this problem is common and have come to recognize that secondary or accessory injuries occur that slow the natural recovery of this injury.
