Cysts of the ligamentum flavum are uncommon causes of neurologic signs and symptoms and usually are seen in persons over 50 years of age. We report a case of an epidural cyst located in the ligamentum flavum, which contributed to spinal stenosis in a 30-year-old man. Radiologic features were similar to those of a synovial cyst, but synovium was not identified histologically. The imaging and pathologic features were unusual, including hemorrhage and a fibrohistiocytic reaction with giant cells.
