A salivary fistula is a relatively uncommon but troublesome complication after parotid surgery. Most cases are self-limiting and respond well to conservative therapy (compression dressings). However, this treatment may require weeks before its effect becomes evident. We present the first report of direct administration of botulinum toxin type A as an effective primary treatment for an acute salivary fistula after parotid surgery, in the absence of other, more conservative treatment. A 47-year-old man with a 7-day history of sore throat was found to have a parapharyngeal tumor originating from the deep lobe of the parotid gland. He underwent tumor removal via a trans-paroticocervical approach. However, on postoperative day 7, the patient was noted to have massive salivary discharge from the surgical incision during a meal. We administered a transcutaneous botulinum toxin type A injection without a pressure dressing. One day after the injection, the salivary discharge from the incision line disappeared completely and there was no evidence of recurrent sialorrhea in the 6 months following the procedure. This report suggests that the injection of botulinum toxin type A is a highly effective and relatively safe primary method of treatment for an acute postparotidectomy salivary fistula, and not merely an alternative to more conservative therapy.
