We report a 69-year-old female patient with mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the appendix and elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Serum CEA levels were 27.6-37.8 ng/ml. An oval shaped cystic mass at the ileocecal region was consistently seen by several radiologic procedures such as, barium enema, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The tumor was resected, and the histopathologic findings indicated mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the appendix. CEA was demonstrated in the neoplastic columnar cells in immunohistochemical studies. The literature on the determination of serum CEA level in adenocarcinoma of the appendix is reviewed.
