Molecular imaging agents are extending the potential of noninvasive medical diagnosis from basic gross anatomic descriptions to complicated phenotypic characterizations based on the recognition of unique cell surface biochemical signatures. Although originally the purview of nuclear medicine, molecular imaging is now a prominent feature of most clinically relevant imaging modalities, in particular magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MR nanoparticulate agents afford the opportunity not only for targeted diagnostic studies but also for image-monitored site-specific therapeutic delivery, much like the "magic bullet" envisioned by Paul Erhlich 100 years ago. Combining high-resolution MR molecular imaging with drug delivery will facilitate verification and quantification of treatment (ie, rational targeted therapy) and will offer new clinical approaches to many diseases.
