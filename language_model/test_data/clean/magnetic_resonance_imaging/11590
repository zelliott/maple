Functional MRI (fMRI) studies designed for simultaneously measuring Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) and Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) signal often employ the standard Flow Alternating Inversion Recovery (FAIR) technique. However, some sensitivity is lost in the BOLD data due to inherent T1 relaxation. We sought to minimize the preceding problem by employing a modified UN-inverted FAIR (UNFAIR) technique, which (in theory) should provide identical CBF signal as FAIR with minimal degradation of the BOLD signal. UNFAIR BOLD maps acquired from human subjects (n = 8) showed significantly higher mean z-score of approximately 17% (p < 0.001), and number of activated voxels at 1.5T. On the other hand, the corresponding FAIR perfusion maps were superior to the UNFAIR perfusion maps as reflected in a higher mean z-score of approximately 8% (p = 0.013), and number of activated voxels. The reduction in UNFAIR sensitivity for perfusion is attributed to increased motion sensitivity related to its higher background signal, and, T2 related losses from the use of an extra inversion pulse. Data acquired at 3.0T demonstrating similar trends are also presented.
