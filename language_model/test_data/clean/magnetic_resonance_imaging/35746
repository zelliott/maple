Rapid image sequences of the spine were compared with proton and T2-weighted spin-echo sequences in 30 patients concerning their diagnostic value and image contrast. The rapid series was carried out with an angle of rotation of 30%, TR of 21 and TE of 12 msec., the spin-echo sequences with a TR/TE of 2,000/20/80 msec. The quality and contrast of the rapid series was markedly inferior to the spin-echo sequences; this was particularly marked for demonstrating disc and bone degeneration. At present, the routine use of rapid sequences cannot be recommended as a substitute for spine-echo examinations.
