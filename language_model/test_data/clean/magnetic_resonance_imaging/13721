The performance of a newly developed potential tumor-seeking magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent alpha-Aqua-13,17-bis(1-carboxypropionyl) carbamoylethyl-3,8-bis(1-phenethyloxyethyl)-beta-hydroxy-2,7,12,18-tetramethyl-porphyrinato manganese (III) (HOP-8P) was tested using a mouse model. Tumor-bearing (SCC-VII) mice were imaged using a 1.5T MR imager before and after intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg of HOP-8P. A biodistribution analysis was performed using an optical emission spectrometer. Significant enhancement of the transplanted tumor was observed in MR images 24 h after intravenous injection of HOP-8P. The biodistribution assessment of manganese also correlated with the results of the imaging study. During the 24-h period following contrast administration, HOP-8P was consistently cleared from the circulation, liver, kidneys, and muscle; however, it was progressively accumulated within the tumor. HOP-8P is a promising tumor-seeking metalloporphyrin MR contrast agent with a wide imaging window.
