The coordination of the direction of selective attention is an adaptive function that may be one of the many anticipatory tools under cerebellar control. This chapter presents neurobehavioral, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging data to support our hypothesis that the cerebellum plays a role in attentional functions. We discuss the idea that the cerebellum is a master computational system that anticipates and adjusts responsiveness in a variety of brain systems (e.g., sensory, attention, memory, language, affect) to efficiently achieve goals determined by cerebral and other subcortical systems.
