Pilomatricoma is an asymptomatic, slowly growing, benign skin tumor that is typically located in the regions of head and neck. We present 1 case of pilomatricoma studied with dynamic magnetic resonance imaging and bone scintigraphy. Our case revealed late enhancement in the dynamic magnetic resonance imaging study that is a common pattern more in a benign soft tissue tumor and caused dramatic uptake in the bone scintigraphy. These findings are not ever reported in published articles. Surgical excision of the lesions was performed, and the pathological evaluation revealed a pilomatricoma.
