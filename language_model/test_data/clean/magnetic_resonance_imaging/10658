In our case we present a 47-year old female patient, who had a history of one year of right-sided recurrent ear pain without any signs of ear-infections. A computer tomography (CT) imaging was carried out. At the mid-modiolar level, the axial CT-scan showed a small contrast-enhancing density in the middle ear space. She refused further investigation until the ear-pain increased and slight hearing loss was present. Again, six months later a CT-scan was performed, and the hyperdense tissue formation engaged the entire middle ear cleft of the right temporal bone. Typical of MEA, no osteolytic signs were present; the skull-base was intact, the air-cell system of the temporal bone showed no osteolysis or deficiency. In the case presented here, we show a MEA which has filled the middle ear with fluid retention in the mastoid with absent destruction of any structure clinically resulting in ear pain and slight conductive hearing loss. These lesions are contrast-enhancing on CT and on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have brain-like signal intensity T2-weighted images. In this case, the lesion was exenterated.
