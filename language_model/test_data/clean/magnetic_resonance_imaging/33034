Meningeal melanocytomas are rare tumours of the central nervous system, most commonly found in the intracranial compartment (posterior cranial fossa). Spinal lesions are uncommon, with the majority being intradural, extramedullary lesions. Intramedullary melanocytomas are extremely rare and are most commonly found in the thoracic region. We report a patient with cervical intramedullary melanocytoma and review the available literature regarding this rare pathology.
