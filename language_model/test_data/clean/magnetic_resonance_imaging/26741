An 18-year-old woman with recurrent embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma underwent a right subtotal exenteration sparing the eyelids and conjunctiva to remove the tumor. A rectus abdominus muscle free flap was secured to the right temporalis muscle. The temporalis muscle was then advanced into the temporal fossa defect and the rectus abdominus flap placed into the right orbital cavity and right maxillary sinus. An ocular conformer was then placed and a lateral tarsorrhaphy was performed. This surgical technique provides rapid socket rehabilitation with good cosmesis and enables the use of a standard ocular prosthesis.
