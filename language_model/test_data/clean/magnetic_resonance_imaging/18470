The evaluation of the impact of therapy on the evolution of atherosclerotic lesions or restenosis after angioplasty requires the use of techniques of vascular imaging. The reference invasive method is digital angiography although it does not provide data on the arterial wall thickness. This parameter can be approached however by intravascular ultrasound imaging, a technique which has a number of important practical limitations. Of the non-invasive techniques available, Doppler ultrasonography is the only one that can be used in clinical trials. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging is the object of much research and is without doubt the technique of the future. The choice of model of atherosclerosis influences that of the imaging technique: cineangiography for coronary arteries, digital angiography or Doppler ultra sonography for lower limb arteries and Doppler ultrasonography for the carotid arteries. Interpretation of angiography is now performed quantitatively by videodensitometry. Interpretation of other techniques should be performed by a second independent observer and "blinded" with respect to the order in which the investigations were performed and to the treatment administered. The criteria of judgment may be qualitative (progression, stabilisation, regression) or quantitative, the latter having a number of advantages over the former. Of the quantitative criteria, the percentage stenosis, though widely used, does not fully answer the question posed, and neither does the diameter of the stenosis. The volume of the arterial lumen calculated from videodensitometric data would seem to be the best, by its sensitivity and additivity, current angiographic parameter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
