In this pilot cross-sectional study, the effectiveness of rigid spinal orthoses in the correction of spinal curvature of 14 patients with moderate adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) at different recumbent positions (supine, prone, right and left decubitus) was investigated. Using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and multi-planar reconstruction technique, evaluation of the scoliotic spine in the coronal, sagittal and axial planes and the effect of spinal orthosis on AIS at different recumbent positions was studied. There was significant reduction of coronal Cobb's angle (p < 0.05) with bracing at all four recumbent positions and the maximal reduction was found in the prone position (18% reduction). The sagittal Cobb's angle was only significantly reduced at the supine position while the axial rotation did not change significantly in all positions.
