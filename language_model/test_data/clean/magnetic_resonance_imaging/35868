Gradient-echo pulse sequences with fast acquisition times permit examinations in short breath-holding intervals. In this way an improvement of MR imaging of upper abdominal organs can be expected. In 41 patients with space-occupying lesions of kidneys and adrenals, influence of external parameter variations on resulting contrasts was analyzed and results were compared to other imaging methods. Gradient-echo sequences demonstrated a high sensitivity in detection of tumorous lesions of kidneys and adrenals, the specificity being similar to that of CT. Further differentiation was only possible by performing dynamic perfusion studies using paramagnetic contrast agents.
