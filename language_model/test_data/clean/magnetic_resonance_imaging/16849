Several recent studies have attempted to evaluate the accuracy of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in predicting the likelihood of tumour involvement of the postoperative circumferential resection margin (CRM) in rectal cancer with the intention of selecting patients who might benefit from neoadjuvant therapy and as a guide to surgery. The aim of this study was to assess whether such studies can provide a valid answer as to whether preoperative MRI can accurately predict CRM involvement by tumour.

The study design and methodology of studies on this topic were critically examined.

Features identified as affecting the efficacy of these studies were: representativeness of patients, definition of the margin assessed by MRI and by histology, lack of blinding of surgeons and pathologists to MRI results, effect of neoadjuvant treatment, and number of patients studied.

Because of methodological inadequacies in studies completed to date, there is insufficient evidence of the ability of a positive MRI result to predict an involved CRM. Although MRI may be able to identify a tumour that has extended to the mesorectal fascia and/or intersphincteric plane, logically, it cannot indicate where the surgical boundary of the resection will ultimately lie, and therefore cannot validly predict an involved CRM and should not be relied upon for this purpose.
