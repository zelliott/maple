Dural metastasis is rare. In most reported cases, brain CT scan findings are mistaken for subdural hematoma or meningioma. We present here a 72-year-old male with a history of headache and progressive mental status changes. Brain CT scans suggested chronic subdural hematoma. However, the only surgical findings were diffuse thickening of the dura and sclerosis of the temporal bone. Histopathology revealed metastatic prostatic carcinoma. As the surgical approach and prognosis of chronic subdural hematoma and metastatic tumors are completely different, the differential diagnosis of these diseases is very important. A contrast-enhanced brain CT scan is recommended for patients who could possibly have dural metastases.
