A lady aged 26 years reported with a 2 months history of fever, upper abdominal pain and weight loss. Her abdominal ultrasonographic scan revealed a complex cystic mass in left lobe of liver suggestive of hydatid cyst that was confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging of abdomen and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogram. With strong suspicion of a hydatid cyst, endoscopic retrograde cholangiogram was performed which confirmed the diagnosis. During the procedure, hydatid membranes protruding from the papilla were removed after sphincterotomy. She was put on albendazole 400 mg twice daily after the procedure and showed a remarkable clinical improvement.
