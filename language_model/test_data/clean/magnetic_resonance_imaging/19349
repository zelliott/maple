We have previously demonstrated that the fractional parameter has significant correlation with the muscle strength of patients with stroke. In this study, we have investigated whether fractional parameter can be used to objectively document stroke patients' functional level (using FIM scores).

Sixty motor units were recorded in abductor pollicis brevis, first dorsal interosseous, and abductor digiti minimi muscles in 18 stroke patients. Patients' FIM scores, obtained fractional parameters, and serial correlation coefficients were analyzed and statistical determination was made.

Statistical significance was found between fractional parameters and motor items of FIMs (except selfcare category); no statistical significant correlation was found between SSC and FIM scores.

Fractional parameter could be a useful tool for measuring motor function at a single motor unit level.
