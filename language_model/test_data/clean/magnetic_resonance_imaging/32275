A 20-year old woman presented with acute right hemiplegia 10 weeks after intrauterine fetal death at 34-weeks gestation (G1P0). A brain MRI showed a typical acute infarct in the left middle cerebral artery territory. A CT pulmonary angiography carried out 1 week later for sudden cardiopulmonary deterioration showed disseminated pulmonary metastases. The CT was extended to the abdomen and pelvis, which showed a uterine mass with bilateral theca lutein cysts. The radiological diagnosis of metastatic choriocarcinoma was made and was subsequently confirmed with the markedly increased serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin. A serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin is therefore considered worthwhile in any young female adult who presents with stroke.
