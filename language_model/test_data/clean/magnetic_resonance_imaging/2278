Between 1980 and 1995, we performed a nephrectomy with curative intent on 183 patients with renal cell carcinoma at Nagoya University Hospital. Among these patients, 5 (2.7%) developed renal fossa recurrence (median follow-up, 65 months). We report a case of such a recurrence found 13 years after a nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (stage pT3a, pN0, M0). A 62-year-old female presented with a nodule on her back. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass in the right back and retroperitoneum, and a biopsy revealed the tumor to be a renal cell carcinoma. Complete resection was performed, followed by administration of alpha-interferon. The patient is doing well 16 months after the operation. The case illustrates that very long-term follow-up after a nephrectomy is mandatory for patients with perinephric invasion of a renal cell carcinoma due to the risk of renal fossa recurrence.
