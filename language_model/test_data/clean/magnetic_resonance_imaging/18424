Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a rare disorder of unknown etiology. The main characteristics on plain X-rays are a lytic destruction in the metaphyseal region of the long bones followed by progressive sclerosis. The symmetrical pattern and the frequent involvement of the sternoclavicular joints and vertebrae are typical. An association with palmoplantar pustulosis has also been described. Laboratory findings are nonspecific. Although MRI is not necessary to make the diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis, it is useful in assessing the extent and the evolution of the lesions. CRMO of the tibial and fibular bones is described in a 14-year-old girl, who suffered from pain and soft tissue swelling in both ankles. Initial plain X-rays and laboratory findings were normal. After relapsing clinically, progressive sclerosis of both fibular bones occurred. Lytic lesions in the left tibia and both fibular bones were visible. Scintigraphic examination showed pathologic tracer accumulation in both legs. The diagnosis of CRMO was suggested based on CT and MRI findings. CRMO was confirmed after curettage and bone biopsy. Histopathological findings were consistent with active chronic osteomyelitis.
