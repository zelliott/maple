Metastases to intramammary nodes have been shown to be an independent predictor of poor outcome in patients with breast cancer, such as axillary lymph node metastases. The detection and accurate characterization of these nodes preoperatively is thus crucial for the staging and planning of treatment for breast carcinoma, particularly in cases with axillary lymph node negative disease as it upgrades the disease staging. We herein report the first case where we detected an intra-mammary node on specimen MRI after the primary pathological gross specimen evaluation failed to detect the node.
