Endoscopic surgery using an expanded endonasal approach now allows surgical access to an increasing range of parasellar, suprasellar, clivus, and petrous apex lesions. Accurate preoperative planning requires proper interpretation of CT and MRI results. It is essential to identify important anatomic landmarks and to recognize the appearance of common lesions and pseudolesions. Postoperative imaging must evaluate for residual tumors and identify iatrogenic conditions.
