We report eight patients with prominent cystic changes in the head of the fibula. Seven of these had osteoarthritis of the adjacent knee, and five had evidence of local deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals. A radiographic survey of 470 knees in 254 patients with osteoarthritis suggested that such cysts are rare, but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of such changes before expensive or invasive investigations are performed.
