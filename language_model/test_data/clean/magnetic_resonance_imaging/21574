Verbal and visual memory performances were evaluated in 60 epileptic children and 60 normal control subjects with Signoret's Memory Battery scale. Eighteen patients had idiopathic generalized epilepsy and 42 had partial epilepsy, mostly of the temporal (n = 28) and frontal (n = 10) lobes. Memory scores were statistically lower in epileptics than in controls and significant differences were found within each group: (1) children with idiopathic generalized epilepsy had a slight depression of visual memory; (2) memory disorder was more severe in partial epilepsy; and (3) children with left and right temporal lobe epilepsy had marked memory deficits related to hemispheric specialization.
