Aberrant left-sided pulmonary artery (pulmonary sling) is an uncommon anomaly, which may cause significant respiratory morbidity. The condition should be considered on finding a mass interposed between the trachea and the esophagus on the esophagogram, but diagnosis is usually made with invasive methods. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been reported as an excellent method for diagnosing cardiovascular anomalies but the findings at MRI in cases of pulmonary artery sling have not been reported previously. In this communication the use of MRI is described for demonstration of pulmonary sling in three patients.
