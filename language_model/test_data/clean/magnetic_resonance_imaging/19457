1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides a unique tool to detect and quantify brain metabolites. In multiple sclerosis it can be used to investigate axonal loss or dysfunction through measurement of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), a neuronal marker. Previous studies in adults have reported variable effects of aging on metabolite concentrations but have predominantly focused on changes in the elderly. This study has examined a younger adult age group to provide a reference database more applicable to the multiple sclerosis population. Single voxel (1)H MRS was carried out in 44 subjects between 22 and 62 years of age. Sixteen subjects underwent repeat examination after one year. Absolute concentrations of NA (the sum of NAA and N-acetyl aspartate glutamate), NAA, creatine/phosphocreatine (Cr), choline containing compounds (Cho) and myo-inositol (mI) were measured. NA, NAA and mI concentrations did not correlate with age but there were significant correlations between age and Cr (r = 0.43, p = 0.004) and Cho (r = 0.38, p = 0. 011) concentrations. No significant differences in metabolite concentrations were seen over one year. This study provides evidence that age-related changes of metabolite concentrations occur even in a young to middle aged adult population. This emphasizes the need to perform absolute quantification of metabolite concentrations rather than ratios and the importance of age-matching in (1)H MRS studies of multiple sclerosis.
