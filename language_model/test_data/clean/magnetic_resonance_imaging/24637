Catheter-based ablation techniques are extensively used for the treatment of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Preprocedural cardiac MRI is valuable for the management of these patients due to its ability to provide high-resolution anatomic mapping and tissue characterization in the absence of ionizing radiation. Delayed enhancement imaging can be used to localize the arrhythmia substrate within the chamber of interest prior to the procedure. There is growing evidence that delayed enhancement cardiac MRI may be useful in patients with atrial fibrillation in terms of treatment decisions and assessment of ablation efficacy.
