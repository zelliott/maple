The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of T2-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for detecting prostate cancer in patients with total serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of 4-10 ng/mL, which is referred to as the "gray zone."

Fifty patients with gray-zone PSA levels underwent MRI before biopsy. According to the sites of biopsy, the prostate was divided into eight regions on MRI scans. These regions were evaluated individually for the following features: detectability of prostate cancer on per-region and per-patient bases, and relationship between tumor size and positive or negative MRI findings for tumor detection.

On a per-region basis, the sensitivity and specificity of tumor detection were 36% and 97% for T2-weighted imaging, 43% and 95% for DCE-MRI, 38% and 96% for DWI, and 53% and 93% for the combined method of MRI, respectively. The sensitivity of combined MRI to detect tumor was significantly higher than those of the individual methods (p < 0.001 to p = 0.001). Tumor size was significantly larger in regions with positive MRI findings than in regions with negative MRI findings (p = 0.004). On a per-patient basis, sensitivity and specificity of combined MRI to detect prostate cancer were 83% and 80%, respectively.

Combined T2-weighted imaging, DWI, and DCE-MRI findings appear to be potentially useful for detecting and managing prostate cancer, even when performed for patients with gray-zone PSA levels.
