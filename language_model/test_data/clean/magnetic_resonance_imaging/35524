To examine the ability of TrueFISP imaging for evaluating tumor size in mouse brain at high field.

Brains of healthy and glioma-implanted nude mice were imaged at 4.7T and 9.4T. 3D imaging was performed with TrueFISP and T2w-RARE. Radiofrequency pulses with alternating phase and the sum-of-squares reconstruction method were used in TrueFISP imaging. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was evaluated in healthy and in tumoral brain regions.

Banding artifact was correctly suppressed in TrueFISP images thanks to the method used. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and CNR were comparable in TrueFISP and T2w-RARE images at 4.7T, but acquisition was around 4 times shorter with TrueFISP. Tumor was well detected at 4.7T with TrueFISP, but CNR between tumor and healthy tissue was low at 9.4T.

TrueFISP is efficient and fast to perform brain imaging at 4.7T. Multiple TrueFISP acquisitions with phase-cycled radiofrequency (RF) pulses and sum-of-squares reconstruction allow suppression of banding artifact. Tumoral regions were well detected and the method allows longitudinal studies of tumor growth.
