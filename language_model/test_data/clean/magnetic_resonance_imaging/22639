Stress fractures are common in athletes, and their incidence in sport is estimated at 2-4%. A case is reported of a stress fracture of the sacrum in an amateur tennis player. The patient was treated with rest and physiotherapy, focusing on stretching programmes and analgesic treatments, followed by an educational programme of tennis training and muscle strengthening. This appears to be the first report of this pathology in a tennis player.
