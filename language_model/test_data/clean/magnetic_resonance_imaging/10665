Clinically indicated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was safely performed at 1.5 T on a patient with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). The ICD was reprogrammed to detection only, and imaging hardware and protocols were modified to minimize radiofrequency power deposition to the ICD system. The integrity of the ICD system was verified immediately post-MRI and after 6 weeks, including an ICD test with induction of ventricular fibrillation. This case demonstrates that in exceptional circumstances, in carefully selected patients, and using special precautions, an MRI exam of the brain may be possible in patients with ICDs.
