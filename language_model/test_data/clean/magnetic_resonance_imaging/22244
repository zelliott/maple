In vivo effective relaxation rates in normal rat liver were evaluated for four dextran coated iron oxide agents: monocrystalline iron oxide nanocolloid (MION) with a mean particle diameter of 3.9 nm, a polycrystalline agent (PION) with a larger mean diameter of 12 nm, and these two agents labeled with the asialofetuin (ASF) protein for high hepatocytic receptor binding affinity (MION-ASF and PION-ASF). Using echo planar imaging at 2 Tesla, dose response was measured with measured with high temporal resolution for 3 h after injection of agent, and by comparing with relaxivities in vitro and in brain, dominant in vivo contrast phenomena were elucidated. While transverse relaxivity for PION-ASF exceeded that for MION-ASF by almost a factor of 2 in solution, relaxation rates in vivo became equivalent. Liver relaxation using non-ASF agents was consistent with rapid water exchange between vascular and extravascular compartments, which dominated relaxation as a result of agent accumulation in Kupffer cells.
