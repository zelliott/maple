A small number of children who develop disconjugate nystagmus, torticollis, and head titubation (spasmus nutans) have been found to have optic chiasm or third ventricle gliomas. However, the prevalence of glioma or other developmental abnormalities in this disorder is unknown because no large series of spasmus nutans cases has previously been reported. A reviewer of the records of 67 consecutive children initially diagnosed with spasmus nutans and followed for an average of 3.3 years at the St Louis Children's Hospital revealed the following: 61% had a history of prematurity, developmental delay, or other systemic abnormality; strabismus, most commonly infantile esotropia, developed in 55%; 43% had neuroimaging studies; and 0% had evidence of a glioma or showed signs of tumor on follow-up examinations. From this consecutive patient series, we estimate the prevalence of tumor in spasmus nutans to be less than 1.4%. Without other evidence of an intracranial mass lesion, neuroimaging of infants initially diagnosed with spasmus nutans may not be immediately warranted.
