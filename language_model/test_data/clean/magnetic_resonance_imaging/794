Choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) arising in the temporal horn is rare in adult population, and to the best of our knowledge, there has been no report of such a case with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The authors describe a unique case of a 27-year-old woman who was diagnosed as TLE and was found to have a CPP in the temporal horn. Choroid plexus papilloma of the temporal horn, even though rare, can be found in adult population and be causally related to temporal lobe epilepsy.
