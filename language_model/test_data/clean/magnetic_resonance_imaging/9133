To investigate the surgical treatment for cervical dumbbell tumors.

Clinical manifestation, surgical type and stage, and surgical method of 36 consecutive patients with cervical dumbbell tumor were retrospectively studied.

The tumors in 35 patients were completely resected once, and the other one patient underwent subtotal resection. Signs and symptoms of all patients were recovered to different degrees, without significant complications and tumor recurrence.

According to the type and stage of dumbbell tumors, we could adopt surgical methods through posterior or posterior combined with anterior approach, together with instruments and fusion, which could completely resect tumors and prevent complications.
