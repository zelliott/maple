Development of techniques for percutaneous closure of atrial septal defects (ASDs) makes accurate noninvasive sizing of ASDs important for appropriate patient selection.

Magnetic resonance (MR) images of ASDs were obtained in 30 patients (mean age, 41 +/- 16 years) by both spin-echo and phase-contrast cine MR imaging. Spin-echo images were obtained in two orthogonal views (short-axis and four-chamber) perpendicular to the plane of the ASD. Spin-echo major and minor diameters were measured, and spin-echo defect area was calculated. Phase-contrast cine MR images were obtained in the plane of the ASD, and cine major diameter and defect area were measured from the region of signal enhancement or phase change due to shunt flow across the defect. MR measurements were compared with templates cut during surgery to match the defect or with ASD diameter determined by balloon sizing at catheterization. ASD size measured from cine MR images (y) agreed closely with catheterization and template standards (x). For major diameter, y = 0.78x + 5.7, r = .93, and SEE = 3.4 mm. On average, spin-echo measurements overestimated major diameter and area of secundum ASDs by 48% and 125%, respectively.

Phase-contrast cine MR images acquired in the plane of an ASD define the defect shape by the cross section of the shunt flow stream and allow noninvasive determination of defect size with sufficient accuracy to permit stratification of patients to closure of the defect by catheter-based techniques versus surgery. Spin-echo images, on the other hand, are not adequate for defining ASD size, because septal thinning adjacent to a secundum ASD may appear to be part of the defect.
