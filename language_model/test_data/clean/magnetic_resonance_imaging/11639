Combined coronary and perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance was performed in three sisters with angina and suspected anomalous coronary arteries. Two sisters had anomalous coronary arteries passing between the aorta and right ventricular outflow tract and had abnormal myocardial perfusion. One sister had normal anatomy and perfusion. The combined approach identified the anatomy and functional significance of suspected anomalous coronary arteries.
