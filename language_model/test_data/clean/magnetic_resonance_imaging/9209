Neuritis ossificans is an extremely rare reactive process affecting peripheral nerves, which can be challenging to diagnose and treat. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an excellent imaging modality for these lesions, showing inflammatory reaction around the nerve. Only a few cases have been previously reported, and all of the patients underwent surgical resection. In this article we report the first case of neuritis ossificans affecting the common peroneal nerve, treated non-operatively, and we review the literature.
