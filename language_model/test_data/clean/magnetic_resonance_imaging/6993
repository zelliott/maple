This paper describes the development of a prototype portable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) device with anticipated application in material science and biomedicine. The device consists of two rings constructed from permanent magnets with the polarization aligned axially. The geometry of the device produces a B0 field with cylindrical symmetry. A region of homogeneous field of 50 mT has been achieved. Images of small phantoms and one biological sample are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the device.
