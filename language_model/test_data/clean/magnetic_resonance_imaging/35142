Reversible posterior lekoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) is usually reversible. However, permanent cerebral damage may result if diagnosis is delayed. White matter edema in the posterior cerebral hemispheres is typical on neuroimaging. A 36-year-old primigravid woman underwent induction of labor due to mild pregnancy-induced hypertension. At 5 h after delivery, she developed eclampsia seizures complicated by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging showed high-density lesions in anterior regions without any abnormalities in posterior cerebral regions. Cases of postpartum RPLS without involvement of posterior brain regions after eclampsia complicated by HELLP syndrome are very rare. Patients with RPLS do not always show typical manifestations.
