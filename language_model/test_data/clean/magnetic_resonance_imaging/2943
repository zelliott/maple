Four patients with acute inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy were evaluated with MRI. In 3 of 4 cases, gadolinium enhancement was observed in the nerve roots of cauda equina, on frontal and horizontal slices. This enhancement was correlated with the severity of the clinical picture and the cerebrospinal-fluid inflammatory protein concentration and supports the inflammatory nature of this forms of acute polyradiculoneuropathy.
