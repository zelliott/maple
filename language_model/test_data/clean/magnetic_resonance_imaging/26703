It is well established that the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) plays a critical role in planning. Neuroimaging studies have yielded predominantly bilateral dlPFC activations, but the existence and nature of functionally specific contributions of left and right dlPFC have remained elusive. In recent experiments, 2 independent parameters have been identified which substantially determine planning: 1) the degree of interdependence between consecutive steps (search depth) and 2) the degree to which the configuration of the goal state renders the order of single steps either clearly evident or ambiguous (goal hierarchy). Thus, search depth affects the actual mental generation and evaluation of action sequences, whereas goal hierarchy reflects the extraction of goal information from an encountered problem. Here, both parameters were independently manipulated in an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study using the Tower of London task. Results revealed a double dissociation as indicated by a significant crossover interaction of hemisphere and task parameter: in left dlPFC, activations were stronger for higher demands on goal hierarchy than on search depth, whereas the reversed result emerged in right dlPFC. In conclusion, often observed bilateral patterns of dlPFC activation in complex tasks may reflect the concomitant operation of specific cognitive processes that show opposing lateralizations.
