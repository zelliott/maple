Catatonia is a syndrome that requires both nonpsychiatric medical and psychiatric evaluation. The authors report on six patients with catatonia that were seen by a psychiatric consultation-liaison service. Five of these patients had medical conditions reported to cause catatonia. Treatment recommendations included the following: 1) subcutaneous heparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, 2) a trial of lorazepam, and 3) transfer to a medical/psychiatric unit or locked psychiatric unit. Catatonia was most parsimoniously attributed to the primary psychiatric illness in five of the patients and to corticosteroid treatment in the sixth patient. These findings suggest that clinicians should use the proposed criteria, past psychiatric history, physical exam, and laboratory and radiological studies when evaluating patients with symptoms of catatonia.
