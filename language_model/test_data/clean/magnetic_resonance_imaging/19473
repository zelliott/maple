Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be of significant benefit in characterizing expansile lesions of the petrous apex. MRI can be of particular help in distinguishing congenital cholesteatoma from cholesterol granuloma. Furthermore, with the advent of faster high-resolution scanning techniques, MRI can define precise spatial relationships of these masses with the middle and inner ear structures, internal carotid artery, jugular vein, and other structures of the skull base. MRI scanning is sensitive in detecting intracranial extension of these masses. MR angiography can provide additional information regarding the relationship of these masses with adjacent vascular structures and confirm patency of the adjacent vessels. In the postoperative period, MR scanning can help evaluate for complete removal, complication, recurrence, or formation of complicating granulation tissue.
