The last decades resulted unlikely development in the investigation and therapy of epilepsy. This process made the classification and separation of the epileptic seizures and epileptic syndromes possible. The new classification established the functional assessment of the convulsive disorder and revealed the fact that epilepsy is not only a symptom but an illness. The new computer assisted neuroimaging methods disclose more and more details in the etiology and extremely reduce the number of cryptogen epilepsies. Understanding the role of different ionchanels and certain excitatory and inhibitory transmitters in the generation and propagation of epileptic excitement gives new possibilities in therapeutic approach. The pharmacokinetic features of the antiepileptic drugs basically determined therapeutic concepts. Most of the antiepileptic drugs exert their therapeutical effect through their blood level. This recognition led to the development of the mono and rational polytherapy. In the last five year developed large cohort of the newest antiepileptic drugs and the renaissance of the epilepsy surgery make a revolution in the treatment of the epileptic disorder.
