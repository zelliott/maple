To study the efficacy of endoscopic nasopharyngectomy in salvaging recurrent T1 to 2a nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).

An investigation of the outcome of endoscopic nasopharyngectomy.

Six nasopharyngectomies for patients presenting with locally recurrent T1 to 2a NPC were performed exclusively by way of endoscopic resection by a single surgeon (m.-k.c.) during the period 2001 to 2005. All patients were operated on with curative intent without postoperative radiotherapy.

All six operations were successfully performed endoscopically, and no conversions to conventional open resection were necessary. Of the patients who underwent endoscopic excision, three of them had rT1 disease, and the others had rT2a disease. No surgical specimens had microscopic invasion of the resection margins. No complications associated with the operation occurred. The patients were followed up for 16 to 59 (average, 29) months. One local recurrence was noted in this series to date, and the patient was treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

Exclusively endoscopic nasopharyngectomy is a feasible method for treatment of locally recurrent T1- to 2a-staged NPC.
