May 2004: We present the case of a male newborn (38th week of gestation) with a 3-week history of a sonographically detected parietal mass of 5-cm diameter. The entire mass was removed at surgery. Surprisingly, microscopy revealed an intracerebral hemorrhage and nests of glycophorin-A immunoreactive blasts and nucleated erythrocytes in the surrounding parenchyma. The final diagnosis was chronic intracerebral hemorrhage of unknown etiology with reactive changes of the surrounding brain tissue and perifocal extramedullary erythropoiesis. This case is unique because, to date, intracranial extramedullary erythropoiesis has only been described in chronic subdural hemorrhage.
