Using single-trial parameters as a regressor in the General Linear Model (GLM) is becoming an increasingly popular method for informing fMRI analysis. However, the parameter used to characterise or to differentiate brain regions involved in the response to a particular task varies across studies (e.g. ERP amplitude, ERP latency, reaction time). Furthermore, the way in which the single-trial information is used in the fMRI analysis is also important. For example, the single-trial parameters can be used as regressors in the GLM or to modify the duration of the events modelled in the GLM. The aim of this study was to investigate the BOLD response to a target detection task when including P3 amplitude, P3 latency and reaction time parameters in the GLM. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI was recorded from fifteen subjects in response to a visual choice reaction time task. Including P3 amplitude as a regressor in the GLM yielded activation in left central opercular cortex, left postcentral gyrus, left insula, left middle frontal gyrus, left insula and left parietal operculum. Using P3 latency and reaction time as an additional regressor yielded no additional activation in comparison with the conventional fMRI analysis. However, when P3 latency or reaction time was used to determine the duration of events at a single-trial level, additional activation was observed in the left postcentral gyrus, left precentral gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex and supramarginal gyrus. Our findings suggest that ERP amplitudes and latencies can yield different activation patterns when used to modify relevant aspects of the GLM.
