To assess the diagnostic accuracy of MR imaging for detecting bone marrow infiltration by malignant lymphoma.

Fifty-three patients with malignant lymphoma underwent MR imaging and bone marrow biopsy. In 80 iliac crests of the 53 patients (13 positive specimens in 9 patients and 67 negative specimens in 44 patients), biopsy results and the signal intensity characteristics were compared. MR sequences included T1-weighted SE, T2-weighted FSE with fat suppression, FSE STIR, and diffusion-weighted EPI with fat suppression at 1.5 T.

To detect lymphoma infiltration, T1-weighted SE had the highest sensitivity (92%) and diffusion-weighted EPI with fat suppression and FSE STIR had the highest specificity (92.5% and 92%, respectively). A combination of T1-weighted SE and FSE STIR yielded the highest sensitivity and specificity (85% and 97%, respectively). A combination of T1-weighted SE and FSE STIR sequences seems to be the current choice of imaging protocol for detecting bone marrow infiltration by malignant lymphoma.
