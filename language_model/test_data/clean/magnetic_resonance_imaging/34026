This is a case report of the occurrence of cerebral diplopia with right-side superior homonymous quadrantanopia in a young woman after chiropractic neck manipulation. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed an infarct in the left inferior V2/V3 (extrastriate) cortex. The characteristics of the diplopia are illustrated with the patient's drawings, and persisting abnormalities in perception are described in the area of the initial field defect after static (computed) visual field testing yielded normal results.
