The purpose of this study was to illustrate the varied MDCT and MRI appearances of hypervascular and hemorrhagic pancreatic conditions and their mimics.

Pancreatic hypervascular conditions are easily detected at multiphasic contrast-enhanced MDCT and MRI. Hemorrhagic pancreatic abnormalities are best depicted with unenhanced CT and, especially, fat-suppressed T1-weighted MRI. Familiarity with the spectrum of possible underlying causes and the imaging features and conditions that can act as mimics assists radiologists in making an accurate presumptive diagnosis.
