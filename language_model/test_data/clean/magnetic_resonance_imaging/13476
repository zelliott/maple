Answering the above mentioned questions we conclude: 1. MRT is the method of choice to get a precise, clear and reproducible imaging of malformations and space occupying lesions of the CNS. 2. MRT is able to detect inflammatory processes of the CNS earlier than CT. Extension and localization of which are illustrated more precisely. Because there is no ionizing radiation MRT is of importance for follow-up studies. Concerning diffuse inflammatory diseases or early diagnosis of Herpes simplex Encephalitis MRT yields more precise and earlier results. 3. In cases of cerebral seizures with or without lesions in EEG MRT should be used instead of CT. MRT offers multiplanar imaging; there are no bony artefacts. 4. CT is superior to MRT, if calcifications or acute bleedings are expected. MRT provides better differentiation of subacute and chronic hemorrhages. 5. To find out cerebral AV-Malformations MRT is better than angiography. Angiography, however, is important for preoperative questions, and for smaller AV-Malformations especially in the spinal canal. 6. Metabolic and degenerative lesions as well as disturbances of white matter myelination are better seen in MRT due to high soft tissue contrast. 7. In newborns and infants sonography is the best imaging modality and might be completed by MRT and/or CT.
