The authors report a first case of reversible cardiomyopathy in an adult with adrenal insufficiency. A 62-year-old man was administered to hospital because of congestive heart failure. The electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT interval and negative T wave on the right precordial leads and frequent multifocal ventricular premature contractions. On the echocardiogram, the left ventricle was revealed to be diffusely hypokinetic with remarkable enlargement. 201Thallium single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) revealed multiple flow defects in the left ventricular wall. He also had pituitary adrenal insufficiency secondary to an empty sella, which was diagnosed by hormonal studies and magnetic resonance images of the brain. After the replacement therapy with hydrocortisone, heart failure was sufficiently resolved. Abnormal flow defects in the myocardium on SPECT were also improved. To the authors' knowledge, adrenal insufficiency with cardiomyopathy has not been previously described in adult patients.
