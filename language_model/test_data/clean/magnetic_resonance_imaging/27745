The article reviews current magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and illustrates the MRI features of the commonly encountered lesions of the adrenal gland. MR may not always be able to characterize an adrenal mass. In these instances, reviewing the patient's clinical history and prior imaging can usually differentiate benign from malignant lesions, even if you cannot establishing an exact tissue diagnosis. The reader is referred to other reviews of adrenal imaging that emphasizes the use of CT and imaging-management algorithms that are beyond the purview of this focused review (1-6).
