In an attempt to improve the detection of chondral abnormalities with magnetic resonance imaging, a fat-suppressed three-dimensional gradient-recalled acquisition in the steady state (GRASS) and spoiled GRASS (SPGR) sequence was optimized by study of five cadaveric knee specimens. Results with this optimized sequence then were compared with results with three spin-echo (T1-, proton-density-, and T2-weighted) and two three-dimensional gradient-recalled echo sequences (GRASS and non-fat-suppressed SPGR) in the assessment of naturally occurring abnormalities of the patellofemoral compartment in 10 cadaveric knees. Results with the optimized fat-suppressed SPGR sequence were significantly better (P < .02) than results with the other five sequences and had a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 95%, and an accuracy of 95%. In addition, normal cartilage consistently appeared as a trilaminar structure with the fat-suppressed SPGR sequence, a feature that appeared to help in identification of chondral lesions.
