Cystic lesions around the knee comprise a diverse group of entities, ranging from benign cysts to complications of underlying diseases such as infection, arthritis, and malignancy. Their diverse causes result in varied prognoses and therapeutic options. Although the presentation of cystic masses may be similar, their management may differ, thus highlighting the importance of appropriate categorization. MR aids in the characterization of lesions by first localizing them, and then defining their relationship with adjacent structures and identifying any additional abnormalities. For the purpose of this article, the authors limit the scope of their discussion to benign cysts, ganglia, and bursae about the knee.
