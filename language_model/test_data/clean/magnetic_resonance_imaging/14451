MR imaging was performed in five members of a family afflicted with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. The individuals imaged included a male proband, his mother, and three maternal uncles. Clinically affected members showed generalized white matter signal aberration consistent with dys- and demyelination, basal ganglia, and thalamic signal aberration suggestive of pathologic iron storage and diffuse brain atrophy. These findings are similar to those seen in other leukodystrophies. The proband's mother was normal by neurologic examination but showed a suspicious but not definitely abnormal similar pattern of basal ganglionic and white matter signal aberration. In our limited patient sample, MR appears to be able to: (1) demonstrate a pattern of imaging abnormalities characteristic of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (we do not know if this pattern is specific); (2) potentially detect the obligate carrier state; and (3) detect the facultative carrier state.
