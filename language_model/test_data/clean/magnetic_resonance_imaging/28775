A child is presented who displayed hypointense multiple sclerotic lesions on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences by magnetic resonance imaging, with the possible pathologic tissue changes of these hypointense lesions evaluated. The magnetic resonance imaging results in this patient demonstrated the disappearance of low-signal lesions on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery in multiple sclerosis, and the improvement of this patient's condition was likely compatible with sequential magnetic resonance imaging findings. Some hypointense lesions in the supratentorial white matter that appear on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images in multiple sclerosis patients may include reversible brain lesions, suggesting extracellular fluid collection not accompanied by axonal loss or gliosis.
