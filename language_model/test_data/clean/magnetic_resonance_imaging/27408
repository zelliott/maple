A 5-year-old girl presented with a mass of the lower eyelid causing lower eyelid retraction and traction in upgaze. The patient had a recent history of minor trauma to the area. An orbitotomy was performed with lateral canthotomy and cantholysis to allow for dissection of the lesion, which was found in the anterior lamella of the lower eyelid. Pathologic review showed non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with granulation tissue. Reports of granulomas of the oral mucosa secondary to trauma are common in the dental literature. This is a unique case in that it is the first report of a subcutaneous granuloma of the eyelid arising secondary to trauma.
