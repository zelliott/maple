Primary leiomyosarcoma of the thyroid gland is rare. In this paper, we report a case of high-grade leiomyosarcoma of the thyroid gland in a 43-year-old man. Lung metastasis was also noted in this patient. Despite of aggressive surgical treatment, the patient died of uncontrolled local recurrent disease 6 months after the initial operation. Immunohistochemical studies showed the tumor cells were positive for c-kit proto-oncogene product. Imatinib mesylate was used as a post-operative adjuvant treatment but the response was poor. The role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on the treatment of thyroid leiomyosarcomas is still unclear because this is the first report of c-kit over-expression in such tumors. Nevertheless, our results show that c-kit over-expression might not be an indicator of good response to imatinib mesylate treatment in thyroid leiomyosarcomas.
