Although multiple sclerosis (MS) is a physically disabling disease, many patients also suffer from cognitive dysfunction in all stages of the disease. Recent studies have demonstrated that 45 up to 65% of MS patients are cognitively impaired. The profile of MS-related cognitive dysfunction varies greatly. It includes memory and learning deficits, attention deficits, executive dysfunction and visuo-spatial deficits. Most studies of cognition in MS examined patients in later stages, often including MS patients with marked physical disabilities. Our own studies revealed cognitive dysfunction in MS patients within the early stage of disease as well. In this paper, three patients with MS in different stages and with different MRI-findings will be presented in consideration of cognitive dysfunction in particular.
