Ocular motility impairment associated with orbital trauma may have several causes and manifest with various clinical symptoms. In some cases orbital reconstructive surgery can be very challenging and the results are often unsatisfactory. The use of modern imaging techniques aids proper diagnosis and surgical planning.

The authors present the case of a 29-year-old male who sustained trauma to the left orbit. Orthoptic examination revealed limited supra- and infraduction of the left eye. The patient reported diplopia in upgaze and downgaze with primary position spared. Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) was performed, which revealed restriction of the left inferior rectus muscle in its central section. A patient-specific anatomical model was prepared on the basis of 3-dimensional computed tomography (CT) study of the intact orbit, which was used to prepare a custom pre-bent titanium mesh implant. The patient underwent reconstructive surgery of the orbital floor.

Modern imaging techniques such as dMRI and 3-dimensional CT reconstruction allow us to better understand the pathophysiology of orbital floor fractures and to precisely plan surgical treatment.
