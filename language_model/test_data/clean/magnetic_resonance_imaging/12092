The sensitivity of the diagnostic procedures in space occupying lesions of the spine have been markedly improved in the recent past, mainly due to the application of CT and MRI--technology and the introduction of superselective angiography. Despite these 'high-tech'-investigations, neurological examination still provides the sole in neurological diagnosis. To show the discrepancies between the techniques mentioned, we present a case of a vascular malformation of the spine with secondary myelopathy (so-called "Foix-Alajouanine-syndrome").
