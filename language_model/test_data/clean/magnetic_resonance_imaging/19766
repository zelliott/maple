Multiple sclerosis is the most frequent multifocal disease of the central nervous system, but in a diagnosis of atypical cases about 100 other diseases should be considered. Neuroborreliosis plays a particular role among them, especially in endemic regions. Difficulties result from similarities of clinical symptoms and lack of specific diagnostic investigations. Diagnostic procedures in neuroborreliosis are mostly based on laboratory analyses and serologic examinations of serum and cerebrospinal fluid, in connection with a clinical picture and an epidemiological state. Since the year 2001, multiple sclerosis neurological diagnostic is based on the diagnostic criteria established under the auspices of The US National Multiple Sclerosis Society and International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies. Those recommendations regarding relapsing-remitting MS and primary progressing MS are discussed in this paper. Current knowledge of those diseases warrants cautiousness in the diagnostic of atypical cases.
