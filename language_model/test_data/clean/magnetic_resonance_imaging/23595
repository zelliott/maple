This report describes a term newborn with isolated distortion in the left parietal bone without any other visible congenital anomaly, due to amniotic band disruption. A skull x-ray, ultrasound scan and subsequent MRI scan of the brain did not show any apparent distortion apart from depression and concavity in the left parietal bone. The purpose of this case report is to raise awareness of this possible, mild outcome of this little-known entity, which may mimic caput succedaneum (moulding of the presenting part in the birth canal during natural delivery), and to provide a historical and embryological background.
