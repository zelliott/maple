We have developed four methods to generate a fractal dimension image and have applied them to the brain MRI. We have adopted four types of scanning methods, "CONVENTIONAL", "OVERLAPPING", "SYMMETRIC" and "FOLDED" to estimate the fractal dimension. The first three methods show almost the same fractal dimension images and their values were between two and three. In the "FOLDED" method, we were able to obtain the images in which the edge of a narrow region including dura and scalp surrounding the brain was selectively enhanced in the T1-weighted MRI. This is found to be a new edge-enhancing filter. We could remove the surrounding structure of the brain by using these filtered images and detect the edge of the brain surface automatically. The brain surface data can be used for various applications such as three-dimensional surface display and registration of inter-modal brain images.
