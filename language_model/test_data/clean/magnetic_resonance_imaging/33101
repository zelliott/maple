In the search for a less expensive alternative to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is contraindicated in some patients, we evaluated the accuracy of an individualized MR template-based head model in terms of navigated brain stimulation system targeting. The mean error between the identification of target points on individualized and individual (gold standard) head models was found to be 4.69Â±2.21 mm (arithmetic mean), i.e., more comparable to the values reported for individual MRI-based than for MR-independent approaches.
