Function and morphology of the cerebral vasculature were studied in the amyloid (Abeta) plaque-containing double-transgenic (TG) B6.PS2APP Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model with MRI at an age range of 10 to 17 months. Perfusion, blood volume, and average vessel geometry were assessed in the brain and compared to age-matched controls (wild-type [WT] C57Bl/6). Additionally, the MR relaxation times T(1), T(2), and T(2)* were measured to detect potential pathological changes that might be associated with Abeta plaque depositions. Both decreased perfusion and decreased blood volume were observed in the occipital cortex in B6.PS2APP mice as compared to controls. A significant decrease in T(1) and T(2) was found in the frontal cortex and in the subiculum/parasubiculum. Immunohistochemistry confirmed plaque depositions in the cortex and in the subiculum/parasubiculum. In summary, our data indicate a reduced blood supply of B6.PS2APP mice in the occipital cortex that parallels the findings in cortical regions of patients with AD.
