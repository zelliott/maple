Worldwide, cysticercosis is the most common parasitic infection of the central nervous system. In endemic regions, the incidence of neurocysticercosis (NCC) approaches 4% of the general population. The disease is predominantly intracranial, the authors of most series generally report the incidence of spinal NCC as only 1.5 to 3% of all cases. Although spinal NCC is relatively rare, it represents a distinct clinical entity that can have devastating consequences for the patient. Because of the limited size of the spinal canal, the mass effect of these lesions is poorly tolerated. Most spinal NCC occurs in the subarachnoid space where mass effect can cause spinal cord compression, although obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid pathways due to scarring of the subarachnoid space can also cause symptoms. The authors treated six patients with spinal NCC. In five cases the lesions were located in the subarachnoid space, and in one the lesion was intramedullary. All patients with subarachnoid spinal NCC required excision of the symptomatic lesions; in two cases initial medical therapy had failed. The patient with intramedullary spinal NCC experienced mild symptoms and underwent steroid therapy. All patients experienced variably improved outcomes and were eventually ambulatory. Medical therapy should be carefully considered in selected patients in whom symptoms are stable and nonprogressive. Surgical intervention is required when severe or progressive deficits occur to prevent permanent injury. In some patients recovery may be limited as a result of inflammatory injury to the spinal cord or arachnoidal adhesions.
