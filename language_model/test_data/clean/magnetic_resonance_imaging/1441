Computed tomography (CT) is the fundamental examination in the diagnosis and assessment of intracranial lesions. After it, other exploratory techniques, such as cervical doppler-ultrasonography, digital angiography by the arterial route, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and straight X-ray films of the skull may be considered. The choice between these different techniques depends on the neurological pathology being investigated.
