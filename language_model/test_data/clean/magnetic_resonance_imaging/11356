We show that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to quantify the amount of muscle in the lower legs of adult rats and to noninvasively monitor the onset and progression of denervation-induced atrophy. Muscle cross-sectional areas determined from 2D gradient-echo MR images allow longitudinal quantification of the protective effects of a beta(2)-adrenergic agonist clenbuterol. We also show that the estimation of clenbuterol's efficacy is improved by computation of the muscle volume. Rapid animal throughput and the ability to accurately estimate efficacy make MRI an attractive technology for studying skeletal muscle atrophy and hypertrophy, allowing the evaluation of potential therapies in longitudinal studies.
