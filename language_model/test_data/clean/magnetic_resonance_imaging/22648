Brucellosis is a zoonosis of worldwide distribution presenting with a wide clinical spectrum. Brucellosis can involve any organ or system. The axial skeleton is the most common site of involvement with a frequency ranging from 2% to 53%. Multiple-level spinal involvements are rare. This report describes the first case of noncontiguous synchronous multifocal involvement of all cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions in a patient with brucellar spondylodiscitis.
