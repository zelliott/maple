Standard chemotherapy administered systemically has a limited efficacy in the treatment of brain tumors. One of the major obstacles in the treatment of brain neoplasias is the impediment to delivery across the intact blood-brain barrier (BBB). Many innovative approaches have been developed to circumvent this obstacle. One such strategy is BBB disruption (BBBD), which successfully increases the delivery of antineoplastic agents to the central nervous system (CNS). This chapter describes the application of the BBBD technique in rats. Different methods to evaluate and measure BBB permeability following hyperosmolar mannitol infusion including Evans blue staining, albumin immunohistochemistry, and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging are also described.
