To investigate whether early rehabilitation has a positive impact on the recovery of the activities of daily living and motor function after intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke, 364 patients with hemorrhagic stroke were selected and randomly divided into a rehabilitation group and a control group. The rehabilitation group underwent a standardized, three-stage rehabilitation program. The control group was treated with standard hospital ward, internal medical intervention. The simplified Fugl-Myere assessment scale (FMA) and Modified Barthel Index (MBI) were administered at various time points. The magnitude of improvement was significantly higher in the rehabilitation group than in the control group for both the FMA (p<0.05) and MBI scores (p<0.05). The greatest improvement was observed in the first month post-stroke. Thus, our study shows that early rehabilitation can significantly improve the daily activities and motor functions of patients with stroke.
