A case of consumptive coagulopathy in a 30-year-old pregnant woman with degenerated uterine leiomyoma is described. She developed lower abdominal pain at 21 weeks of gestation. Laboratory profiles revealed coagulation abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging diagnosed degenerated uterine leiomyoma. At 34 weeks, she underwent cesarean section and myomectomy. Pathological examination showed the presence of organized thrombi in the vessels of leiomyoma. The consumption of platelets and coagulation factors in degenerated uterine leiomyoma may result in consumptive coagulopathy.
