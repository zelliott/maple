The case of a patient with essential tremor in whom tremor disappeared on the right side after a homolateral cerebellar infarct is reported. The pathophysiology of essential tremor remains unknown. Vascular and surgical lesions of dentorubrothalamic pathway have been reported to improve various kinds of tremor including essential tremor. In this patient, a lesion of this pathway related to the cerebellar infarct probably explains the homolateral cessation of essential tremor.
