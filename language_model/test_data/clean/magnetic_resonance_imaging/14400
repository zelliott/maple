Twenty-nine patients were examined by magnetic resonance imaging for various lesions of the spine. The results of these scans were compared with those of plain radiographs, computertomographs, and radionuclide bone scans. The findings were substantiated by intraoperative or histological findings in 18 cases. The MRI scans proved to be very sensitive in the detection of a wide spectrum of morphological changes of the bone marrow of vertebral bodies. Characteristic changes of the signal patterns for inflammatory and tumorous lesions were not observed. The differentiation of these lesions will presently continue to have to be based on morphological criteria.
