Signal intensities of the pituitary gland were measured on T1-weighted sagittal MR images of 25 patients younger than 20 years old. We found that the signal intensities in the eight patients who were 8 weeks old or younger were higher (shorter T1) than those in the 17 older patients. We also noted a difference in the signal intensities across the pituitary gland, the signal being higher in the posterior part of the gland than in the anterior part. We attribute the high signal intensities to the rapid intrauterine pituitary growth, so that at term pituitary protein synthetic activity is at a maximum. Possibly, an increase in the bound fraction of the water molecules of the gland may also be present in the neonatal pituitary as compared with the older gland, but this remains to be proved. The higher signal in the posterior pituitary gland may be due to lipid in the pituicyte cells of the posterior pituitary gland.
