Parathyroid cysts are rare causes of neck swelling accounting for 0.6% of thyroid and parathyroid lesions. They may be functional, resulting in the release of parathyroid hormone, or non-functional. Non-functional cysts may be cosmetically unacceptable or cause dysphagia, dyspnoea or recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy as a result of compression. This article presents a young woman who was diagnosed with a thyroid cyst both on examination and imaging. However, the final histology confirmed this to be parathyroid in origin and this should be considered in the differential of such neck swellings.
