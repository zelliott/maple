Magnetic resonance imaging has acquired a leading role in the assessment of the posterior cranial fossa, base of the skull, and neck. Several technical improvements, such as further refinement of surface coils, fast scanning, and paramagnetic agents, have enhanced the diagnostic capability of this imaging technique. It is extremely useful in the differentiation of pathologic processes arising from or involving the petrous pyramids, such as congenital cholesteatomas, cholesterol granulomas, and glomus tumors. It is the study of choice for both extra- and intra-axial lesions in the posterior cranial fossa. The magnetic characteristics of the most common lesions are reviewed in this paper.
