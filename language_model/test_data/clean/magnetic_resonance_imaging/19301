Recent advances in transgenic technology have made the mouse a particularly interesting small animal in cardiovascular research. Increasingly sophisticated experimental methods and tools are needed for detailed characterization of cardiovascular physiology and biochemistry in the mice. The objective of this study was to develop a method for noninvasive evaluation of cardiac energy metabolism in the mouse. Cardiac gated (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy using Image Selected in Vivo Spectroscopy (ISIS) method was applied in old mice overexpressing bovine growth hormone (bGH) (n = 5) and control mice (n = 5). The localized volumes of interest were 128 and 112 microL, respectively. Phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratio was 1.5 +/- 0.13 in the bGH mice and 2.1 +/- 0.04 in the control group (P < 0.01). The study demonstrates the feasibility of application of volume-selective (31)P MRS for evaluation of cardiac energy metabolism in the mouse under maintained physiological conditions.
