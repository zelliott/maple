Magnetic resonance imaging has become the standard means of imaging pediatric airway obstruction due to vascular anomalies. However, magnetic resonance imaging requires a long acquisition time and is prone to motion artifacts. The development of spiral or helical computed tomography provides an alternative imaging modality for evaluating pediatric airway obstruction. We present the case of a neonate with a double aortic arch which initially was not identified on magnetic resonance imaging but was visualized with spiral computed tomography. If suspicion of an intra-thoracic abnormality is high, spiral computed tomography may be a useful adjunct or replacement to magnetic resonance imaging.
