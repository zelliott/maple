Patients with right parietal damage demonstrate a variety of attentional deficits in their left visual field contralateral to their lesion. We now report that patients with right lesions also show a severe loss in the perception of apparent motion in their "good" right visual field ipsilateral to their lesion. Three tests of attention were conducted, and losses were found only in the contralesional fields for a selective attention and a multiple object tracking task. Losses in apparent motion, however, were bilateral in all cases. The deficit in apparent motion in the parietal patients supports previous claims that this relatively effortless percept is mediated by attention. However, the bilateral deficit suggests that the disruption is due to a bilateral loss in the temporal resolution of attention to transient events that drive the apparent motion percept.
