Noninvasive EEG examination is not always adequate for the determination of the epileptogenic area. In such cases invasive methods are required. The authors report on their experience with the implantation of subdural plates for the precise ictal and inter-ictal determination of the epileptogenic areal and the stimulation of the eloquent cortex. From December 1992 to December 1997, 97 patients were evaluated in the Bethel epilepsy center using subdural plates. Of these patients, 44 were children or adolescents, who underwent 45 resections. In order to be able to draw differentiated conclusions on the use of subdural plates in children and adolescents, these patients were divided into three age groups: Group 1, 0-5 years (n = 12); Group 2, 6-11 years (n = 13 + 1 repeat evaluation and resection); Group 3, 12-18 years (n = 19). In the groups of children and adolescents examined there were no complications or progress impediments which might give reason to assume that the application of these techniques involves risks or hazards. This has been verified by the results, in which 75% of age Groups 1 and 3 were categorized as 1 a/b or 2d according to the Engel classification.
