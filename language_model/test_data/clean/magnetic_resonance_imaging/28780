The possibilities of CT and MR imaging in laryngeal tumours, focused on squamous cell carcinoma, are reviewed. As in other areas of the head and neck, the primary roll of laryngeal imaging studies is to define the extent of disease. Neither CT nor MRI show mucosal detail, but clarify the submucosal extent of disease. Both imaging modalities yield comparable results; in selected cases, they may be considered to be complementary to each other.
