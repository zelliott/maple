The authors describe a rare case of an intradural cervical disc herniation in a 40-year-old man presenting with Brown-SÃ©quard's syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the pathological entity at the C5-6 disc space, which showed suspicious signs of intradural extension of the disc herniation. After the patient underwent microsurgical removal of the herniated disc via an anterior approach, he experienced a complete remission of symptoms. The existing pertinent literature is reviewed, and diagnostic and therapeutic implications are discussed.
