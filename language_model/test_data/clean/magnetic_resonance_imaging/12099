A case of tuberous sclerosis in a neonate, with cerebral and cardiac hamartomas evaluated by MR imaging, is presented. Intracranial subependymal tubers in this neonate exhibit increased signal intensity on short TR images. This differs from the signal characteristics of subependymal tubers in older patients.
