Aim of the present study is to describe a case of extranodal lymphoma localized in paravertebral site, near to thoracic spine. The clinical onset of the affection was as a radicular sciatalgic pain, resistant to long-term current therapy by NSAIDs, and determined by neuroradicular involvement by the neoplastic bulk. The interest of the present case is determined by: 1) the presence of a pain which, for a long while, mimicked one of the most trivial painful syndromes; 2) the fact that extranodal lymphomas are not so rare ones. An extensive research of such entities is therefore mandatory; 3) the diagnosis was made by means of non-invasive examination, and needle biopsy was performed only to confirm a picture which was already patent.
