Malignancy (defined as metastatic disease) has been reported in nearly 5% of head and neck paragangliomas. Metastases preferentially target the lymph nodes, lung, liver, or bone. We describe three patients with multiple silent bone metastases exhibiting a fatty halo at MRI that coexisted with expansive bone lesions. In all cases, (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((123)MIBG) scintigraphy showed no abnormal tracer uptake, whereas (111)In-pentetreotide scintigraphy visualized a few silent bone metastases. These findings indicate that MRI should be included in the staging of paraganglioma patients with risk factors for malignancy.
