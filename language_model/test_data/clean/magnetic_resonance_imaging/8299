Pseudoaneurysms secondary to bone tumours are rare and most of the reported cases are related to osteochondromas, either due to direct pressure or following surgery. Aneurysmal bone cysts are relatively common bony lesions usually treated by curettage.

We describe an unusual case of pseudoaneurysm of the anterior tibial artery complicating curettage of an aneurysmal bone cyst which presented as a rapidly enlarging mass clinically thought to be rapid recurrence of the tumour. This was successfully treated by embolisation.
