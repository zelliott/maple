Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an emerging tool to assess organ-specific iron load in patients with transfusion dependent anemia.

We performed MRI T2 star (T2*) assessment in 44 transfusion dependent patients to study the prevalence of cardiac and liver iron overload and the relationship of T2* measurement with various clinical and biochemical parameters.

Mean age of the study subjects was 19.9 years (range 8.8-32.3) and the mean cardiac T2* was 23.4 +/- 13.8 msec. Fifty percent of the subjects had abnormal cardiac T2* (below 20 msec). Cardiac T2* was not found to have any correlation with serum ferritin or liver T2*. Liver T2* value was abnormal in 79% of the subjects and it correlated inversely with both current and 12 months average serum ferritin (r = -0.44, P = 0.003; r = -0.46, P = 0.002). Clinical parameters including age, duration of transfusion, age starting iron chelation therapy, and ratio between transfusion volume and desferrioxamine dosage were not correlated with cardiac and liver T2*.

We conclude that iron overload in heart and liver is common in our transfusion dependent patients. Liver T2* has inverse correlation with serum ferritin. Cardiac T2* does not have any correlation with the various clinical and biochemical parameters.
