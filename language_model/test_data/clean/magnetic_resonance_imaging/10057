Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has unmatched potential for planning, guiding, monitoring and controlling interventions. MR arthrography (MRA) is the imaging gold standard to assess small ligament and fibrocartilage injury in joints. In contemporary practice, MRA consists of two consecutive sessions: 1) an interventional session where a needle is driven to the joint space and gadolinium contrast is injected under fluoroscopy or CT guidance. 2) A diagnostic MRI imaging session to visualize the distribution of contrast inside the joint space and evaluate the condition of the joint. Our approach to MRA is to eliminate the separate radiologically guided needle insertion and contrast injection procedure by performing those tasks on conventional high-field closed MRI scanners. We propose a 2D augmented reality image overlay device to guide needle insertion procedures. This approach makes diagnostic high-field magnets available for interventions without a complex and expensive engineering entourage.
