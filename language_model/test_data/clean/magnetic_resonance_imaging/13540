A case report.

To report a case of swelling of the spinal cord and an intramedullary lesion occurring after expansive laminoplasty for cervical spondylotic myelopathy.

A university hospital in Japan.

Clinical evaluation, radiography, MR imaging.

A 65-year-old man with a cervical spondylotic myelopathy in whom symptoms were improved immediately after expansive laminoplasty, but became aggravated 2 weeks later. Magnetic resonance images demonstrated swelling of the spinal cord and an intramedullary lesion that extended from the medulla oblongata to C7. Nine months after surgery, the lesion was reduced to C2-6, but neurological deterioration had not improved. Six years after surgery, the patient remains confined to bed.

Patients with such disease conditions are rare, and it is difficult to predict postoperative swelling of the spinal cord before surgery. Spine surgeons should be aware of such rare disease conditions involving the spinal cord.
