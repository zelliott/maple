To explore the application of imaging techniques in determining the death cause and injury manner.

One case due to high fall was fully examined using multi-slice spiral computed tomography (MSCT), 3-D imaging creation and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The systemic and detailed autopsy was subsequently performed to compare with the results from imaging studies. The advantages and disadvantages of autopsy and imaging studies were then analyzed.

Most of the important information such as trauma, fracture and hemorrhage could be obtained by imaging techniques. Furthermore, imaging methods can predict injuries in internal body before autopsy and be minimal or non-invasive to the cadaver. However, the imaging techniques probably also can not find some details in comparison to autopsy in forensic practice and need to improve in their future application.

Application of imaging techniques can be used as the guidance and complimentary for the forensic autopsy in the identification of injury manner. In addition, the application can even be used to replace autopsy in some special circumstances.
