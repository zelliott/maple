A medically sound and cost-effective choice of diagnostic imaging investigations in knee pathology must be supported by a good evaluation of the respective strong and weak points of the available methods. These are: conventional radiology, C.T., arthrography, arthro C.T., ultrasound, scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging. Based upon that analysis, decisional algorithms are proposed, in function of the clinically suspected pathologies.
