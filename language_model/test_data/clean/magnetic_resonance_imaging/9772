Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and arthroscopy have frequently been used to evaluate articular cartilage. Many studies have compared the accuracy of MRI to that of arthroscopy. However, there have been no previous comparison studies between MRI and arthroscopy in the evaluation of repaired cartilage after autologous chondrocyte implantation using the Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) scoring system. The purpose of this study was to compare the results between MRI and arthroscopy after autologous chondrocyte implantation of an osteochondral lesion of the talus using a modified MOCART scoring system. Our study investigated 27 consecutive cases in 26 patients who underwent follow-up MRI and second-look arthroscopy 1 year following autologous chondrocyte implantation based on their osteochondral lesion of the talus diagnosis. According to the comparison results of those 5 categories, the agreement between MRI and arthroscopy evaluation results was statistically significant with good reliability in the categories of the degree of defect repair and defect filling, the quality of repaired tissue surface, and synovitis. However, the integration with the border zone and the adhesion category showed poor to moderate reliability. There has been no well-established correlation method between arthroscopy and MRI after autologous chondrocyte implantation of an osteochondral lesion of the talus.
