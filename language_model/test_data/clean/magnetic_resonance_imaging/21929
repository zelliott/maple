To compare conventional two-dimensional multisection images with registered three-dimensional volume and subtraction images for detecting subtle changes in the brains of infants and children.

Twenty-six patients (24 with hemorrhagic/ischemic lesions) and one each with perinatal infection and Sturge-Weber disease were examined on two or more occasions with conventional multisection T1- and T2-weighted sequences as well as with 3-D T1-weighted volume sequences. A registration program was used to match the volume images to subvoxel dimensions, and subtracted images (second volume set minus the first) were obtained. The multisection images were compared with the 3-D and subtracted images and graded for detection of changes in a variety of brain structures.

In 16% to 33% of comparisons of different structures, the multisection images and the 3-D registered and subtracted images showed changes equally well. The 3-D registered and subtracted images were better than the multisection images in 67% to 84% of comparisons for detection of changes in the cerebral hemispheres, ventricles, brain stem, cerebellum, and in lesions. Statistically significant differences were found between the graded performance of the registered 3-D images and the conventional 2-D images in detecting cerebral infarction and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. In the late phase following neonatal cerebral infarction (1 to 11 months), the 3-D registered and subtracted images revealed growth of the brain at the margins of the lesions.

Subvoxel registration of serial MR images may be of value in detecting subtle changes in the brains of infants and children.
