We report a case of de novo malignant ganglioglioma. A 61-year-old male presented with a 12-day history of headaches and general malaise. Pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging revealed an irregular enhancing mass in the left temporal lobe with associated dural enhancement and subacute subdural hematoma. The findings at surgery were of a vascular tumor intimately involving the surrounding white matter, with central necrosis. Histological and immunohistochemical studies showed an anaplastic ganglioglioma with World Health Organization grade IV characteristics. Gangliogliomas of the central nervous system are rare and are typified by a pediatric predilection and indolent behavior. A review of the de novo anaplastic and malignant gangliogliomas is presented.
