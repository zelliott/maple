Partial olfactory seizures are infrequent. They are related to the presence of lesions in the uncinate area of the temporal lobe. Patients describe smells during the ictal phase that are generally unpleasant. We report the cases of two patients with olfactory disorders of a paroxysmal nature caused by a parasellar meningioma.

Case 1: a 43 year old male who presented paroxysmal episodes in which he perceived a bitter smell, with dysphoria, linked to the presence of a left side parasellar meningioma. Case 2: a 45 year old female who presented paroxysmal episodes during which she could smell formaldehyde and this was linked to the presence of a left side parasellar meningioma.

Olfactory seizures are related to structural alterations to the amygdala. The most frequent causes are associated to the presence of mesial temporal sclerosis and, above all, to tumours situated in the temporomesial structures that have diverse aetiologies.
