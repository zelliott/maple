A variety of intrinsic and extrinsic tumours and tumour-like conditions may affect the infrapatellar (Hoffa's) fat pad (IFP). MR imaging is the technique of choice in evaluating these conditions, but correlation with radiographs is important to identify those lesions producing mineralization. This pictorial review illustrates the spectrum of mass-like lesions that can affect the IFP, emphasizing the radiographic and MR findings that suggest a specific diagnosis.
