This paper discusses the contribution offered by radiological techniques to the diagnosis of the medical and surgical complications of anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia (BN) with the aim of providing general indications as to their use and suggesting the best-suited techniques. In the broad field of the complications of malnourishment, the use of magnetic resonance (MR) instead of computed tomography (CT) in the assessment of brain atrophy provides much more information at a better cost-benefit ratio. Like brain atrophy, other complications may be chance radiographic findings, such as cathartic colon and colon ptosis. Pulmonary tuberculosis and the presence of bronchopneumonia in conditions of malnutrition demand that conventional X-rays be supplemented by high-resolution CT scans, MR and echotomography. When checking for parotidomegaly and polycystic ovary, the best imaging technique is echotomography. Radiologists are also called upon to express their view in the case of emergencies such as the rupture of the esophagus and osteoporosis-induced fractures.
