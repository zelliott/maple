The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of 15 cases of tuberculous (TB) spinal infection were reviewed. The commonest site was the lumbar spine (53.3%), often with three or more contiguous vertebrae involved (47%). Destruction of the vertebral body and the presence of paraspinal soft-tissue masses were noted in 73.3%. Posterior element abnormalities, which is a significant finding, were seen in 40%, a slightly lower incidence rate than in other reported series. Epidural disease (53.3%) and disc abnormalities (73%) were more frequent than was realized. The role of intravenous contrast is discussed. Intravenous gadolinium is useful because it increases diagnostic confidence by characterizing and delineating the disease process, detects reactivation in old and healed TB, helps in treatment management and may prove valuable in monitoring therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging should be considered to be the imaging modality of choice for patients with suspected tuberculous spinal infection.
