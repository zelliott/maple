Magnetic Resonance has become the preferred neuro-imaging modality. To fully take advantage of the high anatomical resolution the Riechert stereotactic system was adapted for use in Magnetic Resonance Stereotaxy. The head ring which until recently was made of an aluminum alloy has been replaced by an unsegmented head ring of pure titanium without changing the dimensions and fixation mode. No significant misregistration due to eddy currents has been noticed. Minor distortion induced by the titanium head ring can be corrected mathematically. Thus the geometric information is limited only by the pixel resolution of the MR image.
