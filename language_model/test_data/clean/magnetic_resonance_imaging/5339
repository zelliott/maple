Fifty-one osteonecrotic hips in 40 patients were randomly divided into 2 treatment groups. Patients in group A (25 hips) were treated with core decompression, and those in group B (26 hips) received autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell instillation into the core tract after core decompression. Outcome between the 2 groups were compared clinically (Harris Hip score), radiographically (x-ray and magnetic resonance imaging), and by Kaplan-Meier hip survival analysis after 12 and 24 months of surgical intervention. The clinical score and mean hip survival were significantly better in group B than in group A (P < .05). Patients with adverse prognostic features at initial presentation, that is, poor Harris Hip score, x-ray changes, edema, and/or effusion on magnetic resonance imaging had significantly better clinical outcome and hip survival in group B than in group A.
