Behind the diagnosis of "distorsio carpi" frequently ligamental injuries with severe functional damage of the carpal joint are hidden. To clear these is, in a significant part of the cases, also in the outpatient department possible if both the clinical (physical) and radiological examinations are carried out with adequate accuracy. Author deals with the "algorithm", summarizing the sequence of these examinations. If, in major complaints, it was not possible to make a diagnosis, an arthroscopy of the carpal joint is suggested.
