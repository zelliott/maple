A severe rest tremor arose in a patient's right arm 9 months after a pontine tegmental hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance studies at 4 and 10 months showed residual hemosiderin in the pons and increasing hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) affecting primarily the left olive. The tremor was refractory to pharmacotherapy (clonazepam, propranolol, and levodopa), but was reduced after implantation of a thalamic stimulator device. Although pontine hemorrhage is among several common causes of HOD, it has not previously been appreciated as a cause of midbrain ("rubral") tremor. A disynaptic dentatorubroolivary tract associated with tremor and monosynaptic dentatoolivary tract associated with HOD may both be components of the rubroolivocerebellorubral loop implicated in midbrain tremor. Their proximity makes the combination of tremor and HOD after pontine tegmental damage plausible and even likely.
