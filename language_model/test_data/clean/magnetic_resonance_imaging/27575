Gnathostoma spinigerum and Angiostrongylus cantonensis are human parasites that can cause neurological symptoms. The human diseases produced by these parasites can usually be differentiated by clinical symptoms. The aim of this study was to report neuroimaging abnormalities detected with computed tomography (CT) and MR in patients with gnathostomiasis and angiostrongyliasis. We enrolled 15 and 12 patients with serologically proven gnathostomiasis and angiostrongyliasis, respectively, who had brain or spinal imaging done. The neuro-gnathostomiasis group had significantly more patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and myelitis patterns. The angiostrongyliasis group had no specific findings and most patients had normal CT brain images. The variety of neuroimaging findings is shown here. This study emphasizes that neuroimaging studies may be useful to differentiate gnathostomiasis and angiostrongyliasis particularly in patients with indistinct clinical presentations.
