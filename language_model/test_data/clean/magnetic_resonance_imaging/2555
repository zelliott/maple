We report a case of diffuse enhancement of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after intravenous administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine in an 8-year-old girl with a primitive neuroectodermal tumor. The enhancement of the CSF was caused by leakage of gadolinium chelate complexes into the CSF, which was proved by CSF analysis.
