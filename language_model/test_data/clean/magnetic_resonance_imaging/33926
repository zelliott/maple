A new case of hepatic inflammatory pseudotumor (HIP) is reported. A 66-year-old woman presented with fever and toxic syndrome. Analysis demonstrated an elevation in erythrocyte sedimentation, CRP, leukocytosis and normocytic anemia. A lesion was observed on ultrasonography in the right hypoechoic hepatic lobe with echos within (mosaic pattern). The lesion was hypodense on CT scan and was hypervascularized on angiography. NMR was hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2. The patient underwent surgery with intraoperative biopsy being performed. Hepatectomy was not carried out given negativity of malignancy. Following surgery the patient remained asymptomatic and the analytical alterations normalized. After a asymptomatic 5-year period the clinical-analytical alterations reappeared following erysipelas. Fever showed partial response to non steroid antiinflammatory drugs and a satisfactory response to corticoids. Studies are required to evaluate the role of corticoid treatment in this disease.
