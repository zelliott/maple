Secondary aneurysmal bone cyst in fibrous dysplasia is exceedingly rare, especially in the skull and particularly in the frontal bone. We present a case of aneurysmal bone cyst concomitant with fibrous dysplasia in the frontal bone in a 15-year-old male patient presenting with headache and euphoria with an uncharacteristic imaging appearance and treated successfully by total resection.
