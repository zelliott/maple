Juxtaglomerular tumors, or reninomas, are a rare cause of hypertension, almost always benign and accurately localized by a combination of biochemical tests and imaging. Because the tumors are usually small at presentation, and there are good markers for recurrence, we consider treatment by radiofrequency ablation a useful alternative to nephron-sparing surgery and describe its use in one patient.
