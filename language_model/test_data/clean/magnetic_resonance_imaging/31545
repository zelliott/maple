Tumor aggressiveness and response to therapy are influenced by the extravascular extracellular space fraction (EESF) of the malignant tissue. The EESF may, therefore, be an important prognostic parameter for cancer patients. The aim of this study was to investigate whether gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA)-based dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) can be used to assess the EESF of tumors. Amelanotic human melanoma xenografts (A-07, R-18) were used as preclinical models of human cancer. Images of E.F (E is the initial extraction fraction of Gd-DTPA and F is perfusion) and lambda (the partition coefficient of Gd-DTPA) were obtained by Kety analysis of DCE-MRI data. Our study was based on the hypothesis that lambda is governed by the EESF and is not influenced significantly by microvascular density (MVD) or blood perfusion. To test this hypothesis, we searched for correlations between lambda and E.F, MVD or EESF by comparing lambda images with E.F images, histological preparations from the imaged tissue and the radial heterogeneity in EESF obtained by invasive imaging. Positive correlations were found between lambda and EESF. Thus, median lambda was larger in A-07 tumors than in R-18 tumors by a factor of 4.2 (P<.00001), consistent with the histological observation that EESF is approximately fourfold larger in A-07 tumors than in R-18 tumors. The radial heterogeneity in lambda in A-07 and R-18 tumors was almost identical to the radial heterogeneity in EESF. Moreover, lambda was larger in tissue regions with high EESF than in tissue regions with low EESF in A-07 tumors (P=.048). On the other hand, significant correlations between lambda and MVD or E.F could not be detected. Consequently, Kety analysis of Gd-DTPA-based DCE-MRI series of xenografted tumors provides lambda images that primarily reflect the EESF of the tissue.
