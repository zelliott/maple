Cherubism is a paediatric disease affecting the jaws. It is a close radiological mimic of giant cell lesions of the mandible. The radiographic features of this condition are well known; however, the MR imaging features have not been well described. We describe the radiographic, CT and MR imaging features of cherubism in a 5-year-old girl. We highlight the MR appearances of cherubic lesions and the ability of MRI to not only accurately depict the anatomical extent of the lesions, but also to reveal signal intensity changes in those areas that are apparently normal on radiographs and CT images.
