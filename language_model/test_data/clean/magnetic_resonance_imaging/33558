The authors report the case of a patient harbouring a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula adjacent to an intradural neurofibroma. Only the latter could be demonstrated by the diagnostic modalities employed. Such a coexistence proved misleading and two interventions were needed to cure both lesions. Only one report has appeared in the literature dealing with such a condition. The possibility of such a coexistence is stressed and mechanisms are discussed.
