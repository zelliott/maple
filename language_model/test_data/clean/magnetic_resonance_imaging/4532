A 15-year-old girl was diagnosed as having acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL, FAB M2) in January 1990 and achieved complete remission with chemotherapy. She was readmitted to our hospital with a hearing disturbance and hoarseness in October 1990. A suprapharyngeal tumor was found on cranial MRI, and bone marrow leukemic cells were slightly increased in number. Involvement of leukemic cells was proven by biopsy of the tumor. Therefore, we made a diagnosis of ANLL relapse with Garcin's syndrome. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of leukemia complicated by Garcin's syndrome.
