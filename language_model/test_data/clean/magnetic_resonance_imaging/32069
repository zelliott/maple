We report two cases of thoracoscopic resection of esophageal duplication cysts. Both patients underwent successful thoracoscopic excision. They were discharged on postoperative day 2 and 4, respectively. They made uneventful recoveries and were completely asymptomatic at 1-month followup. One child was lost to long-term follow-up. In the other child, barium swallow study 10 months after surgery demonstrated a pseudodiverticulum at the site of cyst excision. Thoracoscopic resection of esophageal duplications is safe. Complete excision is possible even if the cyst shares a common muscular wall with the esophagus. Pseudodiverticulum may develop at the site of excision: follow- up is necessary and consideration should be given to closure of the muscular defect at the time of excision. To help avoid esophageal injury and, should it occur, recognize esophageal perforation, we recommend performing the dissection under intraesophageal endoscopic supervision.
