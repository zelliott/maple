We describe a case of brainstem infection by Listeria monocytogenes with right oculomotor palsy and lip drop, facial hypoesthesia, left arm paresthesia, positive blood culture, and sterile liquor in a 63-year-old man. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an isolated mesencephalic lesion. Localization of this kind accounted for 3% of 111 cases reviewed.
