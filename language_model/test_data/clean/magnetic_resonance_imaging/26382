We report a clinical case of vagal chemodectoma with cell atypies, which was presented as slowly growing neck mass without any other symptoms. At the beginning and due to the histologic report of the needle biopsy, which morphologic study based on cellular atypia was misinterpreted as a malignant tumor and with the images obtained by computed tomography (CT) suggesting a malignant neoplasia, we proceeded to approach the case as a metastatic tumor of unknown origin. We made a revision of the epidemiologic factors, and diagnostic and therapeutic management of this type of growths.
