The aim here is to show that texture parameters of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data changes in lymphoma tissue during chemotherapy. Ten patients having non-Hodgkin lymphoma masses in the abdomen were imaged for chemotherapy response evaluation three consecutive times. The analysis was performed with MaZda texture analysis (TA) application. The best discrimination in lymphoma MRI texture was obtained within T2-weighted images between the pre-treatment and the second response evaluation stage. TA proved to be a promising quantitative means of representing lymphoma tissue changes during medication follow-up.
