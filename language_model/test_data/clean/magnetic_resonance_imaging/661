The widespread acceptance of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement as an early detection method for prostate cancer (Pca), coupled with the recent heightened public awareness of Pca as a common disease, has led to an increase in the detection of Pca. It has been established that digital rectal examination (DRE) and PSA are the most useful front-line methods for assessing an individual's risk of Pca. In addition to an elevated PSA above 4 ng/mL and an abnormal DRE, the decision to proceed with TRUS-guided biopsy may also be supported by other factors. Determining the presence of a significant rise in PSA between tests, whether the degree of PSA is concordant with the size of the prostate, and age appropriate PSA may aid in the interpretation of this risk. Grayscale transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) has been established as the first choice imaging technique making it possible to take biopsies, measure the volume and obtain a general overview of the prostate. To improve, however, the TRUS detection rate of Pca, many ultrasonographic technique improvements have been introduced and continuously evaluated. As for prostate biopsy, in the prostate with visible lesions, lesion-guided biopsies only play a role in combination with systematic biopsies, while the systematic prostate biopsy scheme should at the present time include 10 or 12 cores according to prostatic weight. The other imaging techniques actually play a marginal role in Pca detection, but may be useful for staging newly diagnosed Pca or in patient re-staging in case of biochemical failure after radical treatment.
