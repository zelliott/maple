Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a chronic disease of the spine characterized by a significant association with metabolic alterations such as diabetes mellitus. Diabetes decreases the immunocompetence and increases the susceptibility to infections such as spondylitis, spondylodiscitis, and epidural abscess with spinal cord lesions in a high percentage of the cases. Microangiopathic changes of the intrinsic vasculature of the spinal cord are rare and mild. In a retrospective study of 784 acute spinal cord lesions, suspected diabetes could be found in only 13 patients. Neurophysiological and animal experiments as well as pathological studies have provided proof for the presence of diabetic myelopathy. Diabetic neuroarthropathy of the spine is rare, but important in the differential diagnosis of spinal disorders.
