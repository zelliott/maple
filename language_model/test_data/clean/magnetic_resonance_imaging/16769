Subacute haematogenous osteomyelitis of the talus in children is a rare condition. All previously reported cases have been managed by hospital admission with surgical debridement and antibiotics or by intravenous antibiotic therapy followed by oral antibiotics. This case series documents the management of the condition at our institution and reviews the current published literature. We conclude that with appropriate patient selection, primary subacute haematogenous osteomyelitis of the paediatric talus can be managed on an out-patient basis with oral antibiotic therapy.
