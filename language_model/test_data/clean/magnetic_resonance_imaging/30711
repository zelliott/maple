Slipped capital femoral epiphysis in a child with sickle cell disease has not been reported previously. The diagnostic challenges, role of imaging techniques, and the medical treatment of this patient are discussed. The presentation of acute hip or leg pain in a child with sickle cell disease should alert the treating physician to the possibility of a vaso-occlusive crisis as the likely source of the child's pain. The goal of the current case report is to emphasize the need to maintain a high index of suspicion for other potential causes of hip, thigh, or knee pain such as slipped capital femoral epiphysis in an adolescent. Preoperative and postoperative care for a child with sickle cell disease needs to be modified to minimize the risks of vaso-occlusive complications.
