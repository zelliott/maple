To define the reproducibility of strain-encoded (SENC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessment of regional left ventricular myocardial strain and timing of contraction in a 3T MRI system.

The study population consisted of 16 healthy subjects. SENC measurements were performed in three short-axis (SA) slices (apical, mid, and basal) and three long-axis (LA) views (two-, three-, and four-chamber) for assessment of maximal transmural systolic strain and time to peak strain. To assess the interobserver and interstudy reproducibility, analysis of SENC MRI was performed by two independent observers who were blinded to each other's results and four studies were repeated on a different day.

Maximal longitudinal strain was highest at the apex, as was maximal circumferential strain. Peak longitudinal strain occurred earliest at the base, as did peak circumferential strain. Interclass correlation coefficient between observers and repeated studies ranged from 0.92 to 0.98 (P < 0.001 for all).

The present study demonstrates the ability of SENC MRI to define regional left ventricular strain and the time sequence of regional strain. SENC MRI may represent a highly objective method for quantifying regional left ventricular function.
