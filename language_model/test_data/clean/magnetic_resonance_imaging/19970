Neuroblastoma is an undifferentiated malignant tumor of the primitive neuroblasts. Orbital neuroblastoma is typically a metastatic tumor. We describe a two-days-old girl, who presented with a large tumor in her left orbit. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the tumor originated from the retrobulbar area, extending into the upper and lateral orbit. She was operated on the fifth day of life. A histopathologic diagnosis of neuroblastoma was made. Medical evaluation including chest roentgenogram, ultrasonography of the abdomen, whole body computerized tomogram and bone scintigraphy showed no evidence of systemic involvement or metastasis. Neuroblastoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neonatal orbital tumors.
