Deletion (14)(q11.2q13.1) is a rare cytogenetic abnormality associated with severe neurological deficit, microcephaly and psychomotor retardation. We report a case of de novo interstitial deletion of chromosome (14)(q11.2q13.1) in an 8-month-old girl, who presented with marked microcephaly, a nearly closed anterior fontanelle, dysmorphic facies, severe neurological deficits, and delayed developmental milestones. Three-dimensional computed tomography of the brain showed premature closure of the coronal suture and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed frontal atrophy and hypoplastic corpus callosum.
