The aim of our study was to compare the findings of high-resolution sonography of the triangular fibrocartilage with those of MRI and arthroscopy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Thirteen patients with clinically suspected triangular fibrocartilage tears prospectively underwent sonography, followed by MRI, of their wrists. Triangular fibrocartilage tears were classified as predominantly ulnar or predominantly radial. Only the surgeon was aware of the results of both studies, and eight patients subsequently underwent arthroscopy. The findings of the different techniques were compared.

For the presence or absence of a tear, seven (87.5%) of eight sonographic examinations correlated with arthroscopy, and 11 (84.6%) of 13 sonographic examinations correlated with MRI. Sonography missed one small radial tear that was detected at arthroscopy and MRI, but sonography showed an ulnar tear in triangular fibrocartilage that appeared normal on MRI.

High-resolution sonography shows good correlation with MRI and arthroscopy for the evaluation of triangular fibrocartilage tears. Sonography has the potential to be a rapid and cost-effective means of diagnosing tears of the triangular fibrocartilage, particularly those involving the ulnar aspect of the cartilage.
