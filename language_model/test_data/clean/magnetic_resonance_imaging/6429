Acute retinal necrosis syndrome (ARN syndrome) is a rare viral disease with a poor prognosis in most cases. It is characterized by substantial ocular inflammation with progressive retinal necrosis, occlusive vasculitis and sometimes extraocular features.

We report the case of a 62-year-old woman who was referred for a suspicion of a stroke. Ophthalmological examination revealed a profound bilateral visual loss due to extensive retinal necrosis. The patient was immediately treated with antiherpetic drugs. ARN syndrome with meningoencephalitis caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 was confirmed by PCR studies performed on aqueous humor and cerebrospinal fluid. Herpes simplex virus 2 (IgG+ , IgM-) was probably reactivated after intrathecal injection of steroids because of pain associated with narrowing of the lumbar vertebral canal. The patient was treated with intravenous Acyclovir for 3 weeks. After 4 months, both retinas were detached.

ARN syndrome caused by herpes simplex virus 2 most often occurs after reactivation of the latent virus in patients with a neurological medical history or congenital infection. Antiviral treatment must begin early to decrease risks of bilateralization and complications.
