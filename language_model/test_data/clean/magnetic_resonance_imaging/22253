Pregnancies complicated with placenta previa and a history of cesarean section are well known to be at increased risk for placenta accreta. Bladder injury is occasionally encountered in these patients during operation. From January 1992 to December 1995, 25 obstetrical hysterectomy were performed at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Medical Center. Of these 25 patients three had bladder injury. Ultrasonography is a unique way to screen and detect prenatally the abnormal placentation and intraplacental lacunae. Color Doppler ultrasonic scanning further discloses that the lacunae are mainly venous spaces. Elevated mid-trimester maternal serum x-fetoprotein (MSAFP) frequently leads to a suspicion of the abnormal placentation, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can clearly identify the placenta accreta/increta. Uncontrollable bleeding frequently occurs in these patients during cesarean section, warranting emergency hysterectomy. Emergency obstetrical hysterectomy should be decided upon and performed by an experienced obstetrician. Massive hemorrhage and bladder injury are the major complications encountered in such operations. We review the literature and propose a protocol of management. As the incidence of cesarean section continues to rise world-wide, the problem of placenta previa/accreta is likely to become more common. Obstetricians should be ready to face the late sequelae of today's decision for cesarean section.
