We report a case of congenital left temporal lobe arteriovenous malformation (AVM) detected by cranial ultrasound in utero and confirmed immediately after birth by cranial Doppler ultrasound and cranial MRI. The AVM disappeared on follow-up cranial MRI 4 months later. A small left frontal subdural collection was present on these follow-up MR images, which subsequently resolved by the 7 month MRI study. The cause of the spontaneous thrombosis of the AVM is uncertain. The frontal subdural collection may be secondary to volume loss. This case documents the perinatal presence of AVM. The baby was neurologically intact before, during and after the thrombosis of the AVM.
