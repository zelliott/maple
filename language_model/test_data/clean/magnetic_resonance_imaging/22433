Chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a congenital anomaly characterized by cardiovascular, oropharyngeal, immunologic, endocrine, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. We successfully managed a 6-year-old girl with 22q11DS with general anesthesia. Potential problems in anesthetic management of patients with 22q11DS are reviewed.
