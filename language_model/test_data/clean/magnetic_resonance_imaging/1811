To illustrate the MR imaging features of anatomical variants of ligaments, muscles and tendons at the ankle. MATERIAL AND METHODS. The MRI features of the typical anatomy of the ankle is first reviewed in order to better understand the appearance of anatomical variants. The features of those anatomical variants are reported based on data from the literature and from a retrospective study of 63 ankle MRI and/or MR-arthrography performed for chronic instability.

Ankle anatomical variants can be separated into 3 groups For each variant, we report the frequency, the differential diagnosis and the potential clinical consequence that may, at times, require a specific treatment.

Anatomical variants are important to consider because these structures can simulate disease and can sometimes be symptomatic.
