Influenza A is an uncommon but well-recognized cause of viral encephalitis in childhood, occurring most commonly during community influenza outbreaks. The authors report four cases of influenza A encephalitis that occurred during an Australian epidemic in 1997-1998. Choreoathetosis during the acute phase of infection or basal ganglia involvement on neuroimaging was observed in three of the four patients. These findings in pediatric encephalitis are suggestive of influenza A infection and may guide investigation and early diagnosis.
