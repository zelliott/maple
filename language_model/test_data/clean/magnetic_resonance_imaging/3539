The glenohumeral joint enables tremendous range of motion at the expense of stability. Functional stability is maintained by the synchronous coordination of complex static and dynamic structures. Symptomatic glenohumeral instability most often results from injury to the inferior labral-ligamentous complex, the primary passive stabilizer of the shoulder. This article reviews the structures important in glenohumeral stabilization and illustrates their normal appearances and the abnormalities associated with anterior, posterior, and multidirectional instability. These lesions are discussed in the context of therapeutic decision making.
