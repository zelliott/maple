A pulsed Holmium:YAG-laser (lambda = 2,120 nm) was used for the first time clinically in tumour surgery. The primary lesion of a transitional cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx with metastatic disease in the neck (T2N2Mo) was laser resected in a photoablative manner with a minor thermal component without danger of damage to the skull base. Neck dissection was performed by conventional surgery. In comparison to laser types depending primarily on the thermal effects of laser-tissue interaction the coagulative necrosis zone following Holmium:YAG-laser surgery is small and there is no area of carbonisation. Macroscopic wound healing showed no complications and was completed after three weeks. At this time radiation therapy was started. The results of the histological examination and the physical properties of this new infrared laser system are discussed as well as the possibilities of flexible fiber Holmium:YAG endoscopic laser tumour surgery in clinical use.
