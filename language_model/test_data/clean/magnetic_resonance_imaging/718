Although the etiology of the discoid lateral meniscus (DLM) has been the subject of debate, the entity is now believed to result from abnormal development secondary to a deficiency in normal attachments. In children younger than 10 years, snapping knee syndrome is pathognomonic for an unstable DLM. In adolescents, clinical presentation varies and often includes symptoms typically found with meniscal tears. The asymptomatic DLM does not require surgery. Treatment for the symptomatic stable DLM is directed toward arthroscopic saucerization with preservation of enough meniscus to maintain some biomechanical function. Recent reports of meniscal repair for the unstable Wrisberg meniscus have been encouraging. Optimal treatment for DLM requires a high index of suspicion in the appropriate clinical setting and up-to-date knowledge of available therapeutic modalities.
