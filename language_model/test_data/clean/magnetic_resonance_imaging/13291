Neurosarcoidosis is a diagnostic challenge, especially in the absence of systemic involvement, even when cerebral biopsies show noncaseating granulomas. We report a patient with a pineal germinoma associated with a extensive peri- and intra- tumoural granulomatous reaction, who was first diagnosed as possible neurosarcoïdosis. A second patient was initially considered as suffering from Multiple Sclerosis. Brain biopsy showed typical granulomas and gallium scintigraphy revealed other locations of the disease. Unfortunately, he developed a severe, steroid-induced, epidural lipomatosis at the Th3-Th8 levels and died unexpectedly after surgical decompression. Granulomatous inflammation in a tissue obtained by biopsy from a midline lesion should be always considered for the differential diagnosis of germinoma. Corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressant drugs should be used early in neurosarcoïdosis.
