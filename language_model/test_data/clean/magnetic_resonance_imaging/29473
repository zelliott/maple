Tumors of the tongue and the base of mouth are seen rarely in children. The incidence of the ones that are large enough to fill the oral cavity is especially low. If not recognized and treated, tongue tumors may obstruct the upper aero-digestive tract and be fatal. A case of a huge lingual cystic tumor mimicking ranula, and obstructing the upper aero-digestive tract, which was diagnosed antenatal and treated during and after the delivery, is presented together with a review of the literature.
