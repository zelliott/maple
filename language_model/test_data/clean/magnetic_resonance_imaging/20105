We report two cases of acute haematogenous osteomyelitis in the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) in adolescent goalkeepers following trauma of the iliac crest apophysis. Both patients complained of pain over their right ASIS and were pyrexial. They were given antibiotics and were discharged from follow up without complication 64 and 90 days after starting treatment.
