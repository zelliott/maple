Brain abscesses are a rare, severe complication of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). They are almost exclusively due to fungi, Nocardia, or Toxoplasma, and usually occur within months of surgery. Here we report the case of an adolescent who developed a brain abscess due to Klebsiella pneumoniae 11.5 years after OLT. Fever was absent and laboratory parameters were not indicative of infectious disease, and therefore the diagnosis of a central nervous system neoplasm was considered. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy led to a diagnosis of a brain abscess, and to prompt appropriate antibiotic treatment. This case shows that K. pneumoniae may cause a brain abscess long after liver transplantation. The appearance of neurological symptoms should alert clinicians to consider a brain abscess even in the absence of overt clinical/laboratory signs of inflammation, which may be blunted by chronic immunosuppression.
