In order to evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in correlation with different degrees of internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint, we evaluated 117 joints of 59 symptomatic patients and 31 volunteers. Data analysis included morphologic and morphometric characteristics. Sixteen joints (19%) were considered normal, 40 demonstrated anterior displacement with reduction (47%) and 27 anterior displacement without reduction (32%). In three of the volunteers anterior displacement with reduction was noted. Advancing anterior position of the disk was associated with reduced ability to open the mouth, progressive deformity and shortening of the disk, thinning of the bilaminar zone, regressive and proliferative bony changes of the condyle, reduced translatory movement of the disk and condyle, thinning of joint space, cranial and dorsal displacement of the condyle and flattening of the slope of the tuberculum. In addition to alterations in condylar and disk morphology, MRI can demonstrate various additional measurable changes that correlate well with the degree of anterior disk displacement.
