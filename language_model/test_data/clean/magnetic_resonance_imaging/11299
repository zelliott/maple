Seventy-four patients with one to eight proven intraaxial metastatic lesions to the brain received a total gadobenate dimeglumine dose of 0.3 mmol/kg of body weight, administered as three sequential bolus injections of 0.1 mmol/kg, at 10-minute intervals over a 20-minute period. Quantitative and qualitative assessments of efficacy were performed after each injection and a full evaluation of safety was conducted. Cumulative dosing produced significant (P < 0.01) dose-related increases in lesion-to-brain (L/B) ratio and lesion signal intensity (SI) enhancement. Two independent, blinded assessors noted additional lesions, compared to unenhanced images in 31% and 33%, 49% and 42%, and 50% and 48% of patients after each cumulative dose, respectively. Significantly more lesions were noted after the first injection, compared to unenhanced images (P = 0.002 and P < 0.001; assessors 1 and 2, respectively), and after a second injection, compared to the first (P < 0.001 and P = 0.039; assessors 1 and 2, respectively). Neither assessor noted significantly more lesions after the third injection. For patients with just one lesion observed on unenhanced T1- and T2-weighted images, additional lesions were noted by assessors 1 and 2 for 27% and 26%, 48% and 35%, and 42% and 41% of patients, respectively, following each injection. Contemporaneously, diagnostic confidence was increased and lesion conspicuity improved over unenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For patients with one lesion observed after 0.1 mmol/kg of gadobenate dimeglumine, additional lesions were noted for 24% and 17% of patients (assessors 1 and 2, respectively) following a second 0.1 mmol/kg injection. Only assessor 2 noted additional lesions following the third 0.1 mmol/kg injection. The findings of on-site investigators concurred with those of the two off-site assessors. No safety concerns were apparent.
