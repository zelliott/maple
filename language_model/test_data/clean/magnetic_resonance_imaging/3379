Liver imaging is an important clinical area in everyday practice. The clinical meaning of different lesion types in the liver can be quite different. Therefore, the result of imaging studies of the liver can change therapeutic concepts fundamentally. Contrast agents are used in the majority of MR examinations of the liver parenchyma-despite the already good soft-tissue contrast in plain MRI. This can be explained by the advantages in lesion detection and characterization of contrast-enhanced MRI of the liver. Beyond the qualitative evaluation of contrast-enhanced liver MR examinations, quantification of parameters will be the demand of the future. This can be achieved by perfusion MRI, also called dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) of the liver. Its basic principles and different clinical applications will be discussed in this article. Definite cut-off values to determine disease or therapeutic response will help to increase the objectivity and reliability of liver MRI in future. This is especially important in the oncological setting, where modern therapies cannot be assessed based on changes in size only.
