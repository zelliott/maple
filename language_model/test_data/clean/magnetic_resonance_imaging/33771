We documented the merit of endorectal coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detecting intraurethral wall diverticula in women.

We report on 3 women with a long-standing history of urinary frequency, urgency and voiding dysfunction who had been treated unsuccessfully for other etiologies.

MRI of the urethra revealed noncommunicating intraurethral wall diverticula, which were excised.

Urethral MRI should be considered in women with lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to a suspected urethral pathology.
