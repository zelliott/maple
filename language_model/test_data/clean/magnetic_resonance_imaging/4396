The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sequential signal intensity changes in post-traumatic vertebral compression fractures of varying ages. Sixty-six patients with 115 post-traumatic vertebral compression fractures underwent MR imaging. The ages of fractures at the time of MR images ranged from 1 day to 6 years. Sequential follow-up MR imagings were obtained in 4 patients for 2 years after initial MR examination. The fracture sites in all 52 fractures with traumatic events less than 3 months prior were hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images (type I). A type I fracture could be subdivided into 3 patterns depending on its morphologic appearance: diffuse (type Ia); patchy (type Ib); and bandlike (type Ic). In 12 fractures of 3 to 5 months after trauma, six showed focal hypointensity (type II) in all pulse sequences, and six showed isointensity (type IV). Four of 51 fractures with trauma over 5 months showed focal hyperintensity on T1-weighted images and isointensity on T2-weighted images (type III); and the remaining 47 fractures showed isointensity on all sequences (type IV). In conclusion, MR imaging is useful in predicting the age of known traumatic compression fractures, so familiarity with these sequential MR findings would be helpful in distinguishing benign from malignant fractures.
