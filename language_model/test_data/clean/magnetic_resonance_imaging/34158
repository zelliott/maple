The clinical and imaging (magnetic resonance [MR] imaging, radiography, and bone scintigraphy) findings in three adolescent boys with chronic avulsive injury at the deltoid insertion are presented. MR imaging enabled the exclusion of findings suggestive of malignancy and the localization of abnormalities to the deltoid insertion site. Findings included cortical thickening and irregularity of the deltoid tubercle, with or without adjacent soft-tissue edema.
