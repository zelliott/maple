Uveal melanomas are unique among the malignant tumors of the eye investigated by MRI in that both T1 and T2 are relatively shortened due to the paramagnetic effect of melanin. Bearing in mind this property, we conducted a comparative study between MRI and CT in 11 patients with histologically proven choroidal malignant melanoma. The results of this study confirm that MRI is far superior to CT in both differential diagnosis and in determining the extent of the tumor which is crucial if conservative treatment is to be undertaken.
