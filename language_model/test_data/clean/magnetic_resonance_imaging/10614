We report the successful resection of sternal metastasis from endometrial carcinoma, followed by reconstruction of the chest defect, in an 87-year-old woman. We performed subtotal sternectomy and concurrent resection of the ribs and overlying soft tissue. The skeletal defect was then reconstructed with sandwiched Marlex and stainless steel mesh, and soft tissue coverage was accomplished by using a pectoralis major advancement flap. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course with no sign of recurrence during 5 years of follow-up. Thus, reconstruction with Marlex and stainless steel mesh could be an effective technique for preventing paradoxical movement of the thorax and protecting the intrathoracic organs.
