Quantifiable MRI perfusion studies using the contrast agent Gd-DTPA require measurement or estimation of the tissue partition coefficient (lambda) for tracer kinetic modeling. Radiotracer techniques were used to obtain regional lambda measurements from the left ventricles of five dogs. Measurements were analyzed to determine whether spatial heterogeneity was a major component of lambda variability. No systematic variations were identified in terms of radial position, short-axis slice location, or wall position. The high lambda variability seen in this study and in cited data of others may be due in part to tissue heterogeneity in interstitial volume, plasma volume, and perfusate hematocrit.
