The present study used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study bovine eyes using proton magnetic resonance at a 7-tesla field. The MRI images provide detailed structural information on various sections of the ocular tissues. Detailed images of the lens show several well-defined areas of water content. Relative rankings of various structures of the eye are obtained based on T1, T2 and spin density.
