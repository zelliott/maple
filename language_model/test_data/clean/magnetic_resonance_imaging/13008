Hypophyseal triplication is malformation that has not been described previously. We present a child with midline abnormalities who underwent epignathus excision at birth. Brain MR imaging revealed 2 paired lateral pituitary glands and an oval midline gland, each with an independent stalk, connected to a thickened third ventricle floor. Because malformations represent a failure in embryogenesis, this case may provide interesting clues on the normal development of the hypophysis.
