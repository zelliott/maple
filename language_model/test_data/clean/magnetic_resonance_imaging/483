During chemotherapy of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), children sometimes exhibit neurological disturbances. Chemiotherapeutic regimens include methotrexate, administered either intravenously or via intrathecal route. Although multiple drugs are used in addition to methotrexate, the acute neurotoxicity reported in patients is usually attributed to methotrexate. The acute neurotoxicity usually results in stroke-like symptoms such as aphasia, weakness, sensory deficits, ataxia and seizures.

From 2002 until January 2008, 32 children with ALL were diagnosed and treated at the Children's Hospital in Nis. The patients' age ranged from 1.5 to 16 years. They were treated in accordance with the protocol ALL IC-BFM 2002 (ALL Intercontinental Berlin Frankfurt MÃ¼nster 2002). Two of the patients (6.25%) exhibited neurotoxicity. After the occurrence of neurological symptoms, the patients were ophthalmologically and neurologically examined. In addition, the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, computerized tomography and electroencephalography were applied. The paper presents two patients, aged 9 and 15 years respectively, who exhibited acute neurotoxicity--methotrexate encephalopathy during ALL treatment. Both patients had tonic-clonic seizures and neurological symptoms in the course of the induction therapy. Neurotoxicity occurred 7 days after the third, and 3 days after the fourth intrathecal methotrexate therapy. MR images confirmed multi-focal morphological changes of brain density in one of the patients, while the other patient had normal CT reading. Even though the development significantly differed, the changes were reversible in both patients.

The neurotoxicity in patients with ALL can be combined with significant structural changes of the brain, but also morphological changes can be absent. Several questions concerning aetiology and treatment of neurological events are raised.
