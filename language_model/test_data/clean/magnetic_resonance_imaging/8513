The treatment of cervicofacial lymphangiomas has been changing in recent years. OK-432 appears to be a relatively safe and effective treatment option for patients of all ages. An intracystic injection of OK-432 produces a local inflammatory reaction, leading to resolution of the lesion. Cosmetically, the outcome is excellent, leaving no lesions on the skin at the injection site, unlike other sclerosing agents. It may thus be considered as the treatment of choice, especially in cases where surgical treatment is associated with the possibility of serious functional or cosmetic side effects.
