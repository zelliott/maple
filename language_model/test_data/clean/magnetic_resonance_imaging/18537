Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 28 patients with known breast tumors was compared with clinical findings and histopathology, and for 12 of the patients also with mammography. The dynamic measurements performed in 18 patients showed that signal intensity in gradient echo (FFE) images increased rapidly in malignant tumors after contrast injection and reached a plateau level at 1-3 min postcontrast. Fibroadenomas showed slower contrast enhancement continuing throughout the whole examination period of 10 min. The most enhancing parts of the tumors were selected for intensity measurements. The differentiation between malignant and benign tumors in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was in accordance with the histopathological findings in all cases. The tumor diameter as measured by MRI showed very good agreement with the size of the tumor specimens. Comparison of tumor size measurements in mammography and MRI showed that MRI had the most accurate correlation to the measured size of the tumor specimens.
