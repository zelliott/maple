Cardiac hydatid cyst is extremely rare in children. We report a case of a cardiac echinococcal cyst in an 11 year old boy, diagnosed by two-dimensional echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The cyst was located in the posterior wall of the left ventricle and was excised surgically. Echocardiographic and MRI findings are discussed.
