Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess healthy adults while they performed spatial and temporal context memory tasks matched in task structure. After equating task structure between spatial versus temporal context tasks, subjects reported using similar strategies across tasks and we observed no significant differences in accuracy and reaction time performance between tasks. We used three methods of statistical analysis to interrogate similarities and differences in whole-brain activity across retrieval tasks, while focussing on prefrontal cortex (PFC) activations: multivariate partial least squares analysis (PLS), univariate statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and conjunction analysis. The PLS and conjunction analyses indicated that the overall pattern of PFC activity was similar across both temporal and spatial context retrieval tasks; but the SPM results indicated that some of these PFC regions exhibited differences in the degree to which they were engaged between tasks. However, none of these methods identified unique PFC activations specific to mediating spatial and/or temporal context retrieval. These results indicate that, overall, similar patterns of PFC activity were observed during temporal and spatial context memory retrieval once task structure and performance were equated.
