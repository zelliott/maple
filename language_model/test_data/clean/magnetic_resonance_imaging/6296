40 patients with clinically palpable salivary gland masses were included in a prospective study to compare magnetic resonance imaging to computed tomography. MRI has proved superior to CT not only in imaging primary lesions but also in diagnosing local and regional recurrences. In evaluating border structures, signal intensity, T1- and T2-values of space occupying lesions, we can determine the tumour status. Besides, we can define to some extent the internal architecture of the salivary gland or intra-resp. periglandular lymph node masses. Better contrast resolution and more specificity can be obtained by the use of contrast medium gadolinium-DTPA. Even small intraglandular and periglandular masses can be clearly distinguished from the sourrounding structures. At present, magnetic resonance imaging offers the diagnostic potency of both sonography and computed tomography. The advantages of MRI and our present indications in imaging salivary gland masses are discussed.
