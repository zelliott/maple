Histamine affects homeostatic mechanisms, including food and water consumption, by acting on central nervous system (CNS) receptors. Presynaptic histamine H(3) receptors regulate release of histamine and other neurotransmitters, and histamine H(3) receptor antagonists enhance neurotransmitter release. A-331440 [4'-[3-(3(R)-(dimethylamino)-pyrrolidin-1-yl)-propoxy]-biphenyl-4-carbonitrile] is a histamine H(3) receptor antagonist which binds potently and selectively to both human and rat histamine H(3) receptors (K(i)<==25 nM). Mice were stabilized on a high-fat diet (45 kcal % lard) prior to 28-day oral b.i.d. dosing for measurement of obesity-related parameters. A-331440 administered at 0.5 mg/kg had no significant effect on weight, whereas 5 mg/kg decreased weight comparably to dexfenfluramine (10 mg/kg). A-331440 administered at 15 mg/kg reduced weight to a level comparable to mice on the low-fat diet. The two higher doses reduced body fat and the highest dose also normalized an insulin tolerance test. These data show that the histamine H(3) receptor antagonist, A-331440, has potential as an antiobesity agent.
