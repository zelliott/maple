Cast shadows can be salient depth cues in three-dimensional (3D) vision. Using a motion illusion in which a ball is perceived to roll in depth on the bottom or to flow in the front plane depending on the slope of the trajectory of its cast shadow, we investigated cortical mechanisms underlying 3D vision based on cast shadows using fMRI techniques. When modified versions of the original illusion, in which the slope of the shadow trajectory (shadow slope) was changed in 5 steps from the same one as the ball trajectory to the horizontal, were presented to participants, their perceived ball trajectory shifted gradually from rolling on the bottom to floating in the front plane as the change of the shadow slope. This observation suggests that the perception of the ball trajectory in this illusion is strongly affected by the motion of the cast shadow. In the fMRI study, cortical activity during observation of the movies of the illusion was investigated. We found that the bilateral posterior-occipital sulcus (POS) and right ventral precuneus showed activation related to the perception of the ball trajectory induced by the cast shadows in the illusion. Of these areas, it was suggested that the right POS may be involved in the inferring of the ball trajectory by the given spatial relation between the ball and the shadow. Our present results suggest that the posterior portion of the medial parietal cortex may be involved in 3D vision by cast shadows.
