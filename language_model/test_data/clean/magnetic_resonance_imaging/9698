Malignant triton tumour (MTT) is a rare, highly malignant neoplasm, characterized by a mixture of cells with nerve sheath and skeletal muscle differentiation. Cytogenetic analyses of this neoplasm are rare to date and none comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) analysis has been published. In the present study we report about the genomic imbalances of a MMT analysed by CGH, in a 39-year-old male patient without neurofibromatosis. We observed the amplifications at chromosomal location 1p, 6p, 16p, 16q, 17p, 17q, 19p, 19q, 20p, and 22q. Comparing our results with those of previous studies, we found evidence for recurrent genomic aberrations at the chromosomes 1, 16, 17, 19, and 22 suggesting the involvement of several oncogenes in the genesis of MTT.
