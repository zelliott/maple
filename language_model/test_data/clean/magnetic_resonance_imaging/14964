Hysterosalpingography is the gold standard in assessing the patency of the fallopian tubes, which is among the most common causes of female factor infertility, making this technique the most frequent first-choice imaging modality in the assessment of female infertility. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging are typically used for evaluation of indeterminate or complicated cases of female infertility and presurgical planning. Imaging also plays a role in the detection of the secondary causes of ovarian factor infertility, including endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome.
