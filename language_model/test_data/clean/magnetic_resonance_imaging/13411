Ultrasound B-scan, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are currently used in the diagnosis of head and neck tumours. Screening of head and neck tumours should be performed by high resolution B-scan. Its high diagnostic sensitivity, minimal imaging artifacts, real-time recording and its minimal costs are outstanding features. CT is superior in imaging of bony structures; on the other hand, MR is superior in demonstrating site, border and topography of tumours and lymph nodes. Postoperative and/or post-irradiation follow-up of head and neck tumours should be done by sonography which allows differentiation of oedema, scars and tumour recurrence. The parapharyngoscopic sonography, echography, CT and MR can deliver different aspects in planning of neck surgery. An adequate diagnostic schedule is presented.
