A patient who had a high-grade uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS) with extensive intra-abdominal and pulmonary metastases at the time of diagnosis underwent supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and tumor reductive surgery. She then received induction chemotherapy with paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 over 24 h and carboplatin (target AUC = 7.5 mg.ml/min) monthly for seven courses, achieving remission with a small amount of residual disease. The treatment was well tolerated except for peripheral neuropathy. Accordingly, the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel may be considered in patients with advanced high-grade LMS of the uterus, and this regimen warrants further study in this disease.
