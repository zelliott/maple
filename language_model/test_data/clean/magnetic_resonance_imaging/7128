We present a patient with primary pulmonary lymphoma studied by magnetic resonance (MR), whose MR appearance was considered to be suggestive of the disorder. On T1-weighted MR images the tumour was seen as a large mass with homogeneous signal intensity, replacing the entire left lower lobe, while on T2-weighted images it was demonstrated as a homogeneous mass with a surrounding thin layer of greater signal intensity. This discrimination was not possible with computed tomography.
