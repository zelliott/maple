The intracarotid amytal test is commonly used as a predictor of memory dysfunctioning after anterior temporal lobe resection (ATL) for intractable epilepsy. Asymmetry in memory scores can provide focus lateralizing information. In this study the predictive value of a set of Wada test parameters was analyzed, including patients with symmetrical memory scores.

The Wada test was carried out in 226 patients undergoing ATL (94 L, 132 R). Data were collected on item recognition (five items), story recall, amytal dose, presentation time, EEG and arterial filling of amytal. A logistic regression analysis was performed on these data in order to find a set of variables which could best predict the side of seizure onset.

The analysis yielded four variables, i.e. both memory scores, story recall after right-sided injection and presentation time of stimuli after left-sided injection which could correctly predict seizure lateralization in 85% of the cases. Misclassification was lower for right foci than for left foci. Seizure outcome was four times more favourable in the correctly classified patients.

The results suggest that prediction of focus lateralization in temporal lobe epilepsy can be fairly exact even if left/right memory scores are equal. Performing the Wada test with only five memory items keeps the time window of active amytal short enough and gives accurate information about contralateral temporal lobe functioning. The classification scheme can be useful in predicting a lowered chance of seizure freedom.
