We report a patient with solitary thoracic vertebral bone metastasis (Th 8) from uterine leiomyosarcoma. The vertebral metastatic lesion was treated surgically, and vertebral body replacement with ceramic prosthesis and anterior spinal stabilization were performed. Such aggressive surgical intervention for solitary vertebral bone metastasis may contribute to the improvement of prognosis and maintenance of general quality of life in the patient.
