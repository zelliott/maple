Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging augmented with 3-D MR reconstruction provides an excellent display of the soft tissues and surface anatomy of the human body. The excellent anatomical detail of MR images makes this radiographic modality an ideal tool to teach anatomy to all health-care professionals. Previous studies of the lung and liver in swine revealed that the hepatic lymphatics communicated with the visceral pleural lymphatics via the so-called pulmonary ligament, which appears as a sheet of visceral pleura containing lymphatics and small blood vessels in the swine model. A review of the surgical operative reports at the UCLA School of Medicine revealed that the hepatic lymphatics are not connected or even ligated during hepatic resections and transplantations. Therefore, the authors hypothesized that the unattached lymphatics may be a cause of postoperative complications and that interruption of these important lymphatic pathways may specifically result in immediate ascites and right pleural effusions. Cannulation of the hepatic lymphatics is proposed as a method to reduce postoperative complications. The purpose of this research is to demonstrate the visual and radiographic display of the hepatic lymphatics in a swine model and to provide a means to teach anatomical-pathological correlation.
