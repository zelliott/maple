Five patients with superficial anterior cerebral artery territory infarcts in the paracentral area are reported, who developed a hemiparesis which was predominant in the leg, and with homolateral ataxia in the arm. A similar neurological picture was not observed in 1736 patients who were admitted over an eight year period to a primary care stroke centre with their first stroke. Involvement of corticopontine fibres at their origin, together with damage to the lower limb motor strip or underlying white matter, appears to have been the cause of a clinical syndrome (homolateral ataxia and crural paresis) which has been ascribed to lacunar infarction.
