Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare breast malignancy that is associated with poor long-term outcomes despite aggressive surgical and chemotherapeutic interventions. We recently treated a 56-year-old woman with right-sided IBC and biopsy-proven cutaneous metastases to her back and left breast. She underwent chemotherapy, bilateral modified radical mastectomy, and radiation therapy. One year after diagnosis, she is currently disease-free based on positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging and repeat skin biopsies. To provide insight into the management of IBC, we present this interesting case with a reflection on important lessons to be learned.
