Adrenal collision tumors are rare clinical entities referring to separate coexisting adjacent tumors involving an adrenal gland with sharp demarcation between the two and without a substantial histologic admixture at the interface. We report a case of a 60-year-old female patient with an exceedingly rare adrenal hemangioma-adenoma collision tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a collision tumor comprising an adrenal hemangioma and an adenoma.
