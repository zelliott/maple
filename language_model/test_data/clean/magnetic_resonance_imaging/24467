In recordings from anterior piriform cortex in awake behaving mice, we found that neuronal firing early in the olfactory pathway simultaneously conveyed fundamentally different information: odor value (is the odor rewarded?) and identity (what is the smell?). Thus, this sensory system performs early multiplexing of information reflecting stimulus-specific characteristics with that used for decision-making.
