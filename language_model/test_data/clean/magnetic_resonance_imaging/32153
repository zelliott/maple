We report the case of a 32-month-old female patient presenting with cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma with epileptic seizures, psychomotor delay, and severe language delay. Usually, the typical onset of cerebellar tumor is characterized by raised intracranial pressure and cerebellar incoordination. A review of the few cases reported in the literature evidencing epileptic seizures symptomatic of a focal, nondegenerative mass limited to the cerebellum is included. Moreover, a discussion about the cerebellar contribution to nonmotor functions in children is presented, in particular following tumor resection.
