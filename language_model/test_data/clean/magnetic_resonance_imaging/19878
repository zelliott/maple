Portal biliopathy is a newly introduced term, describing the changes observed in the biliary ducts secondary to extrinsic compression by the portal cavernoma. It's a rare condition that is usually not diagnosed.

To explore the principles of diagnosis and treatment of portal biliopathy.

seventeen patients with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction were reviewed prospectively.

symptomatic biliary obstruction was found in 82%. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed abnormality of the bile duct wall in all cases, with stricture in 11 patients. Endoscopic treatment was necessary in 10 patients, whether portosystemic shunting was done only in 2 cases.

Portal biliopathy is frequent and must be diagnosed early.
