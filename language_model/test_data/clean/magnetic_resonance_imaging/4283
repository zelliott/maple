Acute bilateral infarcts in the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellum artery are rare and poorly documented in the literature. Thus, this report describes the clinical course and outcome in 3 patients. Although one was associated with coronary artery bypass surgery, the etiology was not known. Despite large territorial infarcts, the patients recovered to ambulation with minimal assistance.
