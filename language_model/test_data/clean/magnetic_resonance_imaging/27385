For preoperative and intraoperative detection of tumor distribution, numerous multimodal contrast agents, such as magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with several examination indicators, are currently in development. However, complex materials, configuration, and cost are required for multimodal contrast agents, accompanied by a high possibility of toxicity and low popularity in clinics. Nevertheless, the magnetic labeling of MNPs using bioprobes should be feasible not only in preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but also in intraoperative examination based on other magnetic properties. In this study, anti-alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-mediated Fe(3)O(4) MNPs, injected into mice with liver tumors, were used to examine the characteristics of magnetic labeling. Using MRI and scanning superconducting-quantum-interference-device biosusceptometry (SSB), based on alternating current (AC) susceptibility, the magnetic labeling occurred significantly on the first day post-injection of anti-AFP magnetic fluid (MF), and then decreased over time. However, for both MF without antibodies and an anti-carcinoembryonic antigen MF, no magnetic labeling occured on the first day of their respective post-injection. The favorable agreement indicates that magnetic labeling possesses two magnetic characteristics: distortion of the imaging field and AC susceptibility. In addition, the results of the biopsy tests, anti-AFP staining, and Prussian blue staining show the same dynamics as those of magnetic methodologies and prove that bound MNPs on tumor tissue are rotatable by an AC magnetic field to express AC susceptibility. Therefore, with the simple configuration of antibody-mediated MNPs, magnetic labeling is also feasible for intraoperative examinations using SSB with high mobility and sensitivity.
