Intraparenchymal solitary cyst of the medulla oblongata was diagnosed on MRI examination in a 66-year-old woman with a nine year history of progressive brainstem dysfunction and three negative CT scan examinations. Craniotomy and drainage of the cyst to the IVth ventricle led to remarkable clinical recovery. Biopsy of the wall of the cyst revealed an epithelial lining with tonofilaments, desmosomes and surface coating on ultrastructural examination. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated positive reactions of epithelium for keratins, cytokeratins, epithelial membrane antigen and Ulex Europeus lectin, indicating endodermal origin of the cyst.
