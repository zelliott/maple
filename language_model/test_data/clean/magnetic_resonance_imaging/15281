The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of various semiquantitative perfusion parameters of the magnetic resonance perfusion examination of the myocardium compared to conventional coronary angiography.

Twenty patients with suspicion of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary angiography were examined by MR imaging within 14 days before or after coronary angiography. A perfusion examination during adenosine application (140 microg/kg/min) and at rest was performed using a saturation recovery turboFLASH sequence. The semi-quantitative parameters maximum signal intensity (SIM), time-to-peak (TTP), area under the curve (AUC) and upslope (US) were determined using dedicated software (Dynamic Signal Analysis, ARGUS, Siemens Medical Solutions) for the evaluation of the signal-intensity-time curves. In addition, the ratio of these parameters (MPRI: myocardial perfusion reserve index) were determined by dividing the values of the stress examination by the values of the rest examination.

Accuracy was 78.4% (SIM), 64.9% (TTP), 64.2% (AUC) and 70.4% (US) for the evaluation of the stress examination. Accuracy for the MPRI of the semi-quantitative parameters was 72.2% (SIM), 50.9% (TTP), 72.2% (AUC) und 89.1% (US).

A combined semi-quantitative evaluation of the MPRI values using the ratio of the upslope values of the stress and rest examination was shown to be the most accurate method. MPRI (US(Stress)/US(Rest)) is superior to an evaluation of the stress examination alone.
