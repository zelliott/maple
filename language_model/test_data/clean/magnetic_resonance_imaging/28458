Approximately 60 cases of spinal angiolipomas have been described in the medical literature. Extradural tumours predominate. Lesions with a bony component, the infiltrating subgroup, were reported in 10 patients. Intradural angiolipomas were found three times. Several excellent review articles are available, but a systematic comparison of the characteristics of the two major varieties, infiltrating and non-infiltrating spinal extradural angiolipomas, has not so far been made. The authors operated on two patients with spinal angiolipomas and found one of them the infiltrating and the other the non-infiltrating type. Then, they proceeded to a review of all publish cases of infiltrating angiolipomas. With a knowledge of recently reported data on the subject the authors compared essential clinical features of both varieties of tumours. They share identical clinical characteristics. Differences found in age, sex or location were not statistically significant. Mode of onset and signs and symptoms present on admission were essentially similar. As could be anticipated, removal was more often complete in non-infiltrating tumours, but outcome was good or fair in more than 85% of cases in both groups. Involvement of bone by spinal angiolipomas does not imply a worsening in the prognosis.
