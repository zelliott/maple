A 47-year-old female diagnosed as having juvenile parkinsonism at age 38 years developed progressive motor fluctuation while receiving levodopa medication. She underwent right posteroventral pallidotomy which achieved only a transient effect on the wearing-off. An additional procedure on the left pallidum resulted in long-lasting relief of the parkinsonian symptoms.
