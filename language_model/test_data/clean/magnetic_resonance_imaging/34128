Ductus arteriosus Botalli apertus is a congenital cardiovascular malformation usually diagnosed in childhood by echocardiography and/or cardiac catheterization. Reports about magnetic resonance imaging of ductus arteriosus Botalli apertus are rare. We report about three adult female patients and one adult male patient in whom magnetic resonance imaging was able to demonstrate the pathology. In all four patients quantitative data about right ventricular function were calculated. Pulmonary hypertension with Eisenmenger syndrome detected by cardiac catheterization had developed in three of the four patients excluding operative closure of the ductus. The patient in whom pulmonary hypertension had not developed underwent successful operative closure of the ductus. Magnetic resonance imaging is a non-invasive tool that can be used for diagnosis of ductus arteriosus Botalli apertus and it allows to quantify right ventricular function. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used repetitively in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome which may be helpful for better timing of combined heart-lung transplantation as ultimate therapeutic strategy because deterioration of right ventricular function can be monitored.
