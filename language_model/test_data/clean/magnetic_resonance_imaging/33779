Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is still a gold standard in the diagnostic work-up of the pancreaticobiliary system. However, the problem of post-ERCP pancreatitis has not yet been solved. Since the appearance of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), there has been a trend for it to replace ERCP as an imaging tool. At present, MRCP equipment is not available at every institution. In addition, MRCP images are not satisfactorily comparable to those provided by ERCP, although technological advances will fill this gap in the near future. If this is achieved, diagnostic ERCP may be reduced to the specific tasks of obtaining histological and cytological materials, and for functional studies.
