Primary cerebral neuroblastoma occurring within the ventricles has been called intraventricular central neurocytoma. This lesion is usually calcified and tends to have a better prognosis than primary cerebral neuroblastoma occurring in the hemispheres. This entity must be considered when an intraventricular calcified lesion is encountered. We report the CT and MR findings in a case of this unusual neoplasm.
