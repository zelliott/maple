Simultaneous treatment of Salmonella typhimurium-induced symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm with associated spondylitis. Bacterially infected aneurysms associated with local spondylitis, while representing a potentially fatal clinical picture, are an operative challenge for vascular surgeons and orthopaedic surgeons alike. In this context, the concurrent occurrence of an infection with Salmonella typhimurium as a causative agent is a rare observation. The case report gives an outline of the simultaneous vascular and orthopaedic surgical procedure. The subrenal mycotic aneurysm was removed in a first step. The continuity of the aorta was restored centrally through an autogenic aortic graft with caudal anastomosis to a dacron vascular prosthetic tube. Initially, the latter was chosen of excessive length so as to facilitate the orthopaedic surgeon's approach. Upon completion of stabilising surgery of the vertebral column, the dacron tube was reduced in length as necessary and the surgical area was enclosed with an omentum majus plastic mesh. No complications were noted during the 18-month follow-up period.
