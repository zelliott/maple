We describe the MR anatomy of the subcoracoid bursa and findings associated with subcoracoid effusion.

Fluid in the subcoracoid space, revealed on MR imaging of the shoulder, may lie in the subcoracoid bursa or the subscapularis recess (both structures can be distinguished with MR imaging). In our patients, subcoracoid effusions were often associated with anterior rotator cuff tears, including tears of the rotator interval.
