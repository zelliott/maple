The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) in detecting bone marrow involvement in cancer patients.

We studied 50 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed malignant dissemination to the bone marrow, using dMRI of the lumbosacral spine. Time-signal intensity curves were generated from regions of interest (ROIs) obtained from areas of obvious bone marrow disease (group B). In 16 patients from group B with focal disease, ROIs were also placed on areas with apparently normal bone marrow on static magnetic resonance images (group C). Twenty-two patients with no history of malignancy were used as a control group (group A). Wash-in (WIN) and wash-out (WOUT) rates, time to peak (TTPK), time to maximum slope (TMSP) values and WIN/TMSP ratios were calculated for each patient. Mean values for the three groups were compared statistically. Six patients from group B had follow-up dMRI after chemotherapy: four patients achieved a clinical partial response and two had resistant disease.

A significant difference was found between groups A and B for all values. Between groups A and C, in spite of the similar static MRI appearance, all values were significantly different. Between groups B and C, a significant difference was found for WIN, WOUT rates and WIN/TMSP ratio. Follow-up dMRI data analysis correlated well with clinical staging.

dMRI can distinguish normal from malignant bone marrow. It may identify malignant bone marrow infiltration in patients with negative static MRI and serve as both a diagnostic and prognostic tool for patients with bone marrow malignancies.
