Three novel GdDO3A-type bismacrocyclic complexes, conjugated to Ca (2+) chelating moieties like ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid bisamides, were synthesized as potential "smart" magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents. Their sensitivity toward Ca (2+) was studied by relaxometric titrations. A maximum relaxivity increase of 15, 6, and 32% was observed upon Ca (2+) binding for Gd 2L (1), Gd 2L (2), and Gd 2L (3), respectively (L (1) = N, N-bis{1-[{[({1-[1,4,7-tris(carboxymethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-10-yl]eth-2-yl}amino)carbonyl]methyl}-(carboxymethyl)amino]eth-2-yl}aminoacetic acid; L (2) = N, N-bis[1-({[({alpha-[1,4,7-tris(carboxymethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-10-yl]- p-tolylamino}carbonyl)methyl]-(carboxymethyl)}amino)eth-2-yl]aminoacetic acid; L (3) = 1,2-bis[{[({1-[1,4,7-tris(carboxymethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-10-yl]eth-2-yl}amino)carbonyl]methyl}(carboxymethyl)amino]ethane). The apparent association constants are log K A = 3.6 +/- 0.1 for Gd 2L (1) and log K A = 3.4 +/- 0.1 for Gd 2L (3). For the interaction between Mg (2+) and Gd 2L (1), log K A = 2.7 +/- 0.1 has been determined, while no relaxivity change was detected with Gd 2L (3). Luminescence lifetime measurements on the Eu (3+) complexes in the absence of Ca (2+) gave hydration numbers of q = 0.9 (Eu 2L (1)), 0.7 (Eu 2L (2)), and 1.3 (Eu 2L (3)). The parameters influencing proton relaxivity of the Gd (3+) complexes were assessed by a combined nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion (NMRD) and (17)O NMR study. Water exchange is relatively slow on Gd 2L (1) and Gd 2L (2) ( k ex (298) = 0.5 and 0.8 x 10 (6) s (-1)), while it is faster on Gd 2L (3) (k ex (298) = 80 x 10 (6) s (-1)); in any case, it is not sensitive to the presence of Ca (2+). The rotational correlation time, tau R (298), differs for the three complexes and reflects their rigidity. Due to the benzene linker, the Gd 2L (2) complex is remarkably rigid, with a correspondingly high relaxivity despite the low hydration number ( r 1 = 10.2 mM (-1)s (-1) at 60 MHz, 298 K). On the basis of all available experimental data from luminescence, (17)O NMR, and NMRD studies on the Eu (3+) and Gd (3+) complexes of L (1) and L (3) in the absence and in the presence of Ca (2+), we conclude that the relaxivity increase observed upon Ca (2+) addition can be mainly ascribed to the increase in the hydration number, and, to a smaller extent, to the Ca (2+)-induced rigidification of the complex.
