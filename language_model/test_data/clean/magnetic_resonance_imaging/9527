The IL-17 plays a crucial role in the invasion of tumors. However, the effects of IL-17 on the invasion of human pituitary adenomas are still unknown. The current study is designed to investigate the possible involvement of IL-17 in the invasion of adenomas. By collecting invasive and non-invasive pituitary adenomas, the mRNA and protein levels of IL-17, IL-17R and MMP-9 are investigated. The results obtained from IHC showed that the strong positive rate and the total positive rate of IL-17, IL-17R and MMP-9 expression cells in the non-invasive group were 17.1 and 51.43%, 14.3 and 54.3%, 17.1 and 57.1%, respectively. In contrast, the strong positive rate and the total positive rate of the invasive group were significantly higher than that of the non-invasive group, which were 37.5 and 82.5%, 52.5 and 87.5%, 67.5 and 92.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the serum IL-17 level in the invasive pituitary adenomas patients was significantly higher than in the non-invasive groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the mRNA levels of IL-17, IL-17R and MMP-9 were also higher in the invasive group than in the non-invasive group with statistical differences (P < 0.05), and where the expression levels of IL-17 and IL-17R had positive correlation with that of MMP-9 in the invasive group. These results suggested that IL-17 may promote the invasion of pituitary adenomas.
