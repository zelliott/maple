In the present paper the authors examine two cases of Currarino syndrome and review the existing literature on the disease. Both cases presented with chronic constipation. The first concerns a two year old male born with anorectal stenosis and diagnosed with Currarino syndrome when scimitar sacrum and anterior meningocele were finally detected. The second concerns a 25 year old female who suffered from chronic constipation but was not diagnosed until thorough examination revealed ectopic anus with Hirschsprung disease, scimitar sacrum and anterior meningocele. Because these patients were not diagnosed with Currarino syndrome when first seen, the authors reviewed its prevalence, embryogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment. The authors' research supports the significance of prompt diagnosis in effective treatment and reduction of morbidity.
