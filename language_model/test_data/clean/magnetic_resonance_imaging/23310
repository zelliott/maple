Reconstruction of movements from non-invasively recorded brain activity is a key technology for brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). However, electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) inevitably records a mixture of signals originating from many cortical regions, and thus it is not only less effective than invasive methods but also poses more difficulty for incorporating neuroscience knowledge. We combined two sparse Bayesian methods to overcome this difficulty. First, thousands of cortical currents were estimated on the order of millimeters and milliseconds by a hierarchical Bayesian MEG inverse method, and then a sparse regression method automatically selected only relevant cortical currents in accurate reconstruction of movements by a linear weighted sum of their time series. Using the combined methods, we reconstructed two-dimensional trajectories of the index fingertip during pointing movements to various directions by moving the wrist joint. A good generalization (reconstruction) performance was observed for test datasets: mean error between the predicted and actual positions was 15 mm, which was 7% of the path length of the required movement. The reconstruction accuracy of the proposed method was significantly higher than directly using MEG sensor signals. Moreover, spatial distribution and temporal characteristics of weight values revealed that the primary sensorimotor, higher motor, and parietal regions mainly contributed to the reconstruction with expected time courses. These results suggest that the combined sparse Bayesian methods provide effective means to predict movement trajectory from non-invasive brain activity directly related to sensorimotor control.
