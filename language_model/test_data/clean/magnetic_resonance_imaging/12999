Cryptococcus neoformans meningoencephalitis is the most common fungal central nervous system infection, in people affected by the human immunodeficiency virus. It is rare in inmunocompetent children and it is often fatal. It predominates in males at a ratio of 3 to 1. We describe the cases of two school children, one male and one female, with history of contact with pigeons (Columba livea), whose clinical symptoms were fever, headache, photophobia, diplopia, ataxia and meningeal signs, with unilateral involvement of cranial nerve VI. The diagnosis was established by the isolation of Cryptococcus neoformans in culture, staining with India ink and evidence of latex antigen agglutination in the cerebrospinal fluid. The determination of antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus and quantification of CD4, CD8 and T lymphocyte cells, were normal. In the first case, a chest X-ray showed a round mass, circumscribed in the bottom half of the left lung. A brain MRI revealed an image compatible with a nodular cryptococcoma in the parietal region. A pattern of intracranial hypertension was established, with papilledema and bilateral amaurosis, that evolved unsatisfactorily, with the subsequent death of the patient. Both were treated with amphotericin B (1 mg/Kg/day) or fluconazole (6 mg/Kg/day). The second case had a favorable evolution. The Crypotococcus neoformans is not a common fungus in inmunocompetent children. Early detection of the disease and appropriate treatment is essential to achieve a better prognosis ot the disease.
