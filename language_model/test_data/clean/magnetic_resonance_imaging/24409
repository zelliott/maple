Pain in the posterosuperior portion of the calcaneus can be caused by a retrocalcaneal bursitis, enlargement of the superior bursal prominence of the calcaneus, insertional Achilles tendinopathy, stress fracture of the calcaneus, or inflammation of an adventitious bursa between the Achilles tendon and the skin. Hypertrophied tendon impinging on the posterosuperior calcaneal tuberosity can be a cause of retrocalcaneal pain after repair of acute rupture of the Achilles tendon. This can be effectively treated by endoscopic calcaneoplasty.
