Renal lymphangiomatosis is a rare disease characterized by lymphatic vessel proliferation. We present a case of an adult patient with chronic flank pain, hypertension, and a right kidney mass. The magnetic resonance imaging findings were consistent with unilateral renal lymphangiomatosis. Technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintilography revealed decreased ipsilateral renal function. From these findings, the patient underwent right nephrectomy, which resulted in complete remission of his hypertension and pain.
