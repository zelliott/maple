A combination of good clinical selection with reliable quantification of diverse parameters that characterize the dynamics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow from phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging may identify patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).

We have carried out a quantitative analysis of 38 subjects (19 healthy subjects and 19 patients with suspected idiopathic NPH). The images were acquired using a 1.5 T MR unit with a phase-contrast sequence in an oblique-transversal plane perpendicular to the Sylvius aqueduct codified to 20 cm/s and with 27 observations per cardiac cycle by means of retrospective synchronization. The area was defined to half the height of the peak velocity, to maximize accuracy. Parameters quantified were mean flow, maximum systolic and diastolic flow, maximum systolic and diastolic velocity, mean velocity, CSF production and stroke volume.

All the parameters measured showed a significant difference (ANOVA: p<or=0,05) between controls and patient except for the maximum systolic velocity (p=0.17). It was observed in the discriminant analysis that the two groups (controls and patients) were classified correctly in 92.1% with the use of the maximum systolic flow and CSF production.

Semiautomatic quantification of the dynamics of CSF by means of MRI differentiates patients with hyperdynamic state from the control subjects, with significant differences that can be used to classify idiopathic HNP.
