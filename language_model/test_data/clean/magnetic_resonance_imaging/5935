Hydrosalpinx is a common adnexal lesion that may occur either in isolation or as a component of a complex pathologic process (eg, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, fallopian tube tumor, or tubal pregnancy) that leads to distal tubal occlusion. On magnetic resonance (MR) images, hydrosalpinx appears as a fluid-filled C- or S-shaped tubular structure that arises from the upper lateral margin of the uterus. Although hydrosalpinx is most often seen on ultrasonographic images, it also may be delineated on multiplanar MR images. MR imaging also may be useful for determining the cause of a hydrosalpinx or its associated adnexal process by characterizing the nature of the contents of the dilated tube. Tubal fluid with high signal intensity on T1-weighted images is suggestive of hematosalpinx associated with endometriosis and tubal pregnancy. A thickened wall of a dilated fallopian tube that displays variable or heterogeneous signal intensity may be indicative of pyosalpinx as a component of a tubo-ovarian abscess. The presence of an enhancing solid mass within a dilated tube is suggestive of fallopian tube carcinoma, whereas enhancement of the dilated tubal wall surrounding a saclike cystic mass may be indicative of a tubal pregnancy. Understanding the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of conditions associated with hydrosalpinx may aid in the timely diagnosis of complex adnexal masses at MR imaging, enabling avoidance of unnecessary procedures.
