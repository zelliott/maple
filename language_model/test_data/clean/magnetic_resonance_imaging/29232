A 71-year-old woman presented with the symptoms of a posterior cranial fossa mass. CT and MRI revealed a lytic lesion in the occipital bone and a tumour infiltrating the dura mater, venous sinuses and cerebellum. Histopathology demonstrated a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma arising from a primarily intradiploic epidermoid cyst. Despite surgery and radiotherapy, the tumour progressed and the patient died 1 year later.
