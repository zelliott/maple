Angiomyolipomas are benign mesenchymal tumours, mostly of renal origin. Hepatic angiomyolipomas are rare, and radiological and pathological diagnoses may be difficult We report on the first case of hepatic angiomyolipoma recurrence known to us, 6 years after surgical treatment of the initial tumour. Moreover, this hepatic recurrence was associated with renal angiomyolipoma without any stigmata of tuberous sclerosis.
