MRI has revolutionized the diagnostic yield in musculo-skeletal trauma. Studies have documented that MRI can be an accurate, cost-effective means of assessing injuries in the knee, the foot and the ankle, and it may also be cost-effective in other anatomic locations. MRI may have a significant impact on decision-making in relation to these patients and on the follow-up. The patient does not need to be moved for evaluation in all the anatomical planes. Each study can also be post-processed if necessary. MRI may be used in patients with fractures for evaluation of complications. The fracture lines as well as accompanying soft tissue damage are well documented.
