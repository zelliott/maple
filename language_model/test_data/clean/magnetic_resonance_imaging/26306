The authors report a rare case of renal arteriovenous malformation (rAVM) which was diagnosed by arteriography years after onset of intermittent haematuria. The rAVM of the cirsoid type was superselectively catheterized and embolized in toto with n-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate. Diagnostic imaging modalities and the technique of embolization are discussed.
