The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the optic nerve was measured from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging using an intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) sequence. The subjects were seven normal volunteers and eight patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) with a total of four optic nerves with acute neuritis and nine nerves with chronic neuritis. The mean ADC (4.18 +/- 1.13 x 10(-3) mm2/s, n = 9) in the optic nerves with chronic neuritis was significantly higher than that in normal volunteers (1.56 +/- 0.675 x 10(-3) mm2/s, n = 14) and that in the nerves with acute neuritis (0.94 +/- 0.43 x 10(-3) mm2/s n = 4) (P < 0.001). The ADC is useful in assessing MS foci in the optic nerves.
