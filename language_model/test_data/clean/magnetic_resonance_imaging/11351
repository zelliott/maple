Mediastinal lymphoma often presents as a large tumor at the time of diagnosis. Usually chest X-ray filming is the first imaging modality and it is used for routine follow-up during the course of the disease. A new and very fast MRI technique has been developed at our center as an alternative. Results in three patients with mediastinal lymphoma during a pilot study are promising.

After diagnosis the above patients were additionally investigated in a 0.2 T low-field MR-scanner by a modified true FISP sequence (see text) with an acquisition time of 3.6-4.6 sec. Follow-up was performed by both, X-ray filming and MRI. After diagnosis the patients, again, had both X-ray filming and MRI investigation for follow-up: one patient 2, one patient 3, and one patient 5 times. Images were evaluated and compared by two pediatric radiologists.

Total investigation times for radiography and MRI were comparable. The tumor was better visualized by MRI on seven of nine images and gave additional information about the structure and the localization of the tumor as well as concomitant problems such as pericardial effusion.

True FISP MRI may prove to be a good alternative to X-ray filming in the diagnosis and follow-up of mediastinal lymphoma.
