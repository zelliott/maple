Primary hydatid cyst of the skeletal muscle is very rare and accounts for less than 1% of all cases. It is often asymptomatic and can pose diagnostic problems. Accurate diagnosis should be made using ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Proper treatment should be a wide surgical resection of the localized muscle with the aid of antihelmintic chemotherapy pre- and postoperatively. We report a case of primary hydatic cyst located simultaneously in both the biceps brachii and brachialis muscles, treated with wide resection surgery and pre- and postoperative anthelmintic chemotherapy.
