Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by Pseudomonas pseudomallei. It is seldom diagnosed promptly and, if untreated, can lead to an 80-100% mortality rate. Twenty-eight patients with melioidosis were identified over a 6 year period, and their imaging patterns were analysed. Respiratory infections were the commonest form of presentation, frequently shown as diffuse airspace consolidation, and accounted for the highest mortality. Visceral and musculoskeletal infections were associated with chronicity and a high relapse rate. Multifocal splenic abscesses were a common occurrence. Septic arthritis of the knee was frequently seen. The majority of patients had diabetes mellitus and chronic ill-health. An increased awareness of the disease can contribute to its early detection and appropriate treatment.
