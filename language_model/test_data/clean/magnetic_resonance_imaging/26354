We presented a patient with chronic encapsulated intracerebral hematoma. This 49-year-old woman suffered from visual disturbance, and slowly progressive right hemiparesis, sensory disturbance of the right extremities and incongruous right homonymous hemianopia over 2 months. Computed tomography scanning showed high density area and ring enhancement, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed mixed intensity on T1 and T2-weighted images in her left thalamus and internal capsule. Angiographic studies revealed no vascular anomaly or tumor stain. The pathologic pictures indicated well-encapsulated hematoma containing fresh and old hematomas in the left thalamus. Most reported cases of this disease had hematomas in the subcortex and no cases had similar visual disturbance. This report was prepared because this condition is uncommon and may remain unrecognized.
