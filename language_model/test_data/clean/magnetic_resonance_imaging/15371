The objective of this article is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of high-resolution MRI using a microscopy surface coil to stage basal cell carcinomas of the face.

High-resolution MRI using a microscopy surface coil is a promising method to determine the extension of basaliomas of the facial region and to exclude infiltration of bone by the tumor.
