The aim of this paper is to compare diameter of healthy and affected optic nerve determined by ultrasound with brain lesions in acute retrobulbar neuritis in patients with multiple sclerosis. In this prospective study 20 patients with multiple sclerosis and acute retrobulbar neuritis were examined. Optic nerve diameter was measured by ultrasound. Brain lesions were detected by magnetic resonance. Correlation between demyelinating lesions of the brain in multiple sclerosis and optic nerve diameter was tested by Kruskal-Wallis test. Significant difference in diameter between healthy and affected optic nerve in acute retrobulbar neuritis was found. Demyelinating brain changes examined by magnetic resonance revealed periventricular lesions, subcortical lesions and lesions in corpus callosum. There is statistically significant correlation between optic nerve diameter and number of brain lesions in multiple sclerosis, p < 0.05. Diameter of optic nerve in retrobulbar neuritis measured by ultrasound correlates with brain lesions detected by magnetic resonance in multiple sclerosis.
