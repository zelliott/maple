To evaluate the potential role of carotid artery atherosclerosis plaque magnetic resonance (MR) microimaging as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) marker, ex vivo MR images were acquired at optimized parameters on 9.4T Bruker animal imager for occluded tissue resected by carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and corresponding histopathological analysis was made.

For imaging, CEA tissues of size 2-6 cm long and 0.5-1.5 cm wide, were transferred to 15 ml co-polymer laboratory culture tubes containing either 10% formalin in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or in 50% glycerol in PBS. Imaging protocol was set at TE=30 ms, TR=1.5 s, matrix size=265 x 512, NEX=128, slice thickness=1 mm and in-plane resolution=0.1 mm for total sample size 2.5 cm. Soon after imaging done, carotid artery tissues were cut into 5-mm segments and processed for histological section for successive 5-micrometer slices. To compare morphology of 5 mum thin CEA section with that of 1 mm MR slices, registration was obtained between histologic sections and MR slices. Contrast and magnetic resonance relaxation characteristics were analyzed.

Total carotid artery area computed by MR imaging was correlated with areas determined from histologic sections (r(2)=0.989, p=0.0001). For the lumen area, the correlation between MR images and histologic area was (r(2)=0.942, p=0.0001). Relaxation times and T(2) parametric images of different plaque components were determinant for contrast resolution. Scan parameters were optimized for fibrous cap and atheroma. Scan parameters were characteristic for comparison at 1.5T and 9.4T MR imagers.

The observed correlation validated MR microimaging to assess morphological features of carotid artery plaques and contrast resolution highlighted the potential of in vivo MR imaging as non-invasive MRI marker to monitor carotid artery plaque morphometry and plaque composition.
