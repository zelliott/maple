Studies have shown increased prevalence of brain white matter lesions (WML) in patients with late-onset depression. WML are associated with cardio-vascular risk factors, cognitive dysfunction and poor treatment response. Until now, systematic neuropsychiatric assessment with MRI and psychological tests has mainly been used in research, but may also be helpful in clinical work. In 2005, a Neuropsychiatric Unit was established at the Psychiatric Hospital in Aarhus, Denmark to assess all patients with late-onset depression using a standard neuropsychiatric assessment program.
