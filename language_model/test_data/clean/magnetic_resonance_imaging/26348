To demonstrate the clinical, radiographic, intraoperative and histopathologic presentation of a localized neurofibroma of the orbit.

Clinicopathologic case report.

A 25-year-old man was examined for inferior displacement of the right globe. Physical examination and neuro-imaging identified a localized solid tissue mass of the superior orbit. Histopathologic evaluation after complete surgical resection proved the lesion to be a localized neurofibroma.

The patient's history, clinical presentation, and imaging studies were strongly characteristic for this infrequently encountered orbital lesion. Several imaging features, including multilobulation, multiplicity, ring-configured contrast enhancement, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal intensity heterogeneity, when present in combination, may be reasonably diagnostic of this tumor.
