There are several benign and malignant processes in the liver, which are different from the normal and diffuse pathological alterations in smaller or bigger forms of hepatic nodules. Some of them are benign alterations having no clinical significance, but they have some difficulties in the differential diagnosis. The others are to be treated and their size and form must be most precisely written for the diagnosis and for the plan of the treatment important as well. The author discusses the significance of magnetic resonance examination in the differential diagnosis of focal liver lesions.
