To report spontaneous visual improvement in a patient with unilateral optic neuropathy due to pituitary metastasis.

Report of a case.

A 54-year-old woman with a history of breast carcinoma lost vision in her right eye to 20/70 without any other symptoms. Six days later, vision spontaneously improved to 20/30. A pituitary mass compressing the right intracranial optic nerve was found on magnetic resonance imaging and the diagnosis of metastatic breast carcinoma was confirmed by biopsy.

Spontaneous visual improvement can occur in the setting of compressive optic neuropathy by a solid mass.
