MR imaging exhibits excellent soft-tissue contrast and therefore has a greater sensitivity for marrow disease than did previously available modalities. This article reviews the normal morphology and appearance of bone marrow, describes the MR appearance of normal bone marrow, and discusses the MR findings associated with various marrow disorders.
