There are few reports of central pontine myelinolysis after living donor liver transplantation. A 59-year-old male received a right liver graft from his daughter for hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis. Methylprednisolone and tracrolimus were used for immunosuppression. Dysarthria and dysphasia were noted on the second postoperative day. Brain magnetic resonance image taken on the 9th postoperative day revealed a hyperintense area at the center of his pons in T2-weighted images. The symptoms improved spontaneously 1 month after the operation. Central pontine myelinolysis should be included in the differential diagnosis when neurologic manifestations are observed after living donor liver transplantation.
