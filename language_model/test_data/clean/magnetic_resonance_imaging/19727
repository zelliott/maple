Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia. Techniques for the quantitative assessment of neurodegenerative lesions remain to be established in this disease. We attempted to quantify global and region-specific neurodegeneration in DRPLA using analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps.

Diffusion-weighted images (b = 1000 s/mm(2)) by echo-planar sequences were obtained with the use of a 1.5T clinical scanner. Whole-brain histogram and region of interest (ROI) analyses of ADC values as well as conventional MR imaging studies were performed in 6 patients with genetically confirmed DRPLA.

Histograms demonstrated significantly higher mean ADC values in the patients than in age- and sex-matched control subjects (P < .01). ROI analysis revealed that the patients had significantly higher ADC values in the cerebellum and globus pallidus, preferentially affected regions (P < .05), but not in the thalamus, the region relatively spared in this disease. ADC values in the white matter were higher only in patients with adult-onset disease. Histogram analyses could more sensitively identify abnormalities than ROI analyses, because the former avoided errors associated with setting ROIs and thus had smaller P values on statistical analysis than the latter.

Histogram ADC analyses were more sensitive for the detection of neurodegeneration in DRPLA than ROI analyses, whereas ROI analyses revealed regional alterations reflecting the distribution of pathologic changes. Thus, histogram and ROI analyses complement each other and may permit the sensitive, quantitative evaluation of neurodegeneration in DRPLA, especially that involving the globus pallidus showing normal T2 signals.
