Even though diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is mainly based on clinical findings, other examinations are often useful for confirmation and management. The most useful of these examinations is EMG. However, EMG may be inconclusive and MRI may then be helpful. The indications for MRI in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome will be reviewed.

20 patients with a total of 33 clinically suspected cases of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) underwent EMG and MRI evaluation. Clinical and EMG findings identified three groups of patients based on degree of deficit: mild, moderate, and severe. The following structures were evaluated at MRI: median nerve, retinaculum, retrotendinous fat, flexor tendons, thenar space, and muscles and bones of the wrist. Surgery was performed for 19 wrists.

Only retinacular bowing and increased T2W signal intensity within the median nerve were significantly related to the diagnosis of CTS (sensitivity of 70% and 57% respectively). Retinacular bowing indicates increased "pressure" within the compartment (mechanical compression of the nerve) and increased T2W signal of the median nerve indicates nerve suffering. These findings correlated well with more severe cases based on clinical and EMG findings.

In cases where there is discordance between clinical and EMG findings, MRI is helpful to identify patients who would benefit from surgical intervention.
