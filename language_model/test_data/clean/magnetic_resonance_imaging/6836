To evaluate the local tumor control rate and survival data for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-guided laser ablation of breast cancer liver metastases by using laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT).

MR-guided LITT was performed in 232 female patients with 578 liver metastases from breast cancer. Survival rates were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Indications for the procedure were defined for patients with no more than five metastases, none of which were larger than 5 cm in diameter, as follows: recurrent liver metastases after partial liver resection (8.2%), metastases in both liver lobes (45.2%), locally nonresectable tumors (19%), general contraindications for surgery (2.6%), or refusal to undergo surgical resection (25%).

Local recurrence rate at 6-month follow-up after LITT was 2.3% (five of 213) for metastases up to 2 cm in diameter, 4.3% (seven of 162) for metastases 2-3 cm in diameter, 3.2% (two of 63) for metastases 3-4 cm in diameter, and 1.9% (one of 52) for metastases larger than 4 cm in diameter. No additional local tumor progression was observed beyond 6 months. The mean survival rate for all treated patients, with calculation started on the date of diagnosis of the metastases treated with LITT, was 4.9 years (95% confidence interval: 4.3, 5.4). The median survival was 4.3 years; 1-year survival, 96%; 2-year survival, 80%; 3-year survival, 63%; and 5-year survival, 41%. The mean survival after the first LITT treatment was 4.2 years (95% confidence interval: 3.6, 4.8).

MR-guided LITT yields high local tumor control and survival rates in patients with liver metastases from breast cancer.
