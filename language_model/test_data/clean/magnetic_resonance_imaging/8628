Chronic retropharyngeal abscess caused by tuberculosis is rare. It should be suspected in a person who presents with a destructive lesion of the vertebra and a retropharyngeal mass. Early diagnosis and treatment are necessary to prevent the serious complications of the disease. We present the case of a patient who came to our clinic with collapse of the C5-C6 vertebrae and retropharyngeal abscess. We were able to avoid any complications by initiating early surgical drainage and antituberculous therapy.
