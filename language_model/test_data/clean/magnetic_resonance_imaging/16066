The knee is an inherently unstable structure consisting of rounded femoral condyles articulating with a flat tibial plateau. Stability is provided by a complex system of intra-articular and extraarticular ligaments that resist anterior and posterior translation, abnormal tibial rotation, and varus and valgus stress. In this article, the anatomy and biomechanics of the medial and lateral stabilizers, as well as the mechanisms of injury, clinical examination, and radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging appearances of injury of these structures, are discussed.
