Resection represents the best treatment for potentially curable liver tumors; radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an alternative. The curative potential of RFA may be hampered because the extent of burn is difficult to estimate by ultrasound. We postulated that intraoperative MRI (iMRI) would enable a more accurate assessment of ablation completeness.

We performed open hepatic surgery in an operating room equipped with a unique, retractable 1.5-T magnet. Patients were selected because it was anticipated that RFA (with or instead of resection) was likelihood and that iMRI might be helpful in making intraoperative decisions. After baseline MRI, lesions were further assessed by ultrasound at the time of open surgery. Lesions were resected and/or ablated, and further imaging confirmed the margins of the procedure.

Nine patients underwent the procedure: 1 with metastatic carcinoid, 4 with hepatocellular carcinoma, and 4 with colorectal liver metastases. In 4 patients, iMRI had an effect on decision-making. In 5 individuals, there were nonlocal recurrences, and 1 patient who was never disease-free had a local recurrence.

Intraoperative MRI could potentially impact operative decision-making when ablating extensive disease. Its ability to prevent local recurrences must be determined. Moreover, the role of this technology in the overall treatment armamentarium must be defined.
