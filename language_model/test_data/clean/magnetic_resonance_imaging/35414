We undertook a retrospective review of 24 arthroscopic procedures in patients with symptomatic ossicles around the malleoli of the ankle. Most of the patients had a history of injury and localised tenderness in the area coinciding with the radiological findings. Contrast-enhanced three-dimensional fast-spoiled gradient-echo MRI was performed and the results compared with the arthroscopic findings. An enhanced signal surrounding soft tissue corresponding to synovial inflammation and impingement was found in 20 patients (83%). The arthroscopic findings correlated well with those of our MRI technique and the sensitivity was estimated to be 91%. At a mean follow-up of 30.5 months (20 to 86) the mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score improved from 74.5 to 93 points (p < 0.001). Overall, the rate of patient satisfaction was 88%. Our results indicate that symptomatic ossicles of the malleoli respond well to arthroscopic treatment.
