The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of MR-guided percutaneous ethanol ablation of liver tissue on a .2-T open MR scanner. Needles were placed by MR guidance first into an ex vivo sheep liver and then into livers of three anesthetized pigs, and injection of 10 ml of 96% alcohol was performed. T1 fast low-angle shot (FLASH), T2 turbo spin echo (TSE), and T1 spin echo (SE) images were obtained after incremental volumes of injection. In one pig, simultaneous injection of saline into normal liver was also performed with subsequent pathological correlation. Ethanol-infiltrated liver was hypointense to liver on all sequences, whereas saline caused no tissue signal changes on T1 SE and either isointense or hyperintense changes on T2 TSE images. Pathological examination confirmed ethanol-induced acute liver changes as compared with the control. MR guidance of needle placement and monitoring of ethanol effects on liver tissue is feasible. This may have implications for potential MR-guided hepatic tumor ablation.
