This essay illustrates the usefulness of MRI in evaluating perianal fistulas, a common disease, notorious for recurrence if not assessed and treated adequately. MRI exquisitely depicts the perianal anatomy and shows the fistulous tracks and their associated ramifications and abscesses. It thus provides an excellent preoperative understanding of the disease, enabling selection of the most appropriate surgical treatment and therefore minimising all chances of recurrence.
