High retear rates of arthroscopic massive rotator cuff repair have been reported with relatively satisfactory functional outcomes.

To assess the clinical and radiological outcomes of an arthroscopic repair of massive rotator cuff tears using a suture bridge technique. We also aimed to explore the various factors that may affect retears.

Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.

Sixty-six patients included in the study were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of retears on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation at a minimum of 1 year after surgery. We evaluated the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain during motions, the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) score, and the absolute and relative Constant scores (mean follow-up, 25.4 months).

Twenty-eight of the 66 patients (42.4%) in this study had a retear. At the final follow-up visit, pain VAS, UCLA score, and absolute and relative Constant scores in the completely healed group were significantly superior to those in the retear group, with 2, 29.5, 76.0, and 95.2 points and 4, 26.0, 70.6, and 87.3 points, respectively (P < .05). From univariate analysis, the preoperative mean acromiohumeral distance, extent of retraction, and degree of fatty infiltration of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus were significantly different between the completely healed (7.83 mm, 2.97 cm, 1.74, and 0.71, respectively) and the retear group (6.36 mm, 3.97 cm, 2.54, and 2.07, respectively; P < .05). From multivariate logistic regression analysis, the preoperative degree of fatty infiltration of the infraspinatus and extent of retraction were the 2 most important factors associated with retears.

Arthroscopic repair of massive rotator cuff tears using a suture bridge technique has a relatively high retear rate, and these structural failures appear to have a significant difference in clinical outcomes compared with the healed group. Degree of fatty infiltration of the infraspinatus and extent of retraction are the 2 most important factors associated with a retear. Orthopaedic surgeons should predict the possibility of retear before surgery and counsel patients about their expected functional results.
