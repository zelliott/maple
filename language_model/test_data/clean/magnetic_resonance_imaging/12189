Ten cases of syringomyelia confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were presented. The cavities in the spinal cord were of low signal on T1 weighted image (T1WI) and high signal on T2 weighted image (T2WI). The segments of the spinal cord with involved lesion resembled "bamboo joints" or were of "beaded" shape on sagittal section image and of "necklace" shape on cross section image. Size of the lesions in the spinal cord shown by MRI was larger than that judged by clinical symptoms. MRI can clearly show the position, size and shape of the cavities and other abnormal conditions. Results of this study show that MRI is the most useful diagnostic tool for syringomyelia. It should be emphasized that there was no dissociated impairment of pain and temperature and touch sensation in 40% of the patients and chronic spontaneous segmental pain was one of the important clinical characteristics of syringomyelia.
