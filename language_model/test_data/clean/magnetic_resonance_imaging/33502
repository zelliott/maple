The role of MRI in the evaluation of superficial soft tissue lesions in children has not been well established. We present our experience with MRI in the evaluation of nineteen children with a variety of cutaneous and subcutaneous lesions. We find MRI to have a definite role in the evaluation of these lesions particularly when determining extent or depth of involvement would affect medical or surgical management. MRI has a less well defined role in tissue determination. Spin echo T1 and T2 weighted images were sufficient for evaluation in most cases. Fat suppression images added additional information in fatty tumors. The MRI appearance of juvenile hyaline fibromatosis and lipoblastomatosis has not been previously described and is included in this study.
