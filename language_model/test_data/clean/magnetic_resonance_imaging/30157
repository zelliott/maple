Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma is a rare condition of spinal cord compression, and emergent decompressive surgery is strictly indicated. Early recognition, accurate diagnosis, and rapid treatment may result in decreased morbidity and improved outcome. Here, we present a case of a 50-year-old man who sustained sudden onset of severe back pain, followed by progressive weakness and numbness over bilateral lower limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging of thoracic spine demonstrated an epidural mass extending from T6 through T8, causing spinal cord compression. Emergent decompressive surgery was performed, and epidural hematoma was diagnosed postoperatively; the patient had significant improvement of neurologic deficits. The relevant literature is also reviewed.
