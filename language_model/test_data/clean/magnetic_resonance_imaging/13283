The majority of osteoporotic, spinal cord compressive, vertebral fractures occurs at the thoracolumbar junction level. When responsible for neurological impairment, these rare lesions require a decompression procedure. We present the results of a new option to treat these lesions: an open balloon kyphoplasty associated with a short-segment posterior internal fixation.

Twelve patients, aged a mean 72.3 years, were included in this prospective series; all of them presented osteoporotic burst fractures located between T11 and L2 associated with neurological impairment. The surgical procedure first consisted of a laminectomy, for decompression, followed by an open balloon kyphoplasty. A short-segment posterior internal fixation was subsequently put into place when the local kyphosis was considered severe. A CAT scan study evaluated local vertebral body's height restoration using two pre- and postoperative radiological indices.

All of the patients in the series were followed up for a mean 14 months. Local kyphosis improved a mean 10.8 (p<0.001). Vertebral body height was also substantially restored, with a mean gain of 26% according to the anterior height/adjacent height ratio and 28% according to the Beck Index (p<0.001). Two cases of cement leakage were recorded, with no adverse clinical side effect. Complete neurological recovery was observed in 10 patients; two retained a minimal neurological deficit but kept a walking capacity.

The results presented in this study confirm the data reported in the literature in terms of local kyphosis correction and vertebral body height restoration. The combination of this technique with laminectomy plus osteosynthesis allowed us to effectively treat burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction and led to stable results 1 year after surgery. This can be advantageous in a population often carrying multiple co-morbidities. With a single operation, we can achieve neurological decompression and spinal column stability in a minimally invasive way; this avoids more substantial surgery in these fragile patients.
