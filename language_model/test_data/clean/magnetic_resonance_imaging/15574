After a meal the activity of the gut increases markedly as digestion takes place. Associated with this increase in activity is an increase in blood flow, which has been shown to be dependent on factors such as caloric content and constitution of the meal. Much qualitative work has been carried out regarding mechanisms for the presence of food in a section of gut producing increased blood flow to that section, but there are still many aspects of this process that are not fully understood. In this paper we briefly review current knowledge on several relevant areas relating to gut blood flow, focusing on quantitative data where available and highlighting areas where further research is needed. We then present new data on the effect of feeding on flow in the superior mesenteric artery. Finally, we describe a framework for combining this data to produce a single model describing the mechanisms involved in postprandial hyperaemia. For a section of the model, where appropriate data are available, preliminary results are presented.
