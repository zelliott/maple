We describe a patient, AZ, who showed, in addition to an amnesic syndrome which eventually improved, longstanding confabulation and delusional misidentification following bilateral frontal and right temporal post-traumatic lesions. Confabulation appeared in personal recollections and on long-term verbal memory testing. Misidentification concerned mainly his wife and house. During the four year follow-up AZ's confabulation progressively shrinked so as to become restricted to verbal memory tasks. By contrast, misidentification persisted. General semantic memory was unimpaired throughout, while performance on frontal tests was initially poor and partly improved in time. We argue that confabulation and misidentification, though often intermingled and occurring after similar lesion pattern, should be considered as different neuropsychological entities.
