A series of gross brain linear measurements and cross-sectional surface areas were obtained in a sample of 69 postmortem adult human brains. Data indicate that a subset of these measurements are sexually dimorphic and can be used to discriminate between male and female brains. Results further suggest that studies on gender differences in neuromorphometry can be greatly enhanced if they account for sample variance in brain weight. Using 19 of the gross brain measures delineated in this study, it is possible to accurately predict brain weight. It is believed that the measures obtained in this study will facilitate expanded correlative studies of brain morphology and neuropsychological profiles using either postmortem material or in vivo magnetic resonance imaging scans.
