The purpose of this article is to report two cases of pedicular stress fracture of the lumbar spine, which is an uncommon cause of low back and leg pain. The relevant literature is reviewed and features of the cases that differ from those already reported are highlighted. One of our cases of pediculolysis is the first in the literature for that is caused by rotational instability induced by laminectomy. The remodeling of the fractured pedicle was striking when compared with its normal counterpart. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a pediculolysis with T2-weighted imaging findings. In addition, we report the computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings of a healed pediculolysis that has not been reported previously.
