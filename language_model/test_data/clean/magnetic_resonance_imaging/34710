The Guglielmi detachable coil, a platinum microcoil used in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms, was studied in vitro for its MR imaging artifacts, heat production, and ferromagnetism. In addition, imaging artifacts were studied in vivo in eight patients who had undergone therapeutic placement of these coils. These devices displayed a very low level of MR artifact and no ferromagnetism or heat production. We conclude that the Guglielmi detachable coil is compatible with MR imaging in terms of both safety and image quality.
