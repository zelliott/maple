Extremity intramuscular myxoma is an uncommon, deep, benign soft-tissue neoplasm. It is characterized clinically by slow growth and minimal symptoms. Resection achieving wide surgical margins is curative. This article presents the imaging characteristics of five extremity intramuscular myxomas. Images of this benign neoplasm, especially magnetic resonance imaging, are characteristic enough for preoperative recognition. This knowledge can facilitate treatment by avoiding biopsy, permitting primary myectomy, and assisting the pathologist in diagnosing a neoplasm that frequently has overlapping histologic characteristics with other soft-tissue tumors.
