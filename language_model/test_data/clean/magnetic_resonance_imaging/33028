Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) is a rare malformation of cortical development often associated with drug resistant focal onset epilepsy. The link between nodules and neocortex have been demonstrated with depth electrodes investigations showing that seizures may arise from both structures. In the last years fMRI resting-state (fMRI-RS) have received a surge in interest due to its capability to track non-invasively physiological and pathological relevant differences in brain network organization. We performed a cerebro-cerebellar voxel-wise and region-of-interest resting state fMRI (RS-fMRI) functional connectivity analysis in a seizure-free epilepsy patient with a PNH in the right temporal horn. Our finding confirms a spontaneous synchronization between PNH and its surrounding cortex, specifically in the inferior temporal, fusiform and occipital gyrus. We also found a significant connectivity with bilateral cerebellum, more intense and widespread on the PNH cerebellar contralateral lobule. RS-fMRI confirmed its potential as a promising tool for non-invasive mapping of cortical and subcortical brain functional organization.
