Spinal accessory nerve neurinoma is very rare; only 12 cases have been reported in the literature. We describe a 54-year-old woman who had a cisterna magna tumor expanding extracranially to the C1 cervical body. The tumor originated from the spinal root of the right accessory nerve. The radiological features including CT, MRI, and angiography are discussed. There have been reports on cranial MRI studies of spinal accessory neurinoma. MRI suggested an extra-axial tumor. The histological diagnosis was mixed Antoni A and B neurinoma. The neuroradiological findings of 12 cases of neurinoma of the accessory nerve reported in the literature are reviewed.
