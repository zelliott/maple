To review our experience using antero-superior approaches for resection of a heterogeneous group of tumors, both benign and malignant, involving the thoracic inlet and adjacent structures. These included Pancoast type bronchial carcinomas, primary neurogenic tumors, soft-tissue neoplasms, and metastases from a variety of primary sites.

Between October 1993 and January 1998 we undertook 22 operations on 21 patients using a variety of antero-superior approaches. The anterior cervical-transsternal approach was used in 11 operations, the Dartevelle technique was used in five cases, the modification described by Nazari in one patient and that described by Grunenwald in five cases.

21 of the 22 operations were considered to be complete resections with negative margins. There were no intraoperative or postoperative deaths. Major complications occurred in five patients; acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 4), and thrombosis of the arterial graft and acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 1). Chronic morbidity was observed in 12 patients; prolonged arm pain (n = 1), arm edema (n = 2), motor and sensory deficits (n = 2), phrenic nerve paresis (n = 1), disfigurement and instability of the pectoral girdle (n = 4), and disturbances in shoulder girdle function (n = 2).

The anterior cervical-transsternal approach we previously described provides adequate exposure for the resection of neurogenic tumors originating in the brachial plexus and sympathetic chain, and for metastatic nodal disease at the base of the neck or in the superior mediastinum. We have found it to be associated with little morbidity, the postoperative stay has been short, and it has proven flexible enough to cope with the changed circumstances found at surgery. For Pancoast type bronchogenic carcinomas and other malignancies with extensive invasion of major structures at the thoracic inlet, we believe the best present option is the clavicle sparing antero-superior technique described by Grunenwald as a modification of the Dartevelle approach. When operating for lung cancer we presently feel that the antero-superior approach should be combined with a posterolateral thoracotomy, to accomplish complete intraoperative staging and undertake anatomical pulmonary resection under optimal conditions.
