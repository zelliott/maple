A case of Wilms' tumor metastatic to the liver with previously undescribed MR findings is presented. Although there is no evidence that there were hepatic metastases at presentation in this case, small lesions with this appearance would be difficult to detect with MRI. This could lead to incorrect staging of Wilms' tumor examined by MRI alone.
