Cholesterol granulomas (CGs) are tumor-like lesions seldom encountered by neuropathologists. CGs develop in reaction to localized hemorrhage, often occurring in bony sites with possible impaired drainage of blood and blood products. The most common bony location is the petrous apex, although orbital, frontal sinus, and maxillary sinus sites have been reported. We compare and contrast three recent cases seen at our institution that illustrate the spectrum of clinical, radiographic, and pathologic features that can be seen with these mass lesions. One case demonstrated the unique pathological features of Gamma-Gandy body formation, epithelioid histiocytes heavily encrusted with iron pigments, and extensive tophi. The latter most likely represented aggregates of calcium pyrophosphate crystals associated with extensive iron deposition.
