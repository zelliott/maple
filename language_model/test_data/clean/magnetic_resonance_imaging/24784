Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a diagnosis with multiple, mostly unknown origin. Therefore its clinical presentation is highly variable. In case of prenatal detection prognosis and amount of interventions in neonatal intensive care is predictable. The results reported by high volume centres for CDH improved continuously during the last years. In neonates suffering from CDH without prenatal diagnosis severe respiratory distress is the leading clinical sign. Presenting symptom of late-onset CDH can also be gastrointestinal problems. Due to more subtle symptoms late presenting CDH is more difficult to diagnose. Prognosis is good, but it still requires surgical intervention to alleviate the symptoms.
