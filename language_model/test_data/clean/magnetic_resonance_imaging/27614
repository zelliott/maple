Cardiac manifestation is the major cause of morbidity in patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) if left untreated. Endomyocardial biopsy is currently the gold standard for diagnosis, although typical findings using noninvasive methods such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), may suggest the diagnosis. The present case provides an example of the beneficial use of cardiac magnetic resonance for early diagnosis and follow-up of patients with cardiac involvement in hypereosinophilic syndrome.
