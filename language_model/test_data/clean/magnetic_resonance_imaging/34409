The authors describe a simple technique for imaging femoral neck lesions in two orthogonal views. Oblique-coronal imaging was performed in planes parallel to the femoral neck from an axial localizer. Subsequently, oblique-axial imaging was performed perpendicular to the oblique-coronal images. This technique localizes the lesion to either the cortex or the medullary space. Precise location of the femoral neck lesion refines the differential diagnosis and assists the clinicians in therapeutic planning.
