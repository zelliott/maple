Magnetic resonance imaging complements plain radiography and CT for evaluating cancellous bone, cartilage and growth-plate injuries, and intra- and extraarticular supporting soft tissue structures. This review outlines typical applications and imaging consideration for injuries of the pelvis and lower extremity.
