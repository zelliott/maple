Magnetic resonance imaging was used to study the human orofacial complex. Two imaging methods, a fixed head coil and a surface coil, were used. Images from a database of 31 subjects revealed details of many structures including the masseter, temporal, medial and lateral pterygoid muscles, the teeth, articular condyles, and facial bones. A dentigerous cyst and a maxillary sinus "polyp" were also identified. Our study demonstrates the utility of this imaging modality in the identification and localization of soft tissue lesions. The strengths and weaknesses of the technique and its clinical potential are discussed.
