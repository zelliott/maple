There has been a great increase in the detection and earlier diagnosis of a host of renal parenchymal tumors because of the continued improvement in imaging studies. Although this change will tend to improve the cure rate of renal cell carcinoma, it also has uncovered many cases that are problematic in both diagnosis and management. It is hoped that performance of high-quality examinations and the experience gained in dealing with these cases have improved our ability to diagnose and manage these problematic cases successfully.
