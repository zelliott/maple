Cerebral infarctions are unfavorable outcomes of spontaneous intra-cerebral hemorrhage (ICH). To date, there have been no reports on risk factors that are predictive of acute symptomatic cerebral infarctions. With the aim of determining the potential risk factors that are predictive of acute symptomatic cerebral infarctions in patients with spontaneous supratentorial ICH, we have retrospectively evaluated 212 hospitalized patients with spontaneous ICH and compared those who developed a complicated cerebral infarction with those who did not. Cerebral infarctions developed in 8.02% (17/212) of the patient cohort. Neuro-imaging findings between the two patient groups revealed that the presence of intra-ventricular hemorrhage (IVH), hydrocephalus, and the median value of intra-cranial hematoma on admission were significant factors, as well as neurosurgical intervention. However, the multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that only the presence of IVH had an odds ratio of 4.7 (95% confidence interval 0.06-0.75; p = 0.016) in patients with acute symptomatic infarctions. The results indicate that the presence of IVH may imply a danger of cerebrovascular complications when treating spontaneous supratentorial ICH during hospitalization. The frequency of acute symptomatic cerebral infarctions in patients with spontaneous supratentorial ICH is high (8%) and is associated with longer hospitalization and worse outcome.
