MR imaging sections of the hippocampus in different orthogonal planes are illustrated. Matching coronal slices in T2-weighted and gradient echo sequences allow a comparative evaluation of the intricate structure of the hippocampus and its relationship with adjacent structures. Techniques in volumetric assessment of the hippocampus are discussed in light of recent advancement in MR imaging.
