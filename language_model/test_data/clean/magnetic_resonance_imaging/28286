A case of spinal epidural abscess following epidural anesthesia is described. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance images were essential in diagnosis of the abscess without frank pus formation, in defining the extension of the infection, and in assessing the therapeutic effect. The patient was successfully treated non-operatively before neurological symptoms developed and full recovery was achieved.
