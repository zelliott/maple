In this work, computational methods were utilized to optimize the field produced by the transverse electromagnetic (TEM) resonator in the presence of the human head at 8 Tesla. Optimization was achieved through the use of the classical finite difference time domain (FDTD) method and a TEM resonator loaded with an anatomically detailed human head model with a resolution of 2 mm x 2 mm x 2 mm. The head model was developed from 3D MR images. To account for the electromagnetic interactions between the coil and the tissue, the coil and the head were treated as a single system at all the steps of the model including, numerical tuning and excitation. In addition to 2, 3, 4, 6, and 10-port excitations, an antenna array concept was utilized by driving all the possible ports (24) of a 24-strut TEM resonator. The results show that significant improvement in the circularly polarized component of the transverse magnetic field could be obtained when using multiple ports and variable phase and fixed magnitude, or variable phase and variable magnitude excitations.
