We present a rare case of an adult patient without seizures who is found to have a ganglioglioma occurring in the cerebellopontine angle. A 52-year-old woman with ataxia, headaches, and falling episodes underwent neuroimaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a smooth, somewhat lobulated mass in the left cerebellopontine angle. The mass was hypointense on T1-weighted imaging, hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging, and did not enhance after administration of gadolinium. Left retromastoid craniectomy was performed, and the mass was noted to be exophytic from the brain stem. The exophytic component was resected. Light microscopic findings were consistent with ganglioglioma. This was confirmed with immunohistochemical studies. Ganglioglioma is a rare tumor of the central nervous system that typically presents with seizures in children and young adults. Occurrence of this tumor in the cerebellopontine angle is extremely unusual; this rarity is magnified by its occurrence in an adult patient without a history of seizures. Our case illustrates that ganglioglioma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cerebellopontine angle masses at any age. This appears to be especially true when dealing with masses that are non-enhancing on imaging.
