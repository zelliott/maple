Aneurysms involving the infrapopliteal arteries are unusual and in most cases result from trauma. Nontraumatic aneurysms of the infrapopliteal arteries are very rare. We report a case of an aneurysm of a branch of the posterior tibial artery. The clinical manifestations and the findings from magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography led us to make a preoperative diagnosis of schwannoma. Histologic examination of the excised specimen suggested that this lesion was likely a true aneurysm.
