This article reviews recent imaging developments in various diseases of the membranous labyrinth. Membranous labyrinth is the initial receptor for acoustic stimuli. Exciting progress has been made in the imaging evaluation of the normal and diseased labyrinth. Structures of the membranous labyrinth, such as the cochlea, vestibule, semicircular canals, and endolymphatic duct and sac can be visualized on routine MR scans. Using high-resolution MR imaging techniques, researches have been able to visualize the cochlear duct, scala tympani, scala vestibuli, and even the otolithic mass. The sensitivity of gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging is such that labyrinthitis or other labyrinthine pathology, including small intralabyrinthine schwannomas, can be diagnosed on routine MR study.
