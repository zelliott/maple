Recently, there has been increasing interest in the study, characterization, and management of infantile spasms. With technological advances, it is now possible to determine a specific diagnosis on many patients with infantile spasms, thus broadening the spectrum of conditions associated with this electroclinical syndrome. We report a child with infantile spasms who also had a vascular malformation of the vein of Galen. Both clinical and electroencephalographic findings improved rapidly after endovascular treatment of the vascular anomaly, suggesting a possible association.
