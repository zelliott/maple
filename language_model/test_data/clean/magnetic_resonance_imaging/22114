The purpose of this paper is to clarify whether copper accumulation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a cause of high intensity signal pattern on T1-weighted images (T1-WI) by comparing the histologically proven copper accumulation with MR images. Forty-five surgically resected HCCs were analyzed. Distribution patterns of divalent copper by a modified Timm's method on their maximum cut surfaces were compared with signal patterns on corresponding T1-WI. The degree of copper accumulation in tumor compared with surrounding liver tissue was higher in 6 lesions, equal in 17 lesions, and lower in 22 lesions. High intensity pattern on T1-WI were observed in 3 of 6 lesions (50%), 10 of 17 lesions (59%), and 10 of 22 lesions (45%). Distribution patterns of copper were not correlated with intensity patterns on T1-WI. We conclude that the paramagnetic effect of divalent copper accumulation in HCC is insufficient to influence the MRI.
