Primary empty sella is a neuroanatomical condition which is more common in middle aged obese multiparous females with long-standing hypertension. Usually there are no symptoms, but occasionally nonspecific headache may be present. Hormone studies are commonly normal in these patients, although several functional hypothalamic and pituitary abnormalities have been reported. We report a 64-year-old female with primary empty sella in whom Cushing's disease was diagnosed. The association of both disorders is exceptional.
