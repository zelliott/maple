To study changes of serum S100B protein level in preterm infants with brain damage and its role.

Forty-seven preterm infants were classified into 3 groups based on the results of brain ultrasound and MRI: brain white matter damage (WMD; n=13), brain but not white matter damage (non-WMD; n=14) and control (no brain damage; n=20). Blood samples were collected within 24 hrs, 72 hrs and 7 days after birth. S100B protein level was measured using ELISA.

Serum levels of S100B in the WMD and non-WMD groups were significantly higher than in the control group within 24 hours, 72 hours and 7 days after birth (P<0.05). More increased serum S100B levels were observed in the WMD group compared with the non-WMD group (P<0.05).

Serum S100B protein level increases in preterm infants with brain damage within 7 days after birth, suggesting that it may be used as an early sensitive marker for the diagnosis of brain damage, especially WMD.
