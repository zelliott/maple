Diving accidents related to barotrauma constitute a unique subset of ischemic insults to the central nervous system. Victims may demonstrate components of arterial gas embolism, which has a propensity for cerebral involvement, and/or decompression sickness, with primarily spinal cord involvement. Decompression sickness-related radiology literature is very limited. We present our MR findings including FLAIR images in a decompression sickness patient with atypical presentation and review the related literature. We believe MR can be useful in follow-up studies and in early diagnosis of decompression sickness when symptoms do not fit the classic picture or loss of consciousness in surfacing.
