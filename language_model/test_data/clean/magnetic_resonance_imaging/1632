We report a case of a prenatally diagnosed infratentorial subdural hemorrhage. The hematoma located in the posterior cerebral fossa was detected by conventional ultrasound at 24 weeks of gestation. Intrauterine magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis. Autopsy of the fetus revealed a well-circumscribed subdural hematoma. The prenatal findings of intracranial bleeding located in the posterior fossa and the prognosis of such cases are discussed.
