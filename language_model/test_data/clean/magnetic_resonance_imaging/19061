To establish whether surgery can improve the neuropsychological functioning of young adult patients with spina bifida and apparent clinically arrested hydrocephalus showing abnormal intracranial pressure.

Twenty three young adults with spina bifida and assumed arrested hydrocephalus (diagnosed as active or compensated by continuous intracranial pressure monitoring) underwent surgery. All patients received neuropsychological examination before surgery and 6 months later. Neuropsychological assessment included tests of verbal and visual memory, visuospatial functions, speed of mental processing, and frontal lobe functions.

Shunt placement in this subgroup of patients improves neuropsychological functioning, especially in verbal and visual memory and attention and cognitive flexibility.

Young adults with spina bifida and suspected non-functioning shunt or non-shunted ventriculomegaly should be carefully monitored to identify those who could benefit from shunting.
