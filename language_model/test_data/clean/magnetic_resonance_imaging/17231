Asymptomatic non neoplastic cysts of the pineal region are common incidental findings in adults. On the contrary, voluminous and symptomatic cysts of the pineal region are rare and their management are not well defined. We present the case of a 32-year-old woman suffering who suffered from mild intracranial hypertension, gait disturbance and vertigo for one year. The neuroradiological workup showed a voluminous cyst of the pineal region responsible for an obstructive hydrocephalus. An endoscopic etiological treatment was decided. The operation consisted in a marsupialization of the cyst in the third ventricle with a stereotactic guidance system. A frozen section of the cyst wall failed to show tumoral cells. Immediate postoperative course was uneventful. Intracranial hypertension symptoms resolved in 24 hours. Clinical examination and neuropsychological testing were normal at two years postoperatively. The two years follow-up cerebral MRI demonstrated a remnant cystic cavity without mass effect and the patency of the aqueduct of Sylvius. Endoscopic treatment of symptomatic pineal cysts constitutes an interesting therapeutic alternative in the management of this pathology.
