We report a patient with a third nerve palsy and contralateral eyelid retraction from a thalamic-midbrain infarction. Magnetic resonance imaging confirms that this unusual clinical combination, previously termed "the plus-minus lid syndrome," results from a lesion in the region of the nucleus of the posterior commissure with extension to the third nerve fascicle.
