To review the current literature of sterile bone inflammation in childhood and to evaluate the evidence for clinical care including diagnostic methods and treatment.

Chronic noninfectious osteomyelitis includes several different entities marked by sterile bone inflammation associated with histologic evidence of a predominant neutrophil infiltration in the absence of autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells, some of which are associated with a genetic mutation. Whole body MRI is helpful in detecting asymptomatic lesions. Initial treatment with NSAIDs is usually sufficient to control symptoms as the bone heals. However, if the lesions persist and do not respond to first-line treatment, or involve the spine or hip, treatment with bisphosphonate will usually lead to a resolution of symptoms. Rarely, treatment with anti-TNF agents is required.

This review summarizes recent information on diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of disorders involving sterile bone inflammation in childhood. It also addresses the evolving differential diagnosis for autoinflammatory disorders that include sterile bone inflammation and presents a treatment algorithm for management.
