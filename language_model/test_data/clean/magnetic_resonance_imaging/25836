Ten patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and psychosis were assessed using the Present State Examination, and matched retrospectively with respect to age, disability, duration of symptoms, and disease type with 10 MS patients without psychosis. Both groups underwent MRI of the brain. There was a trend for the psychotic group to have a higher total lesion score, particularly around the periventricular areas. This reached statistical significance in the areas around the temporal horn. In all cases, neurological symptoms preceded the onset of psychosis. The psychotic group also had a later age of onset of psychosis than psychotic patients without brain disease. These results point to an aetiological association between the pathological process of MS and psychosis.
