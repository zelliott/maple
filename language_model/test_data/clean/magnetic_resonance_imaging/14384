A case of a rare anomaly of the abdominal aorta was reported. The abdominal aorta was divided into two abnormal vessels and one vessel was celiac artery, and the other was considered to be abdominal aorta. To review literature, this type of anomaly of abdominal aorta is rare. Anatomy of this case had been well demonstrated by MR imaging and angiography. Those findings and the embryological basis of this case were discussed.
