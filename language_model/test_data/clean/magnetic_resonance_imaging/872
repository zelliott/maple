A 75-year-old Asian man presented with two episodes of chorea associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia. His chorea rapidly resolved after restitution of a normal serum glucose level, although an MR image obtained at the time of acute symptoms demonstrated high signal intensity on T1-weighted images, low signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and restricted diffusion, all involving the left putamen. A CT scan obtained 1 month later demonstrated faint hyperattenuation of the involved putamen. The reported pathophysiologic considerations for these imaging features are reviewed, and an original explanation is proposed.
