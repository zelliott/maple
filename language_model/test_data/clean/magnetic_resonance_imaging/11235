A new contrast agent for MRI based on recombinant HDL-like nanoparticles has been prepared. It shows a great potential as a contrast agent for atherosclerotic plaques in a relative short time (24 h post-injection) as it is selective for the plaques and is an endogenous molecule. It also can distinguish between different types of plaques as the enhancement obtained is different, depending on plaque composition.
