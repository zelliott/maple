Authors report a case of abdominal pregnancy diagnosed by MRI at 17 SA with prospective follow-up and planned delivery at 37 SA. The diagnosis is clinically suspected when extra-uterine pregnancy risk factors or history of uterine trauma are present. This is confirmed by MRI, which may be considered as the gold standard. A conservative management may be proposed when the diagnosis is made after 20 weeks and under the following conditions: absence of fetal growth malformation, placental implantation remote from the upper abdomen, good maternal condition, close management in a hospital setting of the patient previously informed of the risks and outcomes. Placental location on the uterus seems to be a major positive factor of outcome for these pregnancies. Materno-fetal follow-up is based on physical examination, repeated ultrasonic investigations with Doppler imaging and daily fetal heart rate monitoring. In the absence of complications, a laparotomy should be planned at 34 weeks. The placenta may not be removed when a serious risk of hemorrhage is feared.
