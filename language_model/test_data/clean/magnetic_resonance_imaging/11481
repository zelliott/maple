We report herein a case (46 years, female) of very early idiopathic portal hypertension. During an examination for in situ uterine cervical cancer, splenomegaly and hypersplenism were incidentally found. CT and MRI showed a nonatrophic liver with dilated portal veins and marked splenomegaly. The portal venous blood flow was increased, while portal venous blood pressure was not high. The spleen (1,220 g) showed hyperplasia of white pulp and congestion. The lobular architecture of the liver was well-preserved, and the subcapsular regions were not atrophic or dropped out. The portal tracts were not fibrotic, and portal veins were neither stenotic nor sclerotic. Instead, lymphoid cell infiltrations were found in about half the portal tracts, and there was subendothelial mononuclear cell infiltration of small portal vein branches. The hepatic lobules showed non-specific reactive change. This case suggests that early hepatic changes recognizable histologically in this disease are lymphoid cell infiltration of the portal tract and of subendothelial regions of portal vein branches, and nonspecific lobular hepatitis. These hepatic changes, as well as marked splenomegaly, may represent an altered immunophenomenon of this disease.
