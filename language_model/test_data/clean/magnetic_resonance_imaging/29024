Cutaneous-evoked tinnitus is a clinical entity that has not been reported previously in the neurootological literature. Herein, a neuroscience framework that encompasses several distinct areas of research is used to conceptualize and help understand this phenomenon. We review normal neuroanatomical and physiological interactions between auditory and somatosensory systems in mammals. Also considered are mechanistic accounts of lesion-induced changes in the CNS following deafferentation/deefferentation of peripheral sensory or motor structures that may have a relationship to this phenomenon, as well as the role of functional imaging modalities in studying various phantom perceptions.
