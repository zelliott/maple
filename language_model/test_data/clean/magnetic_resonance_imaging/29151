Congenital midline spinal hamartomas are relatively rare. Patients harboring this anomaly are generally asymptomatic, but present with an overlying skin anomaly. MR imaging depicts a mass that is isointense with the spinal cord on all sequences, and may show a dermal sinus tract that tethers the cord at the level of the lesion. We report the MR features of congenital midline spinal hamartoma in two children.
