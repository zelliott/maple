We describe an infant who presented with a cervical mass and ear discharge that did not respond to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Tuberculous infection was diagnosed after the onset of respiratory distress. Persistent otorrhoea that does not respond to conventional antibiotics or facial paralysis in a child with a discharging ear should alert the physician to a diagnosis of tuberculosis.
