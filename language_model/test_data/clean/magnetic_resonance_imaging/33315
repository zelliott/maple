We describe the case of a 26-year-old patient with a perivascular epithelioid cell tumour (PEComa) involving the 5th lumbar vertebra. Radiological findings, pathological features and treatment are presented. We conclude that PEComas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of vertebral lesions.
