Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences are finding a new application in the study of human brain function by monitoring localized changes in signal intensity which accompany neuronal activity. These sequences can be sensitized to changes in cerebral blood volume, cerebral blood flow, and blood oxygenation, all of which reflect aspects of neuronal activity in the brain. Many of these experiments benefit from being implemented at a higher magnetic field strength than conventional MRI. An overview of these techniques is presented, and examples of their use are given.
