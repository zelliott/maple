Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) syndrome is a rare form of primary headache disorder, although secondary causes are well known. A growing number of cases have been described since its description in 1978 up to now. We report a new case in a 72 year old woman suffering SUNCT syndrome secondary to two ipsilateral intracranial lesions in the basal portion of the left frontal lobe of the sphenoid wing and the left pontocerebellar angle, suggestive of meningiomas. The patient was successfully treated with carbamazepine. We discuss the differential diagnosis with other very brief headaches associated with cranial autonomic features and the therapeutics possibilities. We review the secondary cases previously reported. The possible pathophysiological mechanism in this case is discussed.
