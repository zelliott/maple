We report a rare case of chronic, neglected rupture of the distal biceps brachii which presented with gradually increasing swelling over the left lower arm. Fine-needle aspiration cytology was reported as indicative of a soft-tissue neoplasm. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were unable to rule out a neoplastic mass. Final histopathology after surgical excision revealed a reparative process.

Such a presentation of ruptured biceps brachii wherein the clinicoradiological features are misleading and suggestive of a soft-tissue tumor is quite unusual.
