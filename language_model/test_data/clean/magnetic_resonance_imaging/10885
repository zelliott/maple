A 20-year-old man presented with early stage osteonecrosis of the trapezium, diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging. A vascularized distal radius bone graft was performed, with good clinical and radiologic results over a 1-year follow-up period. The authors believe that a vascularized distal radius bone graft is an ideal treatment for early stage carpal bone necrosis.
