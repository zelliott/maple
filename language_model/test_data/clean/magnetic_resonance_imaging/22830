To assess the role of CSF oligoclonal bands (OB) in determining the clinical outcome in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) treated with IFN-beta, we carried out a retrospective, multicentre, observational study recruiting 209 RRMS patients from six MS centres from northern, central and southern areas of Italy under treatment with IFN-beta-1a i.m., IFN-beta-1a s.c. and IFN-beta-1b s.c. Twenty-two of 209 patients (10.6%) showed no OB in CSF. The patients without had, at disease onset, significantly higher frequency of visual disturbances (p=0.02) and less sensory involvement (p=0.04) than those with OB. A statistical trend (p=0.056) towards a longer time to reach sustained disability progression during treatment was found in patients without compared to those with OB. Thirty-six of 187 (19%) patients with OB worsened by at least 1 EDSS point compared to none of 22 (0%) OB-negative patients (p=0.017). The delaying of disability progression in OB-negative patients during treatment was significantly dependent only on the number of baseline MRI T2-weighted lesions (p=0.012) that was found to be significantly lower in OB-negative than in OB-positive patients (p=0.04). The absence of OB and low number of baseline T2-weighted lesions in this cohort of MS patients are favourable prognostic factors influencing the clinical response to IFN-beta treatment in RRMS patients.
