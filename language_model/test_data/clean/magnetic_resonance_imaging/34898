We describe a case in which jugular venous bulb oxygen saturation (SjvO2) monitoring proved useful during the surgical resection of an intracranial arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Surgical resection of large intracranial AVMs may be followed by normal perfusion pressure breakthrough with brain swelling, hyperemia, and subsequent problems in achieving hemostasis. SjvO2 monitoring during AVM embolization by interventional radiology has been shown to help in deciding whether embolization is sufficient to avoid such postresection hyperemia, but its use during surgical resection has not been described. In the case discussed, SjvO2 monitoring enabled assessment of the risk of postresection hyperemia preoperatively and permitted the degree and completeness of surgical AVM resection to be followed intraoperatively. During the normal perfusion pressure breakthrough bleeding which followed complete AVM resection, SjvO2 monitoring helped with safe management of the controlled hypotension that finally permitted hemostasis to be achieved.
