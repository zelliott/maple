After resection of an intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor (IPMT), benign tumors or portions of the resected tumor are sometimes left in place to avoid total pancreatectomy. We evaluated the role of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in postoperative follow-up.

Twenty-two patients underwent MRCP 0.5 to 6.5 years after pancreatic resection for IPMT.

Two patients with surgical margin involvement of the main pancreatic duct showed mildly enhanced ductal dilatation due to anastomotic stenosis. In 4 patients with residual IPMT of the branch ducts, postoperative MRCP demonstrated no changes. MRCP revealed new IPMT 1 year after surgery in 1 patient. No patients showed intraductal or intracystic mural nodules postoperatively. In 3 patients with postoperative pancreatitis or recurrent abdominal discomfort, MRCP demonstrated ductal dilatation and poor secretin-stimulated pancreatic secretion into the gastrointestinal tract, which suggested pancreatoenterostomic stenosis.

MRCP is useful for postoperative follow-up of IPMT, in terms of investigating residual or recurrent IPMT and evaluating postpancreatectomy long-term complications.
