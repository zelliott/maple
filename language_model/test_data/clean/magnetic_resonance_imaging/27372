Hodgkin's lymphoma most commonly presents with progressive painless enlargement of peripheral lymph nodes, especially around the cervical region. At the time of diagnosis osseous involvement is uncommon and even in the late stages only 9-35% of cases have any bony involvement. Rarely Hodgkin's lymphoma presents as an osseous lesion without involvement of lymph nodes, therefore the histological diagnosis of osseous Hodgkin's lymphoma can be problematic. Here, the authors present a rare case of primary osseous Hodgkin's lymphoma and a review of the literature.
