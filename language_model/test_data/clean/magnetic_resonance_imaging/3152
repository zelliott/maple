To characterize systolic and diastolic intramural mechanics in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) with a new metric of contractile activity.

Eleven healthy subjects and eight patients with HCM underwent velocity-encoded echo-planar magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (6-8-frame gated breath-hold movies, 3 x 3-mm resolution). A scalar strain rate (SR) parameter was compared with wall thickness and symptoms.

The normal pattern of SR included regional uniformity, a monotonically increasing subepicardial to subendocardial gradient, and minimum transmural shear rate. In HCM, heterogeneity of SRs increased in diastole. Regional diastolic SR correlated with regional wall thickness (r = .785, P = .0001). Interobserver global SR assignment agreed in seven of eight patients. All four patients with New York Heart Association class 1 disease had a low global SR deficit score, whereas three of four patients with class 2 or 3 disease had a high SR deficit score (Spearman r = .775, P = .187).

SR characterization may provide an objective measure of disease course in HCM.
