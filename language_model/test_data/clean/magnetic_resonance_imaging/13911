To show the ability of magnetic resonance hydrometry (MRH) to quantify the pancreatic secretion after secretin stimulation in order to distinguish between physiological excretion and reduced output in chronic pancreatitis.

MRH images were acquired in a 1.0-T-clinical scanner using a body-array coil and a heavily T2-weighted standard single-shot TSE sequence. Thirty-one patients (14 male/17 female) who routinely underwent ERCP for suspected choledocholithiasis (n = 22), recurring abdominal pain (n = 1), icterus (n = 6 and suspected pancreatitis (n = 2) were included. During the investigation 1 CU/kg BW secretin were administered intravenously. Secreted volume of fluid, start of secretion, achievement of a plateau of secretion and a combined score of these parameters (MRH score) were assessed and evaluated. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for these parameters.

27 patients had no pancreatic pathology, and four suffered from chronic pancreatitis. Patients without pancreatic disorders produced a mean pancreatic fluid volume of 183 plus minus 86 mL, whereas patients with chronic pancreatitis secreted 61 +/- 39 mL. Secretion started after a mean time of 95 +/- 94 seconds (no pancreatic impairment) and 62 +/- 13 seconds (chronic pancreatitis). The MRH score achieved a high accuracy in the detection of chronic pancreatitis.

Our study demonstrated the feasibility of measuring pancreatic output by MRH after stimulation with secretin. Moreover, a distinction between normal secretion and patients with chronic pancreatitis is possible.
