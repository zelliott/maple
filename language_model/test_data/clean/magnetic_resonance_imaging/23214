Radiological techniques are now able to provide morphologic, functional, and structural information relative to kidney diseases. Many of these approaches have been proposed experimentally, but validation studies in patients still remain mandatory. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound allows for the measurement of perfusion parameters. Multidetector computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging make it possible to measure the differential function of filtration. Measurement of absolute glomerular filtration rate is still under development. Finally, magnetic resonance imaging is also able to provide information on the level of intrarenal oxygenation by the use of blood oxygenation level-dependent sequences and on cell density and water exchanges by the use of diffusion-sensitive acquisitions.
