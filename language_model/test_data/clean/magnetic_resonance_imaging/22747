An exercise ergometer, for isometric or dynamic contraction of both dorsiflexion and/or plantarflexion exercise, was designed and constructed for a 3.0 T head-only MR scanner. The principal features of this MR-compatible ergometer include electronic devices for quantification of force (during isometric exercise) and angular displacement (during dynamic exercise), without any significant losses to external motions or frictions. The ergometer was also made to be adjustable for subject leg length and was designed for suspension within the bore of the magnet to eliminate transmission of force and vibration to the MR scanner. A description of the design and construction, as well as the important technical features, is presented herein.
