A 53-year-old man showed central auditory disturbance with recurrent cerebral hemorrhage. At his acute stage he had deafness and auditory anosognosia. Two or three months later, there was no deafness and auditory anosognosia, but he could not comprehend words, environmental sounds and music. Auditory brainstem responses showed no peripheral or brainstem damage, and the lesion of bilateral auditory radiation was detected by MRI. His auditory agnosia did not improve over one and a half year. There is no report like such permanent auditory agnosia with the lesion of bilateral subcortical temporal lobe.
