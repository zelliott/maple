An extensive body of literature demonstrates a strong correlation between intervertebral disk (IVD) hydration status (HS) and functional spinal integrity. However, to date, in vivo IVD HS assessment has relied largely on subjective and nonrepeatable measures. The aim of this study was to establish the consistency of signal homogeneity of a novel semisolid-state manganese chloride (MnCl2)-based phantom for HS correlation using conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.

Sixteen MnCl2 phantoms, of increasing relative molar concentration (range 0.01 to 2.9 mM), underwent axial MR imaging. Phantom signal-to-noise ratio measures were recorded for each concentration on several sequence types. Coefficient of variance data were calculated to determine the degree of MR signal variation at each concentration.

Analysis of variance testing suggested no significant difference in coefficient of variance data derived from phantom signal intensities using either T1- (P = .13) or T2-weighted sequence types (P = .96), suggesting a high degree of relative signal homogeneity.

The findings of this study suggest that a MnCl2 phantom combined with a nonfield reactive, semirigid, gelatin suspension media can produce a predictable, concentration-related, homogeneous MR signal response. This may be an appropriate base material for a noninvasive model to allow accurate quantification of the hydration status of the in vivo human IVD.
