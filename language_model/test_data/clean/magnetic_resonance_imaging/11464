Polymer gels whose NMR and optical properties change when irradiated offer unique advantages for measuring radiation dose distributions. To date, all acrylic polymer gel dosimeters must be manufactured, stored and irradiated in hypoxic conditions which severely limits their use and stability. A new formulation of acrylic dosimeter gel has been developed that responds well in normal atmosphere and which we have named MAGIC (Methacrylic and Ascorbic acid in Gelatin Initiated by Copper). To produce dosimeter gels, an aqueous solution of gelatin, open to the atmosphere, is mixed with methacrylic acid, copper(II) ions, ascorbic acid and hydroquinone. It is believed that the copper(II) and ascorbic acid form a complex with oxygen which (with radiolysis of water) serves as a free radical source for the initiation of the polymerization of methacrylic acid. At room air the water proton spin relaxation rate R2 in MAGIC gels is proportional to absorbed dose though the precise relationship depends on the composition of the gel and the initiating complex. For example, in the range 0-30 Gy the slope of the response of R2 versus dose at 20 MHz was 0.300, 0.519 and 0.681 s(-1) Gy(-1), respectively, when the concentration of MAA was 3, 6 and 9%. The slopes increased to 0.310, 0.567 and 0.868 s(-1) Gy(-1) at 85 MHz. An important determinant of the sensitivity to detect small dose changes is shown to be the slope-to-intercept ratio of the dose-response curve. These varied from 0.08 to 0.17, comparable to hypoxic gels described earlier. MAGIC gels can be manufactured and used much more easily than the previous formulations and can be imaged by magnetic resonance imaging or optical scanning, and thus they will likely be of considerable interest to radiation physicists.
