We retrospectively identified 9 consecutive children, 3 males and 6 females (age 5.2 Â± 6.3 years, range 1 day to 18 years), with known or suspected AVGs who underwent MR imaging, including SWI, at our institution between January 2007 and March 2011. On the SWI sequence, arterialized blood flow was considered to be present in the vein of Galen or its tributaries when these showed abnormal signal hyperintensity from arteriovenous shunting. SWI findings were correlated with findings from DSA studies or findings from time-of-flight or contrast-enhanced MR angiography sequences. SWI was found to accurately differentiate between high-flow and low-flow AVGs and was also useful in characterizing the arterial supply and venous drainage patterns associated with high-flow AVGs.
