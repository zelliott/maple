The aim was to identify the radiological features of retrorectal tumours that influence management and to highlight technical points that facilitate safe surgical excision.

A consecutive series of patients was identified from a prospective database. All cases were discussed within a multidisciplinary team. Medical records, radiology and pathology reports were also checked retrospectively.

Fifty-six patients [37 women; median age 51 (20-88) years] underwent excision of retrorectal tumours between 2002 and 2010 under the care of one surgeon. Seventeen (37.5%) had a malignant tumour. The commonest symptom was pain or discomfort. Features identified after MRI that suggested malignancy included heterogenous signal intensity (15/17 malignant lesions vs 5/39 benign lesions), an irregular infiltrative margin (14/17 malignant lesions vs 4/39 benign lesions) and enhancement (14/17 malignant lesions vs 2/39 benign lesions) (all P < 0.05). An abdominal approach was used in 27 (48%) patients, a perineal/trans-sacral approach in 20 (36%) and a composite abdomino-sacral approach in nine (16%). The perineal approach was used if the tumours were below the middle of S3 without sacral, pelvic side-wall or visceral involvement. The three most common types of tumour were schwannoma (n = 11), tail gut cyst (n = 13) and chordoma (n = 9). Over a median follow-up period of 46 (6-90) months there were two local recurrences among the malignant tumours (both resected) and two deaths (both sarcomas).

MR imaging, avoidance of routine preoperative biopsy and careful clinical evaluation result in a good outcome after surgical excision of retrorectal tumours.
