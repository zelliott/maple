Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is very useful in the evaluation of ocular and orbital disease. Heavy metal particles, used in the pigment base of mascara and eyelining tattoos, have a paramagnetic effect that causes alteration of the local magnetic field in adjacent tissues. These changes in normal signal result in distortion of the globes. In some cases, the distortion may mimic actual ocular disease such as a ciliary body melanoma or cyst.
