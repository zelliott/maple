To review studies on the assessment of correlations between magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) histogram analysis and measures of clinical and neuropsychological function.

Since its recent introduction, MTR histogram analysis has attracted attention in the field of multiple sclerosis (MS).

In this paper, studies are discussed that deal with MTR histogram analysis. The principles of MTR, application of MTR methodology as regional and volumetric MTR analysis, clinical and neuropsychological correlates, and potential use of MTR histogram analysis as an estimate of cerebral lesion load in MS are discussed respectively.

In several preliminary studies, it has been shown that in MS patients, measures derived from MTR histograms correlate with measures of clinical and particularly neuropsychological function.

MTR histogram analysis is a promising method to estimate cerebral lesion load in MS patients. Before it can be routinely used as an outcome measure in clinical trials, a number of questions about this technique have to be addressed.
