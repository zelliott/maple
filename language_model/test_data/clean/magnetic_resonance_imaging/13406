Computed tomography is an established modality for the evaluation of the pericardium. It is used to evaluate complicated pericardial effusions, pericardial thickening, calcific pericarditis, pericardial cysts, postoperative changes and primary and metastatic neoplasms of the pericardium. Magnetic resonance imaging is being used with increasing frequency in the evaluation of pericardial disease. It offers advantages over computed tomography, including a potential for tissue characterization, absence of ionizing radiation or need for intravenous contrast medium, and the ability to scan in any plane. Disadvantages include greater cost, longer examination times and the inability to identify calcification positively.
