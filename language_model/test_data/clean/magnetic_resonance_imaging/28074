In view of the variety of 3D representation techniques, a clinical study was carried out in order to evaluate their respective usefulness. It appears that a single technique cannot be claimed to be valid for all clinical situations and that a combination of representations brings more relevant information. Among the different techniques a clear delineation must be established between those which allow the accurate definition of landmarks (multiplanar reformation, surface representation), and those which do not (integral shading, reconstructed radiology). The main point is the possibility to recognize anatomical landmarks on these latter modes and to choose oblique cut planes in relation to them. Visualization quality is strongly dependent upon the acquisition protocol which must provide a spatial resolution as isotropic as possible.
