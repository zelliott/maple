Twenty-six patients with glomus jugulare (16), glomus tympanicum (three), or carotid glomus (seven) tumors were examined with contrast-enhanced CT scans and MR scans without and with Gd-DTPA. MR and CT scans had similar sensitivities, but the enhanced MR scans were diagnostically more specific than either CT or nonenhanced MR. Dynamic MR scanning permitted measurement of the degree of Gd-DTPA enhancement over time. We recommend contrast-enhanced MR with short sequences and a dynamic approach in patients with suspected carotid, tympanic, and jugular paragangliomas.
