Gout is a group of diseases characterized by arthritis and results from a disturbance of urate metabolism with the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints and soft tissues. Often, but not invariably, the serum urate levels are elevated as a result of overproduction or underexcretion of uric acid. Clinical manifestations include acute and chronic arthritis, tophaceous deposits, interstitial renal disease, and uric acid nephrolithiasis. The diagnosis is based on the identification of uric acid crystals in joints, tissues, or body fluids. Acute episodes are treated with colchicine, NSAIDs, or steroids. Long-term management includes treatment with uricosuric agents or xanthine oxidase inhibitors.
