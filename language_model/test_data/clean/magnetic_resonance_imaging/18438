Normal bone marrow MRI has a distinct pattern with STIR pulse sequence MRI. The central low signal intensity area corresponds to fatty marrow. The red marrow is distributed in the peripheral portion of the vertebrae and shows a high signal intensity. Prostatic cancer metastases to the bone marrow revealed a high signal intensity with STIR. Prior to the appearance of an abnormal scintigram and radiograph, MRI was able to depict an abnormality.
