Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has been playing an evolving role in evaluating noninflammatory small-bowel conditions, such as tumors and malabsorption syndrome. MR imaging has shown to be superior to other diagnostic methods in identifying tumors of the small bowel. MR enterography and MR enteroclysis are both valid for studying noninflammatory conditions of the small intestine, although MR enteroclysis may be considered the modality of choice because of its accuracy in the diagnosis of small-bowel neoplasms. Intraluminal and extraluminal MR findings, combined with contrast-agent enhancement and functional information, help to make an accurate diagnosis and consequently to characterize small-bowel diseases.
