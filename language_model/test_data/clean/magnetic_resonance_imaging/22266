Cryosurgery is used in orthopaedic oncology as adjuvant treatment after intralesional excision of bone tumors to induce cell death at and beyond the surgical margin. Monitoring freeze/thaw cycles during cryosurgery is beneficial in controlling a cryosurgical procedure and in preventing an unwarranted local extent of the freeze.

We conducted a study of 15 cryosurgical procedures with the use of a protocolized temperature measuring system wit peroperative graphic visualization.

Using a liquid nitrogen spray, intralesional temperatures of -150 degrees C were achieved, which are, according to the literature, associated with cell death. Extralesional temperature measurements showed no sub-zero temperatures of surrounding important tissues.

Temperature recordings in and outside the lesion during cryosurgery in orthopaedic oncology are of importance to monitor the freeze/thaw cycles and are helpful in facilitating an effective cryosurgical procedure and in controlling the extent of the freeze, avoiding local complications.
