A case of periodic sweating with multifocal dystonia is reported in a 60-year-old woman. At the age of 48 years, she presented with involuntary twisting of the lower face on the right. Six months later she noticed similar movements in the head and right arm. Four years later she began having attacks of generalized sweating over the whole face, anterior region of the trunk and both arms. The attacks occurred hourly each and every day. They lasted for about 10 min and were followed by voluntary urinary voiding. The biochemical and laboratory investigations showed no abnormalities except for the luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone values that were below normal. The computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed a suprasellar cyst. Clonazepam was introduced with partial improvement of the dystonic movements but not of the sweating attacks. The patient refused surgery. Acetazolamide was added and reduced the sweating attacks. We speculate that the periodic sweating may be related to cerebrospinal fluid production and cyst enlargement, hence the ability of acetazolamide, which reduces cerebrospinal fluid production, to reduce attacks.
