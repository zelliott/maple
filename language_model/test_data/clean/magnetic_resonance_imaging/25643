The authors report a case of brucella osteomyelitis of the upper end of the humerus in a 77-year-old patient, presenting as a large swelling of the soft tissues of the shoulder, present for a year. The diagnosis was made by isolation of the organism and specific serology. The authors stress the value of magnetic resonance imaging, which provided confirmation of the diagnosis of osteomyelitis as well as an accurate topographic assessment.
