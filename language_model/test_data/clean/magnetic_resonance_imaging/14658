Radiotherapy forms part of most therapeutic, preventive, and conditioning regimens in pediatric oncology. Numerous late secondary effects of cranial radiation are well known. However, radiation-induced cavernous angiomas (RICA) have been reported only sporadically and even fewer cases of earlier presentation of RICA have been reported. In this brief report, we describe a RICA that appeared in a boy treated for a CNS tumor (an infratentorial anaplastic ependymoma) after a short latency period between the end of radiotherapy and the development of the RICA. We comment on the different variables proposed to explain the formation of these lesions, as well as on their imaging features, treatment, prognosis, and follow-up.
