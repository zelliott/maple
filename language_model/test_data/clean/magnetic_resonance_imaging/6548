Tuberculosis (TB) can affect any organ in the body. Children are a high-risk group for contracting the disease and pose a constant challenge to clinicians with regard to making a definitive diagnosis. Radiologists are playing a more active role in diagnosing TB, and armed with more accurate diagnostic investigations such as CT and MRI, they must face the cost implications as well as technical limitations. This review aims to guide the reader through the modern imaging techniques useful for diagnosing TB of the thorax, central nervous system and abdomen in children. The more specific features of each modality in the particular anatomical regions are highlighted.
