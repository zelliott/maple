To observe the distribution difference of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals in osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) patients of different TCM syndrome types.

Recruited 29 ONFH patients were assigned to the tendon and vessel stagnation group (14 cases) and the Gan-Shen deficiency group (15 cases) according to TCM syndrome typing. The distribution difference of their MRI signals of MRIT1WI, T2WI + fs, T1 and T2 combined signal were compared.

There was statistical difference in T1W1 signal distribution between the two TCM syndrome types (P = 0.04). There was no statistical difference in T2WI + fs or T1 and T2 combined signal between the two TCM syndrome types (P = 0.42, P = 0.15). MRI signals in the tendon and vessel stagnation group were mainly manifested as fat-like signals,while they were mainly manifested as mixed signals in the Gan-Shen deficiency group.

Distribution difference of MRI signals exists between ONFH patients of different TCM syndrome types.
