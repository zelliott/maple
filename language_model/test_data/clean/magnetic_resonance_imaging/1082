Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was tested for evaluation of the soft tissue structures of the equine digit in 16 limbs, derived from three adult warmblood horses and two newborn warmblood foals. The following measuring sequences were used in sagittal, transversal and coronal planes: spin echo, gradient echo, inversion recovery. The images were made with a 1.5 Tesla Siemens scanner in a CP-Helmholtz circular coil. To compare the visualization of the same tissue structures in adult and in newborn cases the limbs were imaged with the routinely used MRI sequences that are used for mature tissues. In newborn foals the bursa podotrochlearis could not be determined with the used sequences. For both the adult and newborn limbs the most visualization of the same tissue structures including the fluid spaces and growth plates were taken by the inversion recovery sequence. T2 sequence was very informative in adult cases but moderately in newborn foals.
