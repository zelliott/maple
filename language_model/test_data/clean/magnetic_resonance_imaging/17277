Legionnaires' disease is an atypical pneumonia with protean multisystem manifestations. Neurological involvement in legionellosis is rare and tends to be among the presenting manifestations. We report a previously healthy young lady who developed focal sensory deficits and cerebellar dysfunction after clinical recovery from Legionella pneumonia. The care is unusual for the delayed appearance of striking focal sensory abnormalities and cerebellar dysfunction.
