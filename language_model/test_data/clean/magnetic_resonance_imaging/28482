Multiple sclerosis (MS) can only be diagnosed with a certain probability. There are neither any specific moments in the medical history of the patient, nor clinical or paraclinical tests as well as their combinations that would prove the diagnosis. In the daily routine the most common criteria we use are of Schumacher, Poser and Bartel. Until the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) had been introduced into the clinical practice, imaging methods were used to exclude other treatable lesions (e.g. tumors, arteriovenous malformations etc.), even though computerized tomography (CT) successfully demonstrated some of the plaques. In the MS CT is both insufficiently sensitive as well as specific. On the contrary MRI is in the MS highly sensitive, 92-98% specificity has been achieved among clinical definite cases. MR is nowadays a method of choice for not only the diagnosis but also for the further follow up of our MS patients. Multiple focal hyperintense lesions on T2 weighted images (T2WI) or the flow attenuated inversion recovery imaging mode (FLAIR) are the typical pathological findings.
