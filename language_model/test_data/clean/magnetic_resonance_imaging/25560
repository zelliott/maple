Three-dimensional (3D) neuroimages are generally considered useful for neurosurgical practice. Nevertheless, neuroimaging modalities such as 3D digital subtraction angiography and 3D computerized tomography angiography are still insufficient because the resulting images fail to delineate neural structures. Complex neurosurgical procedures are mostly performed in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space of the basal cistern, where vessels and neural structures are present along with the lesion. The magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-derived 3D constructive interference in steady-state (CISS) imaging displays the margin between the CSF and neural structures, vessels, and dura mater in detail, in a two-dimensional fashion. The authors know that volume-rendered 3D CISS images would be more useful for surgery than conventional ones. Although the usefulness of "virtual MR image endoscopy" was reported previously, the endoscopic view is different from the operative field because of the perspective being emphasized. Therefore, to simulate surgical views, the authors made 3D neuroimages from a 3D CISS MR sequence by using an advanced computer workstation. After generating volume images, a cutting method was used in the desired plane to visualize the lesion with reference to a multiplanar reformatted image. The authors call these "real" 3D CISS images, and they are more comparable to the operative field. This newly developed method of producing a real 3D CISS image was used in 30 cases and contributed to the understanding of the relationship between a lesion and surrounding structures before attempting neurosurgical procedures, with minimal invasiveness to the patient.
