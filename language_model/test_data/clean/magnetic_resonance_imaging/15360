Arterial bleeding, initially negative on MRI, ultrasonography and radiographic angiography, complicated the course of pregnancy with severe and recurrent vaginal and pelvic haemorrhage in the second trimester. Bleeding from the left uterine artery was successfully terminated by angiographic embolisation. No harmful effects on the fetal well-being were recorded after the embolisation. Massive haemorrhage, most probably from the right uterine artery, recurred some days later, and Caesarean section was performed. At postpartal ultrasonography and catheter angiography, massive arterial bleeding from a pseudoaneurysmatic vessel was clearly imaged on the right side of the cervical myometrium and could successfully be treated by radiographic embolisation. Though the primary aetiology of bleeding remains uncertain, it is possible that cervical endometriosis could have been associated with this complication.
