Primary bone location of hydatid disease is extremely rare. The clinical case herein reported represents a primitive bone location of echinococcus in the ileal and sacral area. The aspecific symptoms did not allow for a preoperative diagnosis. The latter was possible only after a CT scan performed for other reasons. The patient underwent a CT scan and MIR which showed a diffuse involvement of the ilium and sacrum along with the presence of two cysts (anterior and posterior). Surgery was performed through an anterolateral extraperitoneal and posterior access in the gluteal region. Asportation "en bloc" of the cysts was not possible. Therefore, they were opened, aspirated and washed with hypertonic solution (33% NaCl). Following surgery Albendazole was prescribed to the patient. At 22 days from surgery, a CT scan confirmed the disappearance of the cysts along with the presence of bone lesions.
