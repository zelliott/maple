Ten normal volunteers and 25 patients with myocardial infarction were examined by ECG-gated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In normal volunteers, the thickness and signal of left ventricular muscle between different septum are not significantly different. As an effective imaging technique through the changes of wall thickness and signal, 24 of 25 patients with myocardial infarction were identified by MRI. At the same time, ventricular aneurysm and thrombosis etc were found.
