Assessment of the correlation between the clinical diagnosis of intraocular tumor and anatomopathologic findings.

Retrospective analysis of the results of the treatment in the groups of adults and children during the period of 1985-1994.

In all 35 cases of adults melanoma malignum was diagnosed and confirmed anatomopathologically. In 7 among 20 children the appearance of tumor was not confirmed by anatomopathologic findings.

Special attention should be paid to the improvement of intraocular tumor diagnosis, particularly in children.
