A protocol is described for obtaining functional magnetic resonance images in anesthetized cat brain based on the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast mechanism. A visual stimulus was used, which consisted of a high-contrast drifting grating, whose speed and spatial frequency was optimized for cat area 18 (V2). Experiments were conducted at 4.7 Tesla using a gradient echo EPI sequence with a 29-ms echo time, yielding signal changes of between 0.7% and 2% in area 18.
