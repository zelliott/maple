We report a case of ovarian fibrosarcoma, one of the least common gynecological tumors. The tumor was a well-circumscribed mass extending from the pelvis to the lower abdomen. The greater part of the tumor was composed of fluid consisting of hemorrhage, degeneration and necrosis. This appeared as a very high-intensity area on T2-weighted MR images. There were also solid portions in the tumor that were shown as enhanced lesions on contrast-enhanced CT. It should be noted that fibrosarcoma can appear as an area of high intensity on T2-weighted MR images, although it belongs to the fibroma-thecoma group.
