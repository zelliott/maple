The study object was to retrospectively compare the detection rate of hypervascular foci visualized by CT during hepatic arteriography (CTHA) in borderline nodules, which was observed upon cirrhotic livers, on dynamic MDCT, dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR (dynamic MR), and SPIO-enhanced MR imaging. Eighty-five nodules in 49 patients with cirrhosis were evaluated. When a part of the nodule showed hyperdensity relative to the surrounding areas of the nodule on CTHA, it was defined as "hypervascular focus." The relationships between the dynamic MDCT and dynamic MR and SPIO-enhanced MR imaging findings of these foci were analyzed using X(2) test. Hypervascular foci were detected in 17 (53%) of 32 on the arterial dominant phase of dynamic MDCT, in 19 (37%) of 51 on the arterial dominant phase of dynamic MR and in 6 (26%) of 23 on SPIO-enhanced MR imaging. Arterial dominant phase of dynamic MDCT demonstrated a significantly higher detection rate of hypervascular foci less than 5 mm in diameter than did dynamic and SPIO MR imaging (p<0.05). Hypervascular foci in borderline nodules could be better visualized by dynamic MDCT than by gadolinium- and SPIO-enhanced MR imaging. Dynamic MDCT is recommended for the follow-up examination of hypovascular borderline lesions.
