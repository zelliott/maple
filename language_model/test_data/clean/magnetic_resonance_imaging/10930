Use of whole-body MRI beyond 1.5 Tesla (T) has initiated a renaissance in spectroscopic procedures (MRS). The superior signal-to-noise ratio of clinical 3T tomographs allows reliable acquisition of MR spectra not only in fixed organs but also in targets moved by breathing such as the liver. The following contribution describes the principles of (1)H MRS and our own initial experiences with spectroscopy of the liver and hepatic malignant tumors with 3T whole-body MRI.
