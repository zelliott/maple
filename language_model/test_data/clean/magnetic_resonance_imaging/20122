To describe the magnetic resonance (MR) findings in ovarian functional hemorrhagic cysts (FHC).

A total of 21 patients with 22 FHC, proven by follow-up ultrasound (US) in 11 women and surgery in 10 women, had US and MR examinations within 24 hours. The study was limited to cysts with obvious an echogenic pattern. All patients had T2-weighted fast spin echo (FSE), T1-weighted spin echo (SE), and T1-weighted SE fat-suppressed sequences.

Four cysts (18%) were hypointense on T1-weighted-images without and with fat suppression, and hyperintense on T2-weighted-images. Five cysts (23%) were hypointense on T1-weighted images without and with fat suppression but heterogenous on T2-weighted images. Five cysts (23%) were hypointense on T1-weighted images but showed intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted fat suppression images and heterogenous signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Two cysts (9%) were entirely intermediate on T1-weighted images. Five cysts (23%) displayed high signal intensity occupying less than 30% of the cystic content on T1-weighted images and one cyst (5%) displayed high signal intensity occupying more than 30% of the cystic content.

Despite an obvious echogenic pattern on US, 64% of FHC were hypointense on T1-weighted images and 18% were also hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Only 36% demonstrated intermediate or high signal intensity on T1-weighted images.
