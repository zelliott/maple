Wandering spleen is a rare entity characterized by incomplete fixation of the spleen by lienorenal and gastrosplenic ligaments. It can migrate to the lower abdomen or pelvis and can be congenital or acquired. We report a case of torsion of a wandering spleen for which there was correlative imaging by ultrasonography, Doppler ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in which all these modalities were used in the diagnostic evaluation.
