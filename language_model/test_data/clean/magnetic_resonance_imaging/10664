A 29-year-old man presenting with syncopal ventricular tachycardia was diagnosed with arrhythmogenic right ventricular (RV) cardiomyopathy. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an unequivocal dyskinetic segment at the basal portion of the RV lateral free wall. Three-dimensional electroanatomic voltage mapping using the EnSite NavX system recorded a low voltage area corresponding to the diseased portion of the right ventricle identified by MRI. This report describes concordance between cardiac MRI and this novel mapping system in arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy.
