This study was undertaken to correlate apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and relative regional cerebral blood volume (rrCBV) to histological findings in a large series of patients with primary or secondary brain tumours to evaluate diffusion-weighted (DWI) and perfusion-weighted (PWI) imaging in the characterisation of cerebral tumors.

Ninety-eight patients with cerebral tumours, 46 of which were primary (seven grade 0-I, nine low-grade gliomas, two gliomatosis cerebri, nine lymphomas and 19 high-grade gliomas) and 52 secondary, underwent conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging completed with DWI and dynamic contrast susceptibility PWI. Both ADC and rrCBV were calculated on a workstation by using Functool 2 software. Student's t test was used to determine any statistically significant differences in the ADC and rrCBV values.

Seventeen of 98 tumours were cystic or necrotic (12/17 hypointense and 5/17 hyperintense on DWI); the ADC value of hyperintense cystic areas was 0.97+/-0.23x10(-3) mm2/s. The ADC value of solid tumours varied between 0.64 and 3.5x10(-3) mm2/s. The rrCBV value was 1.4 (sigma 0.66) in low-grade gliomas; 1.22 (sigma 0.25) in lymphomas; 4.5 (sigma 0.85) in grade III gliomas; 3.18 (sigma 1.26) in grade IV gliomas and 2.53 (sigma 1.6) in metastases.

DWI has an important role in the differential diagnosis of cystic cerebral masses but not in tumour characterisation. PWI is helpful in differentiating high-from low-grade gliomas and lymphomas from high-grade gliomas.
