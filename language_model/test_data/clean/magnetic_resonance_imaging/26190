Magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging provide unique information about the brain to the biochemist and the clinician. In particular, the ability to image metabolites other than water and to get detailed information about dynamic cellular processes (such as blood flow, blood oxygenation and cell swelling) is leading to many new insights into brain function and dysfunction. This review describes the use of old and new NMR techniques which demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in the cell death that occurs following an hypoxic-ischaemic insult to the neonatal brain.
