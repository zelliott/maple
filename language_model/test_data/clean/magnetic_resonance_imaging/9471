Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the gold-standard technique for the diagnosis of biliary obstruction. ERCP is also used for therapeutic purposes. During these procedures (diagnostic and therapeutic), complications such as pancreatitis, infection, hemorrhage, perforation and cardiopulmonary problems may arise. Some of these complications occur frequently, while others are extremely rare, as in the case presented here. In this case report, we present a woman who suffered an electrical burn in the liver during therapeutic ERCP. To our knowledge, this is the first case ever reported, which was caused by a monopolar cutter during ERCP and diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
