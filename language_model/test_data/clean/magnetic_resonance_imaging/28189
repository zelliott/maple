The diagnostic role of Magnetic Resonance angiography (MRA) was investigated in the study of the abdominal aorta. To obviate the problems relative to motion and respiratory artifacts, the TOF 2D (FISP 2D) technique was employed, together with a superconductive 1.5 T magnet. Fourteen volunteers were studied. The images acquired on the coronal and sagittal planes were processed according to MIP and target MIP, with a rotation on the z axis. The abdominal aorta was clearly demonstrated in 100% of cases, the celiac trunk in 42.8% of cases on coronal and in 100% on sagittal images. The superior mesenteric artery was depicted in 35.7% of cases on coronal and in 100% of subjects on sagittal acquisitions. The renal and iliac arteries were demonstrated in 100% of cases on coronal images only, while dorso-spinal and lumbar arteries were always clearly depicted on sagittal scans only. To evaluate the diagnostic reliability of MRA, 6 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms were also studied and angiography and surgery were assumed as the gold standard. In all cases MRA yielded similar information to angiography and surgery as to aneurysm extent, vessel involvement and left renal vein course; moreover, MRA allowed the assessment of both the thrombotic and the calcific components of the aneurysm. Unenhanced MRA with the TOF 2D technique allows the detailed depiction of the aorta in about 20 minutes. Our preliminary results in the study of aneurysms are encouraging relative to the future diagnostic role of MRA in the abdominal aorta.
