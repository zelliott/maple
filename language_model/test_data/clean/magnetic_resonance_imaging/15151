Studies of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) suggest that anterior transmural infarcts are associated with greater left ventricular (LV) remodeling compared with nontransmural nonanterior infarctions. It is unclear whether this relation also exists in long-term survivors of MI. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was used to explore the relation between myocardial scar size, localization, transmurality, and degree of long-term LV remodeling in patients with healed MI. Subjects were recruited from a registry of patients with healed MI who participated in the OPTIMAAL trial. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed to assess LV mass, volumes, LV ejection fraction, and myocardial scarring, adjusting for myocardial ischemia. Fifty-seven patients (mean age 69 +/- 10 years mean ejection fraction 49 +/- 13%) were studied 4.4 +/- 0.4 years after MI. Anterior scar was found in 19 patients and nonanterior scar in 33, whereas 5 patients did not show myocardial scar. Transmural scar was evident in 36 patients. In the 52 patients with scar, average total scar size was 13 +/- 8% of total LV mass. There was a strong linear relation between scar size and LV end-diastolic volume index (r = 0.81, p <0.0001), end-systolic volume index (r = 0.86, p <0.0001), and LV ejection fraction (r = -0.74, p <0.0001). In multivariate analysis, scar size was the strongest independent predictor of ejection fraction and LV volumes independently of scar localization and transmurality. In conclusion, in the studied cohort, there was a linear relation between scar size and ejection fraction and LV volumes. This relation was independent of scar location and transmurality.
