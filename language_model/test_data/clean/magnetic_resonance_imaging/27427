A previously healthy 56-year-old man presented with chest pain. Echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed minimal pericardial effusion associated with an isolated myocardial mass, protruding into the left atrium. The tumor was surgically removed. Cardiac valve morphology was strictly normal. Histology revealed a well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma. Positron emission tomography scan and thin-slice abdominal computed tomography demonstrated ileal tumor, without evidence of liver metastasis. Histological study of the removed ileal tumor confirmed a neuroendocrine carcinoma, and histology of liver biopsy was negative. Somatostatin analogue treatment was started. No tumoral recurrence was observed after 1 year of follow-up. In conclusion, we report an unusual presentation of neuroendocrine carcinoma, revealed by a large solitary atrial metastasis, in the absence of liver involvement or carcinoid syndrome.
