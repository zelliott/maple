A 65-year-old woman was admitted with exertional dyspnea. She had a history of syncopal attack and cerebral infarction. On admission, her chest radiography ++ revealed two mass shadows in the right upper and lower fields. Pulmonary angiography and right heart catheterization were performed. Six arteriovenous fistulas in the right lung and five in the left were observed. The percent of R-L shunt was 51.5%. Because of exertional dyspnea, large shunt and history of cerebrovascular disorders, excision resection of two fistulas in right upper and middle lobes and right lower lobectomy were performed. Her symptoms improved and the percent of the R-L shunt markedly decreased after the operation. There is no sign of enlargement in size of the remaining arteriovenous fistulas.
