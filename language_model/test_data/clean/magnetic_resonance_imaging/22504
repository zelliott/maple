A 39-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis developed femoral neuropathy secondary to iliopsoas bursitis. The adjacent hip joint was severely damaged. Magnetic resonance imaging showed enlargement and inflammation of the psoas muscle at the same side of iliopsoas bursitis. Iliopsoas bursitis and abnormal findings of the psoas muscle disappeared while the symptoms improved.
