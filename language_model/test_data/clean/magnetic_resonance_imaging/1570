This functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigates commonalties and differences in working memory (WM) processes employing different types of stimuli. We specifically sought to characterize topographic convergence and segregation with respect to prefrontal cortex involvement using verbal, spatial, real object and shape memory items in a two-back WM task. Both the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices are conjointly activated across all stimulus types. No stimulus-specific differences in the activation patterns of the prefrontal cortex could be demonstrated giving support to the view of an amodal prefrontal involvement during WM processes. However, extra-frontal regions specialized on feature processing and involved in the preprocessing of the stimuli were selectively activated by these different subtypes of WM. These selectively activated regions are assigned to parts of the ventral and dorsal stream.
