A 53-year-old man was hospitalized with general fatigue, headache, dizziness and polyuria. The laboratory findings revealed anterior hypopituitarism and central diabetes insipidus. He also showed eye movement disorder and facial sensory impairment. These symptoms were treated successfully with conservative medical treatment. Concurrently, abnormal pituitary MR imaging findings were revealed. Pituitary abscess was primarily suspected on MR imaging findings, although it was difficult to differentiate pituitary apoplexy by MR imaging findings, alone. In this report, we propose a new diagnostic approach of pituitary abscess, using a combination of CT, MR imaging and clinical manifestations, without either pituitary surgery or pituitary biopsy.
