We report a patient with severe hypoxic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest, in which lesions depicted on MRI involved mainly the periaqueductal brainstem, hypothalamus and mamillary bodies, and medial thalami. Hypoxia usually causes cerebro-cerebellar cortical damage. However, it may also cause midline lesions of similar distribution to those of Wernicke's encephalopathy due to thiamine deficiency.
