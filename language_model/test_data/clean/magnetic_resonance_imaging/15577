To study the diagnosis and treatment of spinal cord hemangioblastoma.

The clinical data of 42 patients with spinal cord hemangioblastoma who were operated on between 1997 and 2005 were analyzed.

Spinal cord hemangioblastoma mostly showed space occupying lesions with clear boundary and Dd-DTPA homogenous enhancement by MRI. All the 42 patients underwent complete excision. 27 patients showed improvement of their symptoms, the 6 patients failed to show any change, and neurological deficits were aggravated in the 5 patients.

MRI and DSA are helpful in qualitative and localized diagnoses of the spinal cord hemangioblastoma. Surgical outcomes are favorable.
