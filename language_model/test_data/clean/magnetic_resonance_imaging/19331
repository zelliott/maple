We describe our experience with follow-up MR imaging and MR spectroscopy in two patients after embolization of meningiomas without subsequent surgery. In both patients there was a marked reduction in tumor size and a decrease in contrast enhancement associated with spectroscopic signs of fatty degeneration. We did not observe regrowth; however, in one patient with incomplete angiographic devascularization, residual vital tumor tissue was seen at follow-up examinations.
