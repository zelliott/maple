This article depicts the MR findings of ovarian tumours with cystic components. MRI can predict the cyst contents and evaluate the potential for malignancy when an irregular solid portion or a papillary nodule is observed within the cystic tumour. Post-contrast T1 weighted MRI is helpful for the identification of solid areas that enhance. Fat suppression imaging is useful for differentiation between mature cystic teratoma and other pathology. Fat suppressed post-contrast T1 weighted MRI may demonstrate contrast enhancement, reflecting inflammatory or neoplastic processes in the pelvis.
