Because the tongue is superficially located and the initial manifestation of most diseases occurring there is mucosal change, lingual these lesions can be easily accessed and diagnosed without imaging analysis. Most congenital lesions of the tongue, however, can manifest as a submucosal bulge and be located in a deep portion of that organ such as its base; their true characteristics and extent may be recognized only on cross-sectional images such as those obtained by CT or MRI. In addition, because it is usually difficult to differentiate congenital lesions from other submucosal neoplasms on the basis of imaging findings alone, clinical history and physical examination should always be taken into consideration when interpreting CT and MR images of the tongue. Although the radiologic findings for congenital lesions are nonspecific, CT and MR imaging can play an important role in the diagnostic work-up of these unusual lesions. Delineation of the extent of the tumor, and recognition and understanding of the spectrum of imaging and the pathologic features of these lesions, often help narrow the differential diagnosis.
