Forty-seven out of 49 patients with a histologically-proven diagnosis of medulloblastoma admitted to our institution between 1 January 1984 and 13 December 1990 were examined post-operatively using either myelography or gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in an attempt to detect clinically occult spinal metastatic disease. Spinal spread of the tumour was identified in nine (19%) patients. Of the 16 patients for whom a 5-year follow-up has been available 12 had no myelographic evidence of spinal disease and of these 10 (83%) remain disease-free. Of the six who have died during this period four had evidence of spinal metastases at presentation. Of all the children in the series with spinal spread identified at the time of their initial hospitalization, only one survives to date (15 months after diagnosis). The remainder had an average life expectancy of 18 months.
