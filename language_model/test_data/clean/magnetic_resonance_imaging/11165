We performed extracellular potential recording with dissected snail ganglia inside an MRI scanner to investigate correlation between neuronal activity and MR image intensity. To increase neuronal activity we applied a nitric oxide donor, sodium-nitrosocystein, to the ganglia. The MR image intensity change in the ganglia region is correlated with the neuronal activity and was up to 5.49+/-1.94%. Since the snail has non-magnetic hemocyanins as oxygen carrying protein, it seems that the image intensity change is mainly due to the local magnetic fields produced by the neuronal currents.
