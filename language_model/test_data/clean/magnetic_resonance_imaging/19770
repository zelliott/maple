More fibro-osseous lesions originate in the bones of the extremities than in the craniomaxillofacial bones, scapula, and ribs, which are rarely involved. Fibro-osseous lesions that decrease the quality of life should be treated surgically. We report the case of a fibro-osseous lesion that caused globus pharyngeus and dysphagia. We discuss the clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic features of this case as well as the removal of this unusual lesion by Doppler ultrasound-guided surgery. To the best of our knowledge, no other case of a fibro-osseous lesion in the retropharyngeal area has been reported in the literature.
