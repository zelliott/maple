Choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) is a rare benign tumor of the central nervous system with a propensity for location within the lateral ventricle in children. We report a case of a 14-year-old girl who presented with transient facial paresis and ataxia. Her imaging showed a non-enhancing intra fourth ventricular mass, the histology of which was reported as CPP. The atypical clinical and radiological features in this case are discussed. Choroid plexus papillomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of non-enhancing fourth ventricular masses.
