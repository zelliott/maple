Parapharyngeal lesions are rare. Tumors arising in the parapharyngeal space can be silent clinically for a long period of time. Physical findings like dislocation of the pharyngeal walls or cervical swelling are often recognized by chance.

Representing three cases of parapharyngeal tumors the differential diagnosis of parapharyngeal masses and the importance of the magnetic resonance imaging will be shown.

Mostly, parapharyngeal masses are represented by salivary gland tumors (40%-50%). The second most common tumors in the parapharyngeal space are neurogenic tumors (17%-25%). Paragangliomas are the third group of common parapharyngeal lesions (10%-15%). A mixed group of lesions like branchial cleft cysts, lymph nodes and hematogenic tumors represent the remaining part of the parapharyngeal masses (10%-33%). Most of the lesions (80%) are benign. Because of the magnetic response imaging a reliable preoperative diagnosis is possible in more than 80% of the tumors. The surgical management may also be influenced by the location of the tumor shown in the magnetic resonance imaging.
