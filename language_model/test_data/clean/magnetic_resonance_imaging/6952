Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging allow more accurate staging of the carcinoma of the tongue than the clinical examination alone. The complex anatomy and the tumour margins make the interpretation of CT and MR images challenging. The aim of this paper is to review the technique and semiotic criteria for CT and MR evaluation and staging of carcinoma of the tongue.
