In the course of daily living, changing environmental demands often make our actions, once initiated, unnecessary or even inappropriate. Under such circumstances, the ability to inhibit the obsolete action and to update behavior can be of vital importance. Previous lesion and neuroimaging studies have shown that the right prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia seem to play an important role in the inhibition of already initiated motor responses. The present study was designed to investigate whether the neural activity of inhibitory motor control was altered if the inhibition process was succeeded by an additional process, namely the reengagement into an alternative action. Therefore, cerebral blood oxygenation during performance of a stop-change paradigm was registered in 15 male participants using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. Data analysis showed, that during successful and failed stopping and changing (response inhibition and subsequent response reengagement) of initiated motor responses a very similar network was activated including primarily the right inferior frontal cortex (IFC). Besides, stopping-related activation in right IFC was significantly greater for fast inhibitors than for slow ones. Results of the present study thus further underline the important role of right IFC in response inhibition and suggest that the inhibition process functions similarly regardless whether changing task demands require the complete suppression of an already initiated motor response or its suppression and a subsequent response reengagement into an alternative action.
