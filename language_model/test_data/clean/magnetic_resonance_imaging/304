An 8-year-old Brown Swiss dairy cow was presented with unilateral epistaxis and mild inspiratory stridor. At that time endoscopic examination revealed a smooth-surfaced mass within the left nasal cavity. Biopsy samples were collected and a diagnosis of fibrosarcoma was made. Eighteen months later the animal developed severe respiratory distress that led to difficulties in feeding and consequently to emaciation and a dramatic drop in milk production. The cow was humanely destroyed and submitted for post-mortem examination. The head was subject to further investigation by radiography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. These techniques revealed a non-infiltrative, well-circumscribed mass of both radiodense and heterogeneously intense structures. Histopathological examination revealed a mass consisting of well-differentiated and interlacing bone trabeculae lined by osteoblasts and multinucleated osteoclasts. In contrast to the initial diagnosis, the later diagnostic approaches supported the diagnosis of osteoma.
