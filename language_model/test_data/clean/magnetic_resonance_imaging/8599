In this report, we describe the peculiar eye movements of a young man who became comatose after a head injury. The eyes moved rhythmically from one side to another, without pausing in the lateral positions. This phenomenon has been described as "ping pong gaze" (PPG), referring to short-cycling periodic alternating gaze with smooth eye deviations. In the present patient, however, a saccadic type of PPG could be confirmed by oculography. Possible clinical and pathophysiological implications are discussed.
