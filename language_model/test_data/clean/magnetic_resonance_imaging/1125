The extent of hepatic resection is often determined by the hepatic veins and their relation to the tumor. A need to transect the right hepatic vein at its entry into the vena cava indicates a need to remove the entire right posterior segment. About six cases, the aim of the study was to remind that under certain circumstances the posteroinferior area may be preserved. The circumstances which allow such preservation are the presence of a stout inferior right hepatic vein and the ability to recognize the presence of the vein in the preoperative staging. In patients with possible impaired hepatic function (cirrhosis, chemotherapy), preservation of hepatic parenchyma is an important consideration during resection for hepatic tumors.
