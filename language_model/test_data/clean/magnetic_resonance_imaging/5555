To present a combined interventional radiologic and resection technique for the management of a large amblyogenic, highly vascular lesion of the lower eyelid associated with severe mechanical ectropion, conjunctival pyogenic granuloma, and recurrent, spontaneous conjunctival bleeding.

Preoperative selective embolization and coil placement were followed by resection of the tumor.

Embolization, coil placement, and resection were uneventful with cosmetic and functional visual improvement obtained. Pathology indicated a noninvoluting congenital hemangioma.

To the authors' knowledge, this is the first surgical technique reported in the ophthalmic literature for the selective embolization of a noninvoluting congenital hemangioma prior to its resection. Such a technique should be considered in the management of large lesions of this type.
