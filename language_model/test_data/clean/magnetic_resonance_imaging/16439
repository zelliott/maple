Inflammatory bowel disease remains a complex disease with variable clinical presentations and often nonspecific symptoms. Physicians must rely on diagnostic tools for clarification of disease diagnosis and for guiding management of patients with established disease. Advances in radiologic imaging modalities facilitate early and accurate detection of luminal disease and extraluminal complications. The introduction and dissemination of small bowel capsule endoscopy and double-balloon enteroscopy permit detailed visualization and sampling of the mucosa throughout the entire bowel. Serologic biomarkers are evolving as a valuable tool to clarify diagnosis and stratify patients by disease phenotypes and patterns of behavior. Neutrophil-derived fecal biomarkers are emerging as useful surrogate markers of intestinal inflammation with the potential for a variety of clinical applications, but their application to clinical management has not yet been clarified.
