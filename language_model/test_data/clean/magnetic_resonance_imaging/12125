The authors report two cases of intracranial, extradural, intracavernous epidermoid cyst. In one case the cyst was ruptured into the subarachnoid space and in the substance of the temporal lobe. The two cysts had to be subtotally resected because of dense adherences with the internal carotid artery. In both cases the post-operative periods were uneventful.
