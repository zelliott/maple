We report the MRI findings in a patient with poliomyelitis-like syndrome. MRI demonstrated a lesion extending from the dorsal region of the pons to the upper level of the thoracic spinal cord. The spinal cord was particularly affected in a region involving the bilateral anterior horns. Although its pathology is unknown, the lesion of the spinal cord seemingly reflects the pathological features of this disease.
