Tangier disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the recently identified ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 gene (ABC1). A typical clinical manifestation of Tangier disease is peripheral neuropathy. Former studies differentiated between two manifestations: the more frequent mono- or polyneuropathic form and a syringomyelia-like type. It is unknown whether specific mutations in the ABC1 gene or a particular genetic background are responsible for either of these forms. A family is presented comprising a case with a severe syringomyelia-like phenotype of Tangier disease and absence of cardiovascular disease. Sequencing analysis of the ABC1 gene was performed. A new homozygous C-->T transition in exon 18 was found in the index patient. This mutation results in a stop codon at position 909 (R909X) leading to premature termination of translation. Her clinically asymptomatic daughters, her sister and one of her nieces were heterozygous. Sural nerve biopsies were studied in the index patient at the age of 45 and 54 years; both revealed a severe neuropathy, characterized by a subtotal and finally complete loss of nerve fibres. The entire loss of Schwann cells resulted in an extraordinary form of endoneurial sclerosis. Only rare capillaries, lipid-laden macrophages and fibroblasts had survived in the endoneurium. This case appears to be unique in respect to the underlying novel mutation in the ABC1 gene and its association with complete endoneurial sclerosis of all fascicles in the sural nerve and absence of cardiovascular disease.
