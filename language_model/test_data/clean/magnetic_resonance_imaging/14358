This article provides a brief overview of one of the two fundamental physical principles which lead to a modulation of the magnetic resonance signal of moving spins: the time-of-flight effect. It then discusses some of its characteristic manifestations in spin-echo imaging and reviews strategies for exploiting the effect to quantitate vascular flow.
