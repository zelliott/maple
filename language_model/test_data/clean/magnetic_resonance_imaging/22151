This 9-year-old boy presented with a multifocal, apparently noninfectious granulomatous process involving the central nervous system. Despite gross-total excision of the large left temporal lesion, it recurred after surgery. Serological studies and cultures failed to demonstrate an infectious agent, and histopathological investigation showed a nonspecific granulomatous process without vasculitis. The patient underwent a second craniotomy and was given corticosteroid therapy. There has been no recurrence during 3 years of follow-up review, the last year of which included no course of steroid medications. The case is presented as a noninfectious idiopathic granulomatous encephalitis that is responsive to surgery and corticosteroid therapy. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first reported case of its kind.
