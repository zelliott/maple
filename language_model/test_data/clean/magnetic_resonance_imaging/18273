A patient with a remote history of nephrectomy for hypernephroma presented a visual field defect with hypopituitarism. Neuro-imaging studies showed a highly vascularized sellar mass with suprasellar extension. Surgery, which was performed via the subfrontal approach, disclosed the pituitary tumor to be a hypernephroma. Although anterior pituitary involvement is rare, chiasmal compression is much rarer in metastatic pituitary carcinomas, a review of previously reported cases of metastatic pituitary hypernephroma and our own case indicated that pituitary metastasis from this carcinoma, in contrast to other metastatic pituitary tumors, often mimics pituitary adenoma.
