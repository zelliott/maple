To detect retinotopic activation in the human V5/MT, we obtained fMRI signals during optokinetic responses (OKR). We used two types of patterns, consisting of random dots plotted in either the central or peripheral regions, to stimulate the central and peripheral visual fields, respectively. These patterns moved at a constant speed of 20 degrees/s rightward and leftward alternately. Subjects were required to track the patterns with their eyes. The two types of visual stimuli elicited different patterns of brain activation; the area with the most significant response to central visual field stimuli was located posteriorly to that responding to peripheral visual field stimuli.
