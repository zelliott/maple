An uncommon case of a giant mucinous biliary cystadenoma (BCA) of the liver is described. On T2-weighted and STIR images, a large hyperintense cystic mass revealed some septations and multiple intracystic masses of similar size and shape and uniform signal intensity, which was isointense to liver parenchyma. On T1-weighted images, intracystic bodies were obscured and the cyst was hyperintense. The magnetic resonance (MR) appearance of intracystic fluid and structures was not due to mucinous or proteinous or hyperproteinous material, but corresponded to clots floating within hemorrhagic fluid.
