In a retrospective study of 22 neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, fetal lung volume (FLV) measured by magnetic resonance imaging was associated with survival; the best FLV ratio cut-off to predict mortality was 30% of expected FLV. This study supports a correlation between FLV and the chances of survival.
