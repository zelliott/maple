Coronary disease risk increases inversely with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level. The measurement of the biodistribution and clearance of HDL in vivo, however, has posed a technical challenge. This study presents an approach to the development of a lipoprotein MRI agent by linking gadolinium methanethiosulfonate (Gd[MTS-ADO3A]) to a selective cysteine mutation in position 55 of apo AI, the major protein of HDL. The contrast agent targets both liver and kidney, the sites of HDL catabolism, whereas the standard MRI contrast agent, gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-bismethylamide (GdDTPA-BMA, gadodiamide), enhances only the kidney image. Using a modified apolipoprotein AI to create an HDL contrast agent provides a new approach to investigate HDL biodistribution, metabolism and regulation in vivo.
