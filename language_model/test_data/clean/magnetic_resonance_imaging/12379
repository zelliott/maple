Magnetoencephalography (MEG) in combination with structural MRI (magnetic source imaging, MSI) plays an increasingly important role as one of the tools for presurgical evaluation of medically intractable focal epilepsy. The aim of the study was to compare the MSI and commonly used video EEG monitoring method (vEEG) in their sensitivity to interictal epileptic discharges (IED) in 22 patients with drug resistant epilepsy. Furthermore, the detection and localization results obtained by both methods were verified using the data of electrocorticography (ECoG) and postsurgical outcome in 13 patients who underwent invasive EEG monitoring and surgery. The results showed that MSI was superior to vEEC in terms of sensitivity to IED with difference in sensitivity of 22%. The data also suggested that MSI superiority to vEEG in detecting epileptic discharges might, at least partly, arise from better MEG responsiveness to epileptic events coming from the medial, opercular and basal aspects of cortical lobes. MSI localization estimates were in the same cortical lobe and at the same lobar aspects as the epileptic foci detected by ECoG in all patients. Thus, magnetic source imaging can provide critical localization information that is not available when other noninvasive methods, such as vEEG and MRI, are used.
