Assessment of myocardial viability has become an important issue in patients presenting with either acute myocardial infarction or presenting with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. In patients with viable myocardium recovery of left ventricular function can be anticipatedm, spontaneously in patients with acute myocardial infarction or following revascularization in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. In contrast, patients without viable tissue are not likely to improve in left ventricular function. Currently, nuclear imaging techniques and dobutamine stress echocardiography are used for assessment of viability; recent studies with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have however demonstrated the potential usefulness of this technique for the assessment of viability. Various parameters, derived from resting MRI, can be used as markers of myocardial viability, including the end-diastolic wall thickness, systolic wall thickening and signal intensity without contrast-enhancement. Other studies have combined the information from resting MRI with the assessment of contractile reserve during dobutamine stimulation. Finally, recent studies have evaluated the use of contrast-enhanced MRI to detect viable myocardium. All of these parameters are potentially useful and MRI provide an alternative approach for the assessment of viable myocardium.
