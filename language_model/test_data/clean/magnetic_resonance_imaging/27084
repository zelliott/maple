Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to assess the outcome of infliximab (IFX) therapy in patients with perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (pfCD). However, few long-term data are available about its efficacy.

We assessed 59 patients with pfCD by MRI and clinical evaluation at baseline. Treated patients then received paired clinical and MRI examinations for a median time period of 36 (11-53.3) weeks. Short-, mid-, and long-term effects of therapy, as well as the ability of MRI to predict treatment outcome and need for surgery, were evaluated.

Compared with the baseline MRI, the short-term follow-up MRI (n = 29) revealed a reduced number of fistula tracks in 13.8% and in the inflammatory activity in 55.2% of patients, respectively; mid-term MRI (n = 25) in 56% and in 52%, respectively; and long-term MRI (n = 13) in 15.4% and in 31%, respectively. Improvement of pfCD based on MRI results coincided with clinical improvement in 54.7% of the patients. Short-term and mid-term (but not long-term) MRI showed a significant decrease in the activity score. Therapy outcome was worse among patients with persisting fistulas (P = .01), collections (P = .009), and rectal wall involvement (P = .01) in the final MRI. Patients with single-branched fistulas (P < .0001) and collections (P = .006) in their baseline MRI were more likely to undergo surgery.

MRI is a useful technique for evaluation of pfCD during the first year of follow-up. In the long-term, the MRI improvement coincides with clinical and endoscopic response to IFX in 50% of the patients.
