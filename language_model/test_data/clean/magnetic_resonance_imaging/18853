The neurocentral junction (NCJ) is a cartilaginous growth plate located between the vertebral centrurn and the neural arch. In characterizing the age of closure of this growth plate, anatomic studies have suggested that the NCJ closes before age 10, whereas MRI studies have suggested that the NCJ does not fuse until adolescence In this study, gross anatomic and histologic sections were correlated with MR images to determine the components of the NCJ image. The NCJ image appeared as a thick white line that was shown to encompass the cartilage of the growth plate, the surrounding woven bone and a portion of the trabecular bone of the vertebra. Although the MR pixels were too large to completely resolve the tissues that surround the growth plate, MRI was shown to be a valuable technique of visualizing the NCJ cartilage and further MRI studies of the human NCJ are needed.
