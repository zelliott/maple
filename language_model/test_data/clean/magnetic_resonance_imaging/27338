Primary extraluminal gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) originating from outside of the GI tract are not uncommon. However, none have been reported to arise from the falciform ligament of the liver. The natural history and prognostic indicators for primary GISTs, while still unclear, have been under much investigation, and some promising therapeutic options have surfaced, including surgical removal and adjuvant chemotherapy with imatinib.
