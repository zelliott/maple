Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed on 9 patients who lacked a sense of smell since birth. Seven of them, including two patients with Kallmann syndrome, exhibited abnormality of the olfactory bulb, olfactory tract, olfactory sulcus, or rectus gyrus, with some variation among patients in type and degree of abnormality. The other two patients exhibited normal olfactory pathway morphology, and for them the possibility of acquired sensorineural anosmia could not be ruled out. MRI is useful for determining whether patients with congenital anosmia have olfactory pathway anomalies. Many patients with congenital anosmia and hypoplasty or aplasty of the olfactory pathway nevertheless had no gonadal or endocrinological disorders.
