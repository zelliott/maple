A chondral/osteochondral defect involving the articular surface of a joint is still a therapeutic problem. The goal of articular cartilage repair is restoration of cartilage congruity, accomplishing full painfree range of motion and elimination of cartilage detoriation. The use of autologous grafts was first reported by Wagner 1964. Now the use of cylindrical autograft plugs was described by Bobic 1996 and Hangody 1996. Operative management and early results of osteochondral cylindrical autograft plugs in the femoral condyle, patella, elbow and talar dome are presented. The arthroscopic/open use of autologous osteochondral grafts from the knee is indicated in osteochondral lesions in diameter from 1 to 3 cm, which can not be primarily refixed and in osteonecrosis at femoral condyle, patella, elbow, talar dome as well as shoulder.
