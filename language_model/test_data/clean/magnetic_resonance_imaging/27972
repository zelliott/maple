Temporalis muscle/fascia axial flaps (TFs) were used in 115 temporomandibular joints (TMJs) in 81 patients to correct ankylosis (n = 25 joints), traumatic defects (n = 8), congenital anomalies (n = 4), defects resulting from tumor resection (n = 2), degenerative joint disease (n = 52), autoimmune arthritides (n = 21), and lateral capsule flaccidity (n = 3). The follow-up period ranged from 6 months to 5.5 years. Seven patients (8.6% of the group; 10 TMJs) were reevaluated for recurrent symptoms (pain and decreased motion), with a mean of 1.7 years (range = 1 to 3 years) postoperatively. Four of these patients (seven TMJs) had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as part of their diagnostic workup and four patients (five TMJs) required a second operative procedure. This study reports the results of the MRI, intraoperative, and histologic evaluations of the TFs in these seven patients. The MRIs showed vascularized tissue between the condyle and roof of the glenoid fossa in all seven joints examined. The signal was consistent with muscle and/or fat as opposed to scar tissue. All flaps examined at the time of surgery (arthroscopy, n = 1; arthrotomy, n = 4) were in place and had the gross appearance of normal muscle. Histologic examination of biopsies of four flaps indicated the presence of viable muscle with normal-appearing nuclei. The results of this study indicate that the TF does survive when it is carefully dissected and inferiorly based to preserve blood supply.
