Petroclival meningiomas are technically challenging lesions. They have a tendency to grow slowly, involve cranial nerves and compress the brainstem and basilar artery, pushing them to the opposite side. Their natural history is marked by clinical deterioration and fatal outcome. They were once considered inoperable lesions; decades ago, mortality rates were higher than 50%. The authors describe 15 petroclival meningiomas treated surgically between 1995 and 2007. The main approaches used were combined anterior petrosectomy and retrosigmoid (3 cases), retrosigmoid (8 cases), and pre-sigmoid and subtemporal (4 cases). The mortality rate was 13.5% due to surgical bed hematoma and brain ischemia. The post-operative complications were hydrocephalus in 2 cases, cerebrospinal fluid leak in 2 cases and infection of surgical flap in one case. Limiting factors for surgical removal are tumor consistency, encasement of brainstem perforators and pre-operative clinical status.
