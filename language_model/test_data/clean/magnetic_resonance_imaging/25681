A prospective intra-operative analysis of the location of lumbar disc herniation was performed in 131 patients with verified 54% contained (incomplete) and 46% non-contained (complete) lumbar disc herniations. Bulging discs or protrusions are not included in this study. Complete disc herniations occurred more frequently in the upper lumbar spine. The localization of the lumbar disc herniations within its segment showed no correlation to the affected level. 64% of the disc herniations were located medio-laterally, 20% laterally, 12% within or lateral of the intervertebral compartment and 5% in the midline. Nearly one third of all herniations were found at the level of the disc space. Medio-lateral disc herniations were displaced more often in a caudal direction, lateral herniations were found displaced upwards and downwards with similar frequency while extraforminal herniations migrated significantly more often in a cranial direction. The pathomechanism and anatomical pathways of disc fragment migration are discussed on the basis of a new concept of the anterior extradural space.
