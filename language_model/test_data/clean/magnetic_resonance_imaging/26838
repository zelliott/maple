A 47-year-old woman presented with a growing mass on the lateral rim of orbit. Orbital CT revealed a well-circumscribed soft tissue mass in the right lateral orbit, with focal hyperostosis of the adjacent zygomatic bone. MRI showed a lesion of mixed T1-signal intensity, which became hypointense after fat suppression. The lesion was excised, and the diagnosis of orbital fibrolipoma was made by histopathologic examination. There was no evidence of tumor after 12 months of follow-up. Orbital fibrolipoma is a rare variant of lipoma, with only 1 case described previously. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of orbital mass.
