We present two cases of vertebral body tumours presenting with neurological compromise treated with posterior approach vertebrectomy and three-column reconstruction using in situ expandable cage and pedicle screw reconstruction. One was performed in a staged procedure, the second as a single procedure. This approach avoids the requirement, and associated comorbidity, of combined anterior and posterior approaches. Although previously described as appropriate to minimize comorbidity in patients with metastatic spinal disease, we believe this strategy should be considered in any patient requiring three-column resection and stabilization in the thoracic spine.
