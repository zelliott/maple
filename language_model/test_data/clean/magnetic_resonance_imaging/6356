In degenerative lumbar spine disease, recent studies have supported the clinical usefulness of discography, especially when used with computed tomography (CT) scanning. The role and capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning are currently evolving and being defined. This study reviews a series of patients with prolonged disabling symptoms who had normal MRI scans and abnormal discography. Discograms and discogram-CT scans may at times allow detection of clinically correlative and significant pathology (usually annular disruptions) not suggested by MRI scanning. This fact should be considered in patients with normal MRI scanning and continuing unexplained symptomatology.
