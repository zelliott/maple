A case of schizencephaly with epilepsy is reported. The patient had normal intelligence. Apart from a flattened temporal region and a slight anisokoria, the neurological examination was normal. The patient had frequent simple partial epileptic seizures with visual, auditory and gustatory hallucinations. Eight years after onset of the epilepsy, she had secondary generalization of the seizures. During the period of observation, the EEG worsened and the seizure frequency increased, and, ultimately, the patient had to apply for a disability pension.
