Indications for sialography have became rare and radiologists are less and less experienced for salivary gland cannulation. MR Sialography allows opacification of salivary ducts without any cannulation and could replace residual indications for sialography. The purpose of this paper is to review the principle of the technique, the normal and pathologic aspects of MR Sialography and to emphasize advantages and limitations compared to other techniques.
