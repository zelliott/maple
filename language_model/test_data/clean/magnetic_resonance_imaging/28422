Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) may spread posterolaterally with infiltration of the jugular foramen, jugular vein and the cranial nerves IX-XI. Cranial nerve palsies may be evident clinically but the extent of skull base infiltration is best assessed radiologically. Denervation atrophy is well demonstrated by both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). Accurate delineation of the lesion is important in prognosis and radiotherapy planning.
