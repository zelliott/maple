By performing a comprehensive MR imaging examination, it is not only possible accurately to characterize and stage cystic and solid lesions of the kidney, but also to provide important preoperative information to the surgeon. In addition, MR imaging can characterize many adrenal lesions and frequently can obviate the need to obtain biopsies. The continued development and growth of MR technology combined with the current trend toward minimally invasive surgery will expand the role of MR imaging in the future.
