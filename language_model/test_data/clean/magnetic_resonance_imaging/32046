Wilson disease (WD) produces typical lesions in the brain, which can aid in diagnosis and therapy. The authors present a drug-resistant WD case with atypical cerebral lesions with marked involvement of white matter as visualized on MRI scans. The diagnosis was confirmed by identification of mutations in the ATP7B gene. The case demonstrates an uncommon pathology-related cerebral copper accumulation and emphasizes the importance of genetic screening in the diagnosis of WD.
