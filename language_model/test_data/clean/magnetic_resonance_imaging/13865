The aim of this study was to review the outcome of patients who underwent surgery for treatment of cerebral metastatic melanoma.

A retrospective analysis was performed in 147 patients with cerebral metastases from melanoma who were treated surgically at a single institution between 1979 and 1999. Almost all patients underwent postoperative wholebrain radiation therapy. The mean patient age was 53 years (range 17-76 years); 69% of patients were male. A single cerebral metastasis was identified in 84% of patients, although 56% had synchronous extracranial metastases. The 30-day postoperative mortality rate was 2% and neurological symptoms resolved or improved in 78% of patients. Recurrence of intracerebral disease was seen in 55% of patients and 26% died of intracerebral metastases. Twenty-four patients underwent reoperation for recurrent cerebral disease. The median survival duration from the time of surgery for all patients was 8.5 months; the 3- and 5-year survival rates were 9% and 5%, respectively. Factors that significantly influenced survival on univariate analysis were the number of cerebral metastases (p = 0.015), a macroscopically complete excision (p < 0.05), and reoperation for recurrence (p = 0.02). The presence of extracranial metastases did not significantly influence survival. On multivariate analysis only the number of cerebral metastases significantly affected survival (p = 0.04).

For the majority of patients with cerebral metastases from melanoma, surgery with adjuvant radiation therapy is a treatment option that improves neurological symptoms and produces minimal morbidity. Long-term survival (> 3 years) most likely occurs in patients with a single cerebral metastasis and no demonstrable extracranial disease. Reoperation for recurrent cerebral disease may be appropriate in selected cases.
