Discal (intraspinal extradural) cysts which communicate with intervertebral disk are uncommon cause of lumbar radiculopathy, especially in pediatric patients. Only three pediatric cases have been reported in the literature. A 15-year-old boy presented with acute onset left-sided S1 radiculopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine revealed a well-defined round extradural mass seated in the left ventrolateral epidural space of the spinal canal behind the S1 vertebral body. He did not respond to the conservative therapies. Because of persistent left S1 radiculopathy, left laminotomy was performed at L5-S1 level with coagulation of the posterior longitudinal ligament surrounding the anular tear; however, discectomy was not done. The symptoms resolved and no recurrence was found at 7-year follow-up. The clinical manifestations, imaging findings, possible pathogeneses, and treatment options of these lesions are discussed and the relevant literature is reviewed.
