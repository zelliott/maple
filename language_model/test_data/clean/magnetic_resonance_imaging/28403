We describe a 36-year-old man with pneumococcal meningitis who suddenly showed a left central type facial palsy and left hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a low intensity area in the posterior limb and genu of the right internal capsule to caudate nucleus in T1-weighted images and a high intensity area in T2-weighted images. We surmised vasculitis as the cause of cerebral infarction, because steroid treatment was effective.
