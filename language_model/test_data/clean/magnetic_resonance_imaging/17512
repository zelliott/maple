Intracranial chondromas are uncommon intracranial tumours that most frequently arise from the skull base. They can, however, arise from the calvarium or the meninges. In these cases their neuroradiological features may mimic other intracranial tumours. We present two cases of intracranial chondroma, one that originated from the convexity and the other from the falx. Total excision was achieved in both cases. The literature on intracranial chondromas is reviewed.
