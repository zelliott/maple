The authors report a case of cerebellar mutism arising from a hemorrhagic midbrain cavernous malformation in a 14-year-old boy. No cerebellar lesion was identified; however, edema of the dorsal midbrain was noted on postoperative magnetic resonance images. Dysarthric speech spontaneously returned and then completely resolved to normal speech. This case provides further evidence for the theory that involvement of the dentatothalamic tracts, and not a cerebellar lesion per se, is the underlying cause of "cerebellar" mutism.
