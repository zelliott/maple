The aim of the current study was to characterize the MR appearance of solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura (SFTP).

Twenty-two consecutive patients with histologically confirmed SFTP were retrospectively evaluated with MRI.

Tumors demonstrated low signal intensity (n = 18, 82%), iso signal intensity (n = 2, 9%), and high signal intensity (n = 2, 9%) on T1-weighted images. On T2-weighted images, tumors were observed as low signal intensity (n = 10, 45%), high signal intensity (n = 2, 9%), and mixed signal intensity (n = 10, 45%). Solid component in the proliferation of tumor cells corresponded to low signal intensity in 12 tumors (55%) on T2-weighted images. On gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images, inhomogeneous enhancement (n = 18, 82%), nodular enhancement (n = 6, 27%), and homogeneous enhancement (n = 4, 18%) were observed. The enhanced lesion within the tumors had dense tumor tissue and dilated microvessels in the pathologic specimen.

SFTP shows variable appearance and enhancement pattern on MRI according to morphologic tumor heterogeneity.
