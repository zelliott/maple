Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is useful for the diagnosis of brain atrophy and intracranial abnormalities. We have developed a method of automated volumetry to evaluate the degree of brain atrophy for the diagnosis of dementia. Whole-brain MR images with thin slices without gaps are required for segmentation and volumetry. However, obtaining such images requires that the patient remain at rest for a prolonged period, thereby reducing the throughput of MR imaging examinations. Therefore, a method is needed for the reconstruction of isotropic three-dimensional (3D) data using routine axial, sagittal, and coronal MR images with 30% gaps and measurement of brain volume. The method of reconstructing 3D data consists of four processes: 1) segmentation of the brain region on axial, sagittal, and coronal MR images using the region-growing technique; 2) setting data to a 3D domain; 3) registration by manual operation; and 4) interpolation between the data based on linear interpolation. In clinical MR images, the differences between this method and the conventional technique were less than 10%. These results demonstrate that this technique is able to construct 3D data from axial, sagittal, and coronal MR images.
