Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is a rapidly emerging non-invasive imaging technique free of X-Ray and offers higher spatial resolution than alternative forms of cardiac imaging for the assessment of left ventricular (LV) anatomy, function, and viability due to the unique capability of myocardial tissue characterization after gadolinium-chelates contrast administration. This imaging technique has clinical utility over a broad spectrum of heart diseases: ranging from ischaemic to non ischaemic aetiologies. Cardiomyopathies (CMP) are a heterogeneous group of diseases of the myocardium associated with architectural abnormalities and mechanical dysfunction. CMR can help excluding coronary artery disease and can provide positive diagnostic features for several CMP resulted in better diagnosis and management, Leading to improvements in mortality.
