The term "occult fracture" defines the lack of visible fracture signs in conventional radiography although a fracture exists. The diagnosis is made in the sequel or through further diagnostic procedures. The use of scintigraphy and CT examinations is limited by their moderate sensitivity and specificity. In contrast, MRI is a diagnostic tool that allows early diagnosis of a fracture and of accompanying chondral or ligament damage. We report on 23 patients with traumatic fractures at 5 different anatomical sites, all of which were negative by x-ray, but the diagnosis could subsequently be made with MRI.
