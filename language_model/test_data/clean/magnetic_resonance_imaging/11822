Both the spontaneous shrinkage and the disappearance of disc hernia have been confirmed through the use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There is, however, no practical method to predict the likely absorption of the herniated mass. The objective of this study was to predict the spontaneous absorption of disc hernia by MRI, and to select the optimum treatment. The study involved 65 patients with lumbar disc hernias. Conservative treatment was carried out in 21 patients, while 44 patients underwent herniotomy. In the nonoperated patients, an MRI was taken both during the painful period, and shortly after pain remission. Hernial shrinkage was evaluated according to the decrease in the calculated volume, in addition to the decrease in hernial area, calculated by MRI. In the operated group, preoperative MRI enhancement, type of hernia, and invasion of granulation tissue in the histological specimens were studied. In the 21 nonoperated patients, the volume (mean +/- SD) was 0.488 +/- 208 cm(3) (range, 0.197-0.931 cm(3)) in the painful period and 0.214 +/- 0.181 cm(3) (range, 0.0-0.744 cm(3)) in the remission period. This decrease in volume was statistically significant. There was also a greater decrease in hernias exhibiting positive enhancement by MRI. In the operated patients, hernias that penetrated the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) had high rates of preoperative enhancement, and these hernias showed invasion of granulation tissue with marked neovascularization. Positive enhancement by MRI confirms an ongoing absorption process. Enhanced MRI can be a good method for the prediction of spontaneous absorption of lumbar disc hernias.
