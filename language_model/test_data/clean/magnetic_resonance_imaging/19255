Secondary meningeal localizations are uncommon and may disclose reactivation of a malignant disease. Most meningeal metastases occur in breast cancer, exceptionally in primary ovarian cancer.

We report 2 cases of secondary meningeal localizations of ovarian cancer. The diagnosis was clinical, supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis and computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.

Establishing the diagnosis of carcinomatous meningitis may be difficult. Clinical signs and biological data are not always conclusive. If spinal tap is contraindicated or negative, imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging is highly contributive in establishing the diagnosis of secondary localization. A precise evaluation of the invaded tissues is quite helpful in guiding therapeutic management based on chemotherapy, tumor resection or radiotherapy.
