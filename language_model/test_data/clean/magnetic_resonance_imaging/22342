The capability of the adult primate visual system for rapid and accurate recognition of targets in cluttered, natural scenes far surpasses the abilities of state-of-the-art artificial vision systems. Understanding this capability remains a fundamental challenge in visual neuroscience. Recent experimental evidence suggests that adaptive coding strategies facilitated by underlying neural plasticity enable the adult brain to learn from visual experience and shape its ability to integrate and recognize coherent visual objects.
