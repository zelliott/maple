In vivo 31Phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (31P MRSI) was performed on 18 chronic schizophrenic patients and 14 normal controls to determine if there was asymmetry of high-energy phosphorous metabolism in the temporal lobes of schizophrenic patients. Temporal lobe phosphorous metabolites were also correlated with severity of psychiatric symptomatology as assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Schizophrenics demonstrated significantly higher right relative to left temporal phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate (PCr/ATP), phosphocreatine/inorganic phosphate (PCr/Pi), and PCr as well as significantly lower right relative to left temporal ATP. There were no asymmetries of temporal lobe phosphorous metabolites in the control group. In addition, both left temporal PCr and the degree of asymmetry of temporal lobe PCr were highly correlated with the thinking disturbance subscale of the BPRS. This study provides further support for temporal lobe metabolic asymmetry in schizophrenia and its possible association with clinical symptoms.
