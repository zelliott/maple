Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset neuropsychiatric degenerative disorder that occurs predominantly in male FMR1 premutation carriers. Recently, a broader FXTAS spectrum that, besides the core features of tremor and gait ataxia, also includes neuropsychiatric symptoms and neuropathy as further clinically relevant symptoms has been described among females. Herein 2 fragile X syndrome families with a mother-daughter FXTAS transmission are described in detail in order to shed more light on the female FXTAS phenotype.

Molecular characterization included CGG repeat length, X-chromosome inactivation pattern determination, as well as FMR1 mRNA and FMRP levels quantification. Neuroradiologic examination was performed by 3-T MRI. Neuropsychological assessment included global cognitive, attention, and executive prefrontal functions, verbal fluencies, verbal memory, and visuospatial perception.

Molecular, neurologic, neuropsychiatric, psychological, cognitive, and neuroradiologic features description of 2 fragile X syndrome families with a mother-daughter FXTAS transmission in which dementia is present in both mothers.

Although it is not yet clear to what extent FXTAS shortens lifespan, our findings show that FXTAS progresses from mild tremor and/or ataxia to disabling motor and cognitive impairment, compromising the patients' quality of life. Furthermore, our results show that FXTAS in women can also develop as a multisystem neurodegenerative disorder with central and peripheral nervous system involvement, and both motor and mental disturbances.
