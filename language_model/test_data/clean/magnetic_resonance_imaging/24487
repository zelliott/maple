The objective of the study was to evaluate cortical development parameters by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in late-onset intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) fetuses and normally grown fetuses.

A total of 52 IUGR and 50 control fetuses were imaged using a 3T MRI scanner at 37 weeks of gestational age. T2 half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo anatomical acquisitions were obtained in 3 planes. Cortical sulcation (fissures depth corrected by biparietal diameter), brain volumetry, and asymmetry indices were assessed by means of manual delineation and compared between cases and controls.

Late-onset IUGR fetuses had significantly deeper measurements in the left insula (late-onset IUGR: 0.293 vs control: 0.267; P = .02) and right insula (0.379 vs 0.318; P < .01) and the left cingulate fissure (0.096 vs 0.087; P = .03) and significantly lower intracranial (441.25 cm(3) vs 515.82 cm(3); P < .01), brain (276.47 cm(3) vs 312.07 cm(3); P < .01), and left opercular volumes (2.52 cm(3) vs 3.02 cm(3); P < .01). IUGR fetuses showed significantly higher right insular asymmetry indices.

Late-onset IUGR fetuses had a different pattern of cortical development assessed by MRI, supporting the existence of in utero brain reorganization. Cortical development could be useful to define fetal brain imaging-phenotypes characteristic of IUGR.
