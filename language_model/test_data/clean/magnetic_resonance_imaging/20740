Thoracic disc herniations are commonly found in asymptomatic individuals, sometimes with genetic predisposition. Congenital fusions of cervical vertebrae occur in Klippel-Feil syndrome, which may be asymptomatic or cause compressive myelitis due to cervical instability or associated herniated discs. We report the case of a 72-year-old man with monophasic acute transverse myelitis probably caused by herpes simplex virus, coexistent with fused cervical vertebrae (C4-C5) and thoracic herniated discs. Establishment of the aetiology in cases of transverse acute myelitis can constitute a challenge in patients with cervical spine anomaly and disc herniations.
