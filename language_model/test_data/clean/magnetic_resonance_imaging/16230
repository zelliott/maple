Attention deficit disorder, eventually associated with hyperactivity (ADD +/- H), is nowadays viewed as a syndrome often of unknown etiology but probably not unique, with important genetic influence and associated environmental factors. The cognitive model proposing ADHD as a result of impaired inhibitory control which makes the child less flexible to changing circumstances suffers from poor sensibility and specificity. As studies aimed to make genotype-phenotype correlations were disappointing, recent genetic researches tend to correlate the genotype to an endophenotype defined from neuro-imaging data with encouraging preliminary results. Treatment with methylphenidate has long been considered as a first choice for disabling forms of ADHD, but recent data do not show evidence for superiority of methylphenidate compared to non pharmacological approach at long-term. Evaluation and treatment of each suspected case of ADHD need to be tailored with special concern for associated conditions as psycho-affective troubles or learning difficulties.
