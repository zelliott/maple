We report five of 38 patients with stiff person syndrome (SPS), who also had cerebellar disease, gait ataxia, dysarthria, and oculomotor dysfunction (SPS-Cer). Cerebellar manifestations either preceded SPS or occurred concurrently. Brain MRI was normal. The intrathecal production of glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies was elevated. Gamma-aminobutyric acid-enhancing drugs and immunotherapies improved only the stiffness. SPS-Cer is a distinct subset of SPS causing a more severe and complex clinical phenotype.
