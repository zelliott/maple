We previously reported that, on brain MRI, iNPH features were observed in approximately 1% of asymptomatic elderly community dwellers. This phenomenon is designated asymptomatic ventriculomegaly with features of iNPH on MRI (AVIM). The aim of the present study was to clarify whether a subclinical decline in the neuropsychological function is present in patients with AVIM.

We examined eight subjects with AVIM, six subjects with possible iNPH and 21 elderly controls. Neuropsychological tests were used, including the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), the Hasegawa dementia scale-revised (HDS-R), the frontal assessment battery (FAB), the trail making test A&B and semantic and letter verbal fluency tests.

When comparing the individuals with AVIM with the control subjects, significant differences were found in the scores achieved on the semantic verbal fluency tests and Luria's motor series (fist-edge-palm), a subtest of the FAB.

The present study suggests that individuals with AVIM demonstrate a slight subclinical decline in the cognitive function and motor regulation, which may represent a prodromal stage of iNPH.
