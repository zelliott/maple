To report a case of dacryocystitis that progressed to orbital abscess resulting in the rare complication of central retinal artery occlusion.

A patient without any other known health problems presented with dacryocystitis complicated by orbital cellulitis, orbital abscess, and finally central retinal artery occlusion despite medical treatment.

After 48 hours of medical treatment, there was no recovery, and there was loss of light perception; because of this, surgery indication was determined. Fundus fluorescein angiogram demonstrated findings of central retinal artery occlusion. There was no recovery of light perception after surgical intervention.

We report a case of orbital abscess following dacryocystitis in a healthy middle-aged woman resulting in the rare complication of central retinal artery occlusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of central retinal artery occlusion secondary to orbital abscess following dacryocystitis.
