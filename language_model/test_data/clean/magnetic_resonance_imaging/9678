Scaffold-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation is a clinically effective procedure for cartilage repair, but biomechanical evaluations are still missing.

This study was conducted to assess the clinical efficacy, including biomechanical analyses, of BioSeed-C treatment for traumatic and degenerative cartilage defects of the knee.

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

The authors evaluated the midterm clinical and biomechanical outcome of BioSeed-C, a cell-based fibrin-polymer graft for the treatment of cartilage defects. Clinical outcome at 4-year follow-up was assessed in 52 patients with full-thickness cartilage defects, International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) stage III and IV. Clinical scoring was performed preoperatively and 48 months after implantation using the Lysholm score, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, the ICRS score, the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and the Noyes score. Cartilage regeneration was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using the Henderson-Kreuz score. Biomechanical evaluation was performed by isokinetic strength measurements, comparing healthy and operated knee of each patient.

Clinical evaluation showed significant improvement in the Lysholm (from 51.8 preoperatively to 80.7 at 48 months postoperatively), IKDC (from 47.5 to 71.5), ICRS (from 3.8 to 2.0), KOOS (subcategory pain from 62 to 78, symptoms from 68 to 76, activities of daily living from 68 to 85, sports from 19 to 55, and quality of life from 30 to 55), and Noyes (from 31 to 59) scores (P â‰¤ .001) 48 months after implantation of BioSeed-C compared with the preoperative situation. The MRI evaluations showed moderate to complete defect filling in 43 of 44 treated patients. Two patients without improvement in the clinical and MRI scores received a total knee endoprosthesis after 4 years. Isokinetic evaluation showed significantly reduced maximum strength capacities for knee flexion and extension at the operated knee compared with the healthy knee (P < .05).

The clinical outcomes 4 years after graft implantation are good despite a persisting strength deficit. Implanting BioSeed-C is a promising treatment option for cartilage defects of the knee. More emphasis should be put on the rehabilitation of muscular strength.
