Kasabach-Merritt syndrome is a life-threatening congenital disorder characterized by an enlarging hemangioma, thrombocytopenia, and consumption coagulopathy. We report the case of a one-month male infant who presented with a large cutaneous tumor in his right axilla with ecchymosis, thrombocytopenia, and chronic consumption coagulopathy. Three-dimensional computed tomography was useful for accurate diagnosis of the cutaneous tumor and for determining the precise vascular constitution of the hemangioma, suggesting the efficacy of this method for diagnosing Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. Although administration of a corticosteroid was not effective, additional administration of vincristine resulted in the reversal of thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy with reduction of the hemangioma.
