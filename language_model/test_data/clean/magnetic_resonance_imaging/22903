To retrospectively and quantitatively analyze the acromial undersurface in three dimensions and to determine its association with impingement syndrome and rotator cuff tears.

Institutional review board approval was received with exemption of informed consent for this retrospective HIPAA-compliant study. Magnetic resonance images were evaluated in 84 patients (63 males, 21 females; mean age, 42.6 years; age range, 15-74 years). On the basis of surgical results, patients were separated into three groups: those without shoulder impingement or rotator cuff tears (31 patients), those with shoulder impingement (22 patients), and those with rotator cuff tears (31 patients). To quantitate the acromial undersurface, the structure was manually plotted, and a mathematic model was created by using splines. The undersurface was divided into a 20 x 20 grid. For each patient, a shape index (SI) data set and local undersurface angulation (LUA) data set were determined. Regression analyses were used to identify differences between groups, and prediction models were constructed on the basis of correspondent areas.

Analysis of both data sets yielded no apparent progression between groups and demonstrated a lack of similarity between the impingement and rotator cuff tear groups. Discrimination between groups could be demonstrated by dividing the lateral portion of the acromial undersurface into contiguous blocks. The highest overall diagnostic accuracy of our prediction models was 58.3% (49 of 84) by using 10 blocks of the SI data set and 73.8% (62 of 84) by using five blocks of the LUA data set.

Three-dimensional modeling yields objective data about the acromial undersurface. On the basis of this method, osseous impingement by the acromion is not a primary cause of shoulder impingement syndrome or rotator cuff tears.
