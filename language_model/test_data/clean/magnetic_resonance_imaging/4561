Primary T-cell lymphoma in the central nervous system has rarely been described in the literature. We report 2 such cases in immunocompetent patients. The first presented with subacute encephalopathy affecting both memory and speech. A CT-scan of the head showed a contrast-enhanced mass around the third ventricle. The second presented with 2 partial seizures with secondary generalization; the CT-scan in this case showed a right temporal lesion. Both underwent surgery for total removal of the masses followed by cranial irradiation. Tissue examination confirmed the diagnosis. The first patient died 14 months after diagnosis. In the second case lymphoma recurred 8 months after surgery.
