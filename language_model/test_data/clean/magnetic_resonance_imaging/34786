To present four cases of life-threatening intracranial complications associated with temporal bone osteoradionecrosis.

This study was a retrospective case review of four patients combined with a literature review.

All patients were treated at Loyola University Medical Center, which is a tertiary care facility.

The four patients were retrospectively reviewed without demographic constraints.

All patients underwent preoperative radiographic assessment (magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography scan), and three of the four patients underwent surgery.

The role of surgical intervention in the management of advanced temporal bone osteoradionecrosis.

Three patients underwent mastoid surgery after medical treatment of intracranial complications associated with temporal bone osteoradionecrosis. All three patients had dry, epithelialized mastoid cavities. One patient died as a result of meningitis.

Mastoid surgery should be used in the overall management of patients with advanced temporal bone osteoradionecrosis to prevent secondary intracranial complications.
