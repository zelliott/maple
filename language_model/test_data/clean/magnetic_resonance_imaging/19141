Malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT), described for the first time in 1978 in the kidney, has rarely been reported in other organs including the brain and has involved adults in only 3 cases. We described a case of MRT in a 32-year-old woman who presented with severe headache, nausea and sudden onset of visual disturbance. MRI showed a well-enhanced mass at the suprasellar region. Subtotal removal of the tumor was performed. However, tumor regrowth occurred after the operation (doubling time, 8.36 days) and spinal dissemination was detected. Therefore, chemotherapy and radiotherapy were administered focusing on the suprasellar lesion and the spinal cord. Pathologically, light micrographs showed rhabdoid cells with large, round, single or double nuclei with one prominent nucleolus and eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions. Electron micrographs were made of typical rhabdoid cells displaying bundles of intermediate filaments within the perikaryon. In immunohistochemical studies, EMA, vimentin, cytokeratin and SMA were positive. Pathological findings were consistent with those of MRT. Optimal treatment for this tumor has not been established. Our case may be useful in defining treatment for MRT.
