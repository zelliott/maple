An inductively coupled implanted coil was designed for high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) studies of rat spinal cord (SC) in vivo at 7 T. The practical issues involved in implementation of the coil at high fields are discussed, and the adjustment of various parameters for optimizing coil performance are described. The utility of the coil was demonstrated with anatomical, magnetization transfer, diffusion tensor imaging, and proton MR spectroscopy (MRS).
