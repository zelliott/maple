The value of gadolinium-enhanced MRI in 30 patients with intraocular lesions has been evaluated. Seventeen patients had a uveal melanoma, two a ciliary body melanoma, three had uveal metastases, one lymphoma, four had senile macula degenerations, and three uveal nevi. Twelve of 17 patients with melanoma were followed up by MRI after ruthenium plaque therapy on 2-4 occasions. Melanomas showed high precontrast signal intensities and only a slight enhancement after intravenous Gd-DTPA was given. After ruthenium plaque therapy precontrast signal intensities (SI) decreased while a moderate signal increase on postcontrast scans was noted. Scars or tumor residues were better delineated on enhanced images. All other tumors than melanotic melanomas showed low SI on precontrast scans and a high signal increase after Gd-DTPA administration. Small amelanotic tumors were better delineated on postcontrast scans. In addition Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI allowed differentiation between tumor and hemorrhage. No signal increase after Gd-DTPA application was seen in subretinal or vitreous hemorrhages of varying ages.
