Liposome encapsulation of active principles enhances their bioavailability to the brain. We investigated whether encapsulation of citicoline in liposomes increases its therapeutic effects in ischemia, performing a longitudinal MRI study of lesion volumes and edema in an animal model of stroke. Nineteen rats were submitted to permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and treated with: (1) saline, (2) intraperitoneal citicoline (500mg/kg), (3) intravenous citicoline (48mg/kg), and (4) intravenous liposome-encapsulated citicoline (48mg/kg). Lesion volumes were measured by MRI at days 0, 1, 3 and 7 following surgery. Encapsulation in liposomes increased the therapeutic effects of citicoline, as reflected by a 32% reduction of the infarct sizes at day 7, in contrast with controls where infarct sizes at day 7 increased by 39%, respect to values at day 0. Intravenously injected citicoline reduced infarct sizes by 9% while intraperitoneal citicoline resulted in an increase of infarct sizes by 10%. A slight (not significant) reduction of edema formation was observed for animals treated with citicoline, in all of its delivery forms. Liposome-encapsulated citicoline causes a noticeable reduction in lesion volumes as compared to free citicoline (either i.p. or i.v.) at days 1, 3 and 7 following permanent stroke.
