Methods based on the analysis of metabolic and volumetric interregional correlations have been used in neuroimaging research, yet metabolic and volumetric interregional correlations for identical regions of interest have never been compared in the same group of subjects. Magnetic resonance and [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography brain images were acquired in 59 healthy subject. Correlation matrices for relative glucose metabolic rates during a verbal learning task and for relative gray matter volumes were compiled between the manually traced mediodorsal, centromedian, and pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus and 39 cortical Brodmann's areas. Metabolic correlations between the cortex and these thalamic nuclei followed the known patterns of anatomical connectivity in non-human primates. Intercorrelations of the mediodorsal nucleus were widespread with the prefrontal cortex (9 out of 10 Brodmann's areas in the left hemisphere) and temporal lobe (10 out of 11 Brodmann's areas in the left hemisphere) while the pulvinar correlated only with the parietal and occipital cortical areas. Different correlation patterns were observed for the regional gray matter volumes whereby only the pulvinar yielded extensive cortical intercorrelations, primarily with the occipital, parietal, anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal areas in the right hemisphere. Metabolic thalamocortical correlations were much more extensive for the mediodorsal and centromedian nuclei whereas structural correlations were more extensive for the pulvinar. Therefore, metabolic and volumetric correlational methods are sensitive to different aspects of interregional relations in the brain and their comparison in the same group of subjects may render complementary and only partially overlapping connectivity information.
