In this article, we report a case of talus Brodie abscess with tenosynovitis of posterior tibialis and long flexor tendons of the foot. We describe the radiologic and diagnostic features of this osteomyelitis and outline its management and prognosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a case with this unusual presentation.
