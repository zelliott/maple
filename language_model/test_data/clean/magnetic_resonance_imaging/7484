Age is one of the most important prognostic factors in glioblastoma patients, but no standard treatment has been established for elderly patients with this condition. We therefore conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate treatment regimens and outcomes in elderly glioblastoma patients. The study population consisted of 79 glioblastoma patients aged ≥ 76 years (median age 78.0 years; 34 men and 45 women). The median preoperative Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score was 60. Surgical procedures were classified as biopsy (31 patients, 39.2 %), <95 % resection of the tumor (21 patients, 26.9 %), and ≥ 95 % resection of the tumor (26 patients, 33.3 %). Sixty-seven patients (81.0 %) received radiotherapy and 45 patients (57.0 %) received chemotherapy. The median overall progression-free survival time was 6.8 months, and the median overall survival time was 9.8 months. Patients aged ≥ 78 years were significantly less likely to receive radiotherapy (p = 0.004). Patients with a postoperative KPS score of ≥ 60 were significantly more likely to receive maintenance chemotherapy (p = 0.008). Multivariate analyses identified two independent prognostic factors: postoperative KPS score ≥ 60 (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.531, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.315-0.894, p = 0.017) and temozolomide therapy (HR = 0.442, 95 % CI 0.25-0.784, p < 0.001).The findings of this study suggest that postoperative KPS score is an important prognostic factor for glioblastoma patients aged ≥ 76 years, and that these patients may benefit from temozolomide therapy.
