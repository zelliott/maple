Although patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), their pathologies could be heterogeneous. We aimed to evaluate structural changes in amyloid-negative and amyloid-positive aMCI patients. Forty-eight aMCI patients who underwent Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography were recruited. They were classified as PiB (-) aMCI (N = 16) and PiB (+) (N = 32). Hippocampal shape and regional cortical thickness were compared with 41 subjects with normal cognition (NC). Relative to NC, PiB(-) aMCI exhibited hippocampal deformity in the right cornu ammonis 1, whereas PiB(+) aMCI exhibited hippocampal deformity in bilateral subiculum and cornu ammonis 1 subregions. Relative to NC, PiB(-) aMCI showed cortical thinning in the left medial prefrontal and right anterior temporal regions, whereas PiB(+) aMCI exhibited cortical thinning in bilateral medial temporal regions, temporoparietal junctions and precuneus, and prefrontal cortices. Our findings suggest that structural changes in PiB(-) aMCI might be due to several possible pathologic changes, whereas structural changes in PiB(+) aMCI reflect AD-like structural changes.
