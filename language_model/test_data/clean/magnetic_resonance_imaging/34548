A 23-year-old woman presented with headache and progressive lethargy. The diagnosis of isolated thrombosis of the straight sinus and of the deep cerebral venous system was established using cranial computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, phase-contrast magnetic resonance venography, and cerebral angiography. Because of the rapid deterioration in the patient's clinical condition, the authors used direct transcatheter infusion of urokinase into the straight sinus. This treatment resulted in a successful outcome.
