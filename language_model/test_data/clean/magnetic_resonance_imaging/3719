Blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI has contributions from venous oxygenation and venous cerebral blood volume (CBV) changes. To examine the relative contribution of venous CBV change (ΔCBV(v)) to BOLD fMRI, BOLD and arterial CBV changes (ΔCBV(a)) to a 40-s forepaw stimulation in six α-chloralose anesthetized rats were measured using a magnetization transfer-varied fMRI technique, while total CBV change (ΔCBV(t)) was measured with injection of iron oxide nanoparticles. ΔCBV(v) was obtained by subtracting ΔCBV(a) from ΔCBV(t). We observed a fast ΔCBV(a) response with a time constant of 2.9 ± 2.3s and a slower ΔCBV(v) response with a time constant of 13.5 ± 5.7s and an onset delay of 6.1 ± 3.3s. These results are consistent with earlier studies under different anesthesia and stimulus, supporting that fast CBV(a) and slow CBV(v) responses are generalizable. Assuming the observed post-stimulus BOLD undershoot is at least partly explained by the ΔCBV(v) contribution, the relative contribution of the ΔCBV(v)- and oxygenation-change-related components to the BOLD response was estimated. The relative ΔCBV(v) contribution increases with time during stimulation; whereby it is <0.14 during initial 10s and reaches a maximum possible value of ~0.45 relative to the oxygenation contribution during the 30-40s period after stimulus onset. Our data indicates that the contribution of venous oxygenation change to BOLD fMRI is dominant for short stimulations.
