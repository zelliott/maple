MRI plays an increasing role in small bowel imaging of Crohn's disease. MR enterography (MRE) without nasojejunal intubation and radiation exposure offers similar results compared to MR enteroclysis (with intubation) and should be therefore the preferred method. Sensitivity and specificity is comparable to that of CT enterography. Capsule endoscopy is obviously superior to MRE in detecting superficial lesions, but this is limited to the mucosa and stenosis has to be excluded before examination using imaging, like MRE. There are no convincing studies in the literature regarding assessment of disease activity with imaging. Moreover, there is no consensus in the literature about a suitable reference standard.
