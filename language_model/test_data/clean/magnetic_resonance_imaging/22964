Density functional theory calculations of isolated Watson-Crick A:U and A:T base pairs predict that adenine 13C2 trans-hydrogen bond deuterium isotope shifts due to isotopic substitution at the pyrimidine H3, (2h)Delta13C2, are sensitive to the hydrogen-bond distance between the N1 of adenine and the N3 of uracil or thymine, which supports the notion that (2h)Delta13C2 is sensitive to hydrogen-bond strength. Calculated (2h)Delta13C2 values at a given N1-N3 distance are the same for isolated A:U and A:T base pairs. Replacing uridine residues in RNA with 5-methyl uridine and substituting deoxythymidines in DNA with deoxyuridines do not statistically shift empirical (2h)Delta13C2 values. Thus, we show experimentally and computationally that the C7 methyl group of thymine has no measurable affect on (2h)Delta13C2 values. Furthermore, (2h)Delta13C2 values of modified and unmodified RNA are more negative than those of modified and unmodified DNA, which supports our hypothesis that RNA hydrogen bonds are stronger than those of DNA. It is also shown here that (2h)Delta13C2 is context dependent and that this dependence is similar for RNA and DNA.
