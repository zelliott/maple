Goose flesh and cold shiver can be ictal signs of visceral epilepsies. These visceral epilepsies may occur with isolated ictal signs during a simple partial seizure or in combination with other autonomic signs or in complex partial seizures. Because of the unusual features of the ictal symptomatology, these visceral epilepsies often are masked and wrongly diagnosed as nonepileptic events, e.g., somatoform disorders. Five cases are reported with case history, neurological findings, and results of electroencephalography, MEG, and imaging. Interestingly, patients did not suffer from tumoral epilepsies and the epileptic focus was lateralized to the left (dominant) temporal lobe.
