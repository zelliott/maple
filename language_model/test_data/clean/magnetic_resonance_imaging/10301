Single case reports have described movement disorders including parkinsonism, dystonia and chorea, but not corticobasal syndrome as a consequence of central pontine and extrapontine myelinolysis. We report a case of a 61-year-old woman who developed progressive asymmetric parkinsonism with ideomotor apraxia and cortical sensory deficits following central pontine myelinolysis.
