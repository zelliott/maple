The ability to set a straight line to the perceived gravitational vertical (subjective visual vertical, SVV) was investigated in a 21 year old woman with long standing left hemihypaesthesia due to a posterior thalamic infarct. The putative structures involved were the somatosensory and vestibular thalamus (VPL, VPM) and associative (pulvinar) thalamus. The SVV was normal when seated upright. When lying on her right side, line settings deviated about 17 degrees to the right, which is the normal A-effect. When lying on the hypaesthetic side the mean SVV remained close to true vertical-that is, the A-effect was absent, and there was a large increase in variability of the SVV settings. The findings support the view that the body tilt-induced bias of the SVV (A-effect) is largely mediated by somatosensory afferents. The finding that the A-effect was absent only when lying on the hypaesthetic side suggests that, during body tilt, the somatosensory system participates in visuogravitational orientation.
