Transient osteoporosis of the hip is considered by some to be an early stage of avascular necrosis. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) therapy, which may be of benefit in the treatment of avascular necrosis, might therefore be used in the treatment of transient osteoporosis of the hip. We present a case of transient osteoporosis associated with elevated levels of homocysteine in a 33-year-old white male, who was treated by HBO2. Treatment was administered at 2.5 ATA for 90 minutes once daily, five days per week. Regular follow-up examinations in the course of the HBO2 therapy revealed improvement in the patient's complaints and the findings of the physical examination. Repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed after 40 and 90 sessions showed decreased edema and complete resolution of the edema, respectively. Evaluation 6 months after the completion of treatment revealed complete resolution of symptoms, with a normal physical examination.
