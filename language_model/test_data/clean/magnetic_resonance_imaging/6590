The RARE imaging method was used to monitor the cooking of single rice kernels in real time and with high spatial resolution in three dimensions. The imaging sequence is optimized for rapid acquisition of signals with short relaxation times using centered out RARE. Short scan time and high spatial resolution are critical factors in the investigation of the cooking behavior of rice kernels since time and spatial averaging may lead to erroneous results. The results are confirming the general pattern of moisture ingress that has been suspected from previous (more limited) studies. Water uptake as determined by analysis of the MRI time series recorded during cooking compares well with gravimetric studies. This allows using these real-time MRI data for developing and validating models that describe the effect of kernel microstructure on its cooking behavior.
