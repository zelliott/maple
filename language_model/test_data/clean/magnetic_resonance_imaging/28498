Despite the increasing number of patients affected by neuronal migration disorders (NMDs) recently diagnosed in vivo by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), few detailed data on the correlation between the neuroradiological and the anatomical features in the single NMD case are available. The present paper reports a combined cytoarchitectural and immunocytochemical analysis, by means of antisera recognizing specific neuronal and glial markers, of three MRI diagnosed NMD patients surgically treated for the relief of intractable seizures. The first case was a giant subcortical nodular heterotopia of morphologically normal neurons lacking any type of cortical lamination. The second case was a layered polymicrogyria with an abnormal amount of ectopic neurons in the underlying white matter. The third case was a focal cortical dysplasia characterized by a dramatic disruption of the normal cortical layering associated with marked cytological abnormalities. The present data demonstrate that the macroscopical and microscopical brain abnormalities can be markedly different in different NMD subtypes, and suggest that different anatomical substrates can underlie the intrinsic hyperexcitability of these brain malformations. The relevance of further prospective clinico-morphological studies for a better understanding of the mechanisms determining the development of these brain malformations is underlined.
