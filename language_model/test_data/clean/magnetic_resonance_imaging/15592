Pyogenic myositis (pyomyositis) represents a bacterial infection of muscle, usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus that is endemic in tropical regions. Pyomyositis commonly affects patients who are immunocompromised or who have underlying chronic disorders. Lower extremity localization of infection is typical. The most common pattern of disease, however, appears to be a solitary abscess in the quadriceps musculature. Delay in accurate diagnosis is frequent and clinical deterioration can be precipitous. In view of the high associated morbidity, early imaging to detect, localize, and define disease extent is important. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a key role in the definitive diagnosis of pyomyositis. This article provides a pictorial illustration of the spectrum of MRI findings associated with pyogenic myositis.
