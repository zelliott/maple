Perivascular spaces of the brain, also known as Virchow-Robin spaces (VRS), are of immunological and neuropathological relevance and can be observed in magnetic resonance images (MRI). Their histopathological significance in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) has been reported. Aim of this study was to elucidate the prognostic or diagnostic value of VRS on MRI of the brain in the evaluation of onset or severity of the clinical course in ALD.

Clinical data and MRI from 35 patients with the cerebral form of X-ALD, 29 with the asymptomatic form (including those with adrenal insufficiency), and 36 control patients were studied retrospectively.

VRS could be visualised by MRI in 87% of patients with asymptomatic ALD, in 80% of control patients, and in 47% of patients with cerebral ALD. None of them were found to be dilated. The number of visible VRS correlated negatively with the degree of demyelination both in patients with the cerebral and the asymptomatic form. Furthermore, in the group of patients with cerebral ALD the number of visible VRS correlated positively with a milder course of the disease.

VRS on MRI of patients with ALD seem to reflect the perivascular inflammatory component of this disease. It is possible to speculate that the appearance or a higher number of visible VRS in ALD is associated with an earlier stage of the disease, or even a more benign clinical course.
