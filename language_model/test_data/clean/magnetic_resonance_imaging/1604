The goal of the current study was to analyze the oncologic results and wound complications in patients with soft tissue sarcomas treated with preoperative radiation therapy and en bloc resection. A standard protocol of preoperative radiotherapy was administered followed by en bloc resection in 209 patients. The protocol included needle or incisional biopsy, prospective staging, a consistent dose of radiotherapy, standardized prospective evaluation of surgical margins, and long-term followup. The target radiotherapy dose was 50.4 cGy. Twenty-nine patients had low-grade lesions, and 180 had high-grade lesions. The mean followup was 55 months. The significant wound complication rate was 22% (moderate 14%, major 7%, and amputation 1%). Wound complications were significantly higher in patients with lower extremity lesions when compared with patients with upper extremity or axial lesions, and in patients with lesions larger than 5 cm. The local recurrence rate was 11% in patients who did not have prior surgery, and 37% in patients who had prior surgery at an outside institution (17% overall). Local recurrence was increased significantly in patients who had prior surgery. At latest followup, 78 patients (47%) were continuously disease-free, six (4%) were alive with no evidence of disease, nine (5%) were alive with disease, 63 (38%) died of disease, and 11 (7%) died of another cause. The 2- and 5-year disease-specific survival rates were 77% and 67%, respectively. Overall survival was 56%. A significant decrease in survival was seen in patients who had a local recurrence, and in patients with high-grade lesions. Preoperative radiotherapy can be given safely with a wound complication rate not significantly higher than that reported for other forms of radiotherapy delivery. Local recurrence tends to be higher if surgical intervention is done before tertiary center referral. Distant disease continues to be the cause of the high mortality in these patients.
