We report a case of myxopapillary ependymoma presenting as a primary tumor of the subcutaneous tissue in the sacrococcygeal region. The mass was large, well-encapsulated, lobulated, and multiseptated, with varying signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted MR images caused by hemorrhagic necrosis, blood degradation products, and calcification. Only a small viable portion enhanced after administration of contrast material. Multiple lobules formed from fibrous septa and dystrophic calcification also characterize this tumor.
