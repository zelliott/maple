Hemophilia leads to recurrent bleeding episodes in joints resulting in a severe destructive arthropathy in many cases. Staging of hemophilic joint disease is important for identifying the site of bleeding and planning appropriate therapy. However, classification systems based on plain X-ray findings have been insensitive at detecting the earlier, possibly reversible, changes of synovial hyperplasia. They may also underestimate the severity of cartilage damage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to more accurately assess a hemophilic joint. Tentative hemophilic arthropathy scales based on MRI findings are being developed. Hopefully, use of these scales will result in more consistent assessment of hemophilic joints and facilitate development of more targeted treatment and thus prevent or delay the later, destructive changes in the articular cartilage and bone.
