A retrospective analysis of clinical-radial examination was made in 1946 patients with polytrauma. In 82% of them severe cranio-cerebral traumas and extracranial injuries were revealed. The diagnosis of fractures of the skull bones on the basis of survey radiography was possible but in 2% of the patients. Cranio-cerebral and craniofacial traumas appeared much more often than injuries of other anatomical areas, reaching 79.4%. Spiral computed tomography was the main method of early diagnosing polytrauma which allowed detecting the character, localization and volume of traumatic injuries of the skull bones, facial skeleton and brain in shorter terms. The information value of the method was 97%.
