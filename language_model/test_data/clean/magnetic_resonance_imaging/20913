Tuberculosis is widely prevalent among children in India, especially in those with coexisting severe malnutrition and immunodeficiency. Uncommon sites for tuberculosis are frequently seen. However, intracardiac tuberculomas are extremely rare in children. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of multiple asymptomatic intracardiac tuberculomas in a child. Most intracardiac tuberculomas cause symptoms, especially in adults. In asymptomatic children non surgical management of intracardiac tuberculomas appears to be a safe treatment option as complete resolution occurs with antituberculous therapy.
