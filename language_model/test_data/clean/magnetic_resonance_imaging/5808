Collision tumor means the coexistence of two adjacent, but histologically distinct tumors without histologic admixture in the same tissue or organ. Collision tumors involving ovaries are extremely rare.

We present a case of 45-year-old parous woman with a left dermoid cyst, with unusual imaging findings, massive ascites and peritoneal carcinomatosis. The patient underwent cytoreductive surgery. The histopathology revealed a collision tumor consisting of an invasive serous cystadenocarcinoma and a dermoid cyst.
