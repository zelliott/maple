The extracellular matrix of any tissue, including hyaline cartilage, has a structure that allows it to meet the physical demands placed upon that tissue. Accordingly, the structure of hyaline cartilage is not uniform. There is considerable variation from one joint to the next and even within a particular joint surface, probably reflecting a joint-specific architecture. This structure has a strong influence on T(2) relaxation. The relationship between T2 and matrix curvature relative to the main magnetic field (B(0)) provides tissue contrast. Images obtained with adequate resolution can exploit this contrast and demonstrate the structure of cartilage. Magnetic resonance imaging is thus capable of providing a detailed description of the structure of joint surfaces, information that is difficult to obtain even with histologic techniques.
