We report the anaesthetic management of an abdominal pregnancy. The delivery was obtained by laparotomy, under general anaesthesia, by a multi-specialist team. Abdominal pregnancy carries a high foetal and maternal risk for morbidity and lethal outcome. The main complication is sudden haemorrhage which can occur at any time.
