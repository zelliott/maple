MR images of 48 patients with histologically confirmed benign and malignant diseases of the pleura were retrospectively compared with CT and bioptically/surgically obtained findings. In 47/48 patients pathological changes of the pleura were visualized by increased signal intensities on T2-weighted and contrast enhanced T1-weighted MR images. This lead to a slightly improved sensitivity compared to CT, where pathological pleura findings were confirmed in 45/48 patients. MRI was able to identify 24/28 confirmed pleural effusions, whereas CT was successful in 26/28 patients. In two cases effusions not identified on CT were visible on T2-weighted MRI. 4 pleural effusions were missed with MRI.. On CT images differentiation of pleural changes vs effusions or adjacent lesions of lung parenchyma was successful in 20/28 and in 17/23 cases, respectively. Contrast enhanced T1-weighted images achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy with 22/28 and 20/23 cases, respectively. Signal intensities on MRI were unsuitable as sole criterion for the differentiation of benign and malignant diseases of the pleura. Contour and pattern of spreading of pleural changes were helpful in differential diagnosis. Nodular changes, thickening of more than 10 mm and mediastinal, circumferential and entire hemithoracic affection of the pleura were suggestive for malignant pleural disease. Infiltration of the diaphragm and the chest wall were most indicative for malignancy; here MRI (2/2 resp. 18/19 cases) was superior to CT (0/2 resp. 14/19 cases). CT was superior in the detection of pleural calcifications and osseous destruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
