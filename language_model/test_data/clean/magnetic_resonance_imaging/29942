To evaluate the value of MRI in preoperative staging of rectal cancer.

The data of 156 rectal cancer patients,undergone MRI scans from December 2004 to June 2006 in our hospital, were analyzed retrospectively. Findings of MRI were compared with postoperative pathological examinations.

Intracavitary localized parenchyma tumors were seen in 72 cases, and intestinal wall abnormal incrassation or stricture in other 84 cases from MRI scan. Sixteen cases had rectal polyps simultaneously, 2 cases ovarian cysts, 13 cases anterior-sacral metastases and 2 cases bone metastases. The sensitivity and specificity of T(1-2), T(3) and T(4) rectal cancer by MRI examination were 25%(8/32), 93.3%(84/90), 94.1%(32/34) and 100%(124/124), 57.6%(38/66), 96.7%(118/122) respectively. In MRI imaging, metastatic para-rectal lymph node was diagnosed as the diameter >5 mm or abnormal border or mixed resonance, with a sensitivity of 85.1%(80/94) and specificity of 45.2%(28/62).

MRI has high accuracy for preoperative staging of rectal cancer, and is useful to detect the serosal infiltration and lymph node metastasis.
