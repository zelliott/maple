Spinal strokes are often localised in the anterior spinal artery territory, whereas an involvement of the posterior spinal arteries (PSA) is uncommon, and usually unilateral. Bilateral PSA stroke is exceptional. A 70-year-old woman, after a mild head trauma, presented with cervical pain, left hypoaesthesia and sensitive ataxia, which then extended to the right hemibody, including face. A Doppler ultrasound showed an only systolic flow signal in the left vertebral artery (VA). MR showed a bilateral infarction extending from the posterior medulla oblongata to C4 and a left hypoplasic VA with lack of visualisation of the V3 segment. This case was peculiar, implying a bilateral stroke in the PSA territory, possibly related to a left VA dissection, and in the presence of a dominant PSA, originating from the hypoplasic VA and of hyposupply of posterior radiculomedullary arteries and anastomoses.
