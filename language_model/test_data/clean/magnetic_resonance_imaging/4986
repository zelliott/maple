Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is ideally suited to imaging the patient with painful hip arthroplasty due to its superior soft tissue contrast, multiplanar capabilities, and lack of ionizing radiation. MRI is the most accurate imaging modality in the assessment of periprosthetic osteolysis and wear-induced synovitis, and can also assess regional tendons and neurovascular structures. This article discusses the technical aspects of MRI around metallic implants as well as the appearance of potential complications following hip arthroplasty, including osteolysis, wear-induced synovitis, infection, hemarthrosis, fracture, loosening, component displacement, heterotopic ossification, tendinopathy, and neurovascular impingement. The specific complication of metal hypersensitivity following metal-on-metal prostheses is reviewed.
