The diagnosis of germ-cell tumour is based on the histological examination of the inguinal orchiectomy specimen. The histological classification allows discriminating seminoma and non seminomatous tumours. Non seminomatous tumours are heterogeneous, different sub-groups are described: embryonal carcinoma, teratoma, choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumours, but components are often mixed. Serum tumour markers, human chorionic gonadotropin hormone and alpha-foetoprotein, are important as well in the initial diagnosis, the prognosis, and follow-up of the disease. The staging procedure is strict and the prognostic factors allow defining the optimal treatment according to well established guidelines. Complete information of the patient is mandatory. All consequences of the disease and treatment must be managed, the most important being sperm conservation.
