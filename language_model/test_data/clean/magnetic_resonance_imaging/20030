Functional MRI (fMRI) has had a major impact in cognitive neuroscience. fMRI now has a small but growing role in clinical neuroimaging, with initial applications to neurosurgical planning. Current clinical research has emphasized novel concepts for clinicians, such as the role of plasticity in recovery and the maintenance of brain functions in a broad range of diseases. There is a wider potential for clinical fMRI in applications ranging from presymptomatic diagnosis, through drug development and individualization of therapies, to understanding functional brain disorders. Realization of this potential will require changes in the way clinical neuroimaging services are planned and delivered.
