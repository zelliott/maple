A 56-year-old Connecticut woman suffered multiple strokes 18 months after antibiotic treatment for early Lyme disease with facial palsy. Pleocytosis, intrathecal synthesis of anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibody, and the response to antibiotic treatment substantiated the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis. This is the first report of stroke caused by Lyme disease acquired in North America.
