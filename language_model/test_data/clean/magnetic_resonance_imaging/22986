The management of the postoperative shoulder has improved, in part because of advances in imaging techniques. As disability and pain may occur or persist after shoulder surgery, it is imperative that clinicians have a detailed anatomic delineation before further treatment. Variations in surgical techniques, surgical distortion of native anatomy, and metallic artifacts decrease the accuracy of postoperative imaging. Pitfalls may be avoided with knowledge of postoperative alterations of the rotator cuff, labrum and capsule.
