3-Methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGCA) type IV is defined as a heterogeneous group of inborn errors featuring in common 3-MGCA and associated with primary mitochondrial dysfunction leading to a spectrum of multisystem conditions. We studied four patients who presented at birth with a clinical picture simulating a primary mitochondrial hepatic disorder consistent with the MEGDEL syndrome including 3-MGCA, sensorineural deafness, encephalopathy and a brain magnetic resonance imaging with signs of Leigh disease. All affected children displayed biochemical features consistent with mitochondrial OXPHOS dysfunction including hepatic mitochondrial DNA depletion in one patient. Homozygosity mapping identified a candidate locus on 6q25.2-6q26. Using whole exome sequencing, we identified two novel homozygous mutations in SERAC1 recently reported to harbor mutations in MEGDEL syndrome. Both mutations were found to lead to decreased or absent expression of SERAC1. The present findings indicate that infantile hepatopathy is a cardinal feature of MEGDEL syndrome. We thus propose to rename the disease MEGDHEL syndrome.
