The aim of this study was to describe the normal pattern of development and maturation of the foetal brain with respect to gestational age as assessed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to provide an overview of the possibilities of the technique.

Foetal cerebral MRI was performed on 56 pregnant women between 19 and 37 weeks of gestation. Half-Fourier single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE), true fast imaging with steady precession (FISP), T1-weighted fast low angle shot (FLASH) two-dimensional (2D) and diffusion-weighted (DW) sequences with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were obtained. Biometric parameters and developmental areas of the cerebral cortex were correlated to gestational age by using the Spearman rank correlation test.

We found a negative correlation between the germinal matrix/biparietal diameter ratio and gestational age and a positive correlation between the germinal and cortical matrix when expressed as external intraocular diameter ratio (R=0.452, p=0.02). The cortical mantle was correlated with biometric parameters, such as the biparietal diameter and the frontooccipital diameter, and with gestational age. The interhemispheric fissure, the parietooccipital fissure and the sylvian fissure were detectable by the 22nd week. In the grey matter, the mean ADC values varied from 1.76 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (at week 19) to 0.89 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (at week 37), whereas in the white matter, the values varied from 2.03 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (at week 19) to 1.25 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (at week 37).

MRI provides a reliable valuation of brain maturation during pregnancy.
