The case of a patient with a lesion in the right breast, is discussed. Retrospective evaluation of mammography and US previously performed elsewhere were not fully helpful in the differential diagnosis between benign and malignant and MRI was necessary. Morphological and dynamic characteristics could be indicative of an expansive/infiltrating lesion of the breast and support the staging. The histological examination established the diagnosis of primary breast lymphoma.
