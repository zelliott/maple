Recently, the rate of severe, invasive community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infection has been increasing in healthy children. The single most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis in children is group A Streptococcus. Empiric therapy is usually targeted at this organism, which is uniformly sensitive to penicillin. Necrotizing fasciitis caused by CA-MRSA is a potentially life-threatening infection that has not been extensively reported in the U.S. pediatric population. The limited literature includes reports of neonatal cases and reports of pediatric cases embedded in articles about adults with underlying risk factors. We present a case of CA-MRSA necrotizing fasciitis in a previously healthy 11-year-old male with no risk factors.
