HIV-associated salivary gland disease (HIV-SGD) includes lymphoepithelial lesions and cysts involving the salivary gland tissue and/or intraglandular lymph nodes, and Sj√∂gren-like conditions. Three cases of salivary gland disease occurring in HIV-infected patients are reported. Histopathological examination showed squamous epithelium-lined cysts. In the walls of the cysts lymphoid tissue, epitheloid granulomas and giant cells were found. The clinical and histopathological criteria as well as magnetic resonance imaging and therapy are discussed.
