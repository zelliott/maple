Nuclear magnetic resonance is a non-destructive and non-invasive technology that is highly suited for research in psychiatry. It is establishing itself as a versatile means of studying brain morphology, chemistry and function and is finding a place in the diagnosis of disease, monitoring of treatment and the study of basic brain processes.

A literature review was undertaken.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been shown to distinguish between psychiatric disorders, and has provided evidence of their pathophysiological mechanisms.

Spectroscopy in particular opens a window, for the first time, on the study of in vivo brain chemistry.
