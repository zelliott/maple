The case of a 36-year-old patient with an intramedullary neurinoma of the thoracic spine without Recklinghausen's disease is presented. The intramedullary neurinoma is a very rare condition. Only 33 cases have been reported in the literature. To our knowledge, the case presented here is the first in German literature. The treatment of choice is tumor removal. The case described here was diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Histologically, the tumor showed all features characteristic of a neurinoma. Postoperatively, the patient is nearly without complaints.
