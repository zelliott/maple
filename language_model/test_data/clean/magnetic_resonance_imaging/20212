We report a case of a 3-year-old girl with a history of recurrent dysphagia and feeding difficulties. After chest x-ray and esophagogram examination, magnetic resonance imaging revealed the presence of a right-sided aortic arch with an aberrant retroesophageal left subclavian artery arising from a Kommerell diverticulum.
