The silent period following motor evoked potentials in small hand muscles after transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the human motor cortex is considered to be cortical origin. The authors report three patients with cervical spinal cord lesions who showed loss of the cortical silent period (CSP) after TMS. One patient had traumatic cervical cord injury, and the other two patients had cervical spondylosis. All the patients had cervical cord compression on magnetic resonance imaging. TMS study showed loss of the CSP in both the hand and foot muscles in two patients and only in the foot muscle in one patient. Paired TMS study in one patient with pseudoathetotic hands showed reduced inhibition within the motor cortex. The hand weakness or interrupted sensory afferents might have caused motor cortical reorganization or hyperexcitability, leading to the loss of the CSP.
