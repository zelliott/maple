To investigate the capability of a necrosis-avid magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent, bis-gadolinium mesoporphyrins, for assessment of irreversibly damaged myocardium and to evaluate the time course of signal enhancement in the reperfused myocardium.

Nine cats were subjected to 90 minutes of occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 90 minutes of reperfusion. Contrast material-enhanced T1-weighted spin-echo images were obtained for 12 hours in five cats and 6 hours in four cats. Pathologic examinations of the resected specimens were performed with 2'3'5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) histochemical staining and electron microscopy. The size of enhanced area on MR images was compared with that of irreversibly damaged myocardium with TTC staining. The time course of signal enhancement was evaluated.

The size of enhanced area on MR images was well correlated with that of irreversibly damaged myocardium with TTC staining. Maximum enhancement occurred 1-3 hours after administration of the contrast material, with mean enhancement of 171% that of normal myocardium. Electron microscopic examinations showed severe myocardial damage in the irreversibly damaged myocardium but only mild edematous changes in the reversibly damaged myocardium.

MR images enhanced with bis-gadolinium mesoporphyrins provide accurate sizing of irreversibly damaged myocardium with a strong and persistent signal enhancement in the reperfused myocardium.
