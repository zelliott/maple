The paramedian artery arises from P1 segment of posterior cerebral artery and supplies a variable extent of thalamus but usually the dorsomedian, median, internal medullary lamina and the intralaminar nuclei. The typical clinical picture of unilateral paramedian thalamic infarctions consist of arousal and memory disorders, language or visuospatial disorders depending on the side of the lesion accompanied with gaze palsies and sensory-motor deficits. Ipsilateral ptosis associated with paramedian thalamic infarctions has been rarely reported. We report a 31 years old patient presenting with unilateral ptosis and right sided facial numbness associated with right paramedian thalamic infarction.
