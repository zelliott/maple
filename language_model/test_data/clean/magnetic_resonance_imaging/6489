Injuries of the elbow joint increase along with increased athletic activity and life expectancy. Knowledge of anatomy and biomechanics is important for understanding injury patterns, specific diagnosis, and therapy. Here we classify the most frequent elbow injuries such as dislocation, ligamentous instability, and fracture of the radial head, processus coronoideus, olecranon, and distal humerus based on joint anatomy, biomechanics, clinical examination, and imaging. Specific therapies are described.
