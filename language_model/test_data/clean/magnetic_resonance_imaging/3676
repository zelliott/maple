A potent lanthanide chelate, fulfilling the requirements for the development of MRI contrast agents or luminescent probes, was armed with alkyne groups. We then implemented a click methodology to graft the bifunctional ligand to azide-containing glucoside and maltoside scaffolds. The resulting hydrophilic glycoconjugates retained the ligand binding capacity for Eu(3+) or Tb(3+) ion as evidenced by the number of bound water molecules to the lanthanide ion. Divalent Eu(3+) and Tb(3+) complexes were shown to double the brightness of the emitted fluorescent signal compared to its monovalent derivatives. Designing multivalent lanthanide luminescent probes would enable the fluorescent signal of labeled biomolecules to be enhanced.
