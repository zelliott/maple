Neuroimaging in the early differential diagnosis of dementia has gained considerable interest over the last decade. From being used for exclusive purposes only, neuroimaging is now in the forefront of aiding in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia, vascular dementia, and and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). With the exception of dopamine transporter single photon-emission computed tomography imaging in DLB, imaging has not yet been incorporated into the diagnostic criteria for the various dementia syndromes, but that will soon change. The recently formulated research criteria for early AD recently formulated by Dubois et al explicitly mention magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography for AD, and are an example of a new diagnostic process developing. In this review, the various imaging techniques will be highlighted, with an emphasis on their ability to diagnose Alzheimer's disease and separate it from other entities.
