Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a powerful diagnostic tool that can be used to help evaluate spinal infection and to help distinguish between an infection and other clinical conditions. In most cases of spinal infection, MR images show typical findings such as vertebral endplate destruction, bone marrow and disk signal abnormalities, and paravertebral or epidural abscesses. However, it is not always easy to diagnose a spinal infection, particularly when some of the classic MR imaging features are absent or when there are unusual patterns of infectious spondylitis. Furthermore, noninfectious inflammatory diseases and degenerative disease may simulate spinal infection. It is necessary to be familiar with atypical MR imaging findings of spinal infection and features that may mimic spinal infection to avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.
