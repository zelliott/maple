The objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of four management strategies for a patient with an incidentally discovered asymptomatic pituitary microadenoma. A decision analytic Markov model was used to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of four clinical management strategies: 1) expectant management, 2) PRL screening, 3) an endocrine screening panel (PRL, insulin-like growth factor I, and 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test), and 4) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up. The model incorporated the natural history of incidental microadenomas, test characteristics, pharmacological and surgical treatment outcomes, patient's quality of life, discounting, and the costs of hormone testing, bromocriptine, MRIs, hospitalization for surgery, and physician services. PRL screening, endocrine screening panel, and MRI follow-up all provided slightly greater quality-adjusted survival than expectant management, but the costs increased disproportionately more than the benefits. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year for PRL screening is $1,428, and that for the endocrine screening panel is $69,495. These results are most sensitive to patient anxiety about the microadenoma; increased anxiety shifts the recommended strategy to the endocrine screening panel. We conclude that in patients with an incidental asymptomatic pituitary microadenoma, a single PRL test may be the most cost-effective management strategy.
