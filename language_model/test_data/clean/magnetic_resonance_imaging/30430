The aim of this study was to report on the clinical, radiological and histological characteristics of hemangiopericytomas, and to discuss our experience with their treatment.

The authors reexamined two recent cases of patients presenting with sinonasal hemangiopericytomas (semiology, CT and MRI results, treatment and follow-up).

There was substantial variability of hemangiopericytoma presentation depending on location. Hemangiopericytomas of the nose and paranasal sinuses are considered a distinct entity with a good prognosis. Treatment is based on endoscopic sinus surgery. The histological approach requires the use of immunohistochemistry. Recurrences vary in the literature depending on the initial resection quality. Metastases are rare.
