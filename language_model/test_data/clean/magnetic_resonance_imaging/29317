Previous studies in primates have shown that chronic systemic administration of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) inhibitor, 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP), replicates most of the motor, cognitive, and histopathological features of Huntington's disease. In the present study, serial 1H-NMR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) assessment of striatal and occipital cortex concentrations of N-acetylaspartate, phosphocreatine/creatine, choline, and lactate, were obtained every 2-weeks during the entire course of a chronic 3NP treatment in baboons. A region-selective increase in lactate was detected in the striatum of the 3NP-treated animals, either immediately before or in conjunction with a lesion in the dorsolateral putamen detected by T2-MR imaging. Absolute 1H-MRS quantitation demonstrated a progressive and region-specific decrease in striatal N-acetylaspartate, creatine, and choline, occuring as early as 3 weeks before the first detection of lactate. These results demonstrate that 1H-MRS can be used to monitor early stages of brain metabolic impairment. In addition, given that 3NP-induced SDH inhibition following systemic injection similarly affects all brain regions, the striatal selective decreases in N-acetylaspartate or creatine concentrations are not simply related to the level of mitochondrial impairment but to a preferential vulnerability of the striatum to 3NP-induced toxicity.
