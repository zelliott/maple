Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) is the latest diagnostic technique for the noninvasive evaluation of cardiovascular conditions. This technique has proved to be especially useful in the study of carotid arteries. All the clinical studies reported to date have been obtained at high or medium field strength; our purpose is to assess the clinical value of MRA in the evaluation of carotid arteries at low field strength. All the exams were performed with an 0.2 T permanent magnet, using the 2D time of flight (TOF) technique, the only one which is currently available on our equipment. Forty-two patients with clinical diagnosis of cerebrovascular insufficiency were examined. In all cases MRA findings were confirmed with digital subtraction angiography (DSA), which was considered the gold standard. The double-blind evaluation of the results showed high agreement of the two techniques in 70 of 84 carotid arteries. A mild tendency to overestimation was observed in 4 normal cases considered as mild stenoses on MRA, in 2 cases with mild stenosis considered as discrete stenoses on MRA and in 1 case of severe stenosis considered as an occlusion on MRA. Underestimation was seen in 1 case of mild stenosis considered as normal on MRA, in 2 cases of discrete stenosis which appeared as mild stenoses on MRA and in 2 cases of occlusion considered as severe stenoses. Our study showed high agreement between MRA and DSA results, which means that high quality exams can be obtained even at low field strength. Further progress can be expected when 3D TOF and phase-contrast techniques will be introduced.
