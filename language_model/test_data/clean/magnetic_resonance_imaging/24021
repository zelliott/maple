Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in pediatrics. The disease-free survival rate for patients with stage IV neuroblastoma has improved over the past 10 years secondary to more aggressive induction chemotherapy regimens combined with autologous bone marrow transplantation. The usual sites of recurrence include the site of primary tumor, residual gross disease, bone, and bone narrow. The central nervous system, a rare site of relapse, is being involved with increasing frequency. The authors report two cases of patients with treated stage IV neuroblastoma who had relapses isolated to the CNS.
