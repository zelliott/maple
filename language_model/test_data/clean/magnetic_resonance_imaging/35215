Simultaneous EEG-fMRI (Electroencephalography-functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) recording provides a means for acquiring high temporal resolution electrophysiological data and high spatial resolution metabolic data of the brain in the same experimental runs. Carbon wire electrodes (not metallic EEG electrodes with carbon wire leads) are suitable for simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording, because they cause less RF (radio-frequency) heating and susceptibility artifacts than metallic electrodes. These characteristics are especially desirable for recording the EEG in high field MRI scanners. Carbon wire electrodes are also comfortable to wear during long recording sessions. However, carbon electrodes have high electrode-electrolyte potentials compared to widely used Ag/AgCl (silver/silver chloride) electrodes, which may cause slow voltage drifts. This paper introduces a prototype EEG recording system with carbon wire electrodes and a circuit that suppresses the slow voltage drift. The system was tested for the voltage drift, RF heating, susceptibility artifact, and impedance, and was also evaluated in a simultaneous ERP (event-related potential)-fMRI experiment.
