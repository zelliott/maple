We review the imaging appearances of hepatic angiomyolipomas in patients with and without tuberous sclerosis. Sporadic hepatic angiomyolipomas have a varied appearance because of the inconstant proportion of fat, making confident imaging diagnosis difficult and necessitating biopsy in many cases. In patients with tuberous sclerosis, hepatic angiomyolipomas have a more consistent imaging appearance and, together with other features of the syndrome, can be more easily diagnosed. Preoperative diagnosis helps obviate unnecessary surgery.
