Faces and voices are key features of human recognition but the way the brain links them together is still unknown. In this study, we measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants were recognizing previously learned static faces, voices and voice-static face associations. Using a subtraction method between bimodal and unimodal conditions, we observed that voice-face associations activated both unimodal visual and auditory areas, and specific multimodal regions located in the left angular gyrus and the right hippocampus. Moreover, a functional connectivity analysis confirmed the connectivity of the right hippocampus with the unimodal areas. These findings demonstrate that binding faces and voices rely on a cerebral network sustaining different aspects of integration such as sensory inputs processing, attention and memory.
