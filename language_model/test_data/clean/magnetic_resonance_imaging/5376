Several radiographic diagnostic techniques are currently available to assess the potential involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes in thoracic oncology. In particular, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have been repeatedly validated; these techniques allow adequate imaging with a reasonable accuracy. The morphologic information provided by these techniques is crucial to stage lung cancer and plan treatment. These techniques are also extremely useful to evaluate other disorders and differentiate malignancy from benign disease.
