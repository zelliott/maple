The case of a young patient with severe and persistent anterograde amnesia of no known cause is reported. Anterograde amnesia arose within a 1-month period and has persisted for more than 1 year. Although a wide variety of neurological and neuroradiological assessments were completed (EEG, evoked potential recordings, Doppler sonography, MRI, PET), no evidence of brain damage was detected. Neuropsychologically, the patient was of high intelligence, had average to above-average short-term memory, and normal retrograde memory abilities, but severe and persistent anterograde amnesia in both verbal and nonverbal domains. Furthermore, he demonstrated grossly reduced long-term concentration. It is likely that a complex chain of interacting variables can produce a syndrome that appears phenomenologically as anterograde amnesia without organically measurable correlates.
