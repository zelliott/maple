We admitted an 11-year-old girl with enlarged endolymphatic duct and sac syndrome to our hospital with severe nausea and vertigo. Three-dimensional constructive interference in steady state (3D-CISS) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (3D-FLAIR) images revealed a reflux of proteinous or hemorrhagic fluid into enlarged endolymphatic space in the labyrinth. This is the first imaging report to show endolymphatic hydrops visualized by noncontrast-enhanced MR imaging in a living human patient.
