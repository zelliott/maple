There is only limited experience with neuronavigators among the neurosurgical community so far. We evaluated such a prototype system in order to define indications for its succinct future use and to adjust it to daily clinical practice. We have employed an infrared light-linked computerized system (SPOCS; Aesculap/ISG) for preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation according to digitized images. A wired, penlike sensor-located "pointer" is used for navigation. Forty-eight patients (22 females, 26 males; aged 7-74 years) with a total of 53 intracranial lesions are included in the study. Fourteen lesions were smaller than 2 cm (26.4%), 33 were 2-4 cm (62.3%), and 6 were greater than 4 cm (11.3%). The documented accuracy was in the range of 3 mm or better in 33 patients throughout the whole operation and in an additional 7 through the most important surgical steps, with satisfactory results in all types of patient positioning except for the sitting position. In one patient the accuracy level decreased too early to perform useful intraoperative navigation. Technical dropouts early in the series led to abortion of the navigation in 7 instances but would currently no longer lead to abortion. There was no additional surgical morbidity associated with the use of the system. With more convenience in instrument design and development of techniques for real-time intraoperative reregistration, this kind of navigational device will play an increasingly important role for assistance during intracranial surgery. It proved to be helpful for planning of the craniotomy, intraoperative guidance on occasions of limited exposure and narrow visual field, localization and resection of small lesions in critical areas, and border definition of large lesions and for pure image guided resection of previously marked regions.
