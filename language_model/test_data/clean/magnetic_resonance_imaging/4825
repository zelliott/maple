A 29-year-old African American woman with an 8-year history of biopsy-proven renal sarcoidosis and end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis was admitted to the hospital with progressive weakness and shortness of breath for 2 months. Eight months prior to admission, she was prescribed 15 mg of prednisone twice a day and 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine sulfate twice a day for hypercalcemia and elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme level. As her laboratory abnormalities improved, the prednisone dose was gradually decreased, and hydroxychloroquine was continued. Six months earlier, she noticed numbness in her feet and progressive loss of muscle bulk in her feet and hands. She also noticed difficulty reaching overhead, getting out of a chair, and climbing stairs. She denied any pain or muscle cramps. Results of electrophysiological tests at that time, which included nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography, revealed moderately severe axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Her weakness worsened and so she was admitted to the hospital and subsequently transferred to our facility for further management.
