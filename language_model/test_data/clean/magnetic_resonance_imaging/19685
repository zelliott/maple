Bone marrow edema syndrome (BMES) is a nontraumatic syndrome characterized by disabling joint pain. The disease occurs especially in the hip joint, and the ankle joint has been reported in the English-language literature to be affected only rarely. We describe here the case of an adult with BMES in both ankle joints. She has been treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and physical therapy, as well as ankle arthroscopy, all of which have been unsuccessful. BMES was diagnosed on the basis of clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. The patient was treated with iloprost (Ilomedin; Schering AG, Berlin, Germany); the course of therapy consisted of 5 infusions of 40 microg of iloprost in 500 mL of sodium chloride solution, given over 6 hours on 5 consecutive days. MRI at the third monthly visit showed nearly complete resolution of bone marrow edema. The patient was followed for 2 years and 6 months and was completely asymptomatic. This case report suggests the need for orthopaedic surgeons to know about BMES. Before all-arthroscopic interventions are performed, MRI views should be evaluated carefully. Iloprost infusion therapy seems to be effective and safe in the management of BMES.
