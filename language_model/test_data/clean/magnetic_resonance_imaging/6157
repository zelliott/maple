Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and left ventricular (LV) apical aneurysm represent a previously under-recognized but important subgroup within this heterogeneous disease spectrum. Apical aneurysms and the contiguous areas of myocardial fibrosis have been associated with monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and increased risk for adverse clinical events including sudden cardiac death, prioritizing the application of primary prevention implantable defibrillators. However, VT may be repetitive, thereby raising considerations for additional treatment strategies such as radiofrequency ablation. In this report, we describe such a patient with HCM and apical aneurysm in whom the mapping and ablation procedure was effective in identifying and abolishing the VT focus.
