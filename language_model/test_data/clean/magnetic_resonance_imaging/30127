Hip arthrography is an accurate diagnostic method for evaluation of the peripheral compartment, but its depiction of cartilage lesions is moderate. The purpose of this study was to add leg traction to MR arthrography of the hip to test its effect on visualization of cartilage surfaces.

Hip MR arthrography with leg traction is a technically feasible and safe procedure that improves visualization of the femoral and acetabular cartilage surfaces.
