The clinical and radiographic effect of anterior plate fixation alone was evaluated in 36 consecutive patients with distractive flexion (DF) injuries in the lower cervical spine. Mean follow-up time was 15 months. The aim of the present study was to determine whether anterior plate fixation alone provides sufficient stability when treating DF injuries in the cervical spine. Solid union was seen in 6 of 6 patients with stage 1 injury and in 15 of 17 patients with stage 2 injury. In the patients with stage 3 injury, 7 of 13 of the anterior fixations failed. These failures occurred mainly among the patients with severe neurologic injuries. We believe these findings substantiate the use of anterior plate alone for DF injuries at stage 1 and 2 but disqualify anterior plate fixation alone for DF injuries at stage 3, with neurologic injury present.
