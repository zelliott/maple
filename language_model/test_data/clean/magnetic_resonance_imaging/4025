Assessment of right ventricular volume and mass with three dimensional echocardiography and comparison with magnetic resonance imaging.

Measurements of right ventricular volumes performed on three dimensional datasets acquired by transthoracic echocardiography were compared to those obtained from magnetic resonance imaging performed on the same day. Volumes were measured in end systole and end diastole and ejection fraction calculated. Right ventricular mass was assessed in end systole. With both methods, the areas of a 2 mm thick slice of the ventricle were manually outlined and multiplied by the slice thickness to obtain slice volume. Slice volumes were multiplied by the number of measured slices to obtain the ventricular volume.

16 patients were studied: three with normal hearts, three after surgical repair of coarctation of the aorta, nine following repair of tetralogy of Fallot, and one with Mustard atrial repair of complete transposition of the great arteries.

Correlation between end diastolic volumes measured by both methods was r = 0.95 with limits of agreement ranging from -3.5 to 12.5 ml; correlation for end systolic volumes was r = 0.87 with limits of agreement between -4.0 and 16.4 ml; correlation for end systolic right ventricular mass was r = 0.81 with limits of agreement between -7.0 and 20.6 g. Interobserver variability ranged from 4.3% (range 0.2% to 9.3%) for end diastolic volume to 7.6% (1.8% to 15.4%) for mass measurements.

With transthoracic three dimensional echocardiography, end diastolic right ventricular volumes can be assessed with acceptable accuracy in normal hearts and those with enlarged right ventricles, whereas the current method of three dimensional echocardiography is less good for end systolic volumes and not satisfactory for right ventricular mass measurements.
