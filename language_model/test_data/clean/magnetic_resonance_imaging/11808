Early diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) represents, to date, an essential endpoint. Diagnostic certainty may, indeed, mean the possibility to start preventive treatments and delay the appearance of a clinically definitive MS or the progression of the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represent a valid tool for early diagnosis, albeit several neurologic disorders may mimic the MRI findings of MS.
