We report on the case of a 61-year old man who developed a reversible Brown-Sequard syndrome immediately after an uncomplicated lumbar discectomy. Magnetic resonance imaging showed ischaemic lesions in the upper cervical medulla, the caudal part of the medulla oblongata, and in the cerebellum. Vertebral artery compression due to spondylosis and hyperflexion of the cervical spine during operation is discussed as a possible pathogenetic mechanism.
