Invasive aspergillosis of the central nervous system has a mortality rate exceeding 90%. We describe a 29-year-old woman with a medical history of chronic polyarthritis who developed a proven rhinocerebral Aspergillus fumigatus infection refractory to first-line treatment with liposomal amphotericin B. The patient responded successfully to salvage combination treatment with voriconazole and caspofungin. Furthermore, for the first time, voriconazole levels in an intracerebral abscess were measured in this patient undergoing voriconazole oral therapy.
