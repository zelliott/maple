Volume-localized proton spectroscopy and T2-weighted MRI were performed on 23 monkeys with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). The purpose of this study was to determine the relationships between temporal changes in lesion activity (measured on T2-weighted MRI), MRS [N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine (CR), choline (CHO)], and the histologic definition of disease determined post-mortem. Animals were scanned in the same areas of the brain once a week before and after sensitization to myelin basic protein (BP). Histologic lesion types were predicted by a combination of preceding MRI and MRS measurements. Acutely fatal EAE lesions were large and monophasic as visualized by MRI, and increased CHO (p < 0.02, n = 16) and CHO/CR ratio (p < 0.001, n = 16) were detected by MRS at disease onset. Chronic EAE lesions were preceded by multiple inflammatory attacks as visualized by MRI and consistently low levels of NAA (p < 0.02, n = 13) and NAA/CR (p < 0.01, n = 13) which occurred after the initial attack. MRI negative brain regions (from animals that were sensitized to BP) were associated with low CHO/CR (p < 0.1, n = 5). The temporal correlation of MRI lesion activity and absolute MRS proton metabolites shows promise for predicting the subsequent duration and histologic type of lesions in EAE in non-human primates.
