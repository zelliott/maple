Many years before receiving a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients experience evidence of cognitive decline. Recent studies using a variety of brain imaging technologies have detected subtle changes in brain structure and function in normal adults with a genetic risk for AD; these brain changes have similar pathological features as AD, and some appear to be predictive of future cognitive decline. This review examines the most recent data on brain changes in genetic risk for AD and discusses the benefits and potential risks of detecting individuals at risk.
