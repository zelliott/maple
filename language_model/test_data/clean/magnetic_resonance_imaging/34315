The authors report a patient in whom a subdural hematoma developed from a Type I spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM). The patient became symptomatic with back pain, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a spinal subdural hematoma. Selective spinal angiography, however, failed to demonstrate a pathological process. The patient underwent exploratory laminoplasty that revealed a subdural extraarachnoid hematoma with an underlying Type I spinal AVM, which was surgically obliterated. The patient recovered completely. Subdural hematomas that affect the spine are rare. Although a negative result was obtained using selective spinal angiography, exploratory surgery should be considered for the evacuation of a subdural hematoma and possibly for the definitive treatment of a spinal AVM.
