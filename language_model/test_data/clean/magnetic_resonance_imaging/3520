The aim of the study was to assess the outcome of patients who received chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced rectal cancer, specifically those with complete clinical response (CCR) and who were then managed nonoperatively with a 'Watch and Wait' follow-up protocol.

A retrospective study was carried out of patients undergoing preoperative CRT for rectal cancer, conducted in a district general hospital managing rectal cancer through the multidisciplinary team process.

Forty-nine patients received preoperative CRT over a 5-year period (2004-2009). Twelve (24%) were considered potentially to have had a complete response on MRI. Of these, six subsequently had clinical evidence of residual disease, leading to surgery (mean time to surgery, 24 weeks; range, 12-36 weeks). The remaining six had CCR, avoiding surgery (mean follow up, 26 months; range, 12-45 months), with all six patients disease free to date. A further six patients had complete pathological response (CPR) following surgery after comprehensive histopathological assessment of the specimen.

In this consecutive series of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with CRT, 12% demonstrated a CCR and have been actively managed conservatively, thereby avoiding surgery. With further improvements in diagnostic assessment of response to CRT, this figure may rise.
