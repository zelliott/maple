Peripheral talar fractures are frequently overlooked and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with acute and chronic ankle pain. Early diagnosis allows specific treatment options to prevent long-term complications and enables better overall results. Computertomography is obligatory for definite evaluation of the pathology and to determine the need for conservative or operative treatment. Conservatively treated displaced fractures lead to pain and decreased range of motion from ongoing arthrosis of the subtalar joint. Large or displaced fragments require, according to the scare literature, open reduction and internal fixation. Comminution or small fragments are best addressed by surgical excision, although alteration in the biomechanics of the subtalar joint may occur.
