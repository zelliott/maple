A patient with a history of bronchial carcinoma was admitted to the coronary care unit with chest pain suggestive of infarction and an ECG showing changes compatible with acute lateral wall infarction. The coronary arteries were shown to be normal and echocardiography revealed an intracardiac mass which MRI confirmed to be a direct extension of the pulmonary tumour. Echocardiography should be performed systematically in patients with chest pain and ECG changes of ischaemia who also have progressive oncological disease.
