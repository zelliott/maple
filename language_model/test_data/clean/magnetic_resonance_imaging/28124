The MR studies of three histologically proven spinal neurilemmomas and neurofibromas were reviewed retrospectively. There were two benign neurilemmomas (schwannomas) and one neurofibroma. The common characteristic of these cases was a central low intensity focus ("dot") seen on postcontrast T1-weighted imaging. The low intensity foci corresponded histologically to a congeries of changes including edema, microcysts, foam cells, hyalinization of blood vessels, old hemorrhage, and dystrophic calcification.
