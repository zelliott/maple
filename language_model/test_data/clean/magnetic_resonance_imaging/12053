In magnetic resonance imaging susceptibility artifacts occur at the interface of substances with large magnetic susceptibility differences, resulting in geometric distortions of the image at those boundaries. The susceptibility artifacts are often subtle on clinical images and if not carefully examined they may lead to misdiagnosis. Magnetic susceptibility artifacts are prevalent on the boundary of air-containing paranasal sinuses, as well as bone-soft tissue interfaces in the spinal canal. The appearance of these artifacts on images from three different magnetic field strength instruments, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.5 Tesla were studied. T1- and T2-weighted spin echo and gradient recalled echo pulse sequences were selected to image a water phantom containing substances of varying susceptibilities. The effects were also studied in MR images of the head in a normal human volunteer. At any given field strength the artifacts were more prominent in the gradient echo imaging than in the corresponding spin echo pulse sequence. As expected, the distortions were also greater at higher field strengths. The results in human subjects paralleled the findings in the phantom study.
