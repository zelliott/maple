In this study, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings of patients with varying stages of cervical carcinoma are reviewed. The appearances of the postirradiation pelvis on MR images are also characterized and correlated with preradiation therapy staging. MR imaging findings of recurrent and metastatic disease are presented and discussed.
