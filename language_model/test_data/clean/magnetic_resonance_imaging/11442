Three children, a 4.5-year-old boy and two girls aged 21 months and 10 years respectively, had for several weeks to months experienced lower back pain or walking problems, two of them had an elevated sedimentation and leucocytosis. The MRI scan revealed a narrowing of the lumbal disk. Furthermore, in the case of the 10-year-old girl, Staphylococcus lugdunensis was cultured from the puncture material of the disk. After treatment she continued to experience intermittent complaints of back pain; the other children made a complete recovery. (Spondylo)discitis must be differentiated from vertebral osteomyelitis. In the case of (spondylo)discitis, immobilising the spine with a corset is the mainstay of treatment. Antibiotics are only indicated when osteomyelitis cannot be excluded. Generally, the prognosis is good.
