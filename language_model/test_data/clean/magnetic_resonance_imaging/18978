Xanthomas of the cranium that are not accompanied by endocrine or metabolic abnormalities are extremely rare. It is very important to understand the pathological features of this disease, for differential diagnosis from other diseases.

A 62-year-old woman presented to the hospital with headaches. Cranial x-rays revealed bone destruction in the right temporal bone, with osteosclerosis in the area surrounding the lesion. In computed tomographic scans, the bone cortex was intact and the diploÃ« was dilated because of the large mass of the lesion. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging findings were heterogeneous, with areas of hypo- and isointensity; T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging findings were also heterogeneous, with areas of hypo- and hyperintensity.

Total removal of the tumor was performed, followed by cranioplasty using artificial bone.

Histologically, lipid-containing foamy cells were dense and a cholesterin granuloma was observed. There was no reason to infer other diseases, and a diagnosis of xanthoma of the temporal bone was reached.

Xanthomatous lesions are observed in various pathological conditions, including malignant diseases. Xanthomas are benign lesions and the prognoses for patients with these lesions are satisfactory, even after partial excision. Therefore, it is quite important to distinguish xanthomas from other diseases that produce xanthomatous lesions.
