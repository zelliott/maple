Sensory functional MRI was performed in seven normal volunteers at 1. 5 T using a vibratory stimulus applied to the pad of the first finger of the left hand. The data was normalized to a standard atlas, and individual and group statistical parametric maps were computed. Robust bilateral activation was demonstrated in the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), indicating a bilateral representation of SII in humans. Greater maxima and activation volumes were achieved in contralateral SII as compared to SI. Sensory fMRI can provide a sensitive assay for probing the nature and function of SII in vivo.
