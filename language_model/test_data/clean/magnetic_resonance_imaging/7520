PEComas are a collection of generally rare tumors, defined by the World Health Organization as 'mesenchymal tumors composed of histologically and immunohistochemically distinctive perivascular epitheloid cells'. We describe the case of retroperitoneal PEComa with a liposarcoma-like appearance on cross-sectional imaging, but distinctive immunohistochemistry revealing the correct diagnosis.
