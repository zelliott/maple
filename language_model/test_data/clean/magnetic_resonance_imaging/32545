We present a previously unreported case of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy as the inaugural clinical sign of meningeal carcinomatosis (MC). Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance images (MRI) were unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed malignant cells consistent with a pulmonary adenocarcinoma; the chest CT revealed a small pulmonary mass in the upper right lobe. This case highlights the importance of considering MC in all patients who develop sudden oculomotor palsy; lumbar punctures should always be performed on patients with normal MRI when other possible causes of oculomotor palsy have been ruled out.
