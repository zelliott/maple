Dynamic MRI is routinely used in the diagnosis of soft tissue tumors to supplement static imaging. The aim of our study was to assess the diagnostic value of dynamic MRI using the coefficient of total tumor enhancement expressed as per cent (tec%) and the tumor enhancement rate coefficient expressed as per cent per minute (erc%/min), and to make a comparative analysis of the sensitivity and specificity of both parameters.

The material consisted of 45 patients (30 sarcomas, 15 non-malignant lesions). The age of the patients was 16-64 years. The MRI was done using an Elscint 2T unit, applying gradient echo techniques. The coefficient of total contrast enhancement (tec%) and the tissue enhancement rate (erc%/min) were calculated. The limit values were determined for dividing the tumors into sarcomas and non-malignant lesions. The sensitivity and specificity of MRI were calculated and compared using both indices.

Dynamic MRI with calculation of erc%/min and tec% makes it possible to differentiate between sarcomas and non-malignant lesions.

The erc%/min was a more sensitive than tec% differentiating parameter in the diagnosis of soft tissue tumors.
