Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is an uncommon clinical entity that is often diagnosed after a delay, or it is misdiagnosed due to the variety of clinical presentations and the associated radiological findings. We present here a case of SIH associated with chronic subdural haematoma (SDH) and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Following the diagnosis of the SIH, the patient underwent injection of an epidural blood patch for the SIH and burr hole trephination was done for treating the chronic subdural haematoma.
