Two cases of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease are described, one with the classical and one with the connatal form, both in the same family. It is an X-linked disease affecting the myelinisation of the brain. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher manifests itself within a few months after birth and has a progressive character. The disease is caused by a point mutation in the PLP gene coding for the myelin-protein proteolipid protein. MRI imaging has improved the possibility for diagnosis especially in families with cases of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease and PLP gene detection has brought antenatal diagnosis in focus.
