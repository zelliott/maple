Metallic implants, such as stents, have long been a concern in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition to safety issues, they are commonly associated with image artifacts. The mechanisms of radiofrequency- (RF) and susceptibility-induced artifacts have been thoroughly investigated. However, gradient-switching-induced artifacts have not been analyzed. In this study it was demonstrated that gradient switching may be a source of artifacts in metallic stent MR imaging. These artifacts differ from those caused by the RF pulse. A theoretical explanation is provided as well.
