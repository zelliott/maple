The Chiari malformation causes herniation of the cerebellar amygdalae through the foramen magnum, resulting in the descent of the brain stem and/or traction on the lower cranial pairs. It is important for otolaryngologists to recognize Chiari malformations as part of the differential diagnosis of balance disorders, because patients may initially exhibit symptoms related to the vestibular system, including ataxia, nystagmus, or vertigo. We report 2 cases.
