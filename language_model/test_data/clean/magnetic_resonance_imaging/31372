The simultaneous occurrence of a hypothalamic and sellar gangliocytoma with a pituitary prolactinoma is very rare. The explanation for such an association is not known. We describe the case of a woman who had a coexisting adjacent pituitary prolactinoma and gangliocytoma within the same sellar mass. The tumor cells of the gangliocytoma demonstrated expression of enkephalin, a product of proopiomelanocortin known to be a prolactin secretagogue. We postulate that in this patient there may be a link between gangliocytoma enkephalin and prolactin hypersecretion.
