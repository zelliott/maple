Sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) was administered to a 1-year-old female case of Leigh syndrome, who had a T > G point mutation at nt 8993 of mitochondrial DNA. Her biochemical and clinical symptoms improved gradually, but proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed reduction of the N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio, and magnetic resonance imaging showed progressive cerebral atrophy despite the DCA therapy. These results suggest that DCA therapy may not retard the progress of the primary disease in Leigh syndrome, but produced clinical improvement most likely by reducing toxic accumulation of lactate.
