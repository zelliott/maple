Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a noninvasive technique for studying neurodegenerative events in the rat brain, however, most of the studies are performed on small bore purpose dedicated MR scanners of limited availability and at high cost. The present study explored the feasibility of using a clinical whole body MR-scanner to perform imaging in rat brain and specifically in models of Parkinson's (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD). For that purpose rats were placed into a specially designed PVC device equipped with a flexible surface coil-and T2-weighted spin echo sequences were acquired on a Siemens Magnetom Vision at 1.5 T. In the experimental protocols of PD and HD, animals underwent 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and quinolinic acid (QA) injections, respectively and were subsequently grafted with fetal tissue. T2-weighted images showed a small hyperintense area at the 6-OHDA lesion site and a diffuse hyperintensity in the striata with QA lesions. Transplants were seen as a hypointense area surrounded by a hyperintense rim on T1-weighted images. Moreover, disturbances of the blood-brain-barrier and its time of restoration could be monitored. In conclusion, high-resolution in vivo imaging of small animals is feasible with clinical MR-scanners and hence allows the study of various experimental protocols.
