Neurological complications of metronidazole are rare, predominantly peripheral neuropathies, especially in patients on a long-term high-dose regimen. Cerebellar syndrome or seizures are less frequently reported. The concomitant occurrence of the three complications is exceptional.

We report herein a case with these three complications as side effects of metronidazole. For the cerebellar syndrome, the T2-weighted brain MRI showed a rounded and well-delimited zone of high signal intensity in the cerebellar dentate nuclei, extending up to the protuberance and the subthalamic nucleus, bilaterally and symmetrically.

Neurological complications are possible when a treatment with metronidazole is prescribed for a long duration or at high dose. In our patient, the clinical abnormalities and MRI signs regressed a few months after treatment withdrawal.
