Clinicians should be able to provide the patient with Alzheimer disease (AD) and the family with an accurate prediction of what to expect, but the variability in the rate of disease progression precludes this. In several previous studies, specific clinical signs such as muscular rigidity, myoclonus, and hallucinations or delusions were associated with rapid progression to a more severe stage of dementia or death. The "Predictors Study," a longitudinal study at three independent sites, was designed to develop a predictor model of the natural history of Alzheimer disease. The study was conducted at three study sites, New York, Baltimore, and Boston in a cohort of 224 patients with early probable AD. This article describes the design and implementation of the Predictors Study, and compares features of the study cohort at baseline across sites. Patients were all at the mild stage of disease at entry and were relatively comparable across sites. Extrapyramidal signs and delusions were common, but myoclonus was rarely observed.
