Only a few cases of double-layered meniscus have been described in the English literature. We report two cases of bilateral double-layered lateral meniscus, where an additional semicircular meniscus was observed over the normal lateral meniscus. One of the patients exhibited a bucket-handle tear with a double-layered meniscus. To our knowledge, this abnormality is extremely rare and the incidence of double layered meniscus with bucket-handle tear has not been previously reported.
