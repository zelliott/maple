Dizziness is a frequent indication for neuroimaging within the outpatient and emergency setting with variable diagnostic yield. The majority of persistent, recurrent, and isolated dizziness can be managed clinically. However, it may be difficult to distinguish a benign peripheral aetiology from a central cause, particularly in the emergency setting. We review the relevant anatomy, differential diagnosis, and key imaging features of central and peripheral causes of dizziness, as well as the literature for the diagnostic yield in acute and outpatient settings.
