A 19-month-old child was gradually suffering from gait disturbance and was referred by his pediatrician to the authors' institution. Spinal MRI showed Gd-enhanced spinal cord tumor and congestive myelopathy. Intraoperatively the lesion was seen to be a hemangioblastoma. Because discrimination of the arterialized draining veins from the feeding arteries was difficult, indocyanine green videography was conducted to differentiate them. Real-time evaluation by FLOW 800 revealed that the slope of the average signal intensity in the feeding artery was steeper than that of the arterialized veins. The tumor was successfully resected, and postoperative indocyanine green videography showed total removal of the tumor as a signal-negative region; the circulation time between the feeding artery and the main draining vein was prolonged from 2.5 to 5.5 seconds. Indocyanine green videography and real-time evaluation by FLOW 800 were objective and effective for the excision of a tumor retaining the arteriovenous shunt. The patient recovered from congestive myelopathy and gait disturbance.
