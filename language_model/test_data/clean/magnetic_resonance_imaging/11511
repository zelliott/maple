Ultrasound is the screening modality of choice for fetal imaging. However, when additional information regarding fetal anatomy or pathology is needed, fast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is being used increasingly as a correlative imaging modality because it uses no ionizing radiation, provides excellent soft tissue contrast, has multiple planes for reconstruction, and a large field of view. Sonographic examination of the fetus is still important for selecting the appropriate fetuses for MR examination and to guide the protocol of the examination. Performance of high quality sonographic and MR examinations, as well as interpretation by individuals familiar with prenatal diagnosis, are important factors for optimal parental counseling. Magnetic resonance imaging frequently adds additional information beyond that available with ultrasound. This information commonly changes patient counseling, and at times patient management.
