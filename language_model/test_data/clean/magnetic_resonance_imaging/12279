Various methods of cross-sectional imaging are used for visualization of the cranial nerves, relying heavily on MR imaging. The success of the MR imaging sequences for visualization of cranial nerves depends on their anatomic context at the point of evaluation. The heterogeneity of opinion regarding optimal evaluation of the cranial nerves is partly a function of the complexity of cranial nerve anatomy. A variety of approaches are advocated and variations in equipment and terminology cloud the field. This article proposes a segmental classification and corresponding nomenclature for imaging evaluation of the cranial nerves and reviews technical considerations and applicable literature.
