A 3-year-old boy receiving valproate for 1.5 months presented with sudden-onset unprovoked seizures and unconsciousness. Hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and deranged liver function were detected. Elevated medium-chain urinary acylglycines and plasma acylcarnitine were detected. His serum valproate level was elevated. Valproate toxicity had been precipitated in presence of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging brain indicated unilateral basal ganglia ischemia instead of the bilateral changes expected in metabolic disease.
