Aggressive angiomyxoma (AAM) is a rare, benign mass with propensity for local invasion and recurrence after resection. Infrequently, this tumor can be found arising from the scrotum or cord structures in males.

A case report is presented followed by a review of relevant literature addressing the diagnosis, imaging, management and follow-up for aggressive angiomyxoma of the scrotum.

Imaging can assist in further characterization of masses noted on physical exam. Scrotal sonography is typically the primary imaging modality utilized and magnetic resonance imaging is able to provide further anatomic detail. Treatment mainstay is surgical resection with necessary long term surveillance.
