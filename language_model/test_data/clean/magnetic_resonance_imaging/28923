Occlusion of the retinal artery is a rare complication after therapeutic embolization. We present a case of a partial retinal artery obstruction following coil embolization of an intracerebral aneurysm. To our knowledge, only six cases of acute occlusion of the choroidal and/or retinal arteries after therapeutic embolization have been reported so far. The case presented here, however, is the first in which platinum microcoils were the material used. In addition the retinal ischemia was reversible, visual acuity returning to normal and cutten-wool spot and retinal hemorrhages resolving spontaneously.
