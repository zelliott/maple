We report a patient with splenic vein occlusion (SVO) secondary to tuberculosis. A 17-year-old male patient with mild epigastric pain and splenomegaly was found to have gastric varices by gastroscopy, and SVO by selective angiography. At operation, the splenic vein was occluded by hard fibrous tissue at the splenic hilum, and thus a splenectomy was performed. A microscopic examination of the tissue revealed caseous necrosis surrounded by epithelioid cells and Langhans-type giant cells. Although there were no other findings suggesting intestinal tuberculosis, it seemed that tuberculous lymphadenitis of the splenic hilum most likely caused the occlusion of the splenic vein. Because specific tests for tuberculosis were negative in both immunohistochemical staining for bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin and polymerase chain reaction of DNA for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the time of infection was assumed to have occurred a long time before. SVO can sometimes be seen in pancreatic diseases, but this patient with tuberculosis appears to be the first such reported case in the English literature.
