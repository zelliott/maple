Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive technique that complements computed tomography (CT), conventional X-ray, and bone marrow biopsies by sampling a large volume of musculoskeletal bone and providing information that aids the diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of various lesions. Although less sensitive to the mineral components of bones, the MRI appearance of physiologic bone marrow is mainly a reflection of the relative amounts of red marrow, yellow marrow, and trabecular bone. Therefore, use of T1-and T2-weighted MR sequences with or without fat suppression currently remains the most common approach to musculoskeletal bone lesion imaging. An additional imaging strategy to characterize various bone lesions is the application of contrast-enhanced dynamic MRI. This article examines semiquantitative and quantitative dynamic imaging, evaluation, and postprocessing techniques in various benign and malignant musculoskeletal lesions. Practical guidelines for performing a dynamic contrast-enhanced MR examination are proposed.
