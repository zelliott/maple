Primary liposarcomas of the mediastinum are extremely rare neoplasms, comprising less than 1% of all mediastinal tumors. These tumors occur most commonly in the lower extremities (75%) and less frequently in the retroperitoneum. We present a case involving a successful radical resection of a large myxoid liposarcoma and its recurrence, both located in the posterior mediastinum.
