The anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments are crucial stabilizers of the knee. These ligaments are named by the location of their tibial attachments. Each ligament is composed of separate functional bundles that differ in size but are equally important in function. MR imaging is accurate and sensitive, making it the imaging technique of choice for evaluating these ligaments. Acute and chronic injuries involving the cruciate ligaments have typical appearances and associated findings. MR imaging interpretation must take into account atypical injuries and imaging pitfalls. Knowledge of normal ligament reconstruction techniques allows differentiation of the normal postoperative appearance from reconstruction failure and complications. Ligament reconstruction techniques, complications, and appearances are reviewed in this article.
