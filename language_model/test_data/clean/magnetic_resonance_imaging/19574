To describe the radiologic findings of susceptibility changes in acute middle cerebral artery (MCA) thromboembolism detected with three-dimensional (3D) susceptibility-based perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and to compare the detectability and clinical value of this sign with those of the hyperdense MCA sign at computed tomography (CT).

Twenty-three patients (mean age, 55 years) underwent CT and MR imaging within the first 6 hours after the onset of acute MCA stroke. The hyperdense MCA sign at CT and the presence of susceptibility changes in acute thromboembolism as depicted on T2*-weighted 3D perfusion MR images were assessed. The presence of each sign was correlated with clinical presentation.

The sensitivity of the hyperdense MCA sign at CT was 54% (negative predictive value, 71%) compared with 82% (negative predictive value, 86%) for the susceptibility changes at MR imaging. There were no false-positive CT or MR readings. The presence of the MCA susceptibility sign correlated positively with the initial clinical presentation (chi(2) = 7.987, P =.009, Spearman rho = 0.589). However, neither of the signs was a predictor for clinical outcome in cases of spontaneous MCA stroke.

In addition to the information traditionally provided with reconstructed perfusion parameter maps, 3D susceptibility-based perfusion MR images allow the identification of acute MCA thromboembolism with a sensitivity higher than that of CT.
