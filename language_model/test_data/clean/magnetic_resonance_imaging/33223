Lung parenchyma remains one of the most difficult tissues to be imaged by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Several MRI techniques are routinely used for lung imaging. However, manganese-enhancement MRI (MEMRI) technique has not been associated with pulmonary MRI. Here, we evaluated T(1) -enhancement in the rat lung after a manganese instillation, using a 4.7 T magnet with a radial ultrashort echo time sequence. Our data showed that the signal intensity was increased in lungs receiving a manganese solution compared with a control solution to the lungs. MR signal enhancements above 30% were measured in lung parenchyma following 200 Âµl instillation of a 1 mm manganese chloride solution. MEMRI, therefore, may be a useful novel tool for enhancing signal intensity and image contrast in lung tissue.
