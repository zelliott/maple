A 70-year-old man with hydrocephalus was examined with functional magnetic resonance (fMR) imaging before and after ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Preoperatively, activation by right hand exercise revealed only a slight signal increase in the peri-rolandic area. However, 3 months after ventriculoperitoneal shunting, a significant signal increase was observed. fMR imaging may detect activity-related improvement of cerebral blood flow responses in patients with hydrocephalus after surgical treatment.
