Athletes who partake in overhead or throwing activities frequently suffer from shoulder pain. Glenohumeral instability plays an important role in sports-related shoulder pain. Shoulder instability can be traumatic, atraumatic, or microtraumatic in origin. In athletes, atraumatic and microtraumatic instabilities can lead to secondary impingement and chronic damage to intra-articular structures. MR arthrography is the modality of choice for assessing glenohumeral instability and diagnosing labroligamentous injuries. This article reviews imaging of instability-related injuries in athletes, with special emphasis on MR imaging.
