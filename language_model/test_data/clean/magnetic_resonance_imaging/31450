Cellulite is seen in more than 85% of postpubertal women. Recent studies show that bipolar radiofrequency and low-level laser devices can produce mild skin tightening of cellulite.

The primary objective was to determine if a novel unipolar, more deeply penetrating, radiofrequency device can promote better skin tightening with fewer treatments than is seen with previously described devices. The secondary objective was to determine if such a deeply penetrating device produced undesired effects on lipid metabolism.

Thirty subjects, with Nurnberger-Muller Scale III-IV upper thigh cellulite, were entered into the study. All were treated, every other week, with a unipolar radiofrequency device for a total of six treatments. Subjects were evaluated before and 6 months after treatment with clinical photographs, clinical measurements, biopsies, MRIs, and blood lipid evaluations.

Twenty-seven subjects showed evidence of clinical improvement. The mean decrease in leg circumference was 2.45 cm. Histologic changes showed dermal fibrosis of the upper dermis. No MRI or lipid abnormalities were noted.

Upper thigh skin cellulite can be improved with a new unipolar radiofrequency device. Histologic changes suggest skin tightening as the method of improvement. No undesired complications of the skin or lipid metabolism were noted.
