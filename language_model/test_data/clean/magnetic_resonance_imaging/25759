Spontaneous intracerebellar haematomas are a relatively unusual cause of haemorrhagic stroke. The uncommon variety of vermian haematomas (5%) represents a serious diagnostic and treatment challenge and its outcome is generally poor, being the result of rapid elevation of intracranial pressure and brainstem compression. A rare case of spontaneous vermian haematoma with benign course without surgery is reported, including the results of neuroimaging tests.
