A 23-year-old woman who presented with a branch retinal artery occlusion followed by encephalopathy showed, by brain magnetic resonance imaging, a nonenhancing lesion in the right parietal gray matter with normal diffusion-weighted imaging. Of 64 reported cases of cat-scratch encephalopathy with documented neuroimaging findings, only 12 (18.8%) have had abnormal imaging findings. The abnormalities have included cerebral white matter lesions, basal ganglia and thalamic lesions, and multifocal lesions in immunocompromised patients, but no gray matter lesions similar to those in this patient. The variety of neuroimaging findings supports multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms of central nervous system involvement in this disorder.
