Stuttering is characterised by repetitions, prolongations and pausing while speaking. Researchers have looked for many explanations. However, the cause of stuttering remains unknown. In recent years, structural abnormalities in the speech-related structures of the central nervous system have been brought into focus as a cause of stuttering. Research has shown signs of a lateral hemisphere asymmetry, abnormalities in the basal ganglia, dysfunction in the supplementary motor area and/or a dysfunction in the coordination of the cerebellum. This article is a review of this part of the literature.
