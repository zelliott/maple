Kallmann syndrome (KS) is a developmental disease characterized by the association of isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia/hyposmia. We report an unusual presentation of two females with KS and empty sella. These females, aged at 20 and 29-year-old, presented primary amenorrhea with prepubertal estradiol and low gonadotropin levels. No other significant clinical signs were observed. Empty sella was observed on MRI in both cases. Sequencing of FGFR1 gene, recently implicated in autosomal form of KS, was performed and one splicing mutation (IVS14 + 1G > A) was identified in one patient.
