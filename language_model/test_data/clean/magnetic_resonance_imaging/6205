M.R.I. allows a good delineation of adrenals, due to the high contrast with fat and to the use of frontal planes. We showed on post operative adrenal lesions samples that the lipid percentages, high in normal and hyperplasic glands, was still high in most benign adenomas, and very low (under 5%) in adrenal carcinomas. MRI, with Dixon sequence, allows to evaluate this lipid percentage in adrenal lesions. Post-operative controls show a good agreement between in vivo and in vitro measurements. This simple technique should allow to discriminate between malignant and benign adrenal cortex lesions.
