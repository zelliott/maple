The objective of this study was to determine the value of high-field magnetic resonance imaging and to clarify the characteristics of each image among three-dimensional gradient echo (3D-GRE), two-dimensional spin echo (2D-SE) and inversion recovery (2D-IR) sequences used as contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images for stereotactic irradiation treatment planning of sellar lesions.

Pulse sequences of 2D-SE and 3D-spoiled gradient recalled acquisition in the steady state (3D-SPGR) using GRE at 1.5 T and 2D-IR and 3D-fast SPGR (3D-FSPGR) at 3 T after injection of contrast material were acquired for 14 small pituitary tumors. As quantitative methods, signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) were evaluated using a region-of-interest analysis.

There was no significant difference in SNR between 1.5-T SPGR and 3-T FSPGR, while 3-T IR was superior to 1.5-T SE. The 2D-SE and -IR provided significantly better CNR than 3D-GRE between tumor and normal structures.

Three Tesla was found to be superior to 1.5 T in distinguishing tumors from the normal sellar structure. Optimal dose planning will utilize each advantage of imaging; 3D-GRE allows high-resolution acquisition and 2D-SE and -IR can offer better tissue contrast.
