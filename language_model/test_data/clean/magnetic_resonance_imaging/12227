The measurement of absorbed dose distributions using dosemeter gel and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a standard geometry has been investigated. Absorbed depth-dose curves and profiles measured with this new technique show good agreement with corresponding measurements using diodes. This was proven in a 60Co beam as well as an electron beam. The dosemeter gel is made of agarose and ferrous sulphate solution. The dose response is linear (r = 0.9996) in the investigated dose interval, 0-40 Gy. The sensitivity is a factor of about six higher compared to ordinary ferrous sulphate solution, known as 'Fricke'. This is a true 3D dose measurement technique which will have a number of applications in radiation therapy, since it is possible to mould the gel to arbitrary geometries, mix different radiation qualities and integrate the absorbed dose from different kinds of fields.
