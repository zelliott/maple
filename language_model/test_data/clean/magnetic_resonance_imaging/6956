Pulmonary sequestration in infants and children is conventionally treated by resecting the sequestered lung parenchyma (sequestrectomy) or by performing lobectomy through a standard thoracotomy. We performed lobectomy by video-assisted thoracic surgery, using an original tracheal tube that we designed, in a 6-year-old boy with extralobar pulmonary sequestration and bronchiectasis in the left lower lobe.
