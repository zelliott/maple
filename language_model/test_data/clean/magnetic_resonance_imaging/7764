This study aimed to determine the relationship between delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (DE MRI) and ventricular tachyarrhythmia in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) with basal septal hypertrophy and preserved ejection fraction (EF).

One hundred seven patients with HCM with basal septal hypertrophy and EF greater than 50% underwent cine and DE MRI. Myocardial scar was identified with DE MRI. We assessed whether patient,s background, cine MRI findings, presence of myocardial scar, or number of scarred myocardial segments was related to the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia.

Patient,s age, family history of HCM, and number of scarred segments differed between the patients with and without the arrhythmia. A family history of HCM and number of scarred segments were significantly related to ventricular tachyarrhythmia (P < 0.01).

The number of scarred segments is the significant DE MRI parameter related to ventricular tachyarrhythmia in HCM with basal septal hypertrophy and preserved EF.
