The aim of this study was to elucidate a predictive value of electroencephalogram (EEG) during early infancy for later development of West syndrome (WS) in premature infants with cystic periventricular leukomalacia (PVL).

The subjects of this study were 19 infants with cystic PVL born between 1992 and 1996. EEGs were recorded at 3 months of corrected age (CA) in all of them. We divided these 19 infants into the following two groups; group A (n = 9), no paroxysmal discharge was recognized; and group B (n = 10), paroxysmal discharges were recognized.

In none of the infants in group A did WS develop. Subsequent EEGs were normal in all infants in group A. WS developed in seven of 10 infants in group B. The occurrence of WS is significantly higher in group B than in group A. The mean age at the onset of WS was 6 months of CA. Paroxysmal discharges in infants in group B were observed as irregular spikes-and-waves and polyspikes-and-waves, mainly in bilateral parietooccipital areas. In seven of eight patients with severe MRI findings in group B, WS developed.

Paroxysmal discharges during early infancy were correlated with later development of WS in infants with cystic PVL. The possibility of developing WS had increased in the children with the combination with EEG and MRI findings.
