A case of Rasmussen's encephalitis is reviewed. Focal seizures and hemiparesis in a 5-year-old child progressed over a period of 2 1/2 years. Neuroimaging findings showed progressive atrophy of the right temporal lobe. The diagnosis of this syndrome is possible using a combination of the clinical symptoms and neuroimaging findings.
