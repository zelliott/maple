We describe two methods of breast immobilization using the lateral decubitus position to increase patient comfort and access to the axillary tail for MR-guided biopsy in the postsurgical or irradiated breast. The first method uses a compression device with good immobilization but poor patient tolerance. The second approach uses a thermoplastic mesh material to form a rigid exoskeleton around the breast: immobilization is adequate and patient acceptability is good. The latter method is preferred and requires formal evaluation in larger scale trials.
