The value of MRI in the diagnosis of acute orbital floor fractures has not been clearly defined. We therefore compared MR findings with CT findings in patients with orbital trauma. In 30 patients with isolated orbital trauma both coronal CT and coronal MRI were used to examine the orbits and the adjacent paranasal sinuses. Visualization of anatomical landmarks, the kind and extent of traumatic lesions, as well as artifacts were scored. The scores were compared using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. Interexamination agreement between the two methods was calculated using a kappa analysis. All examinations had diagnostic quality: 30 fractures of the orbital floor (9 right and 21 left orbital floor fractures) were identified. In addition, CT showed fractures of the medial orbital wall in 19 patients (63.3%), of the lateral wall in 10 patients (33.3%), of the zygomatic arch in 2 patients (6.7%), and of the maxillary sinus in 4 patients (13.3%). Soft tissue herniation was shown in 13 patients (inferior rectus muscle twice, orbital fat in 11 cases). Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated soft tissue herniation in 21 patients: muscle in 4, orbital fat in 17 cases. Magnetic resonance imaging is able to demonstrate orbital floor fractures as sensitively as CT, but CT is superior to MRI in showing small and associated fractures; therefore, CT remains in orbital fractures the imaging modality of choice. Magnetic resonance imaging is superior to CT in showing soft tissue herniations; therefore, MRI may have a role as an adjunct to CT if soft tissue entrapment remains unclear.
