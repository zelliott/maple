This report describes the treatment of a 39-year-old man with recurrent medulloblastoma previously treated with extensive chemotherapy and radiation therapy. A novel treatment technique combining paclitaxel (275 mg IV bolus) and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (30 Gy in six fractions over 3 weeks) was given to palliate the patient's significant neurologic symptoms. The patient experienced a significant improvement both radiographically and in the quality of his life at follow-up 5 months after completion of treatment. No toxicity has been observed. The treatment of medulloblastoma with paclitaxel and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, either alone or in combination, merits further investigation.
