A new dual temporal resolution-based, high spatial resolution, pharmacokinetic parametric mapping method is described--improved coverage and spatial resolution using dual injection dynamic contrast-enhanced (ICE-DICE) MRI. In a dual-bolus dynamic contrast-enhanced-MRI acquisition protocol, a high temporal resolution prebolus is followed by a high spatial resolution main bolus to allow high spatial resolution parametric mapping for cerebral tumors. The measured plasma concentration curves from the dual-bolus data were used to reconstruct a high temporal resolution arterial input function. The new method reduces errors resulting from uncertainty in the temporal alignment of the arterial input function, tissue response function, and sampling grid. The technique provides high spatial resolution 3D pharmacokinetic maps (voxel size 1.0 × 1.0 × 2.0 mm(3)) with whole brain coverage and greater parameter accuracy than that was possible with the conventional single temporal resolution methods. High spatial resolution imaging of brain lesions is highly desirable for small lesions and to support investigation of heterogeneity within pathological tissue and peripheral invasion at the interface between diseased and normal brain. The new method has the potential to be used to improve dynamic contrast-enhanced-MRI techniques in general.
