Slowly progressive asymmetric parkinsonism and cortical dysfunction clinically characterize corticobasal syndrome (CBS). Various pathologic findings, including corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy, and frontotemporal degenerations, underlie CBS.

To determine if regional cortical and corpus callosum atrophy and subcortical and periventricular white matter (SPWM) signal changes on head magnetic resonance imaging were specific to CBD.

Historical review of autopsy cases.

Subspecialized behavioral neurology and movement disorder clinics within a neurology department of a tertiary referral center.

Seventeen patients with CBS who had an autopsy-confirmed diagnosis of CBD or another neurodegenerative disease.

Regional cerebral cortical atrophy, regional corpus callosum atrophy, and SPWM signal changes.

Similar patterns of regional atrophy and SPWM signal changes were found in the patients with autopsy-proven CBD and in the patients with other neurodegenerative diseases.

Neither cortical nor corpus callosum atrophy nor SPWM signal changes on head magnetic resonance imaging are specific to CBD.
