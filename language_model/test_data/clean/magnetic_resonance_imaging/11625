1H NMR line-shape analysis and magnetisation-transfer experiments at variable temperature and pressure have been used to elucidate the solution dynamics of both M and m isomers of three [Eu(dota-tetraamide)(H2O)]3+ complexes. The direct 1H NMR observation of the bound water signal allows the water-exchange rates on each isomer to be measured individually. They are definitely independent of the ligand for both M and m isomers (M: k298(ex)=9.4+/-0.2 x 10(3) s(-1) for [Eu(dotam)(H2O)]3+, 8.2+/-0.2 x 10(3) s(-1) for [Eu(dtma)(H2O)]3+ and 11.2+/-1.4 x 10(3) s(-1) for [Eu(dotmam)-(H2O)]3+; m: k298(ex)=474+/-130 x 10(3) s(-1) for [Eu(dotam)(H2O)3+, 357+/-92 x 10(3) s(-1) for [Eu(dtma)(H2O)3+), and proceed through a dissociative mechanism (M isomers: deltaV++ = +4.9 cm3 mol(-1) for [Eu(dotam)(H2O)]3+ and + 6.9 cm3 mol(-1) for [Eu(dtma)(H2O)]3+). The overall water exchange only depends on the M/m isomeric ratio. The m isomer, which exchanges more quickly, is favoured by a-substitution of the ring nitrogen. Therefore the synthesis of DOTA-like ligands, which predominantly form complexes in the m form, should be a sufficient condition to ensure faster water exchange on potential Gd(III)-based contrast agents. Furthermore the activation parameters for the water-exchange and isomerisation processes are both compatible with a nonhydrated complex as intermediate.
