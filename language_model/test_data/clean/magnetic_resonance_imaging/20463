Neurogenic stunned myocardium is characterized by reversible left ventricular dysfunction, which occurs after severe central nervous system injury in patients without coronary artery disease. It has been described in association with subarachnoid hemorrhage, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, and metastatic brain tumors in adults, but has been rarely reported in association with acute myelitis. Described here is a novel case of acute myelitis in a child associated with neurogenic stunned myocardium. This case demonstrates that patients with acute myelitis may harbor a risk of sympathetic dysregulation, leading to neurogenic myocardial dysfunction.
