To our knowledge, there has been no report of ophthalmologic findings related with a duplicated abducens nerve in the ophthalmic literature. This study reports such findings.

An ophthalmologic examination was performed in one patient with a duplicated abducens nerve, revealed with thin-sectioned magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) across the brainstem level.

The MRI disclosed a duplicated left abducens nerve. The patient was orthotropic in five cardinal positions, and her ductions and versions were full.

One patient with a duplicated abducens nerve showed orthotropia and normal ocular movement.
