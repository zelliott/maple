Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using steady-state free precession (SSFP) sequences was described in the early years of MR imaging. However, due to hardware imperfections, these techniques were not robust enough at the time to play any significant role in clinical MRI. More recently, significant hardware improvements became widely available, and the SSFP sequences such as TrueFISP (true fast imaging with steady-state precession) became very popular for a variety of clinical applications due to the distinct improvements in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). The purpose of this article is to give an overview on the basics of TrueFISP imaging and to demonstrate its potential for current clinical applications with a focus on cardiovascular MRI.
