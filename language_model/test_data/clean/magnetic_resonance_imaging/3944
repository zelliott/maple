Of the epileptic patients who were treated for > or = 5 years until the end of 1990 and had more than four seizures in 1990, 63 patients had been treated without interruption until the end of 1995. We analyzed their clinical courses from 1990 to 1995 prospectively. More than half the subjects were diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. Twenty cases had presumed etiology, and 32 had neuropsychiatric complications. Of the subjects whose seizures were not controlled with conventional antiepileptic drugs (AED), 11 cases demonstrated significant improvement when new AED; that is, lamotrigine, vigabatrin, clobazam, topiramate, tiagabine or CGP33101 were added. However, 10 patients did not respond to new AED. Presumed etiology, neuropsychiatric complications, multiple epileptic foci in EEG and abnormalities on head CT or MRI were characteristics of the patients whose seizures were resistant to new AED.
