Indirect magnetic resonance arthrography (I-MRA) confers significant logistical advantages over direct MRA and does not require articular injection. In this study, we determined the diagnostic performance of I-MRA in relation to conventional MRI and arthroscopy or surgery in detecting tears of the glenoid labrum, including Bankart lesions and superior labral antero-posterior (SLAP) tears in a standard clinical setting.

Ninety-one symptomatic patients underwent conventional MRI and I-MRA of the affected shoulder, followed by either arthroscopy or open surgery. The scans were interpreted independently by two experienced radiology consultants with a special interest in musculoskeletal radiology. Using the surgical findings as the standard of reference, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of conventional non-contrast MRI and I-MRA in the detection of labral tears were calculated.

The sensitivity of I-MRA was 95 and 97 %, respectively, for two radiologists as opposed to 79 and 83 % for conventional MRI. For both radiologists, the specificity of I-MRA, as well as MRI, was 91 % for detection of labral tears of all types. Accuracy of diagnosis was 93 and 95 %, respectively, for two radiologists with indirect MRA, compared to 84 and 86 % with non-contrast MRI.

This retrospective study shows that I-MRA is a highly accurate and sensitive method for the detection of labral tears. The data obtained supports the use of I-MRA as standard practice in patients with shoulder instability due to suspected labral pathology where further investigative imaging is indicated.
