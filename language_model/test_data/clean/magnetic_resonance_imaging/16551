Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments are more complex compared with standard radiological imaging, involving additional data streams and hardware along with complex analysis methods. Here, we propose guidelines based around mitigating risks associated with the complexities of the technique at the level of the individual imaging protocol, including workable and effective quality assurance/quality control procedures and rigorous, predefined, analysis pipelines. Our aim is to provide a framework for 'good imaging practice' (GIP), enabling these requirements to be addressed at an appropriate level of detail. The development of a procedural framework for GIP in pharmaceutical fMRI studies could lead to greater acceptance of the method within industry and facilitate validation and, eventually, qualification of the technique as an imaging biomarker.
