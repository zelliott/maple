MRA by means of flow-phased gradient echo sequences is a valuable addition to phlebography for showing the extent of thrombosis in the veins of the pelvis and lower limbs. In eight out of 32 patients in whom the extent of deep vein thrombosis was not clearly shown by phlebography, it was possible to demonstrate the involvement of the inferior vena cava. Three of these patients had bilateral pelvic vein thrombosis. In seven out of 32 cases, thrombosis on the opposite side, which was not apparent clinically, could be demonstrated by MRA. Seven out of 32 patients showed involvement of the internal iliac vein. MRA is also valuable for observing the effect of treatment.
