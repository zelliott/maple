We investigated the in vivo effects of a novel aquaporin 4 (AQP4) inhibitor 2-(nicotinamide)-1,3,4-thiadiazole, TGN-020, in a mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia using 7.0-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Pretreatment with TGN-020 significantly reduced brain edema associated with brain ischemia, as reflected by percentage of brain swelling volume (%BSV), 12.1 ± 6.3% in the treated group, compared to (20.8 ± 5.9%) in the control group (p < 0.05), and in the size of cortical infarction as reflected by the percentage of hemispheric lesion volume (%HLV), 20.0 ± 7.6% in the treated group, compared to 30.0 ± 9.1% in the control group (p < 0.05). The study indicated the potential pharmacological use of AQP4 inhibition in reducing brain edema associated with focal ischemia.
