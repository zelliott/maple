This study was designed to assess whether breath-hold cardiac multiecho imaging at 3.0 T is achievable without significant image artefacts and if fat/water phase interference modulates the exponential T2* signal decay. Twelve healthy volunteers (mean age 39) were imaged on a Philips Intera 3.0 T MRI scanner. Multiecho imaging was performed with a breath-hold spoiled gradient echo sequence with a seven echo readout (echo times 1.15-8.05 ms, repetition time 11 ms) using a black-blood prepulse and volume shimming. T2* values were calculated with both mono- and biexpoential fits from the mean signal intensity of the interventricular septum. The global mean T2* was 27.3 ms +/- 6.4. The mean signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the septum was 22.8 +/- 9.9, and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the septum to the left ventricular cavity 20.3 +/- 9.4. A better fit was obtained with a biexponential model and the mean fat fraction derived was 3.7%. Cardiac functional parameters were in the normal range and showed no correlation with T2*. Cardiac T2* estimation with gradient multiecho imaging at 3.0 T can be achieved with minimal artefact and modelling the signal decay with a biexponential function allows estimation of myocardial lipid content as well as T2* decay.
