To evaluate outcomes in a single-surgeon series of ulnar shortening osteotomy for the treatment of traumatic isolated tears to the lunotriquetral interosseous ligament (LTIL).

This study includes 53 consecutive cases of posttraumatic isolated LTIL tears treated with ulnar shortening osteotomy with minimum 1-year follow-up (range, 1.0-10.6 y). We confirmed all LTIL tears via arthroscopy before performing a precision 2.5-mm oblique osteotomy using a modified Rayhack technique. We assessed outcomes using grip strength measurements and Chun and Palmer's modified Gartland Werley wrist scoring system, which includes subjective and objective outcome measures.

Preoperatively, 45 cases were graded as fair (28%; n = 15) or poor (57%; n = 30) on the modified Gartland Werley score. There were insufficient data to calculate grades in 8 cases (15%). At final follow-up, most patients exhibited excellent (51%; n = 27) or good (32%; n = 17) scores, some scored fair (17%; n = 9), and none scored as poor. All subjective and objective variables significantly improved over a mean follow-up of 36 months (range, 12-127 mo). Mean grip strength increased from a value of 23 kg before surgery to 33 kg over the same period, a 41% increase. All patients achieved clinical and radiographic union by 10 months. Osteotomy plates were removed routinely in most cases (89%; n = 47) at a mean of 17 months.

Ulnar shortening osteotomy reduced symptoms of posttraumatic isolated LTIL tears in this single-surgeon series.

Therapeutic IV.
