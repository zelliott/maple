Despite substantial evidence that the prefrontal cortex does not function normally in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, evidence for prefrontal structural abnormalities, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has been inconsistent. Additionally, evidence for relationships between prefrontal structural and functional measures has been limited. The inconsistencies in the MRI literature are, at least in part, due to a lack of standard and specific measurement protocols that allow delineation of functionally distinct cortical regions. In this study, reliable methods for measuring an estimate of area 46 (estimate referred to as area 46(e)), as defined by 'Cereb. Cortex 5 (1995) 323', were developed and used to examine relationships between area 46(e) volumes, working memory, and symptom severity in 23 male patients and 23 healthy male comparison subjects. Patients performed more poorly than healthy reference subjects on all cognitive measures including measures of spatial and non-spatial working memory, but showed no significant corresponding deficits in area 46(e) volumes or whole brain volumes. Moreover, there were no significant relationships between symptom severity and area 46(e) volumes. These findings suggest that the prefrontal functional abnormalities observed in schizophrenia may occur in the absence of prefrontal volume deficits, and may instead involve more widespread brain systems or prefrontal connections with other brain regions.
