Primary fallopian tube carcinoma (PFTC) is a rare malignant carcinoma among all genital tract malignancies. It occurs most commonly in postmenopausal women and is similar to ovarian malignancy historically and clinically. Because of its insidious onset and silent course, the diagnosis is made usually postoperatively. Liquid-based cytology (LBC) is a type of method for cervical cancer screening, but sometimes it may aid in making PFTC diagnosis. We report a 47-year-old woman with PFTC, whose diagnosis was made with the aid of LBC.
