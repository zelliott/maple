The Mangina-Test provides a neuropsychometric assessment of varying degrees of "Analytical-Specific Visual Perception", i.e., the ability to identify simple stimuli inserted into more complex ones according to their exact geometrical properties in a limited span of time. Perceptual analysis of stimuli dealing with the exact discrimination of size and dimension is related more to mathematical abilities (MATH), while perceptual analysis of direction and spatial orientation is related more to abilities in reading and reading comprehension (READ). Some stimuli are MIXED since they deal with both of the above features combined. We previously determined the distributed neuronal network of analytical-specific visual perceptual processes as measured by the Mangina-Test. Here, we aim at further assessing as to how brain activity is differentially modulated by the discrimination of very subtle category-specific perceptual relationships. Brain activity was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging in 12 young healthy subjects while they performed a computer-adapted version of the Mangina-Test. Behavioral results of the present study indicate that performance was not different among stimulus categories. However, brain functional data show that analytical-specific perceptual processes for MATH, READ and MIXED stimuli rely on partially distinct brain circuits. Bilateral posterior parietal, premotor and prefrontal regions along with the anterior cingulate appeared to be more activated by MATH stimuli, while READ stimuli predominantly activated bilateral medial occipito-temporal, amygdala/parahippocampal and sensorimotor cortices, and the right inferior frontal cortex. Moreover, the posterior parahippocampal cortex showed a higher activity specifically for MIXED stimuli. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that in the Mangina-Test, the exact discrimination of very subtle perceptual relationships between geometrical stimuli distinctly modulates cerebral activity, so that category-specific brain responses can be related to identifiable cognitive abilities.
