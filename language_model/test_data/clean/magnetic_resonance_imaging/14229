Gradient-echo sequences with different amount of flow velocity compensation have been studied using cardiac gating in cine mode MR angiography. The initial results on the leg of a healthy volunteer indicate that the circulatory dynamics may be studied qualitatively by means of these flow-sensitive angiograms.
