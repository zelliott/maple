We report a severe acute headache that occurred in conjunction with a solitary fresh lesion of multiple sclerosis in the periaqueductal gray region of a 16-year-old girl. This unique natural event supports the recent proposition, based on observations of patients with implanted electrodes, that perturbations of the periaqueductal gray region can produce headache. It also suggests that headaches accompanying attacks of multiple sclerosis are due to disturbances in particular regions of the brain.
