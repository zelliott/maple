We present a series of eight patients undergoing circumferential neural decompression and stabilization of the thoracolumbar spine via a single midline posterior approach, with complete vertebrectomy for a variety of indications. Four had primary tumours, two secondary tumours, one patient had tuberculosis and one had delayed deformity due to trauma. This single posterior approach is made possible via the use of an expandable cage that may be expanded in situ to offer anterior and middle column reconstruction. There were no major neurological complications and all patients with deficits improved postoperatively. Extensive posterior fixation was avoided with five patients undergoing a one above/one below fixation and three undergoing a two above/two below fixation. When combined with pedicle screw and rod fixation this anterior reconstruction makes a sound construct. The flexibility of this approach in the thoracolumbar spine, some of the biomechanical advantages and pitfalls are considered.
