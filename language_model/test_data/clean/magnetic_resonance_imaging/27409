Blepharospasm is rarely due to an identifiable etiology. In the majority of cases, imaging fails to reveal any structural lesion. Here we describe an otherwise healthy patient with blepharospasm who was found to have pontine capillary telangiectasia. We propose a potential association between blepharospasm and pontine capillary telangiectasia.
