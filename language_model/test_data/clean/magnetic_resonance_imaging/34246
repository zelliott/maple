In this longitudinal study, we evaluated the sensitivities of dual-echo, conventional spin-echo (CSE), and rapid-acquisition relaxation-enhanced (RARE) scans for detecting the appearance of new lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS). Dual echo, CSE, and RARE scans were obtained on four occasions each separated by 28 days from five patients with relapsing-remitting MS using a 1.5-Tesla machine. A total of 44 new lesions were detected by the two sequences. Thirty-five lesions were seen on both sequences, three only on CSE and six only on FSE. This study indicates that CSE may be substituted by RARE when monitoring short-term disease activity in MS.
