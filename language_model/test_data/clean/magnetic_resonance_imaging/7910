In the present article we report a cholesteatoma of the hypotympanum extending to the jugular foramen in a 16-year-old male with Treacher Collins syndrome. Preoperative imaging excluded jugular paraganglioma and set the diagnosis of cholesteatoma. We discuss the operative treatment via a large hypotympanotomy and creation of an open hypotympanic cavity. To the authors' knowledge this is the first description of hypotympanal cholesteatoma with such an extension, being treated through this approach.
