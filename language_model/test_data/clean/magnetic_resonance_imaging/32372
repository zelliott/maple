Congenital spinal dermal sinuses are relatively uncommon congenital abnormalities that result from abnormal neurulation. Lack of awareness about this problem, especially at the primary care level, results in these patients not being managed appropriately. This issue is highlighted in this case series of nine patients.

The nine patients--six males and three females--were treated over a 3-year period in two centres in the UK and India. The age varied from 212 months to 19 years. Clinical presentations included meningitis or neurological deficits. One was asymptomatic. MRI was done in all cases and showed the sinus tracts in all cases. In five cases, there were intramedullary dermoids and in the others the sinus tract ended either on the dura or blindly. All cases were treated surgically by excision of the sinus and tumour if any. In terms of the neurological status, one became normal, four improved and four remained the same. Of the four who remained the same, two had had normal neurological examination preoperatively. The mean duration from first assessment by a medical practitioner to correct diagnosis and referral to a neurosurgeon was 5 years (range 2 months to 18 years). Proper diagnosis and appropriate management was delayed in these cases because professionals were not aware of this condition.

Primary care physicians should be made more aware about congenital spinal dermal sinuses. This will facilitate early diagnosis and referral to specialist services.
