Velocity imaging with phase contrast (PC) MRI is a noninvasive tool for quantitative blood flow measurement in vivo. A shortcoming of conventional PC imaging is the reduction in temporal resolution as compared to the corresponding magnitude imaging. For the measurement of velocity in a single direction, the temporal resolution is halved because one must acquire two differentially flow-encoded images for every PC image frame to subtract out non-velocity-related image phase information. In this study, a high temporal resolution PC technique which retains both the spatial resolution and breath-hold length of conventional magnitude imaging is presented. Improvement by a factor of 2 in the temporal resolution was achieved by acquiring the differentially flow-encoded images in separate breath-holds rather than interleaved within a single breath-hold. Additionally, a multiecho readout was incorporated into the PC experiment to acquire more views per unit time than is possible with the single gradient-echo technique. A total improvement in temporal resolution by approximately 5 times over conventional PC imaging was achieved. A complete set of images containing velocity data in all three directions was acquired in four breath-holds, with a temporal resolution of 11.2 ms and an in-plane spatial resolution of 2 mm x 2 mm.
