Richardson observed an unusual clinical syndrome in the 1950s, which he later designated progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Over the past 25 years, although knowledge of this disorder has gradually improved, its cause is still unknown, pathogenesis is unclear, and there is still no definitive treatment for this disorder. This article reviews the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic criteria, neuropathology, neuroimaging, and treatment of PSP.
