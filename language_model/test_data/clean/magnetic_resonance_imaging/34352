To illustrate how an understanding of the basic biological responses of peripheral nerves to injury is important in formulating a rational treatment plan.

Peripheral nerve anatomy and physiology are described in a context that is relevant to understanding the different grades of peripheral nerve injury. Methods of evaluating and treating peripheral nerve injuries both medically and surgically are reviewed. Relevant scientific studies with potential clinical impact are also discussed.

The clinical symptoms, physical findings, and electrodiagnostic and imaging test results relevant to the diagnosis of peripheral nerve problems are reviewed. Conventional and new medical or surgical strategies in the management of peripheral nerve injuries and mass lesions are described.

The diagnosis and treatment of peripheral nerve injuries follow logically from an understanding of the biological responses of peripheral nerves after injury and during recovery.
