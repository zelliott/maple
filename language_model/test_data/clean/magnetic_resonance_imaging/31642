Studies of schizophrenia that combine imaging and genetic approaches attempt to map structural brain anomalies associated with genetic risk variants. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether variations in the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RN) were associated with structural brain characteristics of 73 minimally medicated first-episode non-affective psychotic patients. We did not find evidence for association between genetic variation in the IL-1RN gene and brain morphometry at early phases of the illness.
