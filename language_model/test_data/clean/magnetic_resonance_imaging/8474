Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a demyelinating brain disease caused by Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV). This disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. We report a 34-year-old man infected with HIV-1 who presented with frequent general tonic clonic seizure and left side weakness for 2 months. Clinical features and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings with hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging and low density on T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery involving multiple white matter were compatible with PML. He died of sepsis 2 months after diagnosis. Autopsy demonstrated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy according to characteristic histopathologic picture with multifocal demyelination, bizarre astrocytes formation and basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies in the oligodendrocytes. JCV genome was demonstrated in the nucleus of oligodendrocytes using in situ hybridization. In conclusion, in AIDS patients with neurologic signs and typical MRI findings who present with multifocal demyelination lesions, PML should be diagnosed clinically.
