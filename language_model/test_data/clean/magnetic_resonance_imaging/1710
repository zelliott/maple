The purpose of our study was to identify the characteristic MR imaging features of intramuscular myxoma.

We retrospectively reviewed the MR imaging features of 20 patients with intramuscular myxoma. Clinical assessment included the age and sex of the patient and location of the tumor. Radiologic evaluation included the lesion size and shape, border definition, signal on T1- and T2-weighted or fluid-sensitive MR sequences, enhancement pattern, presence or absence of a fat rind, and presence or absence of increased signal in the adjacent muscle on T2-weighted or fluid-sensitive MR sequences.

The mean age of patients presenting with intramuscular myxoma was 61 years (range, 15-85 years; median, 64 years). The mean lesion size was 6.9 cm (range, 3-17 cm; median, 6.3 cm). A peritumoral fat rind was present in 13 of the patients (65%) with myxoma, and an increased signal in the adjacent muscle on fluid-sensitive sequences was present in 11 patients (55%). Intramuscular myxomas were homogeneously low in signal intensity on T1-weighted MR sequences in 19 patients (95%), with all lesions showing a high signal intensity on T2-weighted or fluid-sensitive MR sequences. Twelve of the myxomas had well-defined borders, and eight had borders that were partially ill defined. Of the 11 lesions imaged after gadolinium administration, six (55%) showed intense heterogeneous enhancement.

Findings of a mass that on MR images shows a perilesional fat rind, the signal intensity of fluid, and an increased signal in the adjacent muscle on T2-weighted or fluid-sensitive MR sequences are strongly suggestive of intramuscular myxoma. The degree of lesion enhancement varies but is most frequently intense and heterogeneous. Although the recognition of these features likely will not obviate biopsy of any individual lesion, it will allow more accurate prebiopsy diagnosis and preoperative planning.
