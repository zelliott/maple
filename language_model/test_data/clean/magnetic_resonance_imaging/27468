Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology that involves multiple organs. Computed tomography is the first-line imaging modality for diagnosing sarcoidosis because of its capacity to detect hilar lymphadenopathy and pulmonary lesions. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging provides good soft tissue contrast that is useful for detecting sarcoidosis in some body parts, including skeletal muscle. Signal intensity on pre- and postcontrast T(1)- and T(2)-weighted imaging may reflect disease activity and the pathological appearance of sarcoidosis. In this review, we demonstrate these conventional MR imaging findings of hepatosplenic and muscular sarcoidosis and describe the usefulness of diffusion-weighted imaging for detecting sarcoidosis.
