A 55-year-old patient with severe arterial occlusive disease underwent a femoral artery bypass operation under combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia. Platelet count and coagulation tests were normal after phenprocoumon had been discontinued. The epidural catheter was removed on day 1 while the patient was under therapeutic dose heparin. On day 2 he complained about lower back pain going down both legs and tendon reflexes were absent on the left side. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a lumbar epidural haematoma, which together with a previously existing protrusion of the fourth lumbar disc, compressed the cauda equina. A neurosurgical consultation recommended a conservative approach. The symptoms resolved spontaneously and the patient was discharged in good condition 12 days after the operation.
