Although it has been shown that the phase of the MR signal from the brain is particularly prone to variation due to respiration, the overall physiological information contained in phase time series is not well understood. Here, we explore the different physiological processes contributing to the phase time series noise, identify their spatiotemporal characteristics and examine their relationship to BOLD-related and non-BOLD-related physiological noise in the magnitude time series. This was performed by manipulating the contribution of physiological noise to the total signal variance by modulating the TE and voxel volume, and using a short TR in order to adequately sample physiological signal fluctuations. The phase and magnitude signals were compared both before and after removal of signal fluctuations at the primary respiratory and cardiac frequencies with RETROICOR. We found that the temporal phase noise increased with TE at a faster rate than predicted by 1/TSNR as a result of physiological noise. As suggested by previous studies, the primary contributor to phase physiological noise was respiration-related effects which were manifested at a large scale (>1 cm). Notably, RETROICOR removed respiration-related large-scale artifacts and this resulted in considerable improvements in the temporal phase stability (7-90%). Physiological noise in the magnitude time series after RETROICOR consisted of low-frequency BOLD-related fluctuations (<0.13 Hz) localized to gray matter and the vasculature, and fluctuations in the vasculature correlated with slow (<0.1 Hz) variations in respiration volume and cardiac rhythm. Physiological noise in the phase signal after RETROICOR also occurred in frequencies below 0.13 Hz and was consistent with (1) residual large-scale magneto-mechanical effects correlated with slow variations in respiration volume and cardiac rhythm over time, and (2) local scale (<1 cm) effects localized in gray matter and vasculature most likely due to vascular dephasing mediated by a BOLD susceptibility change. While BOLD-related magnitude noise exhibited a TE dependence similar to BOLD, the 'BOLD-related' noise in the phase data increased with increasing TE and thus caused the overall phase noise to increase at a faster rate with TE than predicted by 1/TSNR. Interestingly, the spatial specificity of this effect was more evident for the higher resolution phase data, as opposed to the magnitude data, suggesting that at a higher spatial resolution the phase signal may contain more information on physiological processes than the magnitude signal.
