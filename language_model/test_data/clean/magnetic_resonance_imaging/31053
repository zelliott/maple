We review the anatomy of the masticator space and the localization of masticator space lesions on cross-sectional imaging. The magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography appearances of inflammatory, neoplastic, developmental and vascular masticator space lesions are discussed and illustrated. Benign processes and normal variations, which mimic masticator space pathology, are also considered.
