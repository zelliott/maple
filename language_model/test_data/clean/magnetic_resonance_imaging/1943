We present global and regional rates of brain atrophy measured on serially acquired T1-weighted brain MR images for a group of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and age-matched normal control (NC) subjects using the analysis procedure described in Part I. Three rates of brain atrophy: the rate of atrophy in the cerebrum, the rate of lateral ventricular enlargement and the rate of atrophy in the region of temporal lobes, were evaluated for 14 AD patients and 14 age-matched NC subjects. All three rates showed significant differences between the two groups. However, the greatest separation of the two groups was obtained when the regional rates were combined. This application has demonstrated that rates of brain atrophy, especially in specific regions of the brain, based on MR images can provide sensitive measures for evaluating the progression of AD. These measures will be useful for the evaluation of therapeutic effects of novel therapies for AD.
