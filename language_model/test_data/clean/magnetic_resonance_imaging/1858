Computerized tomographic colonography (CT colonography) is a new, non-invasive technique that has been developed over the last few years; it looks at the large bowel in detail. In this chapter we look at how the examination is performed and we consider how the images are displayed. We describe the normal features of the colon, as seen using this technique, as well as the features of common pathological conditions. We will discuss screening for colorectal cancer and the performance of CT colonography; we compare the latter with other procedures currently employed in the screening and diagnosis of colorectal pathology. We consider the difficulties in interpreting these CT colonographic images and look at ways to overcome such difficulties. Finally we discuss future developments of this exciting, new technique.
