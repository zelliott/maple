The aim of this study was to compare structure measures obtained from high-resolution MR images of the calcaneus and the distal radius with bone mineral density (BMD) of the spine and hip in the prediction of osteoporotic spine fracture status. High-resolution MR images of the calcaneus and radius were obtained in 24 post-menopausal women with spine fractures and 22 age-matched controls. Imaging was performed at 1.5 T using a T1-weighted spin-echo sequence (slice thickness 1 mm, in-plane spatial resolution 195 x 195 microm(2)). Structure analysis was performed using parameters analogous to standard histomorphometry. Bone mineral density of the spine was obtained using quantitative CT and of the hip with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Significant differences between both patient groups were obtained with BMD and all structure parameters ( p<0.05). Using receiver operating characteristic analysis to determine the diagnostic performance in differentiating both groups, the best results were found for BMD of the spine, one of the radial structure measures and a combination of the calcaneal structure measures. In this study BMD of the spine and structure measures of the distal radius were best suited to predict the osteoporotic fracture status of the spine. A combination of BMD and structure measures did not yield any additional information on fracture status.
