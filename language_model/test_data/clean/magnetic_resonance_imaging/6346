Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging was employed to evaluate musculoskeletal pathoanatomy, and proved to be extremely useful in characterizing knee pathology. Between October 1986 and November 1987, 24 patients with suspected traumatic ligament injuries were examined with high resolution MR imaging in the RMRC diagnostic center, Naples, with a 0.5 T superconducting magnet (5000 Magniscan CGR) using a surface coil and a 500/28 (repetition time: TR: ms/echo time: TE-ms), 1200-1600/35-105 spin-echo pulse sequence. Nineteen patients with positive MR imaging exams underwent diagnostic and/or therapeutic arthroscopy. Arthroscopy confirmed MR diagnosis in the whole of cases. In 6 patients with negative MR findings no arthroscopy followed and the patients' successful outcome confirmed the accuracy of MR negative predictive value. Such results prove MR imaging to have a high diagnostic accuracy in the evaluation of acute joint injuries of the knee. Moreover, MR imaging--an uninvasive screening technique--appears to have high potentials for the evaluation of those cases where diagnostic arthroscopy is not required.
