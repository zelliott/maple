Apnoea is a rare but well-known clinical presentation of the Chiari type I malformation. It may be either obstructive or central in nature, and has been described in children, adolescents and adults. Here, we report a 4-month-old infant who presented with frequent central sleep apnoeas leading to the diagnosis of a Chiari type I malformation. Surgical repair resulted in complete resolution of the symptoms, normal respiratory parameters during sleep and normal psychomotor development. This case illustrates a very early presentation of the Chiari type I malformation with central apnoeas and suggests that this aetiology should be considered in the differential diagnosis of central apnoeas in infants, especially when they are associated with other neurological sign or symptom.
