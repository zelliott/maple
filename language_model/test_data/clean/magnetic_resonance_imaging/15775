Status migrainosus is a condition characterized by a migraine attack causing disability, with or without aura, lasting for > 72 h. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this complication of migraine remain a matter of debate. We describe a migraine without aura patient who presented two episodes of status migrainosus associated with recurrent and reversible brain magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities. These abnormalities, confirmed also by positron emission tomography, suggest that status migrainosus can be associated with a condition of vasogenic cerebral oedema.
