Imaging of a 29-year-old man with seizures showed a frontal lobe mass with curvilinear narrow calcifications, cystic components and multiple flow-voids. An AVM was considered. A DSA confirmed the hypervascular nature of the lesion. It was resected and microscopic examination showed an anaplastic oligodendroglioma remarkable for a diffuse and hypertrophic vasculature with areas of frank vascular proliferation. The marked vascularity seen on the MRI, the gyriform calcifications and the cystic degeneration are all features which can be encountered in an AVM. This case illustrates that highly vascular malignant gliomas can simulate vascular lesions by radiology and may require an angiogram for diagnosis.
