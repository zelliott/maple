Developmentally regulated endothelial locus-1 (Del-1) is an extracellular matrix protein that is expressed by endothelial cells during embryological vascular development. We speculated that Del-1 may be reexpressed in ischemia and may be involved in endogenous angiogenesis.

Del-1 protein was detected by immunohistochemistry in murine ischemic hindlimb after femoral artery excision. To determine whether exogenous Del-1 would augment angiogenesis in vivo, Del-1 or vehicle was administered for 3 weeks by intramuscular injection of murine ischemic hindlimbs. Angiogenesis was quantified by gadolinium-MRI perfusion and capillary densitometry. We used a disc angiogenesis system (DAS) to characterize the angiogenic response to vehicle (PBS), Del-1, Del-1 mutant (altered RGD domain), Del-1 minor (truncated discoidin-I-like domain), or basic fibroblast growth factor. After 14 days, the discs were extracted and sectioned to quantify vascular growth by morphometry. Endogenous Del-1 protein expression was increased in ischemic hindlimbs. Administration of Del-1 increased hindlimb vascular flow index and capillary density. In the DAS, Del-1 doubled fibrovascular growth, as did basic fibroblast growth factor. However, angiogenesis was not enhanced by the Del-1 mutant or Del-1 minor proteins.

Del-1 is expressed in ischemic tissue. Del-1 stimulates angiogenesis, an effect that is dependent on the RGD motif and a second signaling sequence in the discoidin-I-like domain. Exogenous intramuscular administration of Del-1 significantly enhances angiogenesis in the murine ischemic hindlimb. Del-1 may prove to be a novel therapeutic agent for patients with ischemia.
