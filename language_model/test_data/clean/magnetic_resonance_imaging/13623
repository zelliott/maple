Twenty experts, members of a French medical network devoted to neurofibromatosis 1 have elaborated recommendations for the management of the disease. Bibliography was obtained through a Medline of articles from 1966 to 1999 for the terms neurofibromatosis, NF1, neurofibroma and from textbooks. A consensual document was written taking into account extracted data. An annual careful clinical examination is recommended except in cases with complications. Screening investigations are not recommended due to the rarity of complications, generally symptomatic and easily detected during the clinical follow-up. The only controversial exception might be magnetic resonance imaging for early detection of optic pathway gliomas in young children. A co-ordinated follow-up in specialised multidisciplinary centres, providing patients with a rational management, is recommended.
