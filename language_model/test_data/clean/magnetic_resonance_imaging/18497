That proximal joint, the glenohumeral joint is difficult to examine by simple X-rays which explains the numerous lateral views proposed; it is essential to know the precise indications and respective value of each of these views. Arthrography generally combined with computed tomography is an excellent examination for the study of the glenoidal labrum and the capsular structures. In other indications, particularly for the study of the rotator cuff, it tends to be replaced by MRI.
