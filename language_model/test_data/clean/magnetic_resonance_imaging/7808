A slow-involuting segmental haemangioma was initially treated conventionally. Proliferation recurred when treatment was stopped. When the effect of propranolol on haemangiomas was published, we treated this 2.5- year- old girl with it. The haemangioma finally regressed recorded on magnetic resonance imaging and at clinical follow-up.
