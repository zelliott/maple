This article reports a case of a complete discoid lateral meniscus with an anteriomedial cleavage tear in a 4-year-old boy diagnosed by MRI. The patient underwent arthroscopy with findings of a torn complete discoid lateral meniscus. As the peripheral rim of the meniscus was stable, a partial meniscectomy with reshaping was done. At follow-up two years postoperatively, the patient had recovered uneventfully.
