Although current computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have shown great utility in diagnosing various aspects traumatic brain injury, damage resulting from mild diffuse brain injury often goes undetected with these procedures. Newly developed MRI techniques, including magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), have been proposed to have enhanced sensitivities for identifying damage induced by both diffuse and focal brain injury. Results from recent initial studies with experimental models of brain injury suggest that MTI may be useful for evaluating diffuse white matter damage, while DWI may demonstrate regions of focal contusion more acutely and with greater accuracy than conventional MRI procedures.
