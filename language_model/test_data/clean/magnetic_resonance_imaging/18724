Measurements of left ventricular function at rest and during stress are useful for identifying myocardial ischemia, injury, and the risk of subsequent myocardial infarction. Without ionizing radiation or intravascular contrast administration, magnetic resonance imaging techniques can be used to acquire precise measurements of left ventricular function. This relatively new development may enhance a physician's ability to provide care to patients with cardiovascular disease.
