To assess the effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cine magnetic resonance imaging (cine-MRI) in the diagnosis of infantile congenital heart disease.

A total of 34 cases were studied with MRI and cine-MRI. The data were analyzed and compared with those of two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE), cardioangiography (CAG) and surgery.

The size of the defect or its caliber obtained from MRI in 6 patients with left to right shunt congenital heart disease was compatible with that observed in surgery (P = 0.924). Comparison of cine-MRI and CAG in 28 patients with complicated congenital heart disease showed that the diagnosis of 27 cases by cine-MRI was the same as that by CAG.

Both MRI and cine-MRI play an important role in diagnosing infantile congenital heart disease.
