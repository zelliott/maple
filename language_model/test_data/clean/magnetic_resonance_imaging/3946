Various types of fibromatosis have been reported in infancy and early childhood. We describe an infant with diffuse fibromatosis on the scalp. A one year and five months-old girl showed a diffuse and hard mass 3 x 5 cm in diameter and no tenderness on the scalp. Two months later, the size of the mass had increased and several other tumors appeared on the lateral head. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed that a large and diffuse tumor had spread from the frontal to occipital head; a 'helmet-like' configuration of the tumor was exhibited on sagittal MR images. The tumor showed high signal intensity on T2-weighted images and was enhanced with Gd-DTPA. Histological examination showed a fibroblastic proliferation with intervening thick collagen bundles. The patient was diagnosed as having diffuse fibromatosis. The tumor at the resection site immediately recurred, whereas the tumor in the frontal head showed marked regression. Three months after the resection, new tumors appeared in the occipital head. The size and number of these tumors have remained unchanged for more than 18 months. The sites and appearance of the tumors were identical to that of juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) in this patient. However, JHF usually includes fibroblasts associated with large amounts of hyalinized collagen-like material, which were not present in our patient. The different histology of JHF comparing our case and other reported cases may depend on the different phase of the disease progression at resection. Long-term observation is necessary for the appropriate diagnosis and evaluation of prognosis in this patient.
