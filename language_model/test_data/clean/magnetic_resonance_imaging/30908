We report a case of laparoscopic excision of a large symptomatic left seminal vesicle cyst and ipsilateral renal agenesis. A 26-year-old man presented with a 15-year history of dysuria and irritative voiding symptoms. The diagnostic evaluation revealed a 62 x 40 x 35-mm left seminal vesicle cyst. In addition, he had a solitary, right, functioning kidney, with no evidence of the left renal unit. Transperitoneal laparoscopic excision of the cyst was performed successfully. The total operative time was 190 minutes, and blood loss was minimal. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the second postoperative day and did not present with any complaints or complications thereafter.
