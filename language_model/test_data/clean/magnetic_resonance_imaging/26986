Uterine arteriovenous malformations are a rare and potentially life-threatening condition. Medical therapy has not been popular because of the propensity for excessive bleeding in the patient. As a result, the effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) agonists on uterine arteriovenous malformations has not been established.

A 30-year-old patient presented with persistent vaginal bleeding. Based on the color Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging findings, a uterine arteriovenous malformation was diagnosed. Because initial treatment with methylergonovine maleate was unsuccessful, the patient was treated with Gn-RH agonists. The lesion completely disappeared after 6 months of Gn-RH agonist treatment. Five months after the completion of Gn-RH agonist therapy, the patient conceived spontaneously and successfully completed a normal pregnancy. The patient has remained free from recurrence of the lesion.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy has the potential to be a conservative treatment modality for uterine arteriovenous malformations in hemodynamically stable patients.
