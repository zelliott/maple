The clinical differentiation of parkinsonian syndromes remains challenging not only for neurologists but also for movement disorder specialists. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) with the visual assessment of T2- and T1-weighted imaging as well as different advanced MRI techniques offer objective measures, which may be a useful tool in the diagnostic work-up of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonian disorders (APDs). In clinical practice, cMRI is a well-established method for the exclusion of symptomatic parkinsonism due to other pathologies. Over the past two decades, abnormalities in the basal ganglia and infratentorial structures have been shown especially in APDs not only by cMRI but also by different advanced MRI techniques, including methods to assess regional cerebral atrophy quantitatively such as magnetic resonance volumetry, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted imaging, and magnetization transfer imaging. This article aims to review recent research findings on the role of advanced MRI techniques in the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative parkinsonian disorders.
