CSF rhinorrhea due to a transsphenoidal approach usually follows accidental or intentional arachnoid opening. We report a patient with an intrasellar arachnoid cyst, who developed delayed onset of CSF rhinorrhea. A sixty-two-year-old man presented with bitemporal type visual field defect for the last 3 years. With the diagnosis of arachnoid cyst or Rathke's cleft cyst, based on MRI findings of intra-and supra-sellar cyst with CSF intensity, he successfully underwent transsphenoidal surgery without evidence of intra-operative CSF leakage. He developed CSF rhinorrhea one week later. This needed another operation for sellar floor repair. The pathomechanism of this delayed onset is explained as follows. Incomplete or oneway communication of subarachnoid space to cyst cavity, unrecognized during surgery, might cause delayed onset of CSF rhinorrhea. By using MRI, identification of the residual gland, which was compressed posteriorly, is useful for differentiating an arachnoid cyst from other cystic lesions. In highly suspect cases, even without evidence of intra-operative CSF leakage, peri-operative measures to prevent occurrence of postoperative CSF rhinorrhea are required.
