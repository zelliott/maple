The intrasphenoid form of basal cephalocele is uncommon. We describe the clinical, CT and MRI findings in two cases presenting in middle age with persistent cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea. Emphasis is placed upon the imaging findings which aid in discrimination of intrasphenoidal cephalocele from more common causes of a sphenoid sinus mass.
