A 10-year-old girl presented with a history of painful scoliosis. Imaging performed, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), demonstrated a lesion with radiological features consistent with an osteoid osteoma (OO) of the 6th thoracic vertebra. The patient was treated conservatively with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Over eight months of clinical and radiological surveillance, she became entirely asymptomatic and demonstrated complete resolution of the scoliotic curve. The CT and MRI features of the osteoid osteoma during the period of surveillance are presented and are correlated with the corresponding clinical features.
