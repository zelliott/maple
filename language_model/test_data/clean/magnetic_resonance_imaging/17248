Through a case of sellar and suprasellar tuberculoma which presented with central diabetes insipidus, the authors report the frequency of pituitary tuberculoma, its physiopathology, clinical presentation hormonal and radiological findings thus management and evolution. A 42 years old woman, with a history of erythema nodosum, presented with polyuria polydipsia (PUPD), amenorrhea and galactorrhea. Endocrine investigations showed central diabetes insipidus, elevated serum prolactin levels and cortisol failure. Magnetic resonance imagining scans (MRI) revealed a nodular thickening of the pituitary enlargement and loss of posterior pituitary hypointensity signal. Etiologic inquiry has removed the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, Langerhan's histosis, autoimmune hypophysitis and sellar metastasis. The history of erythema nodosum, the positivity of tuberculin skin test and the presence of koch bacillus in the bronchial fluid after culture led to a diagnosis of tuberculosis. Treatment was started with four drug antitubercular chemotherapy regimen for 2 months, and tow drug antitubercular chemotherapy regimen for 16 months. This treatment is associated with hydrocortisone, desmopressin nasal spray and bromocriptine. Under treatment, there was an improvement in clinical condition, disapearence of headache, PUPD and galactorrhea thus normalization of prolactin. A follow-up MRI, 8 months later, showed that pituitary lesion has been completely removed, suggesting our clinical and biology presumption. Pituitary tuberculosis is rare, however, when encountered, they may present a diagnostic difficulty. Accurate diagnosis and management is important because pituitary tuberculoma is curable.
