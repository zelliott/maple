We now report newly developed three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D-MRI) system which is based on semiautomatic tissue extraction from the axial MR images utilizing the fuzzy reasoning calculation method and 3D-image reconstruction with surface rendering. We also studied normal in vivo dynamic changes of the interosseous membrane (IOM) of forearm during rotation using this 3D-MRI. Serial axial MRI of right forearms of five healthy volunteers was obtained in five rotational positions, and extraction and 3D-reconstruction of the radius, ulna, and IOM was made using the system. Extraction results were well with the fuzzy reasoning method. 3D-MRI of the radius and ulna, IOM were reconstructed from these images respectively, and their 3D-shapes were almost identical to the anatomic shape. 3D-MRI showed there were wavy deformities on the IOM in pronation position in the all five subjects and dorsiflexion on the most dorsal portion of the IOM at maximum supination in three forearms. In neutral position, the IOM of all five volunteers was almost flat. From anatomic orientation, these dynamic changes of the IOM mainly occurred at the membranous portion, which is soft, thin, and elastic. Otherwise, the tendinous portion which is a thick and strong complex of 5 to 10 bundles run from proximal one third of the radius to distal one fourth of the ulna, demonstrated minimal dynamic changes on the 3D-MRI. Therefore, the tendinous portion is considered to be taut during rotation to provide stability between the radius and the ulna, while the membranous portion is easy to deform and allowing smooth rotation. Furthermore, because of wide-use, our 3D-MRI system is useful for in vivo analysis of soft tissue kinesiology in normal and abnormal musculoskeletal systems.
