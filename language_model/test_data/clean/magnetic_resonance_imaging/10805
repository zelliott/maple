We demonstrated a head injury case accompanied by multiple small high-density artifacts in the middle of the brain created by multislice CT scanning, due to the malfunction of a detector involved in reconstruction of the mid images. We named these objects high-density spot artifacts. The high-density spot artifacts resemble minute hemorrhages which appear as diffuse axonal injuries. Radiologists and neurosurgeons should be familiar with this the existence of artifact.
