Due to recent domestic measles outbreaks in Japan, the Japanese government has mandated measles vaccination at ages 14 and 17 since April 2008. Since then, the number of people receiving measles vaccination has increased in Japan. Measles vaccination may cause serious neurological complications including encephalopathy, although the incidence is very low. We report here an adult case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and myeloradiculoneuropathy following measles vaccination. Brain MRI demonstrated typical findings of PRES, high intensity signals in the occipital lobes on FLAIR imaging, isointensity signals on diffusion weighted imaging, with an increase in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Vasoconstriction mainly in the posterior cerebral arteries was detected by MRA. Physicians should keep in mind the possible occurrence of PRES and myeloradiculoneuropathy following measles vaccination.
