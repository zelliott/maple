Pheochromocytoma is a rare entity. When it presents during pregnancy, rapid recognition and diagnosis are crucial in order to avoid the maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality associated with severe, uncontrolled hypertension. Difficulties arise from the differential diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. We report two patients operated on for pheochromocytoma during pregnancy. The first patient developed new-onset hypertension in early pregnancy. Prior to presentation, there had been non-specific signs of endocrine disorder, namely a mild diabetes, but no hypertension requiring medication. The second patient sought medical care for irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, and fatigue during the 6th week of pregnancy. She was found to be hypertensive; diagnostic evaluation revealed substantially increased catecholamine levels. The diagnosis was made by elevated urinary catecholamines and by MRI scan as well as ultrasonography, both of which demonstrated an adrenal mass. Both patients underwent surgical extirpation of the affected adrenal gland. The procedure was performed laparoscopically in the case of the second patient. Pre-operatively, both patients were pre-treated with alpha-blockade followed by secondary beta-blockade. Patient two also received methyldopa for control of hypertension. Both patients were readily weaned from antihypertensive medications post-operatively, with complete resolution of hypertension within a few hours. Each pregnancy progressed normally to term.
