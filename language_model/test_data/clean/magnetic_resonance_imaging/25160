We present a case of a 40-year woman with bilateral parotid salivary gland enlargement as presentation of primary Sjögren's syndrome. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed parotid cysts, suggestive of cystic benign lymphoepithelial lesions. A sub-labial biopsy confirmed the syndrome. After 24-month follow-up, the left parotid cysts remain the same, whereas other cysts have appeared in the right parotid gland. Parotid involvement in Sjögren's syndrome is discussed.
