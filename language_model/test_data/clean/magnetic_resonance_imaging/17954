While clinical evaluation of breast implants and their complications can identify capsule contracture and rupture of saline implants, the identification of silicone implant failure is best accomplished by silicone specific protocols for MRI with orthogonal acquisition. Such imaging can also help resolve other clinical problems. Following a brief overview of the history and development of commercial use of silicone implants and alternatives, this article outlines the approach toward optimal imaging and expected results.
