MR studies of the lumbar spine in 111 patients were analyzed at 469 disks to assess the prevalence of intranuclear cleft (INC) in the lumbar intervertebral disk. MR studies were performed on either 0.1-tesla (T) magnet (69 patients) or 0.22-T magnet (42 patients). The pulse sequences reviewed were saturation recovery (SR; TR = 0.5 sec), short TR, TE spin echo (S-SE; TR = 0.5 sec, TE = 34 msec) and long TR, TE spin echo (L-SE; TR = 1.5 sec, TE = 68,80 msec). All study were done in a sagittal plane with 10 mm slice thickness. The conclusions were as follows: 1) On a 80 msec TE, 1.5 sec TR image, INCs were detected in more than 80% of disks in patients over 30 years old but in only 13.3% of disks in patients under 20 years old. 2) In both imaging system, L-SE showed INCs more frequently than SR and S-SE. 3) INCs were less frequently demonstrated in the disk with decreased signal intensity on 0.1-T magnet as compared with 0.22-T magnet. 4) On SR and S-SE, there is an increase in the prevalence of INC in the disk with decreased signal intensity. We suggest that the INC will be a good landmark of the pathological process of the lumbar disk, such as degeneration.
