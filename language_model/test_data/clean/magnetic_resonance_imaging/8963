Dementia remains an exclusion criterion in diagnosing multiple system atrophy (MSA). This study aimed to determine the cognitive changes and brain atrophy patterns in the Parkinsonian (MSA-P) and cerebellar (MSA-C) variants of MSA.

Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuro-psychological tests were applied to 10 MSA-C and 13 MSA-P patients, and compared to 37 age-matched controls. Correlation analyses were performed between cognitive test results and morphometric data extracted from the VBM data.

In neuro-psychological testing, the 23 MSA patients scored lower in the Stroop interference test and took longer in the trail-making test as compared with the controls, whereas MSA-C performed worse than MSA-P in the memory scores, Stroop test, and time to complete the trail-making test. MSA, as a group, showed atrophy in the cerebellum, insular cortex, fusiform gyrus, inferior orbito-frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and caudate nucleus. Memory scores correlated well with pre-frontal lobe atrophy but not in the insular area.

In conclusion, although dementia is not a typical presenting feature of MSA and is regarded as a sub-cortical movement disorder, frontal atrophy, cognitive changes, and dementia are identifiable as MSA progresses.
