The objective of this study was to validate quantitation of R2* and DeltaR2* measurements obtained with a 3-dimensional (3-D) multiple gradient-recalled echo (mGRE) sequence for evaluating intrarenal oxygenation in humans.

Validation was accomplished (1) by comparing R2* values with previously established 2-D techniques (n = 5, mean age = 33.6 years) and (2) by measuring change in DeltaR2* after furosemide (20 mg intravenously) administration (n = 5, mean age = 22 years). Additional pre- and postfurosemide scans were done at 1.5 T for comparison purposes.

R2* measurements with the 3-D technique showed good agreement with the 2-D techniques. The baseline medullary R2* at 3.0 T was about twice the value found at 1.5 T. Furosemide-induced change in R2* was observed within 5 minutes after administration.

R2* measurements with 3-D mGRE were comparable with those reported using 2-D techniques. The 3-D implementation facilitates observation of temporal changes in the medullary oxygenation without compromising spatial coverage.
