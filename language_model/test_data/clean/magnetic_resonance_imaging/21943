We present a rare case of venous hemangioma in the temporalis muscle that repeatedly and spontaneously enlarged and disappeared over several months. MR imaging depicted multiple fluid-fluid levels in the tumor alongside characteristic findings of hemangioma, indicating that the peculiar course was due to hemorrhage and blood resorption within the tumor.
