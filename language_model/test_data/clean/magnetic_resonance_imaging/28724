A contrast-enhanced, gradient-echo 3D pulse sequence providing angiographic information in 24 s was tested in five healthy subjects and used prospectively in 21 patients for the investigation of the cervical arteries. Indications included suspected stenosis of the carotid (in 13), or vertebral arteries (in 1), carotid dissection (3), variants of the branches of the aortic arch (2) and extracranial carotid aneurysms (2). The results in all patients were compared with those of intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA). In patients with carotid stenosis, they were also compared with high-resolution 3D time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiography (MRA). Good quality MR angiograms of the neck vessels were obtained with the fast 3D sequence in 20 of the 21 patients. One claustrophobic patient was unable to cooperate. The degree of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis was graded correctly (compared to DSA) in 21 of 24 cases (87.5%). Two mild stenoses were overestimated as moderate using the fast MR sequence and one high-grade stenosis was misdiagnosed as a complete occlusion. Carotid dissection was confirmed in one case and correctly excluded in two. Four extracranial ICA aneurysms in two patients, arterial variants and stenosis of the origin of the vertebral artery were correctly diagnosed using the contrast-enhanced MR angiogram. Three-dimensional TOF MRA was unsuccessful due to motion artefacts in half of the cases of ICA stenosis.
