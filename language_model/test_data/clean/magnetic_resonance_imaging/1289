The chopper fat suppression (CFS) pulse sequence, which is a phase sensitive implementation of the Dixon fat suppression method and the spin echo (SE) pulse sequence, was used in the evaluation of anatomic structures of the normal knee using 48 sets of imaging sequences in six volunteers using a repetition time/echo time combination of 1,500/30, 60 ms. A demonstration of the CFS technique in 10 patients with suspected knee pathology is also presented. A semiquantitative grading scale was established to rate anatomic visualization and used to compare CFS and SE pulse sequence techniques. The results in normal subjects demonstrate that hyaline cartilage is significantly better visualized by fat suppression pulse sequence than by conventional SE pulse sequence in the coronal and sagittal planes of imaging (p less than 0.001). The preliminary results from patients studies suggest that CFS imaging may be useful in the evaluation of meniscal tears, in the differentiation of hyaline cartilage from joint fluid, and in the detection of both soft tissue and bone injuries.
