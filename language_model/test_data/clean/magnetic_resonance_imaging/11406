To describe the clinical features of an intracranial glomus tumor with orbital extension.

Case report.

A 15-year-old girl was examined for a large, vascular intracranial mass extending into the orbit. Attempted orbital biopsy was aborted for fear of uncontrollable hemorrhage. Tumor embolization and partial resection was performed. Histology was consistent with paraganglioma (glomus tumor).

The orbital surgeon should include glomus tumor in the differential diagnosis of vascular orbital lesions. Their vascularity and hemorrhagic potential should be considered when approaching these lesions surgically.
