Major papilla pancreatic sphincter dysfunction, a variant of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, causes pancreatitis and pancreatic-type pain. The gold standard for diagnosis is sphincter of Oddi manometry, most commonly performed at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Noninvasive testing, such as secretin-stimulated transabdominal or endoscopic ultrasound assessment of pancreatic duct diameter, is less reliable and has relatively low sensitivity. Two thirds of patients with biliary sphincter of Oddi dysfunction have elevated pancreatic basal sphincter pressure. To maximize the diagnostic yield of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, both the biliary and pancreatic sphincter pressures should be measured. Patients with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction may respond to biliary sphincterotomy alone, but evaluation of their pancreatic sphincter is warranted if symptoms persist after biliary therapy alone. Whether both biliary and pancreatic sphincters should be treated at the first ERCP session is controversial. Biliary and pancreatic endoscopic sphincterotomies are associated with two- to fourfold increased incidence of pancreatitis following the procedure in patients with pancreatic sphincter hypertension. Prophylactic pancreatic duct stenting reduces the frequency and severity of complications by greater than 50%.
