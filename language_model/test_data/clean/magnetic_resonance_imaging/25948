The sinonasal tract and, more specifically, the ethmoid sinus, are uncommon sites for metastatic tumors. Fewer than 100 cases have been reported in the world literature. We report the case of a 65-year-ol woman who underwent nephrectomy and adrenalectomy for renal cell carcinoma (hypernephroma) with adrenal metastasis. Four months later the patient was seen for repeated epistaxis and nasal obstruction, which was diagnosed as ethmoidal metastasis of renal adenocarcinoma in a second biopsy. The second metastasis was removed by lateral rhinotomy but recurred six months later. Palliative surgery was performed and the patient died eight months later from brain metastases. Therapeutic strategies for metastatic nasal tumors are reviewed.
