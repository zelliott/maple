Paranasal mucoceles are regarded as slow-growing and benign lesions. They are usually recognized by otorhinolaryngologists, but a clinically relevant mucocele with orbital complications may present to an ophthalmologist. We report a 15-year-old's case with unilateral reduced ocular motility due to bilateral frontal mucocele associated with grade II nasal polyposis.
