Scrofuloderma is tuberculosis of subcutaneous tissue that ulcerates and drains through the overlying skin. It most commonly occurs in the neck from a cervical lymph node source. Although such lymphatic spread is the usual clinical picture, there are sporadic reports in the literature of direct hematogenous seeding of subcutaneous tissue forming a tuberculoma, or "cold abscess." Definitive diagnosis requires the identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis within the suspect lesion. Surgical intervention is necessary in any draining lesion and should be accompanied by appropriate antituberculous chemotherapy. Accounts of bone and joint involvement are numerous, but the orthopedic surgeon must also be aware of the soft-tissue manifestations of tuberculosis and the indications for surgery. We report on an immunocompromised patient who presented with a rare case of scrofuloderma of the lower extremity, which was treated with wide resection.
