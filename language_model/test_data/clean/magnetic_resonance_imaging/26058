A rare case of intramedullary spinal cord metastasis associated with hemorrhage was reported. A 74-year-old man had a subacute onset of paraparesis. He became almost paraplegic within a few days. MRI revealed an intramedullary spinal lesion in the epiconus at the Th 11 and Th 12 level, but spinal angiography did not show any abnormality. Since repeated MRI showed enlargement of the lesion, surgery was performed under the diagnosis of an intramedullary spinal cord tumor. Under general anesthesia, a midline myelotomy of about 3 cm was performed and a grayish, elastic and circumscribed tumor as well as a liquefied hematoma in the caudal part was observed. Both the tumor and the hematoma were removed almost totally. The patient's paraparesis improved slightly after surgery. The histological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma. The primary source was unknown, but multiple small metastatic tumors were found in the lung, liver and brain, etc. Hemorrhage from intramedullary spinal cord metastasis is extremely rare with only 6 reported cases in the recent literature. Rapid deterioration of symptoms caused by the hematoma may make the diagnosis more difficult. Indication of surgical treatment should be carefully determined because prognosis of intramedullary spinal cord metastasis is generally very poor.
