Neurocysticercosis is the most common parasitic disease of the central nervous system. Its incidence diminished dramatically in the last decades in our country, but due to emigration from endemic areas is expected an increase in the next years. In spite of the new immunologic and neuroradiographic techniques, diagnostic of centeinty may be very difficult. In this way exists controversy about the appropriate treatment. We present a case of mixed neurocysticercosis with parenchymal and meningeal disease that shows the difficulty of this disease in its diagnostic and treatment.
