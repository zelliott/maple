Eight cases of pericallosal lipomas were studied by MR imaging at 1.5 Tesla. All were located around the splenium of the corpus callosum, and were classified as the curvilinear type. Corpus callosal abnormalities were detected in the six of these eight cases, and included two cases of short corpus callosum and four of thin splenium. The larger lipomas tended to have greater abnormalities of the corpus callosum. T1-weighted sagittal images were the most useful pulse sequences for diagnosing pericallosal lipomas and corpus callosal abnormalities. On review of the literature we found that the curvilinear type of pericallosal lipoma is more frequently observed by MR imaging than the tubulonodular type.
