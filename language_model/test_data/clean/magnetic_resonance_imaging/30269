Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder is a condition of benign hyperplasia of unknown aetiology, characterised by local or diffuse thickening of the muscular layer, with invagination of the epithelium, forming Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses. Magnetic resonance imaging features are specific and help in the definitive diagnosis of this condition. A 50-year-old obese woman presented with episodic pain in the right hypochondrium. Ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed typical features of adenomyomatosis, which was subsequently confirmed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
