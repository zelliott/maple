Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a new, non-invasive neuroradiological diagnostic procedure for direct multiplanar visualization of the anatomic structures of pituitary gland infundibulum. MRI is extremely sensitive in demonstrating pathological changes of infundibulum, and is a method of choice for diagnosis of its breakage. Forty-eight patients with pituitary hypofunction have been examined on MRI to demonstrate empty sellae and/or breakage of infundibulum. Pathological changes of infundibulum were found in 11 patients, five of which had breakage (congenital or traumatic). Optimal MRI protocol, with application of paramagnetic contrast agent, for examination of pituitary gland has been established.
