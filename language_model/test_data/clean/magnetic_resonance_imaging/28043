Twenty four pediatric migraineurs were prospectively evaluated to determine if white matter hyperintensities were present on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). None had white matter findings or brain abnormalities. Five had mucoperiosteal thickening of the paranasal sinuses, which were unrelated to the patients' clinical course. MRI white matter findings are probably not a common occurrence in pediatric migraineurs. In addition, MRI sinus findings are not necessarily related to a child's headache complaints.
