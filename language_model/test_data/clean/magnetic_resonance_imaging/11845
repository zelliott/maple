Although mycosis fungoides is a malignant T-cell lymphoma involving mainly the skin, neurological complications are possible, with a poor prognosis.

A 59-year-old man, treated for mycosis fungoides with transformation to a pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma for 1 year, was seen for mental status changes with confusion. A brain parenchyma localisation was found.

This observation emphasizes the exceptional neurological tropism in the patients with mycosis fungoides. A transformation to a more aggressive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma seems necessary to induce a central nervous system involvement.
