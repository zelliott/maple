The aim of this study was to compare postmortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the renal system with autopsy in perinatal and fetal deaths. 37 deaths were studied and renal abnormalities were found in five of these cases. Postmortem MRI provided information of diagnostic utility comparable to that obtained by autopsy.
