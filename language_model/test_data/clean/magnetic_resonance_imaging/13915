To study the predictive value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of thoracolumbar spine fractures concerning the radiologic and clinical outcome.

Disagreement about the proper treatment of thoracolumbar spine fractures is caused by insufficiency of conventional imaging techniques. Previous studies have shown that MRI is capable of distinguishing injury to all structures of the fractured spine and thus may help develop schemes with higher predictive power.

A total of 53 patients with 71 fractures were studied with MRI in a prospective fashion. A total of 24 patients with 39 fractures were treated conservatively and 29 patients with 32 fractures were treated operatively after a protocol concerning the treatment options. MRI scans were obtained within 1 week of injury and at the 2-year follow-up. Pain scores were obtained at the 2-year follow-up. Previously described MRI schemes concerning the trauma and post-trauma conditions were used.

An unfavorable outcome in the conservative group was related to the progression of kyphosis, which in most cases was predictable with the use of trauma MRI findings concerning the endplate comminution and vertebral body involvement. In the operatively treated group, recurrence of the kyphotic deformity was predictable by the lesion of the posterior longitudinal ligamentary complex together with endplate comminution and vertebral body involvement as seen on trauma MRI. The authors recommend the use of MRI to develop reliable prognostic criteria for these injuries.
