Intermolecular double quantum coherences (iDQCs), signals that result from simultaneous transitions of two or more separated spins, are known to produce images that are highly sensitive to subvoxel structure, particularly local anisotropy. Here we demonstrate how iDQCs signal can be used to efficiently detect the anisotropy created in breast tumor tissues and prostate tumor tissues by targeted (LHRH-conjugated) superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPIONs), thereby distinguishing the necrotic area from the surrounding tumor tissue.
