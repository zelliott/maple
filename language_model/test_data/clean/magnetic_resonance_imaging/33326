The results of magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine in 33 patients with mono- and bilateral pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PES) and cervical osteochondrosis are presented. The protrusion of intervertebral discs localized in the site of ciliospinal center and rarer in the site of superior cervical sympathetic ganglion is found. The protrusion of intervertebral discs in patients with PES was associated with compression of spinal roots significantly more often than in patients with cataract and osteochondrosis but without PES (control group). The side of protrusion and compression of spinal roots corresponded to the side of PES in more than 50% of cases. Compressive disorders of cervical spinal structures may be of considerable importance in pathogenesis of PES.
