Three-dimensional virtual imaging using reconstructed volume data from helical computed tomography was applied to examine injured anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL) as a noninvasive diagnostic aid. Its diagnostic value for ACL injury was evaluated in 21 patients. These results were compared with those of arthroscopic findings. This new technique allowed visualization of the ACL in a three-dimensional form, similar to an arthroscopic image, and was 100% accurate in detecting ACL injuries in the present samples.
