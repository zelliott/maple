To assess the relevance of the signal intensity time course for the differential diagnosis of enhancing lesions in dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the breast.

Two hundred sixty-six breast lesions were examined with a two-dimensional dynamic MR imaging series and subtraction postprocessing. Time-signal intensity curves of the lesions were obtained and classified according to their shapes as type I, which was steady enhancement; type II, plateau of signal intensity; or type III, washout of signal intensity. Enhancement rates and curve types of benign and malignant lesions were compared.

There were 101 malignant and 165 benign lesions. The distribution of curve types for breast cancers was type I, 8.9%; type II, 33.6%; and type III, 57.4%. The distribution of curve types for benign lesions was type I, 83.0%; type II, 11.5%; and type III, 5.5%. The distributions proved significantly different (chi 2 = 139.6; P < .001). The diagnostic indices for signal intensity time course were sensitivity, 91%; specificity, 83%; and diagnostic accuracy, 86%. The diagnostic indices for the enhancement rate were sensitivity, 91%; specificity, 37%; and diagnostic accuracy, 58%.

The shape of the time-signal intensity curve is an important criterion in differentiating benign and malignant enhancing lesions in dynamic breast MR imaging. A type III time course is a strong indicator of malignancy and is independent of other criteria.
