The acceptance of computer assisted surgical planning was studied by polling 500 German surgeons. 500 questionnaires were sent, from which 105 have been returned, from which 102 could be analysed. The questionnaire consisted of 14 questions relating to the current practice of surgery planning as well as to desired improvements. In general, the computer assisted surgical planning was assessed as a promising tool in the future. 82 % of the surgeons expected a benefit by computer assisted surgical planning. Better assessment of resectability, better training of residents and more safety of surgical procedures were mentioned in the majority. Computer assisted surgical planning should focus on 3D visualization of spatial relations between lesions and vascular structures, on facilities for the preoperative trial of resection strategies and on the documentation of the planned procedure. The current version of a research prototype (Surgery-Planner) is presented which is dealing with these goals.
