41 patients (45 renal tumours) were examined by magnetic resonance imaging to assess the value of the method and its use to specify renal tumours. Histological findings were available in 38 cases. The results of MRI were compared with the CT and ultrasound diagnosis and the histological findings. In 92.1% (35/38) the CT-diagnosis agree with the histological findings, the ultrasound in 76.3% (29/38) and the MRI in 84.2% (32/38). To specify renal tumours the diagnosis by CT-scan and ultrasound is sufficient.
