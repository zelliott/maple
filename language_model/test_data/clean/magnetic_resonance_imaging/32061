Since dentists can be faced by unusual cases during their professional life, this article reviews the common orofacial disorders that are of concern to a dentist trying to diagnose the source of pain or dysfunction symptoms, providing an overview of the essential knowledge and usage of nowadays available advanced diagnostic imaging modalities. In addition to symptom-driven diagnostic dilemmas, where such imaging is utilized, occasionally there are asymptomatic anomalies discovered by routine clinical care and/or on dental or panoramic images that need more discussion. The correct selection criteria of an image exam should be based on the individual characteristics of the patient, and the type of imaging technique should be selected depending on the specific clinical problem, the kind of tissue to be visualized, the information obtained from the imaging modality, radiation exposure, and the cost of the examination. The usage of more specialized imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, ultrasound, as well as single photon computed tomography, positron electron tomography, and their hybrid machines, SPECT/ CT and PET/CT, are discussed.
