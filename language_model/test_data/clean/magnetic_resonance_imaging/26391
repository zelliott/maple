Right atrial varices are rare. They were described for the first time by anatomo-pathologists at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. They are situated in the lower part of the inter-atrial septum and rarely exceed 2 cm in diameter. Descriptions have been from post-mortem studies which have led to epidemiological analyses and have given rise to nosological controversies. The authors report a case characterised by the exceptional volume of the varices. This could have enabled the diagnosis to be suspected at transoesophageal echocardiography before surgery. Thoracic CT scan and MRI completed the iconography. In the literature, two other cases of cardiac varices diagnosed at echocardiography have been published: they were small tumours on the lower part of the interatrial septum and the diagnosis before surgery was that of a myxoma. These formations seem to correspond to chance findings and do not appear to give rise to symptoms.
