The purpose of this study was to compare LV function and mass quantification derived from cardiac dual-source CT (DSCT) exams with those obtained by MRI in heart transplant recipients. Twelve heart transplant recipients who underwent cardiac DSCT and MRI examination were included. Double-oblique short-axis 8-mm slice thickness images were evaluated. Left ventricular ejection fraction, end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume, cardiac output and myocardial mass were manually assessed for each patient by two blinded readers. A systematic overestimation of all left ventricular volumes by DSCT when compared with MRI was observed. Mean difference was 16.58 +/- 18.61 ml for EDV, 4.9 4 +/- 6.84 ml for ESV, 11.64 +/- 13.58 ml for SV and 5.73 +/- 1.14 l/min for CO. Slightly lower values for left ventricular ejection fraction with DSCT compared with MRI were observed (mean difference 0.34 +/- 3.18%, p = 0.754). Correlation between DSCT and MRI for left ventricular mass was excellent (rho = 0.972). Bland and Altman plots and CCC indicated good agreement between DSCT and MRI left ventricular function and mass measurements. The interobserver correlation was good. In conclusion, DSCT accurately estimates left ventricular ejection fraction, volumes and mass in heart transplant recipients.
