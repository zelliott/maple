The authors report six very low birth weight newborn infants who had RDS, IVH and cerebellar porencephalus and later suffered from West syndrome. Four of them have been followed up to the present time and have had MRI scans performed. Their present clinico-neurological features and MRI findings are described. The authors also raise the possibility of prevention of mental deterioration if anticipatory treatment is started early. Very low birth weight newborn infants with cerebellar porencephalus should be observed more carefully with clinical and EEG examinations to detect infantile spasms earlier and to protect them from further mental deterioration.
