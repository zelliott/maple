Meningiomas account for 15 to 45% of spinal cord tumors. They are more frequent in females and have low recurrence rate due both to their low tendency for regrowth and to their prevalence in the aged population.

We reviewed retrospectively the clinical records of 37 patients operated on for spinal meningioma in our Neurosurgical Service from 1982 to 1998. Duration and type of symptoms, radiological and surgical results are analyzed.

Our spinal meningiomas account for about 26% of all spinal cord tumors operated on during a 19-year period. They accounted for 11% of all meningiomas operated during the same period. We observed a higher prevalence in females between 50 to 70 years of age. Weakness and localized pain were the most common presenting symptoms. The tumors were located in the thoracic region in 33 patients and only one case was found to be completely extradural. All the patients were operated on by laminectomy and total removal was achieved in all cases.

The use magnetic resonance to make an early diagnosis and microsurgical techniques appeared as the most relevant factors for further improvement of the surgical results.
