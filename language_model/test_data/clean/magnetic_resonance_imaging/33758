Patients (n = 1166) with various neurological disorders hospitalized in Dakar, Abidjan, Lom√© and Ouagadougou were examined prospectively over a 42-month period. Seropositivity for HTLV-I alone was found to be 1.8%, which is comparable to that estimated for the general population in Africa. Eighteen of the patients with TSP and only 5 with PN were HTLV-I positive, but co-infections were found in 30-40% of cases. Discrete and unspecific lesions were observed on light and electron microscopic examination of peripheral nerve biopsies from 11 patients. Since spastic paraparesis emerges as the disorder containing the largest number of HTLV-I-positive individuals, it may be premature to conclude that HTLV-I is a causal agent in PN. Nevertheless, their rarity and the frequency of retroviral co-infections distinguish these cases of African HTLV-I-associated myelopathy from comparable cases observed in other parts of the world.
