Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is an acute systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown origin. We report a patient whose AOSD presented with the commonly accepted diagnostic clinical signs and laboratory parameters. The painful joints distinctly demonstrated increased uptake of 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate in scintigraphy and areas of increased gadolinium-enhanced signal in MRI. Biopsies indicated bone marrow edema. AOSD in association with bone marrow edema had not been previously demonstrated. AOSD is often diagnosed after a considerable delay, bone scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance imaging may offer new imaging techniques for early diagnosis and successful therapy in follow-up examinations.
