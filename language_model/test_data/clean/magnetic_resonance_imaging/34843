Fetal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy can be diagnosed at birth by means of cerebral ultrasound scanning. The morphological appearance of the lesions depends on the time elapsed between the insult and examination of the brain. We report a case of a neonate affected by multicystic encephalomalacia and corpus callosum atrophy attributable to an episode of maternal anaphylactic shock which occurred at 27 weeks of gestation following intravenous iron injection. The diagnosis was made by means of a cerebral ultrasound scan performed at birth and confirmed by magnetic resonance. This case demonstrates that maternal severe acute hypotension during pregnancy can cause fetal cerebral damage similar to the hypoxicischemic injuries occurring in the perinatal period.
