Schwannoma is a benign neoplasia of the peripheral nerve sheath. Its localization in the gastrointestinal tract, and in particular in the esophagus, is very rare. According to the existing literature esophageal schwannoma has been reported so far only in adult patients. We report the case of an 11 year old patient with neurofibromatosis, type 2, who underwent surgical excision of a plexiform schwannoma of the esophagus.
