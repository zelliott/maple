We present a rare case of a jugular foramen meningocoele in a 48-year-old female, with neurofibromatosis type 1, presenting with positional vertigo. We also postulate possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.

We describe the imaging findings of this rare entity and review the literature on skull base meningocoeles, particularly in the context of neurofibromatosis type 1.

A computed tomography scan revealed smooth expansion of the jugular foramen. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a fluid filled lesion expanding the jugular foramen and communicating with cerebrospinal fluid of the cerebellomedullary cistern superiorly.

Skull base meningocoeles are a rare entity and we believe that this is the first reported case of a meningocoele causing enlargement of the jugular foramen in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1. The meningocoele may have resulted from a severe form of dural ectasia or from dysplastic, weakened bone at the skull base.
