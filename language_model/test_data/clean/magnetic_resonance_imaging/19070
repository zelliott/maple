Reproducible graft placement in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions is considered to be a critical factor affecting the successful clinical outcome of the procedure. Many current ACL instrument systems rely on intra-articular landmarks to guide the ACL tunnel placement. However, most of these instrument systems use mobile soft tissues as landmarks. We hypothesize that consistently identifiable radiographic contour landmarks can be established that can be used to improve the reproducibility of graft tunnel placement in fluoroscopically and computer-assisted ACL reconstructions. For the tibia, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans showed the average ACL attachment site to be projected at 46% on a line extending from the anterior to the posterior cortices. Intraoperative fluoroscopic images were checked for the reproducibility of this line and its clinical use. For the femur, lateral radiographs demonstrated a consistent relationship between the intercondylar roof line (Blumensaat's line) and the nearly circular profile of the posterior and inferior contour of the lateral femoral condyle. The middle of this circular profile is consistently projected on Blumensaat's line at 66% of its anterior-to-posterior direction. Intraoperative images were used, which showed the aiming drill at the point of entering the lateral femoral condyle. Instead of determining the femoral attachment site relative to Blumensaat's line, we can thus determine its position relative to the center of the circle. Based on intraoperative x-rays, the proposed femoral ACL attachment site can be projected on a line parallel with the Blumensaat's line from the circle center in the posterior direction. Our results indicate that there are consistently identifiable radiographic features on the tibia and femur contours that can be used for fluoroscopic and computer-assisted guidance of ACL graft placement.
