A case of posterior mediastinal panniculitis is reported. CT and MRI showed a paraspinal mass containing a small amount of fat. The intercostal veins were found to run through the mass without being distorted, mimicking lymphoma. The diagnosis of panniculitis was made by CT-guided biopsy and open biopsy.
