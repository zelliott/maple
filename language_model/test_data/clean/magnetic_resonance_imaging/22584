Wear-induced osteolysis remains a common problem after total knee arthroplasty and may be particularly difficult to detect clinically or radiographically around the femoral component. We describe the use of magnetic resonance imaging to identify particulate-induced osteolysis around the distal femur and proximal tibia in 2 patients with total knee arthroplasties. The extent of the osteolysis was not apparent from standard x-rays, and the information provided by the magnetic resonance imaging facilitated preoperative discussion with the patient as well as preoperative planning for the surgery.
