This paper constitutes a report of our experience in the assessment of left ventricle contraction using MRI (Philips 0,5T Gyroscan T5/II) and includes a suggestion of the study method directed towards establishing the role of different patterns of ventricle contraction in general ventricle function. In 29 patients, 22 men and 7 women, (average age 55.3) with history of myocardial infarction, electrocardiographically gated MR images encompassing the entire heart in the anatomic long and short axis planes were acquired. Significant positive correlations between long axis shortening and area length ejection fraction were found on four chamber view images: r = 0.605 at p < 0.05 and on two chamber view images: r = 0.554 at p < 0.05.
