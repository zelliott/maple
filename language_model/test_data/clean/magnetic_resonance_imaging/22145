Neurotransplantation has been proposed as a potential treatment for the neurodegenerative disorder of Huntington's disease (HD), which currently has no effective therapy. While patients with Parkinson's disease have received neurotransplantation, until recently no HD patients have undergone transplantation for HD with standardized evaluations of their progress following surgery. The current report presents the cognitive changes in three patients with HD who underwent bilateral transplantation of human fetal striatal tissue. As part of the pre- and postsurgical evaluation, all three patients were administered a neuropsychological battery sensitive to the cognitive effects of HD within 2 mo prior to surgery and at 4-6 mo following transplantation. Four to 6 mo subsequent to surgery, all patients demonstrated increased scores on some measures of cognitive functioning. However, the pattern of changes was not uniform across subjects. These findings suggest that fetal striatal transplantation may improve some of the cognitive symptoms associated with HD in the three reported patients.
