A 42-year-old man suffering from progressive left radicular sensory motor loss (L4 level) underwent neurosurgical repair. Neuroimaging (RMI) had led to the diagnosis of schwannoma of the filum terminale with lipomatous component. Histological examination visualized a true mature lipoma associated with numerous bundles of more or less dystrophic nerve fibers. This histological benign tumor raised the problem of the genesis of intradural lipomas of spinal cord.
