The purpose of this study was to further our understanding of the normal appearance of the popliteomeniscal fasciculi (PMF) on MRI after the determination of finely tuned imaging parameters. For this purpose we performed the study in two stages. Stage I was to determine suitable parameters for depicting the popliteomeniscal fasciculi. Stage II was to classify the "normal" image.

The findings presented in this article will contribute to the understanding of the normal appearance of the popliteomeniscal fasciculi on MRI, and of the degree of variation of this structure among the population.
