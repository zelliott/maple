To investigate the mechanism of anaphylactoid reactions to contrast media, in vitro histamine release induced by magnetic resonance imaging, and iodinated contrast agents was examined in a dog mastocytoma cell line.

Two gadolinium (Gd)-based magnetic resonance contrast agents, Gd diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA), dimeglumine, and Gd-bismorpholide, and two iodinated contrast agents, diatrizoate meglumine and iohexol, were incubated with histamine-containing canine mastocytoma cells. Release of histamine into the supernatant was determined at various contrast-medium concentrations after incubation at 37 degrees C for 30 minutes.

Iodinated and Gd-based contrast agents caused release of histamine from mastocytoma cells at similar concentrations (50-150 mM). Mannitol, an osmotic stimulus, caused release of histamine only at concentrations greater than 1,000 mM.

Histamine release from canine mastocytoma cells does not appear to be solely due to osmotic effects, but results from direct stimulation by contrast media. For all agents examined, the concentration at which in vitro histamine release occurs far exceeds the serum contrast media concentration expected in routine clinical application. Direct release of histamine from mast cells does not completely explain the pathogenesis of idiosyncratic anaphylactoid responses to contrast media.
