The case of a ten years old boy who presented a sudden onset of tetraplegia is discussed. The benign clinical evolution, under corticosteroid therapy, the negativity of biohumoral examinations of the cerebrospinal fluid and the improvement of the NMR pictures allow the diagnosis of acute spinal myelitis. In the paper are also presented the neuroradiological pictures of myeloCT and NMR; the last one can, for its sensibility, discover little variations in the water contents of the nervous tissue and for its harmlessness can be used for serial examinations.
