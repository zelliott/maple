MR images of the fingers are obtained in a 128 x 128 or 256 x 256 matrix format using a prototype of a mini imager dedicated to the hand. The vertical field of 0.1 T is provided by an electro-magnet with an air gap of 15 cm equipped with a single solenoidal coil. No Faraday cage is used. The maximum in plane pixel resolution of 100 mu is obtained for a field of view of 2.5 cm with a slice thickness of 2 mm. The identification of fine structures of the finger is demonstrated by the anatomical and histological correlations. This type of imager which is adapted to very limited field of views demonstrate that high resolution MRI of limb extremities can be achieved at 0.1 T.
