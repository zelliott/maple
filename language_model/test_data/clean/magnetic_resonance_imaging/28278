In a retrospective study we analysed the outcome of 27 pregnancies in 17 hyperprolactinaemic patients. Cranial CT or MRI scans showed a microadenoma in 9, a macroadenoma in 7 and no change in 1 case. In 5 patients macroadenomas were surgically removed but a residual hyperprolactinaemia remained. In 2 patients with selectively removed microadenomas through the transsphenoidal route only in one case normal prolactin levels could be achieved. This patient became two times pregnant. In 24 patients pregnancy was induced by dopaminergic treatment whereas another patient with microadenoma became spontaneously pregnant after surgery and treatment with bromocriptine. The treatment was discontinued as soon as the pregnancy was recognised. 19 pregnancies were finished by spontaneous delivery and 3 by Caesarean section. Termination of pregnancy was artificially induced in 3 patients. One miscarriage was observed. Another patient was suffering from an extrauterine pregnancy. During pregnancy prolactin levels increased in comparison to basal levels. After delivery and lactation the same prolactin level was found compared to basal levels in patients with microprolactinomas. In patients suffering from macroadenomas prolactin levels decreased in comparison to basal levels. CT of MRI scan evaluations performed after delivery revealed a clinical not relevant increase as well as a decrease of tumor size in 2 cases, respectively. During pregnancy there was no complication due to tumor found in treated patients for hyperprolactinaemia. Only about one half of mothers were able to perform regular breast feeding.
