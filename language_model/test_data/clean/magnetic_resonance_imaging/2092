Neurological complications, mainly cerebellar syndrome, have been associated with coeliac disease. We report the first observation of a 56-year-old woman with a chronic meningitis revealing coeliac disease. Neuralgia of the trijeminal nerve and cerebellar syndrome only appeared seven years after the onset of meningitis. MRI examination showed a cerebellar atrophy and a leucoencephalopathy. This case report emphasizes the utility of detection of anti-gliadin antibodies for the diagnosis of a chronic meningitis.
