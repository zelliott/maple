Experiments were conducted in which various intravascular filters, stents, and coils were imaged using magnetic resonance (MR) spin-echo technique at 0.35 T. These devices were also evaluated for ferromagnetism (at 0.35, 1.5, and 4.7 T), magnetic torque (at 0.35 and 1.5 T), and magnetically induced migration within a plastic tube (at 0.35 and 1.5 T for the Greenfield filter [GF]). The stainless-steel GF was evaluated in vitro for its propensity to perforate canine inferior venae cavae (IVC). Magnetic force and torque at 1.5 T did not dislodge the GF or result in perforation of canine IVC by the GF. Beta-3 titanium alloy (used in a new percutaneous version of the GF) is apparently one of the best-suited metals for use with MR imaging because of its lack of ferromagnetism (up to 4.7 T) and absence of MR imaging artifacts (at 0.35 T). Devices composed of Elgiloy (Mobin-Uddin filter), nitinol, and MP32-N (Amplatz filter) alloys all created mild artifacts. Devices fashioned from 304 and 316L (GF and Palmaz stent) stainless-steel alloys created severe "black-hole" artifacts, with the 304 alloy devices also showing marked image distortion. Generally, the greater the ferromagnetism of a device, the greater its magnetic susceptibility artifact.
