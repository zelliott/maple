The purpose of this study is to describe the imaging findings of tears and avulsive injuries of the gluteus medius tendon in elderly women and to evaluate the importance of diagnosis and the implications of treatment in the realm of lateral hip pain.

Elderly women are susceptible to a spectrum of gluteal tendon abnormalities of the hip, notably tears and avulsive injuries of the gluteus medius tendon, that can be a cause of lateral hip pain and may be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The MR imaging findings of this entity are instrumental in establishing the correct diagnosis in the setting of lateral hip pain and initiating appropriate treatment.
