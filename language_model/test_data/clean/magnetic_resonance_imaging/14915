Six women, with ages ranging from 52 to 64 years old, clinically evaluated (Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders) by a single examiner were submitted to MRI (3.0 T). They had only arthralgia diagnosis. The images were evaluated by two radiologists who were not informed about the patients' clinical conditions, in which discs displacements, osteophytes and morphological irregularities, as well as completely normal images, i.e., without any characteristics were identified.

TMJ arthralgia can be caused by various conditions, few of which are objectively observed when investigating its causes or diagnose temporomandibular disorders (TMD). In some cases, imaging exams can detect some conditions and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used for this purpose. Here, the MRI (3.0 T) enabled a detailed visualization of the structures of the TMJ, allowing the characterization of the symptomology in some cases. Despite, some images were completely normal.

This case report detected some features seen on the MRI that justified a clinical diagnosis arthralgia, not associated with other clinical diagnosis. However, the detailed clinical examination should be sovereign even in the face of equipment with advanced technology.
