We present the case of ureteral triplication with vesicoureteral reflux into the lowest and middle pole in a 5-year-old girl. Magnetic resonance (MR) nephrography depicted loss of function of the lowest pole, which could not be assessed through MAG3 renal scan. Morphologic analyses revealed organ structure and vascular anatomy in superior quality. A laparoscopic partial nephroureterectomy of the lower pole was performed. Intraoperative findings correlated exactly with morphologic data obtained through MR nephrography. Dynamic MR nephrography should be considered as diagnostic tool of choice for selected kidney anomalies before surgery.
