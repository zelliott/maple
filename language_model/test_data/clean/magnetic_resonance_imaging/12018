The electrocardiogram gives a reasonable estimate of infarct size but the confidence limits are wide, and the estimates are unreliable in inferior wall infarction. Infarct size also can be determined from perfusion scintigraphy, assessment of left ventricular dimensions, wall motion disturbances, and other characteristics of the left ventricular wall. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, particularly with contrast enhancement, has the greatest potential for accuracy.
