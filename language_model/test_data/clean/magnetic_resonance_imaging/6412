Evaluation of technical aspects, local efficiency and complications of thermoablative procedures, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and laser-induced thermotherapy (LITT), in percutaneous lung metastases.

Techniques of thermal ablative procedures of RFA and LITT are presented. For primary positioning, monitoring and therapy control, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. Different monopolar systems and one bipolar system were available for RFA and two different cooling systems for LITT. Percutaneous CT-guided RFA was performed on 32 metastases in 20 patients and percutaneous LITT on 34 metastases in 24 patients. Inclusion criteria were metastases < or = 5 cm in diameter in unresectable patients with up to 3 metastases per lung. All treatments were performed on outpatient basis using analgosedation.

In our patient group, all patients tolerated both the RFA and LITT procedures well with mild sedation. The pneumothorax rate was 15 % (5/32 procedures) for the RFA group and 12 % (4/34 procedures) for the LITT group, without insertion of a chest tube. In all RF ablations, a complete "roll off" (increase in impedance) was achieved. Local tumor control rate in the 6-month follow-up was 85 % for RFA and 91 % for LITT. Nineteen of the 20 patients treated are still alive, one patient died from tumor progression.

Both pulmonary RFA and LITT allow safe thermal ablation of pulmon arg metastases with a low complication rate and an acceptable tumor control rate.
