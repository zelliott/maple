Statistical approaches used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study cognitive development are varied and evolving. Two approaches have generally been used. These are between-group end-point analysis of variance (ANOVA) and age-related regression. Differences in these 2 approaches could produce different results when applied to a single data set. Event-related fMRI data from a group of typically developing participants (n = 95; age range = 7-35 years) performing controlled lexical processing tasks were analyzed using both methods. Results from the 2 approaches showed significant overlap, but also noteworthy differences. The results suggest that for regions showing age-related changes, correlation was relatively more sensitive to more linear changes whereas ANOVA was relatively more sensitive to less-linear changes. These findings suggest that full characterization of developmental dynamics will require converging methodologies.
