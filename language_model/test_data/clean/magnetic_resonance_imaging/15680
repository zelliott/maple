We evaluated the surgical outcomes of transvaginal diverticulectomies classified using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

We evaluated 30 women (mean age: 46.4 yr; range: 31-73 yr) who were followed up for at least 12 mo after urethral diverticulectomies (mean follow-up: 29 mo; range: 12-93 mo). Characteristics of urethral diverticula were confirmed before surgery by MRI. Diverticula were classified as simple, U-shaped, or circumferential according to MRI features. Transvaginal excisions of urethral diverticula were performed using vaginal flaps and three-layer closures. Cure was defined as the absence of a diverticulum and symptoms.

Seventeen cases (57%) had simple diverticula, three (10%) had U-shaped diverticula, and 10 (33%) had circumferential diverticula. After the first operation, 23 cases (77%) were cured. None of the simple diverticula recurred, but 33% of the U-shaped and 60% of the circumferential diverticula did recur. Of the seven recurrent cases, three did not require a second operation because their symptoms resolved. Of the four cases that underwent a second operation, three were cured and one was cured after two additional operations. The success rate for circumferential diverticula after initial diverticulectomies was less than that of simple or U-shaped diverticula (p<0.05). Location, size, and multiplicity of urethral diverticula did not affect the surgical outcome (p>0.05).

Transvaginal diverticulectomy is effective for treatment of female urethral diverticula. For circumferential urethral diverticula, however, surgical procedures should be adapted to achieve complete resections of the diverticulum.
