Vaginal endodermal sinus tumor is a rare entity.

The purpose of this study was to report the clinical manifestations and MRI features in a case series.

Children with vaginal endodermal sinus tumor admitted to our hospitals between January 2008 and August 2012 were included. MRI was performed in all four children and diffusion-weighted imaging was performed in two children.

Four children, mean age 14 months, were included. All had a history of vaginal bleeding. Serum alpha-fetoprotein was significantly elevated on admission. Relative to muscle, the vaginal masses were uniformly isointense on T1-weighted images, heterogeneously hyperintense on T2-weighted images and heterogeneously enhancing on contrast-enhanced images. The vaginal masses were obviously hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images (b value, 800 s/mm(2)). Extravaginal invasion was observed in three children. Pelvic lymphadenopathy was noted in two children and pulmonary metastasis was found in one child.

MRI may contribute in the evaluation of vaginal endodermal sinus tumors.
