This paper aims to argue the advantages of using routine multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) prior to the first series of biopsies in patients with suspected cancer of the prostate indicated by a rise in Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA). Using biopsy targeted onto a lesion seen by MRI, this diagnostic strategy could increase detection of significant cancers and improve evaluation of their grade and size. This strategy would also mean that the detection of insignificant cancers (microfoci detected by chance during systematic biopsy) would decrease, since if the mp-MRI did not give rise to suspicion, the indications for biopsy would be reduced. It could also reduce the number of biopsies to be performed even when the mp-MRI is suspicious, by resorting solely to targeted biopsies. This review does not evaluate the role of mp-MRI in locoregional staging.
