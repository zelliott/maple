We report a patient with multiple sclerosis (MS) who developed an oligodendroglioma 8 years after the initial diagnosis of MS. This is the first description of a neoplasm, suspected initially on brain MRI and subsequently confirmed by brain biopsy, in an MS patient. Our case emphasizes the need to evaluate atypical brain MRI lesions carefully, even in well-established MS patients, as well as to obtain a tissue diagnosis of such lesions whenever possible in order to determine their precise etiology.
