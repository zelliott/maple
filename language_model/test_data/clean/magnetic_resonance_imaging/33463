Several modalities including plain radiography, CT, and MRI are available for evaluation of the intrasellar, suprasellar and parasellar lesions. Plain radiography, which may used for screening, can identify calcification as well as the elusive and destructive changes of the sella turcica and it's adjacent bony structures. CT is much more sensitive in detecting calcifications. It is also useful for demonstrating bony changes in detail. MRI has been thought to be the best modality in evaluation of sellar and parasellar lesions. Dynamic MRI is a choice of method when microadenoma is suspected.
