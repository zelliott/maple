The authors, after reviewing the main features of the so called "leukemic osteopathy", remark how the natural history of leukoses has changed thanks to progress in both diagnosis and treatment. Indeed, the condition is now diagnosed early and its remission is quick. Thus, the cases with X-ray-evident bone involvement are quite uncommon: hence the need to use, at AL onset, imaging techniques which are more sensitive to bone marrow changes. To this purpose, MR imaging has proved a valuable technique which can demonstrate even the early stages of pathologic conditions affecting bone marrow.
