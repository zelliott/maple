Visual symptomatology in childhood often presents diagnostic difficulties. Recurrent paroxysmal visual complaints, although typically associated with migraine, may also signal other disorders. We describe a 9-year-old partially sighted male with paroxysmal zoopsias resulting from Charles Bonnet syndrome. This condition is characterized by paroxysmal visual hallucinations occurring in patients with chronic visual impairment, akin to the phantom-limb phenomenon. This pediatric case is the fourth report of this condition. We have reviewed the other cases.
