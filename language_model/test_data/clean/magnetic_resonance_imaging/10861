Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) is a clinical syndrome characterized by headache, conscious disturbance, seizure, and cortical visual loss with neuroimaging finding of edema in the posterior regions of the brain, with a reversible course (1). The precise pathomechanism of RPLS is not understood. However, association with uncontrolled hypertension, renal failure, eclampsia, or immunosuppressive agents has been implicated (1). We describe herein a case of Hodgkin's disease (HD)-related central nervous system (CNS) angiitis with neuroimaging finding suggestive of RPLS. The pathophysiology of RPLS in cases with CNS angiitis is discussed.
