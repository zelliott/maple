The Morel-Lavallee lesion is a serous collection in the region of the greater trochanter, resulting from a closed degloving injury at the deep fascial interface. Imaging demonstrates characteristic appearance in relation to this lesion, differentiating it from other mass lesions. We report a case of Morel-Lavallee lesion in an adolescent, with ultrasound and MRI correlation.
