We analyzed the distribution of nasal erectile tissue by reviewing five sets of magnetic resonance imaging scans that were obtained pre- and post-decongestion. We found that cavernous tissues were located at three sites: the inferior turbinate, the middle turbinate, and the nasal septum. This study reaffirms the findings of previous studies that were performed with other modalities such as computed tomography scanning and cadaver dissections.
