Up until recently, neurology was dominated by localisatory thinking. Language and other so-called "centers" were considered to be centers of command controlling the respective functions. Today, there is general agreement that, instead, for every brain function numerous brain regions must act together. For the exploration of these manifold topographic cooperations produced by cognitive tasks, coherence of long-term EEG periods proved to be a proficient parameter for the representation of functionally essential connections. Because of the unequivocal meaningfulness of absolute coherence values, instead, only the signs of significant differences between coherence values during cognitive tasks and periods of EEG at rest before and after the task were considered for all possible electrode pairings and charted on schematic maps of the brain. In addition, the signs of significant changes of amplitude were entered. This procedure was performed for each of 6 frequency bands and for the 19 electrodes of the 10/20 system, thus yielding 171 possible plus or minus values for coherence and 19 for amplitude, respectively. The positions of the electrodes were marked by an MRI contrast medium. After the EEG, MRI examination was performed. The MRI data were segmented and the cortex was mapped onto a plane using a method similar to cartography. The exact electrode positions are registered from a similarly obtained map of the scalp and the electrode position pattern is used as basis for the coherence graphs. A detailed map of the cortex based on the segmented MRI data with the electrode positions marked is provided as a reference enabling allocation of the electrodes to the cortical structures. The usefulness of this procedure is demonstrated with a single subject by means of different cognitive tasks including musical thinking.
