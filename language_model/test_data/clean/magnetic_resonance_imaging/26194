The purpose of this study was to correlate the abnormal signal area on various magnetic resonance (MR) images to the infarct area on pathologic examination and to assess the myocardial viability on the basis of MR images. T2-weighted, first-pass perfusion, and delayed gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images were used as "one-stop examinations" in a pig model of reperfused myocardial infarction. The results of each MR image were compared with those of 2,3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. The abnormal signal areas on T2-weighted and Gd-enhanced T1-weighted images were larger than the infarct areas on TTC staining (34.7% and 32.3% vs. 28.3%; P< 0.05), whereas the nonperfused areas on perfusion images were correlated (25.6% vs, 28.3%; P = 0.139). Electron microscopic examination showed severely distorted ultrastructures in the infarct areas and mildly damaged ultrastructures in the peri-infarct areas. Perfusion images probably reflected the infarct areas, whereas T2-weighted and Gd-enhanced T1-weighted images seemed to include peri-infarct as well as infarct areas.
