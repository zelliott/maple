Ulnar wrist pain is a difficult problem to diagnose and treat. Many diagnostic methods can be used, each having its own value, but the surgeon should know which is the simplest and most appropriate for each case.

Such a case, investigated adequately by conventional arthrography is presented. A review of the relevant literature and a discussion of whether conventional MR and MR arthrography are always necessary or not is provided.

MR arthrography does not need be performed in every case of ulnar wrist pain, this depending on the findings of conventional arthrography, an opinion that has also been confirmed by the authors' own previous experience.
