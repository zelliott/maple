We report a 46-year-old woman who experienced swelling of the right thigh around the wound caused by a dog bite. Physical findings, laboratory findings, imaging studies, and muscle biopsy showed that this was nodular-type muscle sarcoidosis. This is an unusual case of sarcoidosis, and the possibility is discussed that a dog bite may serve as a trauma to trigger sarcoidosis in genetically predisposed individuals.
