The design and application of a two-wire electrophysiology (EP) catheter that simultaneously records the intracardiac electrogram and receives the MR signal for active catheter tracking is described. The catheter acts as a long loop receiver, allowing for visualization of the entire catheter length while simultaneously behaving as a traditional two-wire EP catheter, allowing for intracardiac electrogram recording and ablation. The application of the device is demonstrated by simultaneously tracking the catheter and recording the intracardiac electrogram in canine models using 7 and 10 frame/sec real-time imaging sequences. Using solely MR imaging, the entire catheter was visualized and guided from the jugular vein into the cardiac chambers, where the intracardiac electrogram was recorded. By combining several functions in a single, simple structure, the excellent tissue contrast and functional imaging capabilities of MR can be used to improve the efficacy of EP interventions. This catheter will facilitate MR-guided interventions and demonstrates the design of multifunctional interventional devices for use in MRI.
