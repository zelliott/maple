Transcatheter chemo-embolization (TCE) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was performed in 38 patients. The patients were examined by MR imaging before TCE as well as one week and 4 to 5 weeks after TCE. The tumor signal intensity in T2 weighted images increased in 13 cases and decreased in 19 cases after TCE. Increased intensity seemed to reflect intra-tumoral hemorrhage or liquefaction accompanying tumor necrosis. Decreased intensity seemed to reflect coagulation necrosis. In 9 of 18 cases followed over a 2-month period the signal intensity had decreased in both T1 and T2 weighted images. In these patients the tumor showed no recurrence at angiography and the decreased signal seemed to reflect the completion of coagulation necrosis. A hyper- and/or hypointense rim around the tumor appeared in 22 cases. These changes were thought to be perifocal edema or granulation tissue around the tumor. MR imaging was useful in evaluating the necrotic process of the tumor after TCE.
