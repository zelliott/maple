Seizures and focal neurologic deficits may be the complications of neurosyphilis, but status epilepticus as a presenting picture of neurosyphilis is rare. We describe a 41-year-old man with an acute onset of expressive dysphasia, followed by persistent seizure state and severe complications of systemic medical problems. An extensive laboratory evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of neurosyphilis and diabetes mellitus. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed edematous change in the left cingulate gyrus, left temporal lobe, and peri-Rolandic area, which suggested an inflammatory process. Due to varied clinical manifestations of neurosyphilis, we underscore the importance of considering neurosyphilis among the possible causes of status epilepticus and any central nervous system diseases.
