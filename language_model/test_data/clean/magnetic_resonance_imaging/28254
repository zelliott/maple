MRI findings are increasingly used as outcome measures in therapeutic trials in MS. The discrepancy between the extent of the lesions on conventional T2 images and the clinical condition of the patient is one of the problems encountered in such studies. This clinical-radiological paradox prevents the use of MRI data as surrogate markers of disability in MS. A recent pilot study suggested a relationship between hypointense lesions on T1 MRI and disability. To assess in more detail the correlation of changes in hypointense lesion load on T1-weighted spin-echo MR images ("black holes") with changes in disability in MS, we studied 46 patients with clinically definite MS at baseline and after a median follow-up of 40 months. There was a significant correlation between baseline disability and hypointense lesion load (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [SRCC] = 0.46, p = 0.001). In secondary progressive patients, the rate of accumulation of these "black holes" was significantly related to progression rate (SRCC = 0.81, p < 0.0001). We speculate that the appearance of hypointense lesions is the MRI equivalent of a failure of remission. Overall, T1 lesion load measurements correlated better with clinical assessments than T2 lesion load measurements. Quantification of hypointense lesion load on T1-weighted spin-echo MRI helps to resolve the clinical-radiological paradox between disability and MRI and has the potential to be a surrogate marker of disability in MS.
