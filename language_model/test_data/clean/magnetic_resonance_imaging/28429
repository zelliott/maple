In this review the main contributions of magnetic resonance (MR) techniques in the monitoring of multiple sclerosis (MS) course, both natural or modified by treatments, are presented. MR measures well correlate with short-term disease evolution and therefore their use is appropriate as primary end-points in preliminary clinical trials evaluating the effects of new treatments. In contrast, the correlation between MR measures and long-term clinical evolution in clinically definite MS is less clear, thus indicating that such measures can be used at present only as a secondary end-point in large scale definitive trials. The results coming from the clinical application of newer MR techniques with higher pathological specificity are also presented and their possible future roles in monitoring treatment aimed at preventing development of disability in MS are discussed.
