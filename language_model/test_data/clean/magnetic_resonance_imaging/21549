Using magnetic resonance imaging, arteriosclerotic lesions of the supra-aortic vessels may be well demonstrated. The comparison between 3 magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) techniques (Spin Echo, Gradient Echo 2D FLASH, Gradient Echo 3D FISP) and Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) as reference in 50 patients suspicious of stenotic lesions proved the high reliability of these methods. Specially in determining the degree of stenosis, a good correlation between DSA and SE in 87%, between DSA and 2D FLASH in 78% and between DSA and 3D FISP in 83% could be assessed. Since 3D technique may exaggerate the degree of stenosis, we didn't observe any false negative result in severe stenosis. Therefore we think that the 3D technique is a safe technique which enables a good overview of the supra-aortic vessels and could therefore be suitable for screening.
