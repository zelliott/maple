A case of malignant craniopharyngioma in a 46-year-old woman presenting clinically with visual disturbance and bifrontal headache is reported. Histopathologic examination of the suprasellar mass showed a lesion characterized by nests of epithelial cells with a basaloid appearance, round-to-oval nuclei, moderate pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, increased nuclear cytoplastic ratio and high mitotic activity. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for Ki-67 (44.3%), p53 (98%), and p63 (100%), but negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors. Clinical and pathologic features with a brief review of the relevant literature for malignant craniopharyngioma as a novel member of tumors of the suprasellar region, is discussed.
