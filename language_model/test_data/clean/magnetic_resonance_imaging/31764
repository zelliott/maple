The acute stage of infection with chikungunya virus, which is characterized of fever, polyarthritis, and occasional rash, can be complicated by myocarditis, as reported in a 21-year-old woman. Persisting changes on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging one year after disease onset could lead to delayed myocardial damage. An unexpected delayed increase in dilated cardiomyopathy may be observed in countries affected by the outbreak of chikungunya virus disease during 2005-2007.
