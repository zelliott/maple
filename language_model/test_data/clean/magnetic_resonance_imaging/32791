The incidence of urethral injuries in children is rare due to the fact that the urethra is short, mobile and protected by the pubic bone. The management of urethral trauma in childhood remains controversial because of the limited expertise of most urologists.

We performed a literature review by searching the Medline database for articles published between 1975 and 2010 based on clinical relevance. Electronic searches were limited to the keywords 'pediatric', 'urethral injury', 'trauma' and 'reconstruction'.

Retrograde urethrography is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of urethral injuries. The initial management should ensure drainage of the bladder either by suprapubic cystostomy or urethral realignment if possible: in complete anterior urethral disruption as well as in children with life-threatening pelvic and intra-abdominal injuries after posterior urethral injuries, a deferred repair after 3 months is necessary. Immediate primary suturing of disrupted and dislocated urethral ends should be avoided because of high complication rates. Primary repair, however, of the defect is possible in girls avoiding a 2-stage approach.

The aim of therapy is minimizing remote damages such as urethrocutaneous fistulae, periurethral diverticulae, strictures, incontinence and impotence with different therapeutic management depending on classification of the injury and the presence of life-threatening injuries.
