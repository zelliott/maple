A 52-year-old man was admitted to our clinic with severe headache and bilateral papilledema. Magnetic resonance (MR) images on admission demonstrated diffuse swelling of the cerebral cortex without formation of a tumor mass. Biopsy revealed diffuse infiltration with neoplastic glial cells. After radiation and chemotherapy, the MR images returned to normal. The morphological and neurological features of the present case met the criteria for gliomatosis cerebri. However, this patient showed an unusually good response to radiation and chemotherapy.
