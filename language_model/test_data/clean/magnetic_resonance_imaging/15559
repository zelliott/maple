Brain functional MRI (fMRI) provides an indirect mapping of cerebral activity, based on the detection of local changes in blood flow and oxygenation levels that are associated with neuronal activity (BOLD contrast). fMRI allows noninvasive studies of normal and pathological aspects of the brain's functional organization. It is based on the comparison of two or more cognitive states. Echoplanar imaging is the technique of choice, providing the quickest study of the entire brain. Activation maps are calculated from a statistical analysis of the local signal changes. fMRI has become one of the most widely used functional imaging techniques in neuroscience. In clinical practice, fMRI can identify eloquent areas involved in motor and language functions in surgical patients and can evaluate the risk of postoperative neurological deficit.
