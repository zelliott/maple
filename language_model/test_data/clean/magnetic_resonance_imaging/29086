MR images acquired by using an arterial spin-labeling technique showed spatial and temporal variations of perfusion in the skeletal muscle of exercising humans. Perfusion measurements made during plantar flexion exercise in normal volunteers were consistent with those obtained by traditional techniques reported in the literature. Spatial heterogeneity of perfusion values clearly delineated the various muscle groups within the lower leg. These results are interpreted in terms of a quantitative model for the perfusion signal in muscle. This method can provide a useful tool in the study of muscle physiology.
