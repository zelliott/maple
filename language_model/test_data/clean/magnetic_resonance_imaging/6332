Four patients with dural arteriovenous malformation (AVMs) draining into the cavernous sinus, who presented ophthalmic manifestations, were studied by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. In all patients signal decrease in the involved cavernous sinus was demonstrated in coronal spin-echo (SE) imaging. It is attributable to rapid venous flow in the sinus, and this "high velocity signal loss" is a fairly pathognomonic finding in this condition. We stress the validity of MR imaging in the primary diagnosis of dural AVMs with ophthalmic symptoms.
