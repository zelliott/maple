One of the characteristics of multiple sclerosis is the unpredictable occurrence of exacerbations and remissions. These fluctuations in disease activity are related to alterations in (auto-)immune activity. Exacerbations lead to short-term morbidity, but may also influence long-term disability. This longitudinal study in 73 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis assessed the contribution of systemic infections to the natural course of exacerbations. In addition, we analysed whether infections lead to an increase in the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions. A total of 167 infections and 145 exacerbations were observed during 6466 patient weeks. During a predefined at-risk period (ARP) of 2 weeks before until 5 weeks after the onset of a clinical infection (predominantly upper airway infections), there was an increased risk of exacerbations (rate ratio 2.1), which is in accordance with previous studies. Exacerbations with onset during the ARP led more frequently to sustained deficit [increase of > or =1 Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) point or > or =0.5 above EDSS 5.5 for >3 months] than exacerbations with onset outside the ARP, with a rate ratio of 3.8. Minor and major exacerbations were equally distributed between the ARP and non-ARP onset groups. ARP exacerbations were associated with significantly higher plasma levels of the inflammatory marker soluble intracellular adhesion molecule 1 than non-ARP exacerbations, indicating relatively enhanced immune activation during ARP relapses. Three serial MRI scans were performed after the onset of an infection over a 6-week period. There was no difference in the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions between the three time points. In conclusion, exacerbations in the context of a systemic infection lead to more sustained damage than other exacerbations. There is no indication that this effect occurs through enhanced opening of the blood-brain barrier.
