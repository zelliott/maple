To retrospectively assess the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of vesicouterine fistula (VUF).

Between January 2003 and January 2011, 12 patients with a diagnosis of VUF were surgically managed at our center; among them, eight patients had MRI among their preoperative radiological investigations and those were included in our study. The clinical presentation, radiological investigations, and surgical findings of the patients were reviewed.

The mean age of the patients was 31 years. Seven of the eight patients had complaints of cyclic hematuria and the remaining patient complained of urinary leakage through the vagina. The etiology of VUF was cesarean section in all patients. The preoperative radiological investigations included conventional cystography in five patients, intravenous urography in two, computed tomography (CT) urography in two, and MRI in eight. The sensitivities of diagnosis for these investigations were 40%, 0%, 50%, and 100%, respectively.

In our small retrospective series, pelvic MRI was reliable and sensitive for diagnosis of VUF. It should be considered in the work-up of patients with suspected VUF.
