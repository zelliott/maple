This study documents changes in clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics in a large cohort of patients with primary and transitional progressive multiple sclerosis (PP and TPMS) over 2 years. Patients with PPMS and TPMS were recruited from six European centres and underwent clinical and MRI examination at three time points: baseline, year one and year two. Of the 190 patients recruited clinical data were available on 125 patients (66%, five centres) and MRI data were available on 113 patients (59%, four centres) at 2 years. Significant increases were seen in T2 load and T1 hypointensity, while brain and cord volume decreased. In PPMS significantly higher lesion loads were found in those who presented with non-cord syndromes when compared to cord presentation and there was a trend to greater brain atrophy in those who deteriorated clinically over the course of the study compared to those who remained stable. Significant cord atrophy was only seen in those with a cord presentation. Measurable changes in MRI parameters can be detected in PPMS patients over a relatively short period of time. MRI quantification is likely to be useful in elucidating disease mechanisms in PPMS and in the execution of clinical trials.
