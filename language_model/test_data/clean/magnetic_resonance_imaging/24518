To determine the outcomes of surgical excision in the management of angioleiomyomas of the upper extremity.

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 26 patients undergoing a surgical excision of an angioleiomyoma in the upper extremity between 1975 and 2012, who had at least 1 year of follow-up. There were 12 men and 14 women, with an average age of 55 ± 20 years. The most common location was the hand (n = 14). The onset of symptoms was on average 6 ± 5 years before presentation. The most common problem was a painful mass (19 of 26 patients). Average tumor size was 10 ± 7 mm.

Patients over the age of 60 years tended to have smaller tumors. There was no significant difference between average preoperative and postoperative grip strength in the affected and unaffected extremities. None of the lesions was diagnosed based on radiographic imaging. There was 1 postoperative complication. No recurrence was noted at an average 8.6-year follow-up (range, 1.0-21.0 y).

Angioleiomyomas present as a small, painful masses that can be reliably treated with marginal surgical excision.

Therapeutic IV.
