In vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS) is a functional imaging modality. When magnetic resonance imaging is coupled with H-MRS, it results in accurate metabolic characterization of various lesions. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy has an established role in evaluating malignant breast lesions, and the increasing number of published literature supports the role of H-MRS in patients with breast cancer. However, H-MRS can be of help in evaluating benign breast disease. We present a case of tubercular breast abscess, initial diagnosis of which was suggested based on characteristic lipid pick on H-MRS and was subsequently confirmed by fine needle aspiration biopsy of the breast lesion.
