The Debrecen Stroke Unit covers a catchment area of 210,000 inhabitants in eastern Hungary. The unit was established at the Department of Neurology of the University Hospital in 1974 and has 23 beds, 7 of which have monitoring facilities. The unit treats about 600 patients with acute cerebrovascular diseases annually - about 60% of all hospitalised stroke cases in the region. Overall, 18 registered nurses and 4 nurse helpers work for the unit. Computer tomography is performed in over 90% of cases. Carotid duplex ultrasound and echocardiography are part of the routine examinations in ischaemic strokes. Delay from onset of stroke to hospital arrival is the main barrier against the use of rt-PA. Average length of stay is 12 days; a lack of rehabilitation and nursing capacities sometimes delays discharge of dependent patients. The hospital is reimbursed the costs of stroke care based on DRG.
