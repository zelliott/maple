The true incidence of serious neuraxial complications such as epidural hematoma or abscess after postoperative epidural infusions is still uncertain, in part due to inconsistencies in multicenter data collection.

Prospective data were collected over 16 yr from the authors' Acute Pain Service, which is based in a large tertiary teaching institution with a nonobstetric general surgical population.

Over this period, 8,210 epidural catheters were inserted for postoperative analgesia and 32 computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans were undertaken to exclude potential neuraxial complications. From these, two spinal hematomas (1:4,105) and six epidural abscesses (1:1,368) were diagnosed. Only one patient required surgical decompression. There were no long-term neurologic sequelae in any patient. In the past 6 yr, the frequency of investigation and diagnosis of epidural abscess has increased. Overall, the combined rate of epidural abscess or hematoma was 1:1,026, (0.1%; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.19%) with a need for operative intervention of 1:8,210 (0.01%; 95% confidence interval, 0.0-0.07%).

Spinal hematoma was very rare (< 0.05%). Epidural abscess was also rare (< 0.1%) but remains a potentially serious complication. Early diagnosis, using magnetic resonance imaging in patients with appropriate clinical indicators, before the onset of neurologic signs, enables conservative therapy in many cases and may help to prevent the development of serious neurologic sequelae.
