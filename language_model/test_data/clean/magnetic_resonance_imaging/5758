To compare the imaging characteristics of magnetic resonance (MR) delayed enhancement between ischemic and nonischemic myocardial diseases.

We retrospectively analyzed the imaging and clinical characteristics of 25 patients who had MR delayed enhancement.

Among the 25 cases, 19 cases were ischemic heart diseases, in which the delayed enhancement was subendocardium, non-transmural or transmural; two cases were hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, in which the delayed enhancement was midwall in the hypertrophic myocardium, strip- and patch-shaped; one case was dilated cardiomyopathy, in which the delayed enhancement was diffuse small midwall spots two cases was restrictive cardiomyopathy, in which the delayed enhancement was located in the area of the subendocardium both of the right and left ventricles; and one case was a mass of the lateral wall of the left ventricle, in which the delayed enhancement with a clumpy shape was shown.

MR myocardial delayed enhancement is not a specific sign of myocardial infarction of ischeminc heart disease. The differentiation of the etiology of the delayed enhancement relies upon both the MR images and the clinical history.
