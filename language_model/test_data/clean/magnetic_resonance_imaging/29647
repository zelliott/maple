Magnetic resonance imaging has evolved as a prime diagnostic method for soft-tissue abnormalities of the temporomandibular joint. The most common temporomandibular joint abnormalities are internal derangement and osteoarthritis, but there are many other reasons for pain and dysfunction that are often overlooked. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate several of these more unusual and less well-recognized causes for temporomandibular joint pain and dysfunction. For example, internal derangement is often seen in asymptomatic individuals. Another purpose is to illustrate the difference in magnetic resonance imaging of asymptomatic and symptomatic internal derangement.
