We used naming and pointing tests and a proverb completion task to compare two cases of aphasia that exhibited a selective disturbance of word processing. One patient had anomia with word comprehension difficulty due to partial ablation of the left temporal lobe and the other patient had Gogi aphasia due to lobar atrophy with left temporal predominance. We presented 90 pictures of common objects divided into 9 categories in the naming and pointing tests, and used 10 well-known Japanese proverbs as stimuli in the proverb completion task. Performance of the naming and pointing tests was severely impaired in both patients. In the patient with anomia, words the patient could not name or point to varied from session to session and phonemic cue effects were frequently observed. The proverb completion phenomenon was positive. These findings indicate that the patient had an obstruction of the access route to the intact word store or a partial rarefaction of the word store itself. In the patient with Gogi aphasia, the words the patient could not name or point to were consistent from one occasion to another, and no phonemic cue effects or signs of familiarity were observed at all. The proverb completion phenomenon was totally negative. These findings indicate that the patient has lost the word store itself. MR images in the case of anomia revealed a lesion extending from the anterior to the central portion of the inferior part of the left temporal lobe. In the case of Gogi aphasia, the MR images displayed knife-edged focal atrophy in the anterior aspect of both temporal lobes, more prominently on the left.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
