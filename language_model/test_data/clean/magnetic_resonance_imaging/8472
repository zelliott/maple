The aim of this article is to describe the diffusion of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in Iran, including regional variations during the period of 1990 to 2005 and international comparisons.

Data on the diffusion of MRI were obtained from the Medical Equipment Office of the Ministry of Health (MOH) and, using self-administered questionnaires, from forty-one universities specializing in medical sciences. Data were gathered from the year of first purchase up to mid-2005. Information for international comparisons was obtained from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development health data of 2006.

Iran purchased its first MRI unit in 1990. Since then, the number of MRI units has increased remarkably. The diffusion curve of MRI in Iran follows an S-shaped curve with a very slow speed in the period of 1991-95. Accelerated adoption occurred later coinciding with a significant influence from the private sector, especially from 1999. Iran had ninety-three MRI units in 2005, and the number of MRI units per million in the population was 1.36.

The number of MRI units in provinces is not in direct proportion to the number of their inhabitants. Rational adoption and equitable diffusion of MRI may require the MOH and regulatory bodies to improve their ability in health technology assessment and integrate it into the policy making regarding adoption, diffusion, and utilization of health technologies.
