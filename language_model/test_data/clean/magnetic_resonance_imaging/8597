Neurologic complications may develop during the course of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Differential diagnosis of the chronic progressive myelopathy related to human immunodeficiency virus must include multiple sclerosis.

We report a human immunodeficiency virus-positive case with progressive myelopathy who showed multiple sclerosis-like white matter lesions on cranial magnetic resonance imaging. Viral screening revealed positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus.

This case suggests that in a patient who presents with a multiple sclerosis-like clinical course and cerebral white matter lesions, a human immunodeficiency virus-related clinical picture should be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis.
