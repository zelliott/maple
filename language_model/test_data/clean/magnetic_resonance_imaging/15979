Chordomas usually arise in bone and are most commonly found in the midline axial skeleton. An accurate pre-operative diagnosis of chordoma is crucial, as survival is optimal when radical en bloc resection is performed at primary surgery. We report a rare case of cervical chordoma masquerading radiologically as an extracranial nerve sheath tumour. A laterally situated chordoma (centred extra-osseously in the neural foramen) was diagnosed radiologically as a neurofibroma pre-operatively. We review the key radiological features for diagnosis of chordoma. We consider the importance of pre-operative diagnosis of chordoma in guiding management and in determining survival.
