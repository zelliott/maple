A rare case of bilateral basal-cell adenomas in the parotid glands of a 65-year-old woman is reported. There have been only four previous reported cases of bilateral parotid basal-cell adenomas, all of which occurred synchronously with dermal cylindromas. The present lesion is the first case reported in the English literature of bilateral parotid basal-cell adenoma without coexisting dermal cylindroma. Histological examination revealed that the left tumour had adenoid cystic change, which closely resembled adenoid cystic carcinoma. This case is of interest not only because of the raity of bilateral parotid basal-cell adenomas, but also because of the necessity for differentiation from adenoid cystic carcinoma in order to plan appropriate treatment.
