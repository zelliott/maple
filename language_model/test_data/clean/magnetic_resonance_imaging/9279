There is no consensus regarding the fundamental phonetic units that underlie speech production. There is, however, general agreement that the frequency of occurrence of these units is a significant factor. Investigators often use the effects of manipulating frequency to support the importance of particular units. Studies of pseudoword production have been used to show the importance of sublexical units, such as initial syllables, phonemes, and biphones. However, it is not clear that these units play the same role when the production of pseudowords is compared to the production of real words. In this study, participants overtly repeated real and pseudowords that were similar for length, complexity, and initial syllable frequency while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Compared to real words, production of pseudowords produced greater activation in much of the speech production network, including bilateral inferior frontal cortex, precentral gyri and supplementary motor areas and left superior temporal cortex and anterior insula. Only middle right frontal gyrus showed greater activation for real words than for pseudowords. Compared to a no-speech control condition, production of pseudowords or real words resulted in activation of all of the areas shown to comprise the speech production network. Our data, in conjunction with previous studies, suggest that the unit that is identified as the basic unit of speech production is influenced by the nature of the speech that is being studied, i.e., real words as compared to other real words, pseudowords as compared to other pseudowords, or real words as compared to pseudowords.
