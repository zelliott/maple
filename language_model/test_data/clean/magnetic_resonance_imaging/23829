MR imaging depicts the levels, sides, and severity of physical stenoses of the central spinal canal, the lateral recesses, and the neural foramina--diagnostic information crucial for the symptomatic patient under consideration for surgical correction. In the future, it is probable that MR imaging, using standard static techniques, flow-sensitive studies, and noncontrast, intravenous gadolinium-enhanced or intrathecal gadolinium-enhanced acquisitions, will probably replace all other imaging modalities in the primary evaluation of the various subtypes of spinal stenoses.
