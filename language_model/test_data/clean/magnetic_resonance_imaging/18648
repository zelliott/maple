The aim of the present study was to compare eyeblink conditioning in cerebellar patients with lesions including the territory of the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) and in patients with lesions restricted to the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). The cerebellar areas known to be most critical in eyeblink conditioning based on animal data (i.e. Larsell lobule H VI and interposed nucleus) are commonly supplied by the SCA. Eyeblink conditioning was expected to be impaired in SCA, but not in PICA patients. A total of 27 cerebellar patients and 25 age-matched controls were tested. Cerebellar lesions were primarily unilateral (n = 20). Most patients suffered from ischaemic infarctions of the SCA (n = 11) or the PICA (n = 13). The other patients presented with cerebellar tumours (n = 2) and cerebellar agenesis (n = 1). The extent of the cortical lesion (i.e. which lobuli were affected) and possible involvement of the cerebellar nuclei was determined by 3D-MRI. As expected, the ability to acquire classically conditioned eyeblink responses was significantly reduced in the group of all cerebellar patients compared with the controls. In the patients with unilateral cerebellar lesions, conditioning deficits were present ipsilaterally. In SCA patients with lesions including hemispheral lobules VI and Crus I, eyeblink conditioning was significantly reduced on the affected side compared with the unaffected side. No significant difference between the affected and unaffected sides was present in patients with lesions restricted to the common PICA territory (i.e. Crus II and below). Conditioning deficits were neither significantly different in SCA patients with pure cortical lesions compared with SCA patients with additional nuclear impairment nor in SCA patients with unilateral lesions compared with SCA patients with bilateral lesions. To summarize, unilateral cortical lesions of the superior cerebellum appear to be sufficient to reduce eyeblink conditioning in humans significantly.
