Planning of behavior relies on the integrity of the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (mid-dlPFC). Yet, only indirect evidence exists on the association of protracted maturation of dlPFC and continuing gains in planning performance post adolescence. Here, gray matter density of mid-dlPFC in young, healthy adults (18-32 years) was regressed onto performance on the Tower of London planning task while accounting for moderating effects of age and sex on this interrelation. Multiple regression analysis revealed an association of planning performance and mid-dlPFC gray matter density that was especially strong in late adolescence and early twenties. As expected, for males better planning performance was linked to reduced gray matter density of mid-dlPFC, possibly due to maturational processes such as synaptic pruning. Most surprisingly, females showed an inverted, positive interrelation of planning performance and mid-dlPFC gray matter density, indicating that sexually dimorphic development of dlPFC continues during early adulthood. Age and sex are hence important moderators of the link between planning performance and gray matter density in mid-dlPFC. Consequently, the assessment of moderator effects in regression designs can significantly enhance understanding of brain-behavior relationships.
