A 17-year-old black woman with a large vesical pheochromocytoma was managed successfully by hemicystectomy and ureteroneocystotomy. Preoperatively, in addition to the routine diagnostic evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging proved to be an extremely useful modality to assess the integrity of the bladder wall and extent of extravesical involvement.
