The aim of the present study was to investigate, using laser Doppler (LD) flowmetry, the phases immediately prior to and following experimental, neurosurgical laser therapy in animals. Two statistical models obtained on the basis of discriminant analysis are described. These models should enable the user to classify the sets of parameters calculated from the LD signals. With both models which contain 3 and 5 parameters, respectively. 100% discrimination of the two phases was attained. The usefulness of the models could be validated by results obtained with other models.
