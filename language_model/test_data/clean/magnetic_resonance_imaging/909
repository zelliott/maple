The natural history of bronchogenic carcinoma shows that 42% of patients are diagnosed with cancer-related neurological complications either at initial presentation or at follow-up that can be separated in 3 different categories: - locoregional involvement of cervicothoracic nerves (recurrent laryngeal nerves, phrenic and vagus nerves, brachial plexus and sympathetic cervical chains), - metastatic disease characterized by intracranial lesions (brain, meningeal, ependymal and pituitary metastases) and spinal (extradural, subarachnoid and medullary metastases) lesions, - paraneoplastic syndromes including limbic encephalitis, Lambert-Eaton syndrome and paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. These neurological disorders usually are associated with advanced cancer for which radical surgical management seldom is indicated. All imaging studies performed at the time of initial staging for bronchogenic carcinoma should therefore be carefully reviewed in order to detect signs that could suggest the presence of one or several neurological complications. The goals of this paper are to describe the clinical signs and to illustrate the imaging features of neurological complications related to bronchogenic carcinoma at conventional radiography, CT and MRI.
