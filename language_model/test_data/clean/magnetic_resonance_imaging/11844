Fabry disease is an X-linked recessive abnormality of glycosphingolipid metabolism that is due to deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A.

A majority of hemizygous men develop severe multisystemic disease (classic form), dominated by renal failure, progressive neurological and cardiac involvement. Nevertheless, some affected men retain sufficient enzyme activity and long remain asymptomatic (atypical form); their main manifestation is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Female heterozygous carriers are usually asymptomatic; 15% of them, however, have severe involvement of one or several organs. Laboratory, histologic and molecular diagnosis identifies 100% of hemizygous and over 80% of heterozygous subjects.

With developments in molecular genetics, it is now possible to produce the human recombinant enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. Two recent studies had proven that this therapeutic approach was able to be clinically and histologically effective in men. In addition, the results of a trial of gene therapy in a Fabry gene knocked-out mouse appear promising.
