Transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation in the setting of right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit dysfunction is a relatively new procedure with encouraging early and midterm results. Malpositioning of the valve during implantation is a potentially serious complication. This report describes a case in which valve malpositioning was avoided by the use of a unique hybrid approach. This approach may prove to be useful for a select group of patients requiring pulmonary valve replacement.
