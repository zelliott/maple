A 76-year-old male was admitted with increasing fatigue and shortness of breath. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation and an oscillating mass on the pulmonic valve that was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. The patient underwent repair of the mitral valve and excision of the pulmonic valve mass, which was confirmed as a papillary fibroelastoma by histology.
