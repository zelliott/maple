Intracranial mucoceles have been previously reported as direct extradural extensions of mucoceles of the paranasal sinuses. We describe a patient with 2 silent mucoceles isolated within the parenchyma of the frontal lobe of the brain. The patient had undergone multiple previous intranasal polypectomy and ethmoidectomy procedures, and the unsuspected mucoceles were discovered on a computed tomographic scan obtained to evaluate recurrent rhinosinusitis symptoms. Craniotomy was required for removal of the mucoceles.
