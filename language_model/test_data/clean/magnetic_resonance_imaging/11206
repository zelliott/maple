A 9-month-old infant presented with orbital cellulitis and recent discharge from a hair-bearing pit above the eyebrow. Orbital imaging demonstrated a tubular lesion and sinus tract extending from a hypoplastic sphenoid wing, through the lateral orbit, to the skin surface. Complete excision of the dermoid cyst and sinus tract was performed through an eyelid crease approach.
