The hardware chosen for fMRI data analysis may depend on the platform already present in the laboratory or the supporting software. In this study, we ran SPM99 software on multiple platforms to examine whether we could analyze fMRI data by SPM99, and to compare their differences and limitations in processing fMRI data, which can be attributed to hardware capabilities. Six normal right-handed volunteers participated in a study of hand-grasping to obtain fMRI data. Each subject performed a run that consisted of 98 images. The run was measured using a gradient echo-type echo planar imaging sequence on a 1.5T apparatus with a head coil. We used several personal computer (PC), Unix and Linux machines to analyze the fMRI data. There were no differences in the results obtained on several PC, Unix and Linux machines. The only limitations in processing large amounts of the fMRI data were found using PC machines. This suggests that the results obtained with different machines were not affected by differences in hardware components, such as the CPU, memory and hard drive. Rather, it is likely that the limitations in analyzing a huge amount of the fMRI data were due to differences in the operating system (OS).
