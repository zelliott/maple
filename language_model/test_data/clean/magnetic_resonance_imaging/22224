This is a report of two parent-child families which developed intracranial neoplasm. There is no known history of brain tumor in other family members. Two instances of familial brain tumors are reported which are different from those seen in phakomatosis. Family one had posterior fossa tumors including astrocytoma and hemangioblastoma. The second family had endocrine-associated tumors consisting of pituitary adenoma and yolk sac tumor.
