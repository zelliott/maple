The popliteal artery is a relatively short vascular segment but is affected by a unique set of pathologic conditions. These conditions, which may be common throughout the arterial system or exclusive to the popliteal artery, include atherosclerosis, popliteal artery aneurysm, arterial embolus, trauma, popliteal artery entrapment syndrome, and cystic adventitial disease. The clinical manifestations, imaging appearances, and treatment options associated with these pathologic conditions differ significantly. Consequently, the radiologist should be familiar with these conditions to direct imaging for accurate diagnosis and treatment and to prevent loss of limb.
