The accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of osteonecrosis of the femoral head was compared with that of other diagnostic methods in current use: plain radiography, bone-marrow pressure determinations, intramedullary venography, and histological examination of core-biopsy bone specimens. In the first phase of the study, forty-eight patients (ninety-six hips) who were at high risk for avascular necrosis were studied. Abnormal patterns on magnetic resonance imaging, consistent with those seen in necrosis, were found in all hips that were suspected of having Ficat Stage-2 or 3 changes on the basis of radiographic evidence of the disease. Abnormal patterns on magnetic resonance imaging that were characteristic of avascular necrosis were also observed in 17 per cent of the hips that were suspected of having Ficat Stage-0 changes and in 64 per cent of those that showed Stage-1 changes, all with no radiographic changes. In the second phase of the study, twenty-three of the ninety-six hips that were suspected of having early-stage necrosis of the femoral head but showed slight or no radiographic changes were studied by repeat radiographs, Ficat functional evaluations of bone, core biopsies of the femoral head, and magnetic resonance imaging. Of the twenty-three hips, eighteen (78 per cent) had positive changes on magnetic resonance imaging; nineteen (83 per cent) had positive histological evidence of necrosis; and fourteen (61 per cent) had positive findings by bone-marrow pressure studies and intramedullary venography. Although false-negative and false-positive results were observed with magnetic resonance imaging, the over-all results of this study suggest that magnetic resonance imaging may be useful for the early diagnosis of avascular necrosis.
