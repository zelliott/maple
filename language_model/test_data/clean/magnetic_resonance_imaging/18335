A family with late-onset autosomal dominant pure cerebellar ataxia was studied both neurologically and genetically. Neuroimaging and electrophysiological results were in agreement with the clinical evidence showing involvement of the cerebellar system only, even many years after onset. No atrophy of inferior olives was observed by magnetic resonance imaging, while cerebellar atrophy was extremely marked. A very slow disease progression was observed in all patients. The disease can be differentiated from autosomal dominant olivo-ponto-cerebellar atrophies, and in particular from spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 mapping on chromosome 6p, which shows an early multisystemic involvement and a more rapid progression toward inability. A genetic study of the family with the 6p DNA marker D6S89 closely linked to the spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 locus was performed. Results showed significant exclusion of a linkage between the disease and the marker within a distance of 8.5% recombination, indicating that genetic heterogeneity underlies phenotypic differences.
