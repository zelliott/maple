A case of carcinoma arising in a posterior pharyngeal pulsion diverticulum is reported. The radiologic work-up included computed tomography and magnetic resonance. Both these modern cross-sectional imaging methods allow conclusive differentiation of filling defects, which is known to be difficult in many cases with conventional imaging techniques. Filling defects due to carcinoma are easily recognized and differentiated from those caused by inspissated food debris as they are enhanced following i.v. administration of contrast medium. In addition, the depth of infiltration can be established.
