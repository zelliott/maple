Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease is an inherited disorder characterized by multiple cysts in kidneys and other organs. A 63-year-old man was evaluated for the etiology of recurrent pancreatitis and chronic renal failure. Multiple cysts of kidneys, liver, and pancreas and pancreas divisum was diagnosed. Pancreatitis should be included in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in patients with ADPKD. Pancreas divisum may be a predisposing factor for acute pancreatitis in these patients.
