High-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with phased-array pelvic and endorectal coils has dramatically enhanced the ability to visualize abnormalities of the female urethra and periurethral tissues. These include developmental abnormalities (eg, urethral duplication, ectopic ureterocele), benign processes (eg, urethral diverticulum, caruncle, leiomyoma, trauma, and fistula; stress incontinence; paravaginal cyst), and malignant processes (eg, primary urethral carcinoma, secondary urethral malignancies). High-resolution MR imaging can be used to assess complications such as fistula formation and periurethral abscess, localize various entities, exclude pathologic processes whose presence could lead to an incorrect diagnosis, differentiate processes that might be confused at physical examination, and contribute to surgical planning and facilitate surgical correction.
