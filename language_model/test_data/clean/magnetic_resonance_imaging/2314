We evaluated 31 painful shoulders of 30 patients with chronic arthritis by ultrasonography (US) and compared the results with those of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both US and MRI revealed effusion in the subacromial-subdeltoid (SA-SD) bursa, biceps tendon sheath (BTS) and glenohumeral (GH) joint, but MRI was more accurate in depicting joint inflammation because of its ability to visualize synovial hypertrophy. US visualized biceps tendon ruptures equally well as MRI. MRI was better able to reveal full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon, whereas US showed better other changes of the supraspinatus tendon (degeneration or partial-thickness tear). Both of the imaging methods were able to depict erosions of the humeral head, but the locations occasionally differed. Inexpensive and easily available US can be recommended as the first imaging method for the detection of soft-tissue changes in the arthritic shoulder, but in rotator cuff problems both methods may be needed.
