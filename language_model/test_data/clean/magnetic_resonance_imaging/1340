Thirty-three patients with histological diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma were studied with MR imaging at 1.5 T. All patients were clinically diagnosed as having stage I or II disease (FIGO) and underwent abdominal hysterectomy. MR tissue characteristics and morphological features were compared with morphological features were compared with microscopic pathological findings, in all patients. The following initials were adopted for statistical comparison: M0 = tumor confined to endometrium; M1 = infiltration of the inner third of myometrium; M2 = invasion of the central third of myometrium; M3 = infiltration of the outer third of myometrium. T1-weighted (SE 600/30) and T2-weighted (SE 2000/35.90) (SE 1500/28.60) images were obtained in sagittal plane (section thickness = mm 4). Overall MR accuracy in determining the extent of myometrial invasion was 78%. Correct evaluation of myometrial invasion is essential in patients with stage I or II endometrial carcinoma who are to undergo transvaginal hysterectomy without lymphadenectomy (M0, M1).
