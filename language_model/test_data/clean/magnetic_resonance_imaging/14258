Abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are reported in six individuals with various skeletal complications of type I Gaucher disease. The changes were a nonhomogeneous reduction in both T1 and T2 marrow signals with increased T2 signals during avascular episodes. MRI proved an excellent technique for the assessment of bone marrow changes in Type I Gaucher disease and for assessing avascular complications. It was not able to differentiate between pseudo-osteomyelitis and pyogenic osteomyelitis without clinical correlation. The problems studied included the extent of intramedullary Gaucher cell infiltration, avascular necrosis of femoral heads, assessment of bone pain from pseudo-osteomyelitis and the relationship of skeletal disease to splenectomy.
