Imaging features of intracranial haemangiopericytomas are similar to those of meningiomas. Preoperative identification of these tumours is important because of their aggressive nature, high rate of local recurrence and propensity for late metastasis. We reviewed the CT, MRI and angiographic findings in seven pathologically proved haemangiopericytomas, to determine if imaging characteristics might distinguish them from meningiomas. None showed hyperostosis or tumour calcification. All showed marked enhancement. Five had prominent internal signal voids, suggesting feeding arteries. On angiography, one had only pial-cortical supply but six also had meningeal supply; all showed a persistent stain. Only one had multiple "corkscrew" feeding vessels.
