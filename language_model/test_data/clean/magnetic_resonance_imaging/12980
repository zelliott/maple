External snapping hip is caused by snapping of the thickened iliotibial band or the gluteus maximus over the greater trochanter. We retrospectively reviewed results of the release of multiple fibrous bands of the iliotibial band or gluteus maximus for treatment of external snapping hip in 44 patients.

We wanted to evaluate the functional results of this technique in terms of resolution of symptoms, patient satisfaction, and complications. A snapping hip questionnaire was designed for the evaluation, and the results were evaluated at an average 62 months after surgery.

All the patients had resolution of their symptoms after surgery and were satisfied with the treatment. Recurrence of snapping was reported in five patients, but they did not find it severe enough to require a second surgery. Ten patients reported some limp or weakness, and four patients had seroma formation, requiring reinsertion of a drainage tube.

We recommend release of multiple fibrous bands of the iliotibial band and gluteus maximus muscle for treatment of external snapping hip, as it has a low rate of recurrence and a high rate of patient satisfaction.
