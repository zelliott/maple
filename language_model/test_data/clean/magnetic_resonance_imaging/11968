Optimal control methods have been recently introduced to improve the design of selective radio frequency pulses and several optimized selective pulses that can produce excellent slice profiles have been reported. These pulses usually require high peak rf amplitudes to implement and thus can not be widely utilized because of the limitations of the specific absorption rate and the rf power amplifier of a clinical system. We have a Siemens 1.5 T MRI clinical system. Several pulse files which consist of the bandwidth matched 90 degrees and 180 degrees selective pulses are provided. Some of these can produce excellent slice profiles. However, they can only be used in the pulse sequences with the pulse length of 5.12 msec. The purpose of this paper is to improve the slice profiles produced by the pulse file in the pulse sequences with the shorter 2.56 msec pulse length. A pulse file optimized by the conjugate gradient method is proposed to substitute the 2.56 msec Siemens pulse file. Our experimental results confirm that the slice profiles and images are improved by the optimized pulse file with a lower peak voltage. The proposed pulse file can also be applied in other clinical MRI systems.
