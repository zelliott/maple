In 114 patients with postrepair myelomeningocele MRI of the spine was performed. Tethered cord (89%) and associated malformations (syrinx, lipoma etc.) (33%) were the most important findings. Additional MRI scans of the head (44 patients) revealed numerous further anomalies. Arnold Chiari malformation was found in 76% of the patients (ACM I:32%, ACM II:44%). In the ACM II group compression of lower cranial nerves, brain stem, and cerebellum can lead to considerable neurologic symptoms. Therefore in patients with progressive neurologic dysfunction a complete investigation of the whole spine and brain is necessary. MRI proves to be the diagnostic procedure of choice in patients with dysraphic myelodysplasia.
