Percutaneous vertebroplasty has been established as a safe and effective treatment for compression fractures of osteoporotic vertebrae. Complications of vertebroplasty, such as infection or anterior cement extrusion, are rare. Herein, we report an unusual presentation in an immunocompromised patient with an insidious infection of the disk. This infection resulted in dislodgment of the cement inferiorly and a compression fracture of the adjacent vertebra 6 months after vertebroplasty. We discuss the significance of this case and compare it with 7 others found in the literature.
