We report the results of the reevaluation of 24 patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) using central nervous system (CNS) imaging techniques. The first examination by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated the presence of optic glioma in three cases, "unidentified bright objects" (UBOs) in six, and a suspected right frontal tumor in one. In two patients optic glioma and UBOs were both present and in one of them a bulbar tumor was also suspected. Later imaging examinations revealed the appearance of optic glioma in three more cases and UBOs in nine. In two of these patients both optic glioma and UBOs were present. This study indicates that the likelihood of detecting imaging abnormalities in patients with NF1 increases when systematic follow-up is performed. Optic gliomas are characteristic of pediatric patients; they rarely give rise to clinical manifestations (1/6 cases) and in general progress very slowly. For these reasons, therapeutic strategy must be carefully considered and individually decided. UBOs are very frequent findings in pediatric patients with NF 1 and therefore they must be considered diagnostically relevant. They are not related to clinical manifestations and spontaneous regression has been observed. The nature of these imaging abnormalities is still unknown, but because they do not behave like tumors, useless and dangerous therapeutic procedures should not be employed.
