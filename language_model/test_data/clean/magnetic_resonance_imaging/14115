A case of rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata was investigated with MR imaging of the brain and hydrogen-1 MR spectroscopy of the brain and blood. Areas with abnormal signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted images or hypointensity on T1-weighted images were detected in the subcortical white matter. MR spectroscopy of the brain showed that normal-appearing white matter was characterized by increased levels of mobile lipids and myo-inositol, reduced levels of choline, and the presence of acetate. The importance of these metabolic anomalies is correlated to the deficiency in plasmalogen biosynthesis.
