We reported a rare case who had hypoxic-encephalopathy causing frontal apraxia of gait. The patient, a 34-year-old female, was admitted in July, 1994, complaining of difficulty in walking after anoxic brain damage caused by ventricular arrhythmia. She had difficulty in raising her feet, which appeared to be rooted to the floor. There was no evidence of motor paralysis, spasticity, rigidity or sensory loss, but she did show frontal lobe signs such as foot grasp reflex and Gegenhalten. Cranial MRI showed slight atrophy of the frontal lobe. On T2 weighted image, high-intensity areas were detected at the posterior internal capsule and corona radiata. Single photon emission CT (123I-IMP) demonstrated a low perfusion area which included the inferomedical part of the frontal lobe. After 8 months of hospitalization, her postural instability and unsteady gait slowly improved without treatment as frontal signs such as foot grasp reflex disappeared. We speculate that her apraxia of gait may result from grasp reflex and Gegenhalten.
