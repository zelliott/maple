We present a case of acute spinal cord compression due to haemorrhage following recurrent infarction of the right pedicle of the second lumbar vertebra. Such a case has not previously been reported and we describe the radiological and operative findings. Magnetic resonance imaging was particularly helpful in precisely localizing the lesion and planning surgery. The most likely diagnosis remained a solitary neoplastic deposit until confirmation of recurrent infarction was made on histological examination of the operative specimen. The histological findings were also in keeping with the episodic progression of the patients symptoms.
