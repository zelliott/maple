The aim of this study was to analyze the type and frequency of cranial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging anomalies in patients with idiopathic growth hormone deficiency, and also to investigate the possible relationship between neuroradiological images and the presence of isolated growth hormone or multiple pituitary hormone deficiency.

Magnetic resonance and computed tomography images were obtained for 37 patients with idiopathic growth hormone deficiency. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with isolated growth hormone (group A) and patients with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies (group B).

Computed tomography was normal in 25 (68%), and abnormal in 12 (32%) patients. We observed empty sella in 50%, partially empty sella in 17% and anterior pituitary hypoplasia in 33% patients. MRI studies revealed normal findings in the hypothalamus-pituitary area in 17 (46%) and abnormal in 20 (54%) patients. We did not observed differences in the frequency of computed tomography alterations when groups A and B were compared (p = 0.55). With magnetic resonance imaging we observed, empty sella in 10%, partially empty sella in 15% and anterior pituitary hypoplasia in 75% patients. Among those patients whose magnetic resonance images were altered, the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland was identified in an abnormal position in 70%, and the hypophyseal stalk was thin or interrupted in 60%. The patients from group B presented a higher frequency of magnetic resonance imaging anomalies (90%) when compared to group A (10%), p = 0.03. There was disagreement between the two methods in 43% of cases, but we didn't observe a difference in the frequency of alterations when computed tomography was compared with magnetic resonance imaging (p = 0.06).

The most frequent defects observed using magnetic resonance imaging are anterior pituitary hypoplasia and ectopic posterior pituitary lobe. The association of glandular hypoplasia with other magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities can suggest the presence of multiple anterior pituitary deficiencies.
