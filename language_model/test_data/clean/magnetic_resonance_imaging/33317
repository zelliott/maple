We report four patients who presented with a severe form of metaphyseal chondromatosis in association with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D-2-HGA). All patients showed splaying columns of irregular ossification defects with bulbous metaphyses of the long tubular bones, as well as remarkable involvement of the short tubular and flat bones. The vertebral bodies revealed platyspondyly with irregular, stippled endplates. D-2-HGA has been described as a neurometabolic disorder manifesting a broad range of impairment in mental and motor development. Although hydroxyglutaric acid was excreted in high amounts in the urine of all four patients described herein, no significant neurologic abnormalities were evident. This unusual combination of characteristic skeletal and metabolic abnormalities has rarely been reported. Thus, our report will facilitate the recognition of this distinctive entity, and we suggest that a urine organic acid screening be obtained in patients who present with generalized enchondromatosis.
