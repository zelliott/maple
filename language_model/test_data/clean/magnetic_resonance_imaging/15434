We report a rare case of cerebellopontine angle (CPA) meningioma whose sole symptom was severe vertigo. A 39-year-old woman with right CPA meningioma was referred for surgery. She experienced severe vertigo for 2 years without any other symptoms. Caloric test indicated right canal paresis of 90%. Her audiogram was normal. After surgery, vertigo symptoms disappeared dramatically. The mechanisms of restoration from vertigo are discussed.
