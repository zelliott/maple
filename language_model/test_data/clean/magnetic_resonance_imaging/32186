A 35 month old child was referred for electrophysiology testing with pendular nystagmus, corresponding head oscillations and reduced vision. Flash visual evoked potential (VEP) revealed large responses at the right occiput (but not the left occiput) from the right eye and similar large responses at only the left occiput from the left eye, indicating absent/deficient crossover at the chiasm. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan subsequently confirmed absence of the optic chiasm. There was no other evidence of midline brain defects. Her subsequent development to age 11 has been followed. The nystagmus has remained mainly horizontal but a torsional component was noted from age 5 years and described as see-saw at age 6 years. A small right esotropia was noted at 6 years and spectacles prescribed for low hypermetropic refractive error. Bilateral superior rectus recessions at age 7 years produced an improved head posture. Her visual acuity has remained stable at around 6/24 from age 4 years. No binocularity nor stereopsis has been demonstrated over subsequent visits.
