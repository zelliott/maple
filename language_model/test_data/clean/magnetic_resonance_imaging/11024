The authors present the case of a chondrolipoma which was excised from the left hand's palm of an 83-year old woman. Chondrolipomas are rare neoplasms; their terminology and pathogenesis have been controversial in the past. Chondrolipoma in the hand does not seem to have been reported so far. The present case thus expands the spectrum of neoplasms known to arise at this anatomical site.
