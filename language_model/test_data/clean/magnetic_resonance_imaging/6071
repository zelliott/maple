The use of MRI in prostate cancer management is controversial and current guidelines underplay its role. Technological advances over the past 5 years, however, demand a re-evaluation of this position. In this article, we propose an increased use of MRI, not only in those with a diagnosis of prostate cancer but also for men before a prostate biopsy. The use of MRI before a biopsy can serve as a triage test in men with raised serum prostate-specific antigen levels, in order to select those for biopsy with significant cancer that requires treatment. This strategy could avoid biopsy, and hence unnecessary treatment, in those with no disease or insignificant cancer. In addition, avoidance of postbiopsy artifact caused by hemorrhage will lead to better local staging accuracy, while determining more accurately the disease burden. This approach could improve risk stratification by selecting those who require adjuvant therapy or dose escalation. Furthermore, MRI evaluation of cancer burden could be important in active surveillance regimens to select those needing intervention.
