To compare the diagnostic performance of gadofluorine M with that of gadopentetate dimeglumine in the diagnosis of lymph node metastases with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in a rabbit model of gastric cancer.

The study protocol was approved by the institutional animal care committee. VX2 carcinomas were inoculated into the wall of the stomach in 20 rabbits. Gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging was performed 4-6 weeks after inoculation, and gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging was performed approximately 24 hours later. Both MR imaging sets were analyzed separately and independently by four radiologists with respect to confidence level regarding the presence of metastases in lymph nodes and lymph node conspicuity. Statistical analysis was performed by using multiple-reader multiple-case (MRMC) receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and the Wilcoxon signed rank test.

Metastases were confirmed at pathologic analysis in 32 of 104 lymph nodes from 16 rabbits. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for confidence regarding the presence of metastases in lymph nodes was significantly greater for gadofluorine M than for gadopentetate dimeglumine (AUC, 0.947 vs 0.894; P = .009). However, most (81%, 25 of 32) metastatic nodes were necrotic, and no significant difference was obtained in nonnecrotic nodes. For lymph node conspicuity, the gadofluorine M MR imaging set was assigned a significantly higher score than was the gadopentetate dimeglumine MR imaging set by all readers (P < .001).

Gadofluorine M showed significantly higher accuracy and better conspicuity than gadopentetate dimeglumine in the diagnosis of metastatic nodes, most of which were necrotic, in this animal model of gastric cancer.
