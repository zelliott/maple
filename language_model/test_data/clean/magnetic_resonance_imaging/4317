We report a patient with multiple negative evaluations during emergency department visits and inpatient admissions for unexplained, intermittent nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The etiology of her symptoms was not revealed until her 13th hospital visit, when head magnetic resonance imaging suggested active neurocysticercosis. Central etiologies should be considered for intractable nausea and vomiting in neurologically intact patients even if head computed-assisted tomography scan is negative.
