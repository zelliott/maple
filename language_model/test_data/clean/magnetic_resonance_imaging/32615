Intracranial granulocytic sarcoma (chloroma) may occur rarely in leukemia. A 27-year-old male presented with an isolated recurrence of granulocytic sarcoma manifesting as an intraaxial mass 27 months after complete remission of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He was admitted due to a severe headache and blurred vision. Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an enhanced mass which was initially interpreted as an extraaxial tumor in the right temporal region. Because of increased intracranial pressure and the mass effect, open biopsy with surgical resection was performed. The biopsy result indicated that intraaxial lymphoblastic leukemia infiltration had caused CNS relapse. Although granulocytic sarcoma occurs primarily in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, the authors report a rare case of intraparenchymal granulocytic sarcoma in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
