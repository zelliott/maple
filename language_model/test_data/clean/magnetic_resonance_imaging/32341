A healthy 45-year-old man had a retrobulbar hemorrhage 9 days after cosmetic upper eyelid blepharoplasty that resulted in permanent visual loss. After performing a left lateral canthotomy and cantholysis, intraocular pressure returned to normal and vision improved from no light perception to 20/40; however, the patient did have permanent visual field loss. To our knowledge, this is the longest period of time after blepharoplasty that a retrobulbar hemorrhage occurred. Ophthalmologists should have a heightened level of suspicion 1 to 2 weeks after surgery.
