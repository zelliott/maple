We measured and compared left ventricular mass in 20 patients by ultrafast computed tomography (UFCT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and contrast left ventriculography (LVG). Left ventricular mass was calculated by UFCT and MRI in two ways: (1) excluding papillary muscles and trabeculae (LV mass), and (2) including papillary muscles and trabeculae (LV mass + PM&T) by Simpson's method. Left ventricular mass excluding papillary muscles and trabeculae (LV mass) in LVG was calculated by Rackley's method by biplane angiocardiography. LV mass was significantly larger in LVG than in MRI and UFCT (p < 0.01). Although LV mass was significantly larger in MRI than in UFCT (p < 0.01), there was no significant difference in LV mass + PM&T between UFCT and MRI. Interobserver and intraobserver variability showed good correlation of coefficient in both UFCT and MRI. We therefore conclude that left ventricular mass is best measured by including papillary muscles and trabeculae by Simpson's method in UFCT or MRI.
