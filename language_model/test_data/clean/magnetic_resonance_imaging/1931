The purpose of this study was to present a new visualizing method for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pathology in 3D at several condylar positions and to apply the method to a case of juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) with previously diagnosed bilateral TMJ disorder and to a subject without signs and symptoms from the TMJ.

The 20-year-old female patient had suffered from polyarticular JCA from the age of 6 years 8 months. The present study is based on a follow-up examination after the completion of orthodontic treatment with the Herbst appliance. Both TMJs were examined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at closed and open mouth positions. The mandibular condyle, the glenoid fossa and the articular disc were segmented and 3D reconstruction of these structures was carried out.

The condyle was characterized by an increased sagittal diameter with osteophyte-like formation at the anterior aspect of the condylar head and flattening of the superior surface. The depth of the glenoid fossa was reduced and the articular eminence was remarkably flat. The articular disc was markedly diminished and posteriorly placed on the condylar head. The distance of the condylar path during mouth opening was reduced and the curvature of the condylar path was quite flat. The disc moved slightly posteriorly on the condylar head and remained in the glenoid fossa during mouth opening.

The imaging modality described improves visualization of TMJ morphology and gains insight into the TMJ pathology of the JCA patient, adding to understanding of the clinical problems.
