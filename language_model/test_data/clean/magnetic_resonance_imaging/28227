The purpose of the study was to examine behavioral/cognitive and neuroradiological features of patients with concurrent Tourette's disorder (TD) and Asperger's syndrome (AS).

The authors studied the occurrence of structural brain abnormalities using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in seven males with concurrent TD and AS, and in nine age-matched males, who had TD but did not have AS. Both groups were tested with an extensive battery of neurological and psychiatric rating scales and cognitive tests.

Five of the seven patients with TD and AS had developmental brain anomalies. In contrast, normal MRI scans were found in all but one TD patient without AS. Both groups were not significantly different in the severity of motor and phonic tics, obsessionality, depression and anxiety, or in measures of general intelligence, memory, and language function; but patients with TD and AS had a history of more psychiatric hospitalizations, poor academic achievement, more neurological soft signs and appeared more impaired on complex problem-solving and spatial tests than did TD patients without AS.

These findings suggest that structural cortical and subcortical abnormalities are more common among individuals with concurrent TD and AS than among sex- and age-matched TD patients without AS. Dysfunction of frontal-subcortical systems may play a role in the pathophysiology of concurrent TD and AS.
