A 47-year-old man underwent a low anterior resection of the rectosigmoid colon with en bloc cystoprostatectomy for vesicorectal fistula due to a locally advanced rectal cancer. Histopathological examination of the bladder revealed two additional primary malignancies: urothelial carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of two histologically distinct urothelial malignancies that were diagnosed during a work up of vesicorectal fistula due to adenocarcinoma of the rectum.
