High field MRI operating at 3 T is increasingly being used in the field of neuroradiology on the grounds that higher magnetic field strength should theoretically lead to a higher diagnostic accuracy in the diagnosis of several disease entities. This Editorial discusses the exhaustive review by Wardlaw and colleagues of research comparing 3 T MRI with 1.5 T MRI in the field of neuroradiology. Interestingly, the authors found no convincing evidence of improved image quality, diagnostic accuracy, or reduced total examination times using 3 T MRI instead of 1.5 T MRI. These findings are highly relevant since a new generation of high field MRI systems operating at 7 T has recently been introduced.

• Higher magnetic field strengths do not necessarily lead to a better diagnostic accuracy.                 • Disadvantages of high field MR systems have to be considered in clinical practice.                 • Higher field strengths are needed for functional imaging, spectroscopy, etc.                 • Disappointingly there are few direct comparisons of 1.5 and 3 T MRI.                 • Whether the next high field MR generation (7 T) will improve diagnostic accuracy has to be investigated.
