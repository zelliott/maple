To present a real classification of the cerebral midline and the posterior fossa malformations from a clinical, embryological, anatomical and imaging point of view.

They were considered personal criteria based in a wide experience, especially considering the clinical facts of the patients and their correlation with the magnetic resonance (MR) images and the anatomic findings as well as the contribution of the literature to this subject.

It is able to distinguish several types of malformations that involve supratentorial or infratentorial zones or both in the same patient. Given the clinical, imaging and anatomical peculiarities, it is possible to differentiate isolated malformations and malformative syndromes involving zones of the cerebral midline or the posterior fossa.

The clinical peculiarities are basic to suggest the presence of cerebral malformations, but the imaging study, especially the MR, is necessary in order to confirm the malformations. The differentiation between isolated malformation and malformative syndrome is nowadays necessary [REV NEUROL 1999; 28:116-29].
