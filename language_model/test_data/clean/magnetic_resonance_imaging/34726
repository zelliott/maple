The purpose of this study was to present our initial experience with contrast-enhanced MR urography with a breath-hold three-dimensional imaging technique. We performed MR urographic studies in two pigs (four studies) and five human subjects using gadopentetate dimeglumine. The FISP sequence we used was the same as the one used for contrast-enhanced three-dimensional breath-hold angiography. MR three-dimensional urograms were obtained 7-24 minutes after the contrast injection with a dose as low as .03 mmol/kg. The calyces, renal pelves, and ureters were very well visualized. Three-dimensional MR urography can be acquired within a single breath-hold after administration of gadolinium chelates. This technique could become part of a protocol that could potentially lead to a single comprehensive diagnostic workup for suspected ureteral obstruction and gross hematuria.
