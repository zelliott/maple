This concerns a patient with compression myelopathy following passive hyperextension of the cervical spine during a dental procedure. Although he had been asymptomatic prior to the procedure, subsequent cervical spinal imaging revealed advanced spondylosis and spinal stenosis. Spinal stenosis is often asymptomatic for a long time. However, when radiculomyelopathy occurs after minor trauma to the head or neck, the patient is often found to have spinal stenosis. Specifically, hyperextension of a cervical spine with spondylotic changes can lead to compression myelopathy. Acquired spinal stenosis correlates positively with aging. As the size of the elderly population continues to increase the prevalence of cervical spondylotic radiculo-myelopathy will likely increase as well. Since appropriate precautions against potential neurologic damage can be undertaken, we suggest radiographic screening for pre-existing spinal stenosis prior to a procedure requiring hyperextension of the neck. Preventive measures for individuals with asymptomatic spondylotic changes and education of all health-care professionals to avoid abrupt or prolonged hyperextension of the cervical spine is emphasized.
