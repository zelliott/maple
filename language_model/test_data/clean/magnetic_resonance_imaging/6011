The anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) is the major white matter tract providing reciprocal connections between the frontal cortex, striatum and thalamus. Mounting evidence suggests that this tract may be affected in schizophrenia, with brain imaging studies reporting reductions in white matter volume and density, changes in fractional anisotropy and reduced asymmetry. However, the molecular correlates of these deficits are currently unknown. The aim of this study was to identify alterations in protein and metabolite levels in the ALIC in schizophrenia. Samples were obtained post-mortem from individuals with schizophrenia (n=15) and non-psychiatric controls (n=13). Immunoreactivity for the myelin-associated protein myelin basic protein (MBP), and the axonal-associated proteins phosphorylated neurofilament and SNAP-25 was measured by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA). Metabolite concentrations were quantified by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR) spectroscopy. Levels of myelin- or axonal-associated proteins did not differ between groups. Overall differences in metabolite concentrations were observed between the two groups (MANOVA F=2.685, p=0.036), with post-hoc tests revealing lower lactate (19%) and alanine (24%) levels in the schizophrenia group relative to controls. Observed changes in lactate and alanine levels indicate metabolic abnormalities within the ALIC in schizophrenia.
