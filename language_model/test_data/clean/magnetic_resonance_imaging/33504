Odontogenic infections rarely spread beyond the periapical space. Occasionally spread of infection into contiguous anatomic areas occurs through bone, fascial or muscular barriers. Two cases of orofacial abscess of odontogenic origin in the pediatric patient are presented, one imaged with CT and the other with MRI. Both abscesses involved the deep and superficial tissues of the face. Additionally, one of the abscesses extended into the orbit and the other involved the preseptal soft tissue. The pathogenesis, mechanism of spread and management of the disease are discussed.
