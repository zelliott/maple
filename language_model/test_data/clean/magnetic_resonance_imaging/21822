The case of a patient with selective left hemispheric medial and lateral temporal lobe damage is described. The patient was of slightly supra-average intelligence and had no problems in normal memory functions, but was severely anomic with respect to people's names. One month post-onset, this deficit held for names of colleagues and friends she had gotten to know during the last 10 years prior to the infarct and for all names confronted with post-infarct. On the other hand, learning of face-name associations was preserved and was independent of the ability to generate context-specific information for the subjects whose names were requested. The results support the existence of category-specific naming impairments, and, moreover, indicate a deficit that has to be differentiated with regard to memory systems. A time-limited, but prolonged engagement of interconnected left medial and adjacent lateral temporal lobe structures in ecphory is stressed for context-restricted information such as proper names.
