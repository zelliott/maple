Thirty-four consecutive patients with cervical disc herniation underwent surgical treatment at Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute. The clinical signs and diagnostic findings as well as surgical results were analyzed. Predominance of direct spinal cord involvement, characteristic changes in the anterior spinal artery and afferent vessels confirm the fact that cervical disk herniation causes vascular changes to take place, which in turn affect neural structures. Microsurgical techniques with maximum preservation of bone structures and vertebral endplates is mandatory. If multiple disk herniations are present, the most prominent compressing disk fragment should be removed. Stabilization following the surgery is considered effective.
