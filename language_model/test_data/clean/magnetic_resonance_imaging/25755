The diagnosis of teratoma may be made by demonstration of high amylase content in fluid aspirated from anterior mediastinal lesions. In 2 cases of mediastinal teratoma proteolytic enzyme activity was evident at the time of operation. A diagnosis of mediastinal teratoma was aided in 2 subsequent cases by demonstration of elevated amylase activity in the aspirated fluid before definitive operation.
