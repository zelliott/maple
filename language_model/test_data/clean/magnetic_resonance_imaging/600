This paper documents the clinical, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and anatomic characteristics of 6 patients with esohypotropia and high axial myopia. The results of strabismus surgery performed on these patients are evaluated.

Retrospective cohort study.

Six patients with esohypotropia and high axial myopia were selected from the practice of the second author (Michael Flanders).

We extracted the history and data from the preoperative and postoperative ophthalmic and orthoptic examinations, recorded the surgical procedures, and tabulated the postoperative results. A- and B-scans, orbital MRI images, and photo documentation were obtained for all patients. Supramaximal recession and resection on the horizontal rectus muscles, using adjustable sutures, was performed in all patients. A surgical outcome was deemed successful if, in primary position, postoperative horizontal ocular alignment measured 15 prism diopters (PD) or less and (or) if diplopia was eliminated.

Echographic and MRI findings demonstrated an enlarged globe in all cases. Globe flattening on the orbital walls was found in 5 cases. Lateral rectus depression was visualized on MRI images in 4 cases. Surgical success was obtained in all patients. The average preoperative primary position esotropia measured 60 PD (25 to 90 PD) and the esodeviation after surgery was 7.0 PD (0 to 15 PD). Ductions were also improved.

Different surgical approaches to realignment of eyes with high myopia and esohypotropia have been attempted. In this study, supramaximal amounts of recession and resection on the rectus muscles provided satisfactory results.
