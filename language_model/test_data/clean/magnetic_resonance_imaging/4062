A 43-year-old male presented with swelling involving the right eye. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a round tumor in the lateral region of the right orbit, which was isointense relative to the cerebral gray matter and homogeneously enhanced by gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid with a flow-void signal area in the mass. The tumor was totally resected through the transcranial and fronto-orbitotemporal approach after embolization of feeding arteries arising from the external carotid artery. The histological findings were characteristic of hemangiopericytoma. No radiation therapy was administered. The transcranial and fronto-orbitotemporal approach provides a wide operative field with excellent exposure of the highly vascular orbital tumor.
