We present the case of a 23-year old female patient with clinical signs and biochemical results of a pheochromocytoma. Abdominal ultrasound gave no hints on localisation. Angiography demonstrated a richly vasculated tumour in the region of the superior urinary bladder. Computed tomography (CT) was able to localise the tumour but could not differentiate the tumour origin in bladder or uterus. The selective venous catheter blood sampling confirmed the localisation of the norepinephrine producing pheochromocytoma in the inferior pelvic region. Intraoperative diagnosis turned out to be an extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma of unknown tumour status in the dorsal bladder wall.
