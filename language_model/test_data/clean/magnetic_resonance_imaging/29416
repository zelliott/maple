We report an immunocompetent patient with the Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) followed days later by brainstem disease. Extensive virological studies proved that varicella zoster virus (VZV) was the causative agent. Treatment with intravenous acyclovir resulted in prompt resolution of all neurological deficits except peripheral facial palsy. This case demonstrates that after geniculate zoster, brainstem disease may develop even in an immunocompetent individual and effective antiviral therapy can be curative.
