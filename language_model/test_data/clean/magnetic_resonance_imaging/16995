Shunt dysfunction is a common situation in neurosurgery. Often symptoms, physical examination and radiology are not enough to set a diagnosis. ICP continuous monitoring is a safe and reliable tool that provides valuable information about CSF dynamics in these patients. Not only quantitative analysis is needed but also a qualitative one that enables pathological waves identification, because high amplitude B waves are strongly related to shunt dysfunction. In this paper experience about ICP continuous monitoring in patients with shunt dysfunction suspect is presented. Quantitative and qualitative data analysis led to a correct diagnosis, improving all the patients treated according to this criterion. An intraparenchymatous CaminoÂ® sensor and neuroPICture software (developed by first author) for data collection and graphic representation were used. Complications related to monitoring were absent and graphics obtained useful for qualitative analysis.
