Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood. Spontaneous regression has been well described in infants, especially in those with stage 4S and those with low-stage neuroblastoma detected by screening. However, neuroblastoma presenting with intracranial metastasis is generally considered to need a postoperative chemotherapy. Here, we report a 3-month-old girl with stage 4 neuroblastoma presenting with spontaneous regression of metastatic tumor including meningeal metastasis after gross resection of primary tumor. Further investigation may be required to detect patients of this kind without the need of postoperative chemotherapy regardless of their stage at diagnosis.
