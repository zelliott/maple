Hypothermia is an established therapy in term neonates to reduce death and disability after perinatal asphyxia. Near-infrared spectroscopy-monitored regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) and amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG)-monitored background pattern have been shown to be early predictors of long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of rScO2 and aEEG for neurodevelopmental outcome in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) treated with hypothermia.

In neonates with HIE who were subjected to hypothermia, the aEEG background pattern and rScO2 were studied prospectively from admission up to 84 h in relation to early magnetic resonance imaging and neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 mo of age.

Of 39 infants, 12 neonates died because of neurological deterioration. One had an adverse outcome and 26 had a favorable outcome. The rScO2 was higher in neonates with adverse outcome, although aEEG scores were lower. Positive predictive values at 12, 24, and 36 h of age for adverse outcome ranged from 50 to 67% for rScO2 and aEEG; negative predictive values ranged from 73 to 96% for rScO2 and 90 to 100% for aEEG. Combining rScO2 and aEEG increased positive predictive values (70-91%) and negative predictive values (90-100%).

During hypothermia, rScO2 and aEEG measurements are early predictors of long-term outcome after HIE. Combining both parameters further improves early prediction.
