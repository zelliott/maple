The amount of spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could be of importance for the understanding of CSF dynamics, CSF biomarker analyses as well as for the amount and effect of anaesthesia using intrathecally administered drugs. However, knowledge of spinal CSF volumes is scarce. The main purpose of this article is to present data on spinal CSF volumes. In total, 22 healthy individuals aged between 64 and 76 years underwent MR imaging with a 3D balanced turbo field echo pulse sequence, which provided high contrast between spinal cord, CSF and the extradural surroundings. The entire spinal CSF volume, the cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral CSF volumes and the spinal cord volume were calculated. The total spinal CSF volume was 81 ± 13 ml (range 52-103 ml). The amount of CSF in the cervical region was 19 ± 4 ml, in the thoracic region 38 ± 8 and in the lumbosacral region 25 ± 7 ml. There was no difference between genders nor was there any correlation with height. The volume of the spinal cord was 20 ± 3 ml. The results present new magnetic resonance imaging-based data on the spinal CSF volume in healthy elderly individuals.
