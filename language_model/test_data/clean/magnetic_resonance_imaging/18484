A 66-year-old man developed progressive visual field loss in the inferior arcuate region of the right eye with normal central visual acuity. Intraocular pressures were normal on all but one occasion. The right optic disk showed extensive glaucomalike cupping; the left optic disk was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a tumor of the right medial sphenoid wing impinging upon the intracranial portion of the right optic nerve. It was resected via a frontotemporal craniotomy. Histopathologic examination revealed a meningothelial meningioma. The visual field and optic disk cupping remained unchanged postoperatively. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which both glaucomalike cupping and visual field loss occurred as the result of a compressive lesion of the anterior visual pathway.
