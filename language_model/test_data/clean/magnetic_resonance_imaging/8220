Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is increasingly being used for animal studies studying the transmission of nociceptive information. Application of noxious mechanical stimuli is widely used for animal and human assessment of pain processing. Any accessory hardware used in animal imaging studies must, however, be sufficiently small to fit in the magnet bore diameter and be non-magnetic. We have developed a system that can apply mechanical stimuli simultaneously with fMRI. This system consists of a standardized instrument to deliver mechanical stimuli (VonFrey monofilament) and a gas-pressured mechanical transducer. These components were integrated with a computer console that controlled the period of stimuli to match acquisition scans. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that the force-stimulus transducer did not influence MRI signal to noise ratio. Mechanical stimulation of the hindpaw significantly increased blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal intensity in several midbrain regions involved in the processing of nociceptive information in the rat (p<0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons). This system can be applied to both animal and human imaging studies and has a wide range of applications for studies of nociceptive processing.
