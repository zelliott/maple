We combined a sternomastoid musculocutaneous (SMC) flap and an external jugular veno-accompanying-artery adipofascial (EJ VAF) flap, for head and neck defect reconstruction. The SMC flap provides a rich arterial flow and the EJ VAF flap good venous drainage, making a reliable flap easy-to-raise combination. The flap took well in two patients requiring head and neck reconstruction.
