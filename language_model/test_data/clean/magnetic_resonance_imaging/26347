Pathophysiologic parameters of the functional neovasculature and the blood-brain barrier of 9L-glioma in rat brain were measured noninvasively by dynamic 1H magnetic resonance imaging studies of gadolinium (Gd)-DTPA uptake. Changes of apparent [Gd-DTPA] uptake in time (CT[t]) were analyzed in a slice through the center of 10 9L-gliomas using fast T1 measurements. The distribution of the contrast agent was spatially correlated with the distribution of perfused microvessels as determined by immunohistochemical analysis. This method permits a distinction between perfused and nonperfused microvessels with a disrupted blood-brain barrier. In transverse slices of the whole tumor, a spatial correlation was observed between CT maps and the two-dimensional distribution of perfused microvessels. In the next step, Gd-DTPA uptake rates were spatially related to the perfused microvessel density (Np) or vascular surface area (Sp). In tumor voxels with perfused microvessels, a linear correlation was found between Gd-DTPA uptake rate constants (k values) and Np or Sp. No correlation was observed between k values and the total microvessel density. These are the first data that show a relation between Gd-DTPA uptake rates and parameters of the functional neovasculature in 9L-glioma growing in rat brain. Now that Gd-DTPA uptake studies can be related to parameters of the functional neovasculature, they may be used more efficiently as a prognostic tool before or during therapy.
