A total of 63 cardiac lipomas have been reported to date. Although most of these rare tumors cause no symptoms, a few can have a detrimental effect on myocardial function as well as displacing and encasing the coronary arteries. This case of a cardiac lipoma was initially seen in 1982. The lipoma was found to be nonresectable at surgery due to involvement of the coronary arteries. This neoplasm was characterized with magnetic resonance imaging in 1989 on a follow-up visit. Magnetic resonance imaging is shown to be superior to computed tomography for identifying the relationship of the lipoma to the coronary arteries. This is a significant factor in determining resectability.
