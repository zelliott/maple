Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can track labeled cells in the brain. The use of hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelopes (HVJ-Es) to effectively introduce the contrast agent to neural progenitor cells (NPCs) is limited to date despite their high NPC affinity.

HVJ-Es and Lipofectamine 2000 were compared as transfection vehicles of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO). Labeled NPCs were examined for iron content, MRI signal change, and fundamental cell characteristics. Prussian Blue staining was used after differentiation to determine SPIO localization.

HVJ-Es transfected up to 12.5 +/- 8.8 times more SPIO into NPCs. HVJ-Es do not affect cell viability or differentiation capability. Superparamagnetic iron oxide was disseminated in both the soma and neurites.

These findings indicate that HVJ-Es are an effective vehicle for SPIO transfection of NPCs. The intracellular localization after differentiation raises the question as to the capability of MRI to distinguish cell migration from axonal or dendritic growth in vivo.
