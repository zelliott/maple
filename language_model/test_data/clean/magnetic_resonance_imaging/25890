This paper reports three cases of 'occult' submucous posterior laryngeal cleft in which MR examination has visualized the deficiency of the posterior cricoid lamina. Laryngeal cleft is an uncommon anomaly, and its clinical and endoscopic diagnosis is always difficult. To our knowledge, the role of MR in this diagnosis has not yet been emphasized.
