We report about the diagnosis of recurrent soft tissue tumors in more than 350 patients using magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) and computed tomography (CT) during the last 5-6 years. MRT turned out to be the method of choice having a sensitivity of about 85% and a specificity of 60-70%, provided that a high resolution technique is used and a paramagnetic contrast agent (gadolinium-DTPA (Gd)) is applied. By performing "dynamic Gd-sequences" a quantification and of the perfusion of a recurrent tumor is possible. Even MRT does not produce a definite tumor-specificity. The alterations of imaging concerning surgical treatment or therapeutic irradiation are extensively discussed. Practical suggestions for the daily routine diagnostic in case of uncertain clinic or symptoms are given.
