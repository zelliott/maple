An arachnoid cyst of the quadrigeminal plate in a 49-year-old female is reported. This is the seventh published case of a cyst of this kind in an adult. The presenting symptom was an isolated left fourth cranial nerve palsy. Up to now, no other case with isolated superior oblique muscle palsy has been described which was caused by an arachnoidal cyst of the quadrigeminal plate.
