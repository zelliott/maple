The aim of this study was to compare peripheral nodular enhancement with centripetal progression on contrast-enhanced coded harmonic angio (CHA) with those as seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. A total of 20 patients with 24 hemangiomas confirmed by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI were included in this study. All 20 patients were examined with CHA in conjunction with a galactose-based microbubble contrast agent (SH U 508A) and with interval delay scanning. The pattern and the time of contrast enhancement were recorded on CHA images. We compared CHA images with MRI in terms of the similarity of contrast-enhanced peripheral nodules. The significance of size of tumor and baseline echogenicity on the ability to see peripheral nodular enhancement was independently assessed. Peripheral nodular enhancement was shown on CHA in 22 (92%) of 24 hemangiomas. Of 22 hemangiomas, 21 (95%) with peripheral nodular enhancement had progressive centripetal fill-in on CHA images. In 4 (80%) of 5 hemangiomas less than 1.5 cm in diameter, contrast-enhanced peripheral nodules were depicted on CHA images. In terms of the similarity of peripheral nodules, CHA images showed the similarity more than "similar" grade with MRI in 21 (95%) of 22 hemangiomas. This study shows that CHA is approximately equal to MRI in its ability to show peripheral nodular enhancement with centripetal progression, even in small hemangiomas.
