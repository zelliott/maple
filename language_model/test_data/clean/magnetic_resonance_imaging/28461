Intervertebral disc herniation is an important health problem from both the social and economic aspect. It is often accompanied by a decrease in the content of water and proteoglycan (PG). The present study was undertaken to elucidate the effect of neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser on degenerated disc tissue. In this study a ventral disc herniation model in guinea pigs was performed to study the effects of ND:YAG laser on degenerated disc with low water and PG content. Effect of ND:YAG laser on degenerated cervical disc tissue is examined from the aspects of biochemistry and radiology. In the acute period water, PG, and collagen content decreased due to the ablative effect of ND:YAG laser on disc tissue. When changes in the degenerated disc in the post-laser chronic period were compared with degenerated disc findings, statistically significant changes could not be be found. From the results of this study, there is no question that the Nd:YAG laser offers many potential benefits, it remains to be proven whether or not this is of real benefit in the treatment of patients with degenerated disc disease.
