Accurate target delineation has significant impact on brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) obliteration, treatment success, and potential complications of stereotactic radiosurgery.

We compare the nidal contouring of AVMs using fused images of contrasted computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with matched images of 3-dimensional (3-D) cerebral angiography for CyberKnife radiosurgery (CKRS) treatment planning.

Between May 2009 and April 2012, 3-D cerebral angiography was integrated into CKRS target planning for 30 consecutive patients. The AVM nidal target volumes were delineated using fused CT and MRI scans vs fused CT, MRI, and 3-D cerebral angiography for each patient.

The mean volume of the AVM nidus contoured with the addition of 3-D cerebral angiography to the CT/MRI fusion (9.09 cm(3), 95% confidence interval: 5.39 cm(3)-12.8 cm(3)) was statistically smaller than the mean volume contoured with CT/MRI fused scans alone (14.1 cm(3), 95% confidence interval: 9.16 cm(3)-19.1 cm(3)), with a mean volume difference of δ = 5.01 cm(3) (P = .001). Diffuse AVM nidus was associated with larger mean volume differences compared with a compact nidus (δ = 6.51 vs 2.11 cm(3), P = .02). The mean volume difference was not statistically associated with the patient's sex (male δ = 5.61, female δ = 5.06, P = .84), previous hemorrhage status (yes δ = 5.69, no δ = 5.23, P = .86), or previous embolization status (yes δ = 6.80, no δ = 5.95, P = .11).

For brain AVMs treated with CKRS, the addition of 3-D cerebral angiography to CT/MRI fusions for diagnostic accuracy results in a statistically significant reduction in contoured nidal volume compared with standard CT/MRI fusion-based contouring.
