Ovarian germ cell tumors are malignant tumors which commonly develop during childhood, and which are sensitive to chemotherapy. We have had a case of germ cell tumors which showed resistance to first-line PEP(BEP)chemotherapy. As second-line chemotherapy, VeIP therapy was used, because it is possible that this therapy is effective against recurrent testicular germ cell tumors. The patient was fourteen years old. She experienced acute abdominal pain and visited the hospital, where she was diagnosed with torsion of an ovarian tumor. An emergency laparotomy and right salpingoophorectomy were performed, the pathological diagnosis being stage Ia ovarian dysgerminoma G1. She was followed for two years until her serum hCG-CTP elevated to 1.4 mIU/mL. An MRI revealed an abnormal signal in the left ovary, so we diagnosed this as a recurrence of the dysgerminoma. Then she received chemotherapy PEP(BEP), but after eight months of PEP (BEP), her serum hCG-CTP was again elevated to 14.5 mIU/mL. A recurrence was detected with an MRI and PET-CT, and another laparotomy was performed. The recurrent region was detected in the left ovary. A left ovarian cystectomy was performed in which CDDP ip was used. After the operation, the patient again underwent chemotherapy. VeIP (vinblastine+ifosfamide+cisplatin)was chosen as the second-line regimen. After 6 courses of this therapy, she had a follow-up operation. No recurrence region was found in the pelvic area. She remains without recurrence of this disease 24 months after VeIP therapy. This case suggests that VeIP therapy might be an effective second-line therapy for patients with PEP(BEP)-resistant ovarian dysgerminoma.
