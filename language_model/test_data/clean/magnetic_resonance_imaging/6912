Waldeyer's ring is the most vulnerable site outside lymph nodes in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Its imaging features in NHL of early stage were similar with those of squamous epithelial cancer, which often leads to misdiagnosis. This study was to discuss imaging features of Waldeyer's ring in NHL, and its clinical significance.

CT and MRI performances of 149 patients with pathologically diagnosed Waldeyer's ring-NHL were retrospectively analyzed.

Among 149 cases of Waldeyer's ring-NHL, 98 (65.8%) were B-cell origin, and 51 (34.2%) were T-cell or NK/T-cell origin; tonsil was the most vulnerable site followed by nasopharyngeal tonsil and other positions. CT and MRI showed that 81 were focal nodules or masses (commonly in B-cell NHL), 36 were diffuse infiltrating growth (commonly in NK/T-cell NHL), 7 were pure ulcer, and 25 were mixed type. The lesions of focal masses are characterized with even CT density and MRI signals. The lesions usually localized in pharynx-mucosa clearance, but rarely in deep space, such as parapharyngeal space, and in skull-base. Among 78 cases with involved cervical lymph nodes, 64 were B-cell origin, and 14 were NK/T-cell origin (P< 0.05).

Multiple positions and centers origin, huge masses, diffuse infiltration growth, and less involvement in deep space and skull-base are typical imaging features of Waldeyer's ring-NHL; CT and MRI may be helpful to diagnose, clinical classifying, and treating Waldeyer's ring-NHL.
