Neuroendocrine tumors are slowly growing neoplasms and 75% of patients already present with hepatic metastases at the time of diagnosis. Size and growth of liver metastases is of prognostic value. Due to arterial vascularization of metastases, transarterial embolization (TAE) is a suitable procedure, which can also be combined with chemotherapeutic agents. Indications for embolization or chemoembolization (TACE) are growth of liver metastases or inadequate symptom control. The majority of patients show clinical improvement and partial remission can be achieved in 50% of cases with 5-year survival rates of 50-60%. Response rates, survival or complications are not dependent on the embolization technique (TAE or TACE). Embolization is usually performed in several sessions depending on individual tumor stage and disease progression. Embolization is a cost-effective procedure and is included in the treatment algorithm of international guidelines. Therefore, evaluation of new embolization therapies must be evaluated in randomized controlled studies.
