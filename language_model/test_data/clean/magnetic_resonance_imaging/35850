A case of cervical pregnancy was treated successfully with methotrexate. We used serial beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels, magnetic resonance imaging, and sonography to diagnose the pregnancy and monitor therapy. Hysterectomy was avoided, and the patient's reproductive capability was preserved. Toxicity was limited to transient elevation of liver transaminases.
