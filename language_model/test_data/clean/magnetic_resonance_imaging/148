Periurethral masses in females are rarely observed, although they can occur anywhere along the genitourinary tract. They may be detected on physical examination or present with symptoms such as vaginal swelling, bladder outlet obstruction, vaginal bleeding, hematuria, or urinary tract infection. We report a sexually inactive, 27-year-old woman with an exophytic, fimbria-like periurethral mass. The benign nature of the lesion was suspected on the basis of the findings of magnetic resonance imaging. Surgical enucleation was performed. The microscopic examination revealed a urethral leiomyoma. Immunohistochemical study confirmed a leiomyoma with positive staining for smooth muscle actin and negative staining for S-100.
