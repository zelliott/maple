Cancer screening is currently offered for the organs breast, prostate, cervix and colorectum. With progressing technique in computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) the colorectum can be increasingly better assessed. Because in CT and MRI also other organs are imaged with the colorectum, a colorectal screening automatically becomes a multiorgan screening. CT and MRI protocols designed for early detection of colorectal tumors are presented and discussed with regard to monoorganscreening (in CT: low dose, no i.v. contrast) and multiorganscreening (in CT: diagnostic dose for neighboured organs with i.v. contrast).
