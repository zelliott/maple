Single brain metastases from cervical carcinomas are rare. We report two cases of solitary brain metastases, showing different histological types, which have been excised with microsurgical technique. Neuroendocrine differentiation does not seem to be connected to clinical behavior, indeed a poor prognosis depends on poorly differentiated histological types. In our cases, brain metastases were a late event and they have been successfully excised in microsurgery, thanks to their solitary and resectable nature, and a well-controlled primary disease.
