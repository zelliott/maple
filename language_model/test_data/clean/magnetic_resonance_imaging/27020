A girl with cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome due to a BRAF gene mutation (c.1454Tâ†’C, p.L485S) experienced repetitive epileptic spasms at the corrected age of 4 months. Electroencephalograms revealed hypsarrhythmia, and magnetic resonance imaging identified delayed myelination and a hypoplastic corpus callosum. Various antiepileptic treatments, including adrenocorticotropic hormone therapy, were ineffective, although transient seizure control was achieved by a ketogenic diet and clorazepate dipotassium. However, seizures with epileptic foci at the bilateral posterior temporal areas re-aggravated and remained intractable; severe psychomotor delay persisted. This case indicated that infantile spasms in CFC syndrome can be difficult to control and may be accompanied by severe psychomotor retardation and abnormal myelination.
