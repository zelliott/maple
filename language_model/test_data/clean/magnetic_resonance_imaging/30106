Baker's cysts are commonly encountered in pain management practices.

To ascertain if sclerotherapy treatment of a Baker's cyst could produce objectively verifiable MRI imaging changes.

Case report.

A 52-year-old white male with a posterior horn of the medial meniscus tear and a large Baker's cyst who had failed conservative care and drainage was imaged before treatment with sclerosing. Three injections of 12.5% dextrose and anesthetic with sodium morrhuate were injected intraarticular into the right knee after drainage.

The Baker's cyst resolved on both postoperative imaging after the completion of care as well as on physical examination.

Prolotherapy in this case study seemed to be an effective treatment for Baker's cyst in this patient.
