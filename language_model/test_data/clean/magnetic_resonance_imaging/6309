We have developed a novel in vivo proton MR spectroscopy magnetization transfer method for detection of lactate in ischemic tissue in the presence of interfering fat proton resonances. Pyruvate is magnetically labeled with a saturation pulse and, when converted to lactate, the lactate retains the label. Difference of spectra obtained with and without a saturation pulse contain no fat resonances. High-resolution spectra (determined with a GE 1.5 T Signa) of low lactate levels were obtained in vivo by water suppression using a 2662 composite RF pulse and slice-selective gradients. Spectral subtraction was performed in real time allowing the monitoring of a buildup of the intensity of the lactate peak. Pyruvate-lactate saturation transfer techniques should find wide applicability in the study of ischemia.
