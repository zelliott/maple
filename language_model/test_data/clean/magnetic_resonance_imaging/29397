Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is widely regarded as capable of providing a cornucopia of detailed diagnostic information. However, of that information, very little is truly unique, and can be obtained by a combination of alternate diagnostic modalities. Given this, it is anticipated that in the short term (1-5 years) CMR will find use primarily as a modality to service patients whose diagnosis is inaccessible to established technologies such as ultrasound and radionuclide imaging. Due to the evolving emphasis on finding new and more efficient approaches to disease detection and prevention, as outlined in a policy-setting speech given by the director of the National Institutes of Health, it is anticipated that the scientific and clinical trial communities will adopt CMR at a more rapid pace due to its inherent dimensional accuracy and comprehensive nature. CMR is particularly well suited to participate in the approaching explosion of nanoparticle technologies, as they are applied to diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In the longer term (5-10 years), as paradigms of disease detection likely expand beyond evaluation of symptoms and risk factors, the comprehensive nature of information provided by CMR will drive the increase of its use as a primary, first-tier, diagnostic modality. In summary, the use of CMR will become increasingly common, and as understanding of disease processes expand, it will emerge as a diagnostic modality that provides an abundance of unique information.
