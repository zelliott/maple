The surface properties of objects, such as gloss, transparency and texture, provide important information about the material characteristics of objects in our visual environment. However, because there have been few reports on the neuronal responses to surface properties in primates, we still lack information about where and how surface properties are processed in the primate visual cortex. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the cortical responses to specular surfaces in the macaque visual cortex. Using computer graphics, we generated images of specular and matte objects and prepared scrambled images by locally randomizing the luminance phases of the images with specular and matte objects. In experiment 1, we contrasted the responses to specular images with those to matte and scrambled images. Activation was observed along the ventral visual pathway, including V1, V2, V3, V4 and the posterior inferior temporal (IT) cortex. In experiment 2, we manipulated the contrasts of images and found that the activation observed in these regions could not be explained solely by the global or local contrasts. These results suggest that image features related to specular surface are processed along the ventral visual pathway from V1 to specific regions in the IT cortex. This is consistent with previous human fMRI experiments that showed surface properties are processed in the ventral visual pathway.
