Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be a useful tool in the evaluation of the complex deformities which are present in congenital talipes equinovarus (clubfoot).

To evaluate MRI with the multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) technique as a new method for assessment of clubfoot.

Seven infants with 11 clubfeet were studied by using three-dimensional gradient-echo MR sequences. MPR was performed from the acquired image data in orthogonal, single and double oblique planes to demonstrate the complex deformities in clubfoot. Three angles (talar body-neck angle, talocalcaneal left-right angle and the talocalcaneal superior-inferior angle) were defined for measuring the medial angulation of the talar neck and the rotation of the calcaneus in relation to the talus.

The method clearly demonstrated the pathological anatomy of the clubfeet, especially the talonavicular articulations. Dislocation of the navicular bone was observed in 9 of the 11 feet. The angle measurements were easily conducted with MPR, and these angles differed considerably among the patients.

The information provided by this method is useful for classification of the severity of clubfoot deformities.
