Fallen television sets can cause significant injuries in toddlers. We report the case of a child with a focal brainstem injury who presented with subtle physical examination findings, which eventually led to aspiration and airway compromise. This case illustrates the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion and performing a careful physical examination in traumatized, preverbal children who sustain an apparently minor head injury. The limitation of computed tomography studies in detecting brainstem injury is also discussed.
