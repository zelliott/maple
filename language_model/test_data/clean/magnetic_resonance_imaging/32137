Magnetic resonance signal intensity of focal liver lesions is the result of their histological and cytological features. Therefore, analysis of lesion signal intensity and enhancement patterns obtained with magnetic resonance imaging is essential for the differential diagnosis of focal liver lesions. In this article, we review the magnetic resonance imaging features of the most common focal liver lesions.
