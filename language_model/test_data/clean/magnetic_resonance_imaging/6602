The authors report the long-term course of two siblings with L-dopa responsive dystonia (DRD) associated with a compound heterozygous mutation in the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene. Both siblings manifested with lower-limb onset generalized DRD and had a sustained response to low-dose L-dopa therapy for over 35 years. Although the l-dopa therapy was delayed up to 20 years after disease onset, there were no cognitive or neurologic sequelae of the long-term catecholamine deficit.
