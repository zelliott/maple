Tularemia is a zoonotic disease of the northern hemisphere. Oculoglandular tularemia is the rarest form, comprising 1.4-4.2% of all cases. We present a patient with oculoglandular tularemia that did not respond to gentamicin to demonstrate the need for prolonged antimicrobial treatment and surgical intervention.
