With the use of magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) the options and limitations of this modern technique in reproducing teeth and endodontium should be evaluated. Therefore, extracted teeth were stored in formaline and measured in two different devices of the magnetic resonance technique. One is common for material research and normally used for spectroscopy of solids. Measuring takes place in the strayfield of the magnet which leads to the term "Stray Field Imaging" (STRAFI). The other one is a spectroscopy with an additional micro-imaging device (magnetic resonance microscope) where resolutions up to (100 microns)3 can be reached. For the first time the STRAFI allowed to make pictures from the hydrogen-protons of the teeth's hard substances. A two or three dimensional imaging on the basis of microscopic resolution became reality. In addition the MRM allowed to depict the soft tissue portion and the outer contour of the teeth in 2D and 3D. The two-dimensional pictures were able to show a texture within the pulp tissue. The three-dimensional images enabled a naturalistic and non-destructive visualization of the outer surface and the pulp room. The results shown here open very new perspectives for endodontics.
