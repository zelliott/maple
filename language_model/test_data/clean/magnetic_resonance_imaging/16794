As the need for accurate diagnostic imaging often continues throughout a cancer survivor's life, imaging methods with the least toxicity must be used so as to provide needed information without contributing to long-term sequelae that might compound toxicities inherent with the primary disease and its treatment. In this regard, the costs, benefits and potential risks of post-therapy monitoring for disease recurrence warrant periodic review. Unfortunately, few analyses are available regarding the impact of surveillance imaging on the detection of disease recurrence, salvage rates of relapse disease and long-term survival outcomes for pediatric cancer survivors. This review will examine the role and limitations of surveillance imaging in pediatric oncology.
