To evaluate the nature, frequency, and predictors of adverse events during the use of propofol by pediatric hospitalists.

We reviewed 1649 charts of patients sedated with propofol by pediatric hospitalists at St Louis Children's Hospital between January 2005 and September 2009.

Hospitalists were able to complete 1633 of the 1649 sedations reviewed (99%). Major complications included 2 patients with aspiration and 1 patient intubated to complete the study. We observed a 74% reduction in the number of patients with respiratory events and airway interventions from 2005 to 2009. Predictors of respiratory events were history of snoring (OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.52-3.80), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification of ASA 3 (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.22-4.33), age >12 years (OR, 4.01; 95% CI, 2.02-7.98), premedication with midazolam (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.15-2.98), and use of adjuvant glycopyrrolate (OR, 4.70; 95% CI, 2.35-9.40). All except ASA 3 status were also predictors for airway intervention. There was a decline in the prevalence of all of these predictors over the study years (P < .05) except for use of glycopyrrolate.

Our pediatric hospitalists implemented a successful propofol sedation program that realized a 74% reduction in respiratory events and airway interventions between 2005 and 2009. Decreased prevalence of the predictors of adverse events that we identified likely contributed to this reduction.
