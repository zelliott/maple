We herein describe a rare case of meningeal carcinomatosis in a 77-year-old woman who had bilateral deafness as the initial symptom of a previously undetected colon cancer malignancy. Meningeal carcinomatosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis in cases of abrupt-onset sensorineural deafness. Both MRI scans and cerebrospinal fluid evaluation are necessary diagnostic tools, and should be used in conjunction as each of these procedures could have false-negative results. This should apply even when there is no known primary malignancy.
