The authors report a series of five cases of non tuberculous cervical spinal epidural abscesses. There were neither patients suffering from immunodeficiency syndromes nor drug addicts; all the patients were in their seventh decade; two patients were affected by diabetes mellitus refractory to medical treatment. Retropharyngeal abscess was the main etiological risk factor (two cases); Staphylococcus aureus was cultured in two cases. Gadolinium MRI was necessary for a preoperative diagnosis, planning surgical approach and postoperative prognosis. Surgical debridement was performed via an anterior approach in those cases where the collection was located lower than C4 and did not span more than three vertebral segments; posterior approach, via a laminectomy, was performed in a case of C1-C2 location of the lesion and in a case of involvement of the whole cervical spine. Surgical results were poor in those patients affected by diabetes mellitus, a lesion involving the high cervical segments (higher than C4) or a lesion spanning more than three levels. Medical treatment with MRI follow-up was not undertaken in any of the patients and we opted for surgical drainage in all the cases due to the possibility of a sudden neurological deterioration, caused both by spinal cord mechanical compression and vascular compromission.
