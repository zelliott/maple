The diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma is sometimes difficult since its clinical presentation is quite variable. We report a 52-year-old woman who presented with acute diabetes mellitus and severe hypertension, which spontaneously disappeared. MIBG-scintigraphy and urine and plasma catecholamines were normal. At surgery, a largely necrotic phaeochromocytoma was found. Pathological examination demonstrated extensive avascular necrosis, which had occurred spontaneously without any major symptoms.
