Successful management of large AVMs is difficult. Traditionally they are considered less responsive and even unsuitable for radiosurgery. This case report demonstrates total angiographic obliteration in a complex, large corpus callosum AVM (volume 36.52 cc) in a 39-year-old male. Stereotactic radiation was delivered with a Linear Accelerator using ultra conformal treatment planning. Large volume AVMs can be subjected to stereotactic radiosurgery if the shape and location makes it possible to deliver an adequate radiation dose.
