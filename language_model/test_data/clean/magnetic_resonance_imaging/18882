The authors report the use of neuroendoscopy for the treatment of cisternal neurocysticercosis. The utilization of the endoscope is meant to provide a safe and minimally invasive procedure for the removal of symptomatic cysts, minimizing morbidity and mortality relating to the natural history of the disease, as well as possibly avoiding a more extensive standard open craniotomy. A retrospective review of three cases of cisternal cysticercosis was performed. The presenting signs and symptoms, neuroimaging findings, endoscopic treatment, and outcomes are presented. The technical aspect of the endoscopic resection is described, with visual support provided by intraoperative video. Cerebrospinal fluid shunt placement was avoided in one patient in whom complete resection of the cyst was required. In one patient there were extensive interhemispheric and premesencephalic cisternal cysts, some of which could not be removed because of their multiplicity and extensive adhesions. Despite the intraoperative rupture of cysts, there were no cases of arachnoiditis or ventriculitis postoperatively. The minimally invasive endoscopic resection of cisternal cysticercosis is possible and effective in selected patients. Although the most appropriate treatment of cisternal cysticercosis remains a controversial issue, endoscopic resection should be considered as a primary treatment in symptomatic patients in cases that are amenable to endoscopic intervention.
