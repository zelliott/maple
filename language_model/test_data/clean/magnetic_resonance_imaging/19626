Chondromyxoid fibroma is a rare benign tumor that is typically found in the metaphyseal ends of long tubular bones, such as the tibia. The authors describe a case of this neoplasm occurring in the foot. Treatment included complete resection with reconstruction using an autogenous fibular bone graft. The surgical technique and the advantages of using a fibular bone graft are discussed.
