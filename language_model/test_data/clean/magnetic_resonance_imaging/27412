In patients with patellar dislocation, osteochondral injury is often an indication for early surgical intervention. However, no studies have identified a relationship between injury to the weight-bearing surface of the lateral femoral condyle following a patellar dislocation and the eventual need for surgical treatment. The authors hypothesized that a significant number of patients sustain injury to the weight-bearing surface of the lateral femoral condyle following an acute patellar dislocation.Radiographs and magnetic resonance images were retrospectively reviewed and the patterns of injury were evaluated for 80 patients with a diagnosis of acute patellar dislocation, including the presence of osteochondral damage, the location of the medial patellofemoral ligament injury, and concomitant meniscal pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging identified a 27.5% incidence of osteochondral injury involving the articular, weight-bearing region of the lateral femoral condyle following an acute lateral patellar dislocation. Surgical intervention was performed in more than 60% of these injuries, and most were not identified with plain radiographs. Injury to the weight-bearing surface of the lateral femoral condyle following patellar dislocation was 3.6 times more common in boys in the current study population.Osteochondral injury to the weight-bearing surface of the lateral femoral condyle may occur in a high percentage of patients following a lateral patellar dislocation and in a higher percentage of boys than girls. Patients with tenderness over the lateral femoral condyle following an acute lateral patellar dislocation should undergo magnetic resonance imaging.
