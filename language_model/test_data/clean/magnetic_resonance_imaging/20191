Solitary fibrous tumor (formerly known as hemangiopericytoma) is a rare soft tissue neoplasm, most frequently arising from the retroperitoneum and lower extremities. We present two cases of retroperitoneal solitary fibrous tumors diagnosed after surgical removal. We provide a literature review showing the basic clinical, pathologic and therapeutic features of these tumors.
