We report on a 32-year-old patient with a 9 month history of pain of the mid-third of his sternum. The laboratory results as well as other diagnostical methods (MRI and bone scintigraphy) were negative. The ultrasound examination revealed an interruption of the corticalis reflex beneath the sternal synchondrosis of a length of 4 cm. Under suspicion of an osteolysis we performed an open biopsy. The histological analysis made the diagnosis of a solitary myeloma. Therefore ultrasonography is able to depict tumerous infiltrations of the sternum if the anterior corticalis is involved and allows therapeutical consequences.
