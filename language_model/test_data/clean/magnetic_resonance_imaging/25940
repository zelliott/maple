This report presents a case of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the region of the superior vermis and quadrigeminal plate, which was partially embolized using a endovascular technique and subsequently surgically excised. An occipital transtentorial approach was employed to excise the AVM, and the patient did well without neurological complications postoperatively. Comparing various surgical approaches, we believe the occipital transtentorial approach is the best for the AVM of this region.
