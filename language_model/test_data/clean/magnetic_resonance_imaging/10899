Case report and review of literature.

Intracranial chronic subdural hematoma (SDH) is a well-recognized complication of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. Spinal chronic SDH is very rarely associated with VP shunt.

Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

We describe a spinal chronic SDH, developing after a minor trauma, in a patient who underwent a VP shunt surgery for hydrocephalus 6 months previously. A good outcome was achieved after decompressive surgery.

Spinal chronic SDH should be considered in the diagnosis of progressive spinal compression, especially in the patients with VP shunt after minor trauma.
