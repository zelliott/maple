We report a case of a female patient with portal hypertension due to liver cirrhosis. In this case, MR imaging revealed small siderotic nodules of the spleen, called Gamna-Gandy bodies. These lesions are found in patients with portal vein or splenic vein thrombosis, hemolytic anemia, leukemia, or lymphoma, patients receiving blood transfusions, acquired hemochromatosis, or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. There are only few reports in the literature about these siderotic nodules which are not very familiar. MR imaging seems to be the superior imaging method for detection of these lesions. It is important to consider Gamna-Gandy bodies in the differential diagnosis of portal hypertension and the other diseases mentioned above.
