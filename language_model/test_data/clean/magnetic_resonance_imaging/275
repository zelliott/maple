The incidence of vertebral hemangiomas as the most common benign spinal neoplasms has been differently reported from 10 to 27% based on autopsy series, plain X-rays and MRI reviews. In this study, we reviewed consecutive 782 standard spinal MRI with axial and sagital T1 weighted and T2 weighted images looking for hemangiomas. In this study, the incidence of hemangioma was 26.9%, more common in females (30%) than males (23%), in older age group and in lumbar spine. Most hemangiomas (65%) were less than 10 mm in diameter. Multiple hemangiomas were seen in 33% of cases. The results of this study are similar to another Mediterranean study reported based on MRI findings, but differ from other reports using X-ray or autopsy as diagnostic tool, suggesting the influence of either the race or the sensitivity of the diagnostic tool on the incidence of vertebral hemangioma.
