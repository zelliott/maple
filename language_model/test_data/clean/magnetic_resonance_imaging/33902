To evaluate temporomandibular joint (TMJ) articular disc position and osseous degenerative changes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as clinical symptoms of temporomandibular disorders in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

A sample of 43 patients with AS (38 males, age 45.9+/-10.7 years) and 16 controls (all male, age 41.3+/-6.3 years) were studied. All subjects completed a self-administered questionnaire and underwent clinical examination and MRI survey. Recorded variables included disease characteristics, subjective neck and TMJ disorder symptoms, and axial mobility measurements. MRI variables included TMJ disc position and severity of osseous degenerative change.

TMJ disorder symptoms of headache duration and frequency, TMJ pain duration and frequency, and painful jaw movement were more frequent in patients with AS (p < 0.05). Significant differences were also observed in MRI indices for disc displacement (AS, 0.89; controls, 0.36; p = 0.005) and degenerative changes (AS, 0.55; controls, 0.06; p = 0.01). A total of 50 (62%) joints in the AS group had disc displacement compared to 11 (34%) joints in the controls. A total of 16 (20%) joints in the AS group had degenerative change compared to 2 (6%) joints in the controls.

TMJ internal derangement, degenerative changes, and subjective pain complaints are frequent in patients with AS. Physicians should be aware of potential TMJ involvement in these patients, which may require specific assessment and therapy.
