This paper reviews the techniques that we employ to perform musculoskeletal magnetic resonance imaging in the pediatric patient. We examine the procedures for preparation and screening of the patient and the protocols for sedation. The selection of imaging coils and sequences for the evaluation of the pediatric musculoskeletal system is also addressed, followed by a summary of scanning protocols.
