Most of the peripheral neuropathies in Sjögren's syndrome (SS) are sensory- or autonomic-dominant. In this report, we present two cases of a rare type of neuropathy, motor dominant neuropathy, in SS. One showed signs similar to those of Guillain-Barré syndrome, and the other showed signs characteristic of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. These patients received i.v. immunoglobulin therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that i.v. immunoglobulin has beneficial effects on motor dominant neuropathy in SS.
