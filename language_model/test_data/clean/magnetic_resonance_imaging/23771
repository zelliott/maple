Vertex epidural hematomas may be underestimated or overlooked altogether when computed tomographic scans alone are used for diagnosis. Such hematomas can be resolved with active intervention and sometimes with conservative treatment.

Two cases of successfully treated vertex epidural hematomas, in a 33-year-old man who presented with seizures and an 11-year-old girl who presented with headache and vomiting, are described. Both hematomas were traumatic in origin and were associated with cranial fractures. In each, coronal images (computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging scans) showed the extent of the hematoma much more clearly than did axial images.

One case was treated surgically and the other conservatively.

Magnetic resonance imaging is not usually indicated for trauma patients, but it is an appropriate diagnostic modality for these rare lesions, to supplement standard axial computed tomographic scans. Because vertex epidural hematomas may resolve spontaneously with time, conservative treatment should be considered on a case-by-case basis.
