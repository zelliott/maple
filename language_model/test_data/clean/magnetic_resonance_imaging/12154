A 70-year-old woman suffered paresis of the left hand with dysaesthesia of the head lasting about 12 hours. The Doppler-flow study and duplex scan of the carotid arteries performed 14 days later showed an occluded right internal carotid artery. She refused angiography. However, 7 days later she was willing to undergo further investigation. This time the Doppler flow study and duplex scan demonstrated regular flow without stenosis, which suggested spontaneous recanalization of the formerly occluded right internal carotid artery.
