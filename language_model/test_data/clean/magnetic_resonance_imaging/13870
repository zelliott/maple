A case of unusual clinical manifestation of pheochromocytoma in a type 2A multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN2A) patient is presented. A 27-year-old man affected by MEN2A syndrome, complaining of anxiety and depression, was admitted in our Division. Past medical history included a total thyroidectomy for medullary carcinoma in 1985, and left adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma in 1994. Blood pressure was 130/ 85 mmHg without orthostatic hypotension and pulse rate was 72 beats/min. Laboratory data revealed thyroid hormones and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the normal range and high basal serum calcitonin levels (158 pg/ml). Plasma catecholamines and vanillylmandelic acid resulted in normal levels but epinephrine/norepinephrine ratio was elevated (0.65). The glucagon stimulation test showed positive clinical and biochemical response. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintiscan confirmed the presence of bilateral adrenal masses. Bilateral adrenalectomy by laparoscopic anterior approach was performed. Histology was consistent with adrenal pheochromocytomas. After surgical approach, psychiatric findings disappeared and did not recur at follow-up in spite of no medication for two years. In conclusion, bilateral pheochromocytoma is more frequent in MEN2A syndrome and probably understimated if the follow-up is not prolonged. In these cases clinical features are often aspecific and basal hormonal data may be normal in a great number of patients. Therefore long-term observation is justified in these patients. Pheochromocytoma was described as the "great mimic" for the numerous subjective manifestations. Differential diagnosis among typical features of neuropsychiatric disorders and pheochromocytoma must be considered.
