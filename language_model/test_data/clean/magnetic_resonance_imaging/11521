The case of a patient with Ludwig's angina, diffuse inflammation of the submandibular and sublingual spaces, a rare but life threatening disease, is described. This disorder can develop almost always as a complication of the dental infection. Causative bacteria include many Gram-negative, anaerobic organisms, streptococci and staphylococci. The potential for rapid respiratory obstruction is the greatest concern. Other serious complications include sepsis, mediastinitis, pleural empidema, pericarditis, pericardial tamponade. A cervico thoracic CT-scan and neck RNM, were performed to determine the extent of the inflammatory lesion. Treatment consists of ensuring adequate ventilation, with tracheostomy, broad spectrum antibiotic therapy and surgical drainage of the source of infection. The patient recovered without complications.
