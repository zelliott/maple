To study the CT and MR features of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC).

49 patients had pathologically confirmed XGC. All patients underwent contrast enhanced CT, and 10 patients had additional plain MRI. The CT and MRI results were retrospectively analyzed.

On CT, all patients had thickening of gallbladder wall, with 87.8% cases showed diffuse thickening. 85.7% cases had intramural hypo-attenuated nodules in the thickened wall. Continuous mucosal line and luminal surface enhancement were noted in 79.6% and 85.7% cases, respectively. Gallbladder stones were seen in 69.4% patients. The coexistence of the above 5 CT features was seen in 40% cases, and 80% cases had the coexistence of â‰¥ 4 features. Diffused gallbladder wall thickening in XGC is more likely to have disrupted mucosal line, and XGC with disrupted mucosal line is more likely to be associated with liver infiltration. In 60% patients the inflammatory process extended beyond gallbladder, with the interface between gallbladder and liver and/or the surrounding fat blurred. 40% cases had an early enhancement of liver parenchyma. Infiltration to other surrounding tissues included bowel (n=3), stomach (n=2), and abdominal wall (n=1). On MR images, 7 of 9 intramural nodules in 7 subjects with T1-weighted dual echo MR images showed higher signal intensity on in-phase images than out-of-phase images.

Coexisting of diffuse gallbladder wall thickening, hypo-attenuated intramural nodules, continuous mucosal line, luminal surface enhancement, and gallbladder stone highly suggest XGC. XGC frequently infiltrate liver and surrounding fat. Chemical-shift MRI helps classifying intramural nodules in the gallbladder wall.
