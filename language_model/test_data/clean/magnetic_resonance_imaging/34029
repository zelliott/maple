Isolated inferior division third nerve palsies are rare. The authors report a patient with an isolated, pupil-involving inferior division third cranial nerve palsy from an intraorbital dural arteriovenous malformation. Despite spontaneous thrombosis of the malformation, the third nerve palsy persisted. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case report of an inferior division third nerve palsy caused by an orbital dural arteriovenous malformation.
