Hypertension is among the most ubiquitous diseases in the world. In the U.S., up to sixty million individuals may be affected by hypertension and be prone to associated renal, cardiac, and CNS damage. This morbidity is mediated by changes in the microcirculation of these organs, resultant of blood pressure elevation.
