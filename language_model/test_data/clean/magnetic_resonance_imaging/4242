Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) uses magnetic resonance (MR) pulse sequences in which static fluid appears bright against a low signal or dark background. When these MR images are subjected to postprocessing techniques, they produce images that resemble the pancreatograms obtained using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The MRCP examination is easily performed, is noninvasive, requires no contrast injection, and has no known complications. The place of MRCP in the evaluation of disorders of the pancreas is not yet fully established, but several well-defined roles have already emerged. These include the evaluation of the pancreatic duct after failed or incomplete ERCP, and the evaluation of complete pancreatic duct obstruction. The technical aspects required for MRCP of the pancreatic duct, and the established and emerging roles for MRCP in the pancreatic duct, are described here.
