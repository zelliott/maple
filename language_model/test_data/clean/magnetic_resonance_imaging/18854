New surgical navigation techniques may combine the use of live video from a surgical endoscope with 3D volumetrically-reconstructed images of a patient's anatomy. This image-enhanced endoscopy requires calibration of the endoscope to ensure that the mapping of the real endoscope image to its virtual counterpart is properly performed. The application of a technique to calibrate an endoscope prior to use in a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure is described, as well as a simple yet effective linear method for lens-distortion compensation. The results of accuracy testing of the calibration technique using a dedicated testing apparatus are reported.
