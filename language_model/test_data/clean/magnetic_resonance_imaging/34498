The incidence of intervertebral disc herniation in the thoracic region of the spine is much less than in the cervical or lumbar areas, and multiple thoracic disc herniations are rare. We described a 33-year-old man with two-level thoracic disc herniation, who exhibited features of spinal cord compression. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic myelography demonstrated anterior compression of the spinal cord due to disc herniation at T4/5 and T7/8 levels. Through an anterolateral approach, these discs were removed and interbody fusion was performed using autogenous bone grafts. Excellent results were obtained.
