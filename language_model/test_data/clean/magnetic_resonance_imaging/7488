Diffuse intrinsic brainstem gliomas (DIBG) account for 1-2 % of adult gliomas. Their biological characteristics are scarcely understood and whether DIBG are biologically different from supratentorial gliomas remains to be established. We analyzed 17 DIBG samples for IDH1 R132H, alpha internexin, p53, and Ki67 expression, and, in a subset with sufficient DNA amount, for IDH1 and histone H3 mutational status, genomic profiling and MGMT promoter methylation status. A series of 738 adult supratentorial gliomas was used for comparison. Median age at diagnosis was 41 years (range 18.9-65.3 years). Median overall survival was 48.7 months (57 months for low-grade vs. 16 months for high-grade gliomas, p < 0.01). IDH1 sequencing revealed two mutations (IDH1 (R132G) , IDH1 (R132C) ) out of 7 DIBG whereas the R132H IDH1 enzyme was detected in 1/17 DIBG, suggesting that IDH1 mutations are mostly non R132H in DIBG (2/2), in contrast to supratentorial gliomas (31/313; p = 0.01). Mutations in histone genes H3F3A (encoding H3.3) and HIST1H3B (encoding H3.1) were found in 3/8 (37.5 %) of the DIBG (two H3F3A (K27M) and one HIST1H3B (K27M) ) versus 6/205 (2.9 %) of the supratentorial high-grade gliomas (four H3F3A (G34R) and two H3F3A (K27M) ) (p = 0.002). The CGH array showed a higher frequency of chromosome arm 1q gain, 9q gain and 11q loss in DIBG compared to the supratentorial high-grade gliomas, which had a less frequent chromosome 7 gain, and a less frequent chromosome 10 loss. No EGFR amplification was found. These data suggest that adult DIBG differ from adult supratentorial gliomas. In particular, histone genes (H3F3A (K27M) , HIST1H3B (K27M) ) mutations are frequent in adult DIBG whereas IDH1 (R132H) mutations are rare.
