To test the feasibility of applying the magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) technique to map the elastic modulus of the plantar fat pads in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects.

A prototype MRE imaging apparatus was used to produce quantitative maps of the heel fat pad in a pilot study of 12 volunteers and 4 patients with diabetes with neuropathy. Anatomic images corresponding to MRE maps allowed precise selection of regions of interest in the fat.

Magnetic resonance elastograms of the heel fat pads were successfully created; mean measurements in the volunteers and the diabetic patients were 4.85 and 5.26 kPa, respectively.

It is feasible to perform MRE on the plantar fat pads and to produce elasticity maps. The trend toward stiffer fat pads, as demonstrated in patients with diabetes, suggests that the fat pads were qualitatively different. Magnetic resonance elastography offers great potential to investigate the mechanical properties of soft tissues in vivo noninvasively.
