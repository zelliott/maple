The purpose of this review is to present an overview of the state-of-the-art imaging modalities used to track drug delivery from liposomal formulations into tumors during or after hyperthermia treatment. Liposomes are a drug delivery system comprised of a phospholipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous core and have been shown to accumulate following hyperthermia therapy. Use of contrast-containing liposomes in conjunction with hyperthermia therapy holds great promise to be able to directly measure drug dose concentrations as well as to non-invasively describe patterns of drug distribution with MR and PET/SPECT imaging modalities. We will review the rationale for using this approach and the potential advantages of having such information available during and after treatment.
