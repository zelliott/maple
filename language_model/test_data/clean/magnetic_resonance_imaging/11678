To explore the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in distinguishing malignant from benign pleural disease.

All 64 patients were examined with both computed tomography (CT) and MRI. The morphologic features of pleural lesions and MR signal intensity on T1-weighted, T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images were evaluated.

Mediastinal pleural involvement, circumferential pleural thickening, nodularity, irregularity of pleural contour, and infiltration of the chest wall and/or diaphragm were most suggestive of a malignant cause on CT and MR images. Contrary to what has been reported in the literature, pleural thickness greater than 1 cm either on CT or on MRI did not reveal a significant difference between malignant and benign pleural disease (P > 0.05, chi-square test). Using morphologic features in combination with signal intensity features, MRI had a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 92% in the detection of pleural malignancy.

Compared with those on CT, the morphologic features on MRI allowed a mostly equal and in some cases superior detection and evaluation of the spread of pleural disease. In combination with signal intensity and morphologic features, MRI is very useful in distinguishing malignant from benign pleural disease.
