Twin gestations are responsible for a disproportionate amount of perinatal mortality and morbidity. Such gestations may impose greater demands on maternal and child physiologic systems than singleton pregnancies. The most common antenatal complications were preterm labor. The clinical record of myelomeningocele infant presenting with overt hydrocephalus in utero at 27 weeks of twin gestation and operated miniature Ommaya's reservoir placement early after birth and intentional delayed back closure for myelomeningocele was reported. Although perinatal neurosurgical care for one fetal hydrocephalus on twin gestation is clearly advantageous, it alone is relatively ineffective in reducing the incidence of the complication, preterm labor.
