Basic theoretical concepts of static magnetic shielding are summarized. Expressions describing the magnetic field produced by a solenoidal coil confined coaxially inside a long thin ferromagnetic cylinder of constant permeability are derived. Conditions for the optimum arrangement of a magnetic screen for whole-body NMR systems are discussed.
