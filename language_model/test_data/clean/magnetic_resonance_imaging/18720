The authors examined three patients with pure primary mediastinal seminomas, all of whom had marked Ga-67 uptake on scintigraphy. The unusual presentation of sclerotic bone metastases with remarkable extraosseous soft tissue involvement was observed in one patient. Another had a seminoma associated with a multiloculated thymic cyst, which is a rare lesion.
