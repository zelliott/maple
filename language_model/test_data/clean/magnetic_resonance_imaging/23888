Multiple sclerosis (MS) is usually diagnosed on the basis of the typical clinical course, with remission and exacerbation in multiple parts of the central nervous system (CNS). Recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has made a large contribution to the diagnosis of patients with MS. But it is difficult to make a definite diagnosis due to clinical variability of the disease and variable MRI findings. We report the case of a 26-year-old woman who developed progressive left hemiplegia, mental dysfunction, and had extensive bilateral cerebral white matter lesions diagnosed by brain MRI. Complete recovery from the left hemiplegia followed the use of corticosteroid, and her brain MRI findings also improved after medication. Early in the clinical course it was difficult to differentiate between multiple sclerosis and granulomatous angiitis of the CNS. After recovery from the first episode of left hemiplegia and mental dysfunction, she developed acute visual disturbance five months after her first admission. Readmission followed and her retrobulbar neuritis was successfully treated by methylpredonisolone pulse therapy. In summary, she experienced two episodes of neurological deficit, had left hemiplegia and mental dysfunction associated with multiple lesions in bilateral cerebral white matter in brain MRI, and the left retrobulbar neuritis with delay of P100 by visual evoked potential study. Due to these two episodes we concluded that she had multiple sclerosis. Though the initial diagnosis was difficult, prompt treatment and close follow-up was important, since multiple sclerosis and granulomatous angiitis of the CNS can both recur.
