MRI and MRA are accepted as valuable methods for diagnosing vertigo, although they are costly and time-consuming. Thus, some indicator of the necessity of a detailed evaluation by MRI and MRA is desirable.

To assess the usefulness of an impairment of the visual suppression (VS) as an indicator, the relation between abnormal findings on MRI and/or MRA and impairment of the VS of manually rotated vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) was retrospectively examined in 40 consecutive patients suffering from vertigo.

12 of 23 patients with a low VS% were found to have a pathologic condition on MRI and/or MRA, however, no abnormality was found in any of the patients with a normal VS%. The rates of abnormality on MRI and/or MRA significantly differed between the 2 groups (chi2, P = 0.0004).

The VS% is thought to be a good indicator of the need for further evaluation by MRI and MRA in vertiginous patients.
