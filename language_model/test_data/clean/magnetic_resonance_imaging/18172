Stem cell transplantation is a promising new therapeutic option in different neurological diseases. However, it is not yet possible to translate its potential from animal models to clinical application. One of the main problems of applying stem cell transplantation in clinical medium is the difficulty of detection, localization, and examination of the stem cells in vivo at both cellular and molecular levels. State-of-the-art molecular imaging techniques provide new and better means for noninvasive, repeated, and quantitative tracking of stem cell implant or transplant. From initial deposition to the survival, migration, and differentiation of the transplant/implanted stem cells, current molecular imaging methods allow monitoring of the infused cells in the same live recipient over time. The present review briefly summarizes and compares these molecular imaging methods for cell labeling and imaging in animal models as well as in clinical application and sheds light on consecutive new therapeutic options if appropriate.
