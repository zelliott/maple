We obtained cranial MRIs of 76 individuals from 13 MS multiplex families. Thirty-one MS patients and 45 normal family members participated in the study. Twenty-eight of the 31 individuals with definite or probable MS had multiple white matter lesions by MRI. Thirty-five normal family members had normal MRIs, and 10 had abnormal studies. Four normal individuals under age 40 had abnormal MRIs. Three had multiple white matter lesions. The 4th had a single small white matter lesion in the left centrum semiovale. Six normal individuals over age 50 had multiple white matter lesions. Although diffuse white matter lesions in individuals over age 50 should be interpreted with caution, these lesions in individuals under age 40 with no history of underlying medical illness are suggestive of demyelination. The results of the present study indicate that subclinical MS may be present in apparently normal members of multiplex families.
