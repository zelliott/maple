Ictal vomiting in patients with focal epilepsy has mostly been associated with an epileptogenic zone in the non-language-dominant hemisphere. Here we present the case of a left hemisphere language-dominant patient suffering from typical mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with histologically proven hippocampal sclerosis and ictal vomiting during complex partial seizures. He became seizure-free after selective left-sided amygdalohippocampectomy. This case implies that ictal vomiting may not necessitate invasive electrophysiological exploration of left hemisphere language-dominant patients with temporal lobe epilepsy if surface EEG and MRI indicate a left-sided epileptogenic zone. It thus corroborates that with concordant imaging and neurophysiological data, clinical signs become less valuable.
