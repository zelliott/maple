During the past year observations have been published that might lead to further improvement in the design of future clinical trials. At the same time, results of clinical trials have become available that suggest that a number of treatments could be of benefit in the care of patients in the various phases of multiple sclerosis. Future multiple sclerosis clinical trials should involve a blinded investigator restricted to assessing the clinical outcome variables, and because current evidence suggests that magnetic resonance imaging gives an objective and sensitive reflection of the biological evolution of the disease, such scanning should also be included. The use of a composite outcome variable in a trial of chronic progressive multiple sclerosis should also be considered in order to increase the percentage of patients reaching the clinical endpoint. In 1994 recommendations were published for the selection of relapsing-remitting patients for treatment with interferon beta-1b; furthermore, large and well performed clinical trials demonstrated that interferon beta-1a and copolymer-1 are also partially effective, though not curative, for these patients. Two smaller studies suggested that low-dose methotrexate and cladribine might have a beneficial effect on the course of the disease in patients with secondary chronic progressive multiple sclerosis, the former drug probably being less toxic. Unfortunately, therapeutic perspectives for patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis are less promising at present. Several studies suggest that 4-aminopyridine and tizanidine have therapeutic potential for symptomatic treatment; the former by improving neurological deficits, the latter by relieving troublesome spasticity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
