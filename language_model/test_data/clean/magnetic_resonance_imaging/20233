To evaluate the feasibility of molecular cartilage MRI in finger joints.

Delayed Gd(DTPA)²-enhanced MRI of the cartilage (dGEMRIC) using a variable flip angle approach (VFA) was performed for the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints II and III in nine healthy volunteers and eighteen patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The cartilage thickness was measured. Additionally, dGEMRIC was performed on proximal interphalangeal joints (PIP) in two patients with finger osteoarthritis (OA).

the dGEMRIC index of the four evaluated cartilage areas was significantly decreased in RA patients compared to healthy subjects. The dGEMRIC index of MCP II phalangeal cartilage was 389.6 ± 85.5 msec vs. 558.7 ± 74.4 msec in healthy subjects. The metacarpal MCP II cartilage dGEMRIC index was 357.3 msec ± 97.1 msec vs. 490.0 ± 86.6 msec. The dGEMRIC indices of MCP III were: phalangeal 436.2 ± 113.6 msec in RA, 558.8 ± 115.5 msec in healthy subjects and metacarpal 398.0 ± 97.6 msec in RA and 529.6 ± 111.0 msec in healthy subjects. Age and cartilage thickness were not significantly different. In PIP joints of finger osteoarthritis patients, low dGEMRIC indices were noted, compared to the controls.

The dGEMRIC of finger joints is feasible in patients with RA and finger OA. Morphologically normal cartilage shows significantly decreased dGEMRIC values in RA, pointing towards cartilage degeneration on a molecular level. Further studies are needed to establish the usefulness of this technique for early diagnosis, prognosis and therapy monitoring.
