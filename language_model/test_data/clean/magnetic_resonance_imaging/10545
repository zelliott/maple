Heart failure secondary to iron overload is the main cause of death in patients with beta-thalassemia major. Combination therapy with deferoxamine and deferiprone has been shown to be more effective than either drug used alone in patients with beta-thalassemia major and symptomatic cardiomyopathy. Although monitoring the response to chelation therapy is usually carried out by indirect measurement of the serum ferritin level or by direct determination of tissue iron content in biopsy specimens, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) seems to be useful for noninvasive qualitative and quantitative assessment of iron deposition. We present a case in which the efficacy of double chelation therapy in a patient with beta-thalassemia major and heart failure was demonstrated by MRI.
