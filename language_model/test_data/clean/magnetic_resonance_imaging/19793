Sarcoidosis is a systemic, chronic inflammatory disease characterized by non-caseating epithelioid granuloma. It is well known that the central nervous system (CNS) is also involved in about 5% of patients with systemic sarcoidosis. Although CNS sarcoidosis presents with various neurological manifestations, intracerebral bleeding is quite rare. In this report, we describe a case in which a patient suffered from intracerebral hemorrhagic due to CNS sarcoidosis. A 57-year-old male who had been diagnosed as having systemic sarcoidosis was admitted to our hospital due to status epilepticus. Plain CT scan showed a subcortical hematoma in the left marginal gyrus. Serial MR imaging revealed that an enhanced mass in the overlying cortex had gradually increased its size. Subsequently, the enhanced mass and hematoma were totally removed, using a navigation system. Pathological examination revealed typical findings of sarcoidosis. We discuss the mechanism of intracerebral bleeding due to CNS sarcoidosis in this report.
