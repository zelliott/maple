Since there are salvage solutions, it is important to detect local recurrence of prostate cancer as early as possible. The first sign is "biochemical failure" in that the prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentration rises again. The definition of biochemical failure varies depending on the initial treatment: PSA greater than 0.2ng/mL after prostatectomy, nadir+2ng/mL after radiotherapy. There is no standardised definition of biochemical failure after cryotherapy, focused ultrasound, or brachytherapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (particularly dynamic MRI) can detect local recurrence with good sensitivity. The role of spectroscopy is still under discussion. For the moment, ultrasound techniques are less effective than MRI.
