A 66-year-old female with a 3-year history of left trigeminal neuralgia presented with an unusual left cerebellopontine angle meningioma associated with asymptomatic syringomyelia at the C2 to C4 levels diagnosed by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Two months after total tumor removal, the syringomyelia had diminished without shunting. MR images are useful as a basis for early diagnosis of syringomyelia.
