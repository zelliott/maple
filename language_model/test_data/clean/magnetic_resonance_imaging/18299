We report the clinical features and laboratory-instrumental findings in two patients with acute monophasic demyelinating disease with focal clinical expression: one case of incomplete cervical transverse myelitis and one of focal supratentorial encephalitis. We describe the clinical course and evolution of the neuroradiological findings (CT and MRI) and discuss their pathological meaning and diagnostic value.
