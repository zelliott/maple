Myofibroma and myofibromatosis are rare, benign mesenchymal neoplasms composed of spindle-shaped contractile myoid cells and myofibroblasts, which generally develop in infancy or before the age of 2 years. At present, the precise etiology of this condition is unknown, with most cases reported as sporadic. However, some cases have suggested the possibility of a familial pattern of inheritance, with both dominant and -recessive patterns of inheritance have been reported. Presented here is a case of myofibroma associated with a family history of myofibromatosis, suggesting autosomal-dominant inheritance.
