Angiolipomas are considered to be rare. They are benign mesenchymal tumors generally located in the subcutaneous tissue of trunk and limbs.

The authors report a thoracic epidural angiolipoma mimicking a vertebro-epidural metastasis. The patient suffered from medullary compression related to an extradural mass in T6.

Pathological ex-, amination was obtained from tumoral samples. They consisted of mature adipose tissue with numerous sections of abnormal vascular channels.

Reviewing literature particular attention is paid to some questions raised in connection with different kinds of vertebro-epidural tumors. The authors give importance to relationships between angiolipomas and angiomyolipomas using MRI as a tool in differential diagnosis. Pathogenesis is evokated especially regarding the role of corticotherapy, the case herein reported lying within this therapeutical context.
