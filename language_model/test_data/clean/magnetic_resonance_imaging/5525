Myelolipoma is a rare, hormonally inactive, benign tumor consisting of fat and hematopoietic cells. It is often encountered in the adrenal gland. Less frequently, it may occur in extraadrenal sites. Although myelolipoma is well defined by criteria of morphologic imaging, functional characteristics may be crucial to exclude malignancy.We present a case of histologically proven extraadrenal myelolipoma which was successfully diagnosed by bone marrow scintigraphy, using a monoclonal antibody directed against myeloid elements.
