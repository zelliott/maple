Truly accurate dipole source localization relies on having (1) reliable, artifact-free EP/ERP (or magnetoelectroencephalogram) data to start with; (2) landmark and electrode position data obtained with a three-dimensional digitizer; (3) MRI (or CT) data from the same subject (with a means to measure the same landmarks); (4) the capability to apply different dipole and volume conductor models; and (5) the ability to coregister the functional and anatomic data to display the final source solutions. Most important is to have a thorough understanding of the fundamental principles of the localization programs and neurophysiologic processes. Localization programs are simply tools. Used incorrectly, they can yield meaningless results. Used correctly, they can provide a window into neurophysiologic functioning that is not available through any other means.
