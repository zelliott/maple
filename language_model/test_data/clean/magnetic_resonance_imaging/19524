Congenital abnormality of the aortic arch is a diagnosis made most of the time incidentally in childhood, unless dysphagia or respiratory disorders occur before. A case of a complex aortic arch anomaly with an aneurysm of the right subclavian artery presenting as an isolated Horner's syndrome in an adult is reported herein. Magnetic resonance imaging led to this very unusual diagnosis.
