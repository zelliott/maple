The factors determining the operating safety of magnetic resonance (MR) tomographs are considered. It is stated that the main factors to be accounted in defining safety measures are exposures to 3 types of magnetic fields: the static leakage field of the magnetic system of a MR tomograph; the radio-frequency field of RF coils, and the rapidly varying fields of gradient coils. Possible impacts of exposure to the above fields on patients and staff are enlisted. The indices accepted to rate the operating safety of MR tomographs and their maximum acceptable levels are given.
