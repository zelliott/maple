Radiation-induced neoplasms of the central nervous system generally present as meningioma or sarcoma. Spinal cord glioma after radiation therapy is rare and half of the cases documented occurred after treatment of Hodgkin's disease.A 39-year-old male presented with a 1-month history of gradually worsening neck ache and paraparesis. The patient had been treated for stage IB Hodgkin's disease 9 years previously with combined therapy: MOPP-ABV and a 40-Gray mediastinal radiotherapy from T1 to T10. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed an intramedullary lesion from C6 to T2 and histopathological examination from biopsy demonstrated a malignant glioma. Despite chemotherapy and additional radiotherapy, the patient's neurological status worsened and he died 11 months after initial presentation. We suggest a strategy aimed solely at obtaining a tissue diagnosis to differentiate myelitis from tumor, and, in the event of tumor, confirming the strong likelihood of a high histopathological grade. The very limited survival associated with these tumors regardless of therapy advocates palliative therapies without attempting complete resection.
