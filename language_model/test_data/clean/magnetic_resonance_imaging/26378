A mucocele is an epithelial lined mucus-containing sac completely filling a paranasal sinus and capable of expansion. They are relatively unusual, occurring most frequently in the fronto-ethmoidal region. The imaging features on plain X-ray, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are relatively characteristic allowing distinction of the lesion from other pathologies in this area although the mucoceles may occur in association with other pathologies such as nasal polyposis and neoplasia.
