We report a rare case of chronic encapsulated intracerebral hematoma (CEIH) after radiosurgery for a cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM).

Seven years after radiosurgery, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a high-intensity mass in the right basal ganglia with a peripheral low signal ring and fluid level on both T1- and T2-weighted images, which was compatible with CEIH.

Stereotactic evacuation and placement of an Ommaya reservoir were performed.

The concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor was high in the hematoma, suggesting that CEIH may be similar to chronic subdural hematoma.
