Multiple myeloma, also known as Kahler's disease or myelomatosis, is a type of cancer that begins in plasma cells. It is the second most common hematologic malignancy (13%) and accounts for 1% of all cancers. A mnemonic sometimes used to remember the common tetrad of multiple myeloma is CRAB: C = Calcium (elevated), R = Renal failure, A = Anemia, B = Bone lesions.

We present the case of an 70- year-old male with bilateral humeral location. Diagnosis was difficult because of atypical X-ray findings in the right shoulder, the classic finding being punched-out lesions. ESR, blood, renal and liver tests were atypical.

Although the diagnosis of multiple myeloma is easy, being based on blood and kidney tests and X-ray examination, in some cases an accurate diagnosis is obtained only by pathological examination.
