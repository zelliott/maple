Computer simulations based on a physiologically realistic tracer kinetic model with multiple pathways was used to provide insights on the applicability and interpretation of tissue enhancement metrics such as the maximum slope, peak enhancement and area under curve, commonly used in dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. Results show that physiological conditions of the tissue that could affect the accuracy of the maximal slope method include a high blood flow, increased variability of flow within the vasculature or a low vascular volume. Interestingly, changes in permeability and interstitial volume might not affect the accuracy of the maximal slope method. Time-to-peak and peak value of the tissue enhancement curve are not strictly properties of the tissue alone, and they cannot be linearly related to intrinsic tissue parameters such as blood flow, blood volume, capillary permeability, interstitial volume and mean transit time. Similar to the normalized initial area under tissue concentration curve, an alternative estimate of the total tracer distribution volume can be simply given by the ratio of tracer concentration in the tissue and artery sampled at the final DCE scan.
