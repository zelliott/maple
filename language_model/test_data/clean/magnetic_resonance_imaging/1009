We report a case of an hydatid cyst of diaphragma in a 34-year-old female who was admitted to our clinic for right basithoracic pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reported a giant hydatid cyst including multiple vesicles at the right lower thoracic cavity. Surgical exploration revealed an independent giant diaphragmatic hydatid cyst. We performed cystotomy and more than 200 daughter vesicles were removed from the cyst. The rest of the giant cyst cavity was excised.
