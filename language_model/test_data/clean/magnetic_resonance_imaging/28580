Fifty six patients with suspected spinal metastases were examined. A diagnostic algorithm included native and contrast (the paramagnetic contrast agent magnevist (Shering) magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) of the spine and spinal marrow. The diagnosis of spinal metastases was verified in all patients examined by using magnevist. Spinal metastases most commonly gave rise to the breast (55%), prostate (20%), lung (10%). The results of the study provide evidence that the use of magnevist enhances the informative value and specificity of MRT in the diagnosis of spinal metastases.
