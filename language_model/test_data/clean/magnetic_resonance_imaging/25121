To describe the different imaging modalities for the evaluation of pathological changes in the cavernous sinus as well as to compile criteria for differential diagnosis. Imaging of the cavernous sinus comprises the primary use of tomographic modalities such as CT or MRI. The continuing development of multislice-CT (MSCT) allows the depiction of bony structures of the cavernous sinus with a high resolution.Secondary reconstructions of the acquired data set allow a reliable evaluation especially of the bony topography including the foraminae of nerves and vessels. Uni- or bilateral structures can be visualized using contrast-enhanced CT.CT-angiography is capable of demonstrating the course of the internal carotid artery and its involvement in pathologies of the cavernous sinus, this recent achievement has only been made available by use of the current short scanning times. Contrast-enhanced MRI in axial and coronal orientation, optionally using fat saturation techniques as well as arterial and venous MRI-angiography (MRA) are used to depict the soft parts of the cavernous sinus. Care must be taken to cover all topographic detail including different signal intensities, as multiple inborn, neoplastic, infectious or traumatic changes can be present hampering the radiologic diagnosis of the cavernous sinus. Uni- and bilateral infiltration of the cavernous sinus as well as vascular involvement represent additional criteria leading to the differential diagnosis. The advent of dynamic sequences as well as diffusion and perfusion weighted MRI have broadened the spectrum of diagnostic modalities. Digital subtraction angiography as an invasive technique is used during therapeutic procedures such as the local treatment of aneurysms or carotid-cavernous fistulas.
