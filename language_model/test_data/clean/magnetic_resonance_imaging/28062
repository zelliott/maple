Two cases of dumbbell cervical neurinomas with massive subcutaneous extension were reported. The first case was A 30-year-old woman who was admitted to our hospital because she had been aware of a left lateral cervical subcutaneous mass and was suffering from shoulder dullness. On admission, neurological examination revealed hypesthesia to touch and pain in the segmental area of C4, and hyperreflexia in the left biceps and patellar tendon reflexes. Plain X-ray showed enlargement of the left C3/4 intervertebral foramen. CT scan, post-myelogram CT and MRI demonstrated a dumbbell shaped tumor at the level of C3-4. Angiogram showed an anterior shift of the left vertebral artery (VA) and tumor stain. Temporary occlusion of the left VA by a balloon catheter was performed leaving no neurological deficits. The second case was a 36-year-old woman who had been aware of a left lateral cervical subcutaneous mass. She complained of shoulder pain and finger clumsiness. On admission, neurological examination revealed weakness of the left deltoid muscle, hypesthesia in the segmental area of C3-4 and exaggeration of all deep tendon reflexes in the left-side extremities. Plain X-ray showed enlargement of the C2/3, C3/4 and C4/5 intervertebral foramina. CT scan, post myelogram CT and MRI demonstrated a dumbbell shaped tumor at the level of C2-5. Angiogram showed an anteromedial shift of the left VA and tumor stain. Temporary occlusion test of the left VA by a balloon catheter was performed with negative results. In each case two-stage operations were undertaken with excellent results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
