The effect of section alignment and distance in volumetric determination of myocardial mass by means of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was studied in 19 isolated pig hearts. Double angulated views taken through the short axis of the heart with a slice thickness of 10 mm and slices at a distance of 0 mm, 1 mm, 3 mm and 5 mm produced accurate left ventricular measurements with cardiac MRI. Measurements in the long axis of the heart resulted in a marked underestimation of myocardial mass; depending on slice intervals, there was an error between 13% and 20%. In vivo measurements in 35 subjects confirmed the effect of section alignment. Measurements in the long axis of the heart produced results of 139.9 +/- 31.7 g, significantly less than measurements in the short axis of the heart of 157.8 +/- 32.3 g.
