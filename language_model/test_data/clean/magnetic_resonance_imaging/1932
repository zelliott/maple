To compare pulse sequences in revealing intracranial bleeding from the hyperacute to subacute phase.

We injected 0.3-1 ml of autologous blood into the brain of 8 rabbits. MR imaging was performed immediately after haematoma creation and then at determined intervals up to 9-12 days. All images were analysed by two observers. After the last MR investigation, the brain was fixed in formalin. The last MR images were compared to the fixed brain sections and to the histologic findings.

T2*-weighted GE sequences, both conventional spoiled and echoplanar sequences, revealed the intraparenchymal haematomas as hypointensities in all but 1 case, which was negative from the second day onward (a rabbit with 0.3 ml blood injected). The signal patterns remained unchanged during the follow-up. The haematoma sizes and shapes corresponded well to gross pathology. Blood in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space was detected with T2*-weighted GE sequences in a great majority of the examinations during the first 2 days. The cases with the smallest injected volume of blood were negative. SE sequences were rather insensitive. The FLAIR sequence often revealed blood in CSF spaces but not in the brain.

T2*-weighted GE sequences are capable of revealing very small intraparenchymal haemorrhages from the hyperacute to the subacute phase, and blood in CSF spaces during at least the first 2 days.
