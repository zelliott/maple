Based on several clinical case examples, this article demonstrates the different symptoms and complications in patients fitted with prostheses with metal-on-metal (MoM) bearings. We recommend an annual clinical control for patients with MoM prostheses with a prosthesis head size of 36Â mm or larger. In patients who have problems tests should be carried out to measure the metal ion levels of cobalt and chromium and the metal artifact-reduced sequence by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or if this is not possible an ultrasound investigation. The clinical investigations should specifically target asymptomatic local swellings or hardened sites and patients should be questioned on problems with general hypersensitivity reactions (skin rash), cardiomyopathy, neurological changes including sensory changes, renal function impairment and thyroid dysfunction.
