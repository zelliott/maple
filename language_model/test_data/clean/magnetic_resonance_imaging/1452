The complementary use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of bladder-base leiomyoma is reported. The MRI, as compared to computed tomography (CT), gave the characteristics of myoma resembling uterine myoma, submucosal location, the site of origin and relationship to bladder wall. The MRI appearance of homogenous and medium intensity on T1 weighted image, and of low intensity on T2 weighted image, of submucosal solid mass was suggestive of a leiomyoma.
