The bulk of spinal imaging is still performed with conventional two-dimensional sequences. This study assesses the suitability of three-dimensional sampling perfection with application-optimised contrasts using a different flip angle evolutions (SPACE) sequence for routine spinal imaging.

62 MRI examinations of the spine were evaluated by 2 examiners in consensus for the depiction of anatomy and presence of artefact. We noted pathologies that might be missed using the SPACE sequence only or the SPACE and a sagittal T(1) weighted sequence. The reference standards were sagittal and axial T(1) weighted and T(2) weighted sequences. At a later date the evaluation was repeated by one of the original examiners and an additional examiner.

There was good agreement of the single evaluations and consensus evaluation for the conventional sequences: κ>0.8, confidence interval (CI)>0.6-1.0. For the SPACE sequence, depiction of anatomy was very good for 84% of cases, with high interobserver agreement, but there was poor interobserver agreement for other cases. For artefact assessment of SPACE, κ=0.92, CI=0.92-1.0. The SPACE sequence was superior to conventional sequences for depiction of anatomy and artefact resistance. The SPACE sequence occasionally missed bone marrow oedema. In conjunction with sagittal T(1) weighted sequences, no abnormality was missed. The isotropic SPACE sequence was superior to conventional sequences in imaging difficult anatomy such as in scoliosis and spondylolysis.

The SPACE sequence allows excellent assessment of anatomy owing to high spatial resolution and resistance to artefact. The sensitivity for bone marrow abnormalities is limited.
