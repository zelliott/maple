This case report describes the use of cholescintigraphy in the preoperative evaluation of ventrally conjoined twin girls. Sonography and magnetic resonance imaging disclosed an anatomically conjoined heart and a single apparently fused liver. Cholescintigraphy demonstrated that the hepatic system functioned as two independent livers, gallbladders, and biliary drainage systems that were susceptible to separation.
