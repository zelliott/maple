(1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that apparently normal (from the data of magnetic resonance imaging) human brain frontoparietal cortex in the subacute stage of traumatic brain injury is characterized by decreased level of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and increase in levels of myoinositol, choline-containing compounds (Cho), and creatine/phosphocreatine (Cr). Correlations between Cr, Cho, and NAA were established. We propose a scheme of neuronal metabolic processes that joins these substances.
