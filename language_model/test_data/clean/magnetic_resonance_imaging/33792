Lateral ventricular volumes were monitored and quantified using accurately registered magnetic resonance images (MRIs) in six healthy individuals 30 min before and up to 4 h after ingestion of a glucose drink. The volume of the lateral ventricles increased by an average (+/- S.E.M.) of 2.4 +/- 0.4% as blood glucose levels rose from 4.8 +/- 0.2 mmol l-1 to 8.4 +/- 0.4 mmol l-1. This was followed by a peak decrease of 5.99 +/- 3.3% below initial fasting volumes as blood glucose levels fell to 5.0 +/- 0.3 mmol l-1. We suggest that the secondary volume decrease demonstrates a homeostatic process of brain volume regulation for which the mechanism remains uncertain.
