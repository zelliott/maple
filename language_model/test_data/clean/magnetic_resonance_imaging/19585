We report a case of a 42-year old man with a bilateral medial medullary stroke (MMS) with favorable outcome. First described by Spiller in 1908, the MMS accounts for less than 0,5% of all cerebral infarcts. It may be unilateral or more rarely bilateral, and may often be the consequence of the atherosclerosis. The clinical features of MMS classically associate contralateral hemiparesis and lemniscal hypoesthesia accompanied by ipsilateral lingual palsy and sometimes oculomotor disturbances (upbeat nystagmus). With the advent of magnetic resonance imaging, some restricted or unusual clinical manifestations can be attributed to this localization. The benign form of MMS seems much more common than MMS with poor prognosis.
