We compared (123)I-iodobenzamide single photon emission computed tomography (IBZM-SPECT) for imaging of striatal dopamine D(2) receptors in vivo, and MRI in 32 patients with the clinical diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). We found a significant inter-dependence of reduction of specific striatal IBZM binding indicative of striatal degeneration and of the absence of multiple signal hyperintensities in MRI; age had no influence neither on IBZM binding nor on signal hyperintensities. We conclude that the presence of multiple signal hyperintensities should raise doubt on the correct clinical diagnosis.
