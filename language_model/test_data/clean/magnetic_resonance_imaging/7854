We report a 33-year-old woman with invasive thyrotropin-secreting pituitary adenoma after previous thyroid ablation with radioiodine who was successfully treated with transsphenoidal surgery after pre-treatment with octreotide-LAR for 10 months. Since invasive and aggressive thyrotropin-secreting macroadenomas are more frequently observed in patients who have undergone thyroid ablation, we suggest preoperative treatment with somatostatin analogs should be considered in these patients to reduce serum thyrotropin and stabilize or reduce tumor size.
