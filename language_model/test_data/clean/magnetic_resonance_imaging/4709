A method was developed for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of human autopsy brains stored long-term at -70 degrees C. Scanning brains at temperatures between -70 and -8 degrees C gave minimal MRI signals consistent with protons having limited freedom of movement at low temperature. Raising brain temperature improved the signal such that scanning at -1 degree C generated images with good in-plane resolution, grey/white matter contrast, and fine detail of cortical sulcal/gyral patterns. To validate the method, volume and area measurements were made using computerized image analysis on stored digital images of 14 brains from adult subjects of both genders and various ages. The data confirmed that brain volume was inversely correlated with age, and female subjects had smaller brains. This is a valuable new method for acquiring morphometric data from previously unscanned pathologic brains that are to be used for neurochemical and molecular investigations.
