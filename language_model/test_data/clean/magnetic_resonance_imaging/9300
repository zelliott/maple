Reversible edema following seizure activity has been well described; however, there are now a number of further distinct MR findings described in the literature, also documented to be transient and associated with seizure activity. A concise review of these described transient conventional magnetic resonance imaging manifestations of seizure activity is presented in pictorial essay format. In addition to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome appearances, less common abnormalities involving the cerebral and cerebellar cortices, deep gray matter, meninges, hippocampi, and corpus callosum are presented and highlighted.
