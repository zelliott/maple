In one volunteer, five breast coils were evaluated for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), uniformity, comfort, subject orientation, access to the breast, and unilateral imaging options. The four-coil arrays provided superior SNR, imaging flexibility, and access. Uniformity and comfort were issues with all coils. Substantial design differences exist between coils; purchasers should ensure that their specific requirements are met.
