A case of calcified synovial cyst of the cervical spine was diagnosed by a combination of imaging modalities. Curvilinear calcification associated with posterior elements, well seen by CT, suggested the correct diagnosis. Magnetic resonance showed a curvilinear region of low signal intensity corresponding to the calcification.
