To confirm the structure of the fiber connection between Whitnall's ligament and the superior wall of the orbit, ten orbits from five Japanese cadavers were examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dissection. MRI showed a well-circumscribed low-intensity signal at the fiber connection. Pre-aponeurotic fat was prominent and the fibers originating from Whitnall's ligament were fused at the lower face of the capsule of the pre-aponeurotic fat in four cadavers. Fibers originating from the upper face of the fat were attached to the superior periorbit (minimum width: 15 mm). The fifth cadaver had very little pre-aponeurotic fat and few fibers. These anatomic differences may be within the normal range of variation. The fibers may support Whitnall's ligament and may help to retract pre-aponeurotic fat during levator muscle contraction as the eye opens.
