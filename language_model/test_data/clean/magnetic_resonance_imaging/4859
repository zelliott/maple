Early diagnosis of optic nerve head (ONH) avulsion may be difficult due to an obscured fundus view. Although B-scan ultrasonography is more useful than MRI and CT imaging, it has limited sensitivity and specificity. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used to identify optic nerve pathology. Utilization of OCT has not been widely reported in the diagnosis of ONH avulsion. Two cases OCT use in ONH avulsion are reported. The utility of OCT in the diagnosis of ONH avulsion is of limited value.
