The authors have reviewed available data from 7 pediatric patients with intramedullary spinal cord cavernous angioma (ISCCA) reported in the literature, and added from their own series 2 pediatric patients, for a total of 9 patients. This group of pediatric patients' clinical presentation, course, management and outcome were compared to their adult counterparts as reported in the literature. In contrast to adults, children with symptomatic ISCCA do not show a gender imbalance and the thoracic spinal cord is not predominantly involved. Pediatric patients commonly present with an acute episode and rapid deterioration. A more favorable outcome has been reported in children as compared to adults in the face of relatively similar presenting deficits. As in adults, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains the diagnostic and postoperative test of choice. Complete resection affords the best chance for cure. Symptomatic children with ISCCA characteristically present with an acute deficit and rapid deterioration. MRI of the entire neuraxis is recommended for lesion multiplicity. An attempt at total resection and long-term MRI follow-up are recommended.
