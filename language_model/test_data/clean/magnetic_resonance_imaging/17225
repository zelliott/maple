Lymphangiomas are benign malformations of the vessels. They are commonly located in the neck, axillary region and mediastinum. Lymphangioma of the adrenal gland is very rare. These lesions were first discovered as incidental autopsy findings. As the imaging techniques have improved, they now appear as incidental findings at abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography scan examinations. They are usually asymptomatic. We present a 26-year-old woman admitted to the hospital, complaining of weakness, putting on weight, and lumbago. Her laboratory findings were within normal limits. Radiological examination revealed a 7 cm cystic lesion located in the right adrenal gland. Right adrenalectomy was performed. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical analysis of the cystic lesion was consistent with a lymphangioma.
