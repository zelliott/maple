A 25-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma developed severe muscular weakness and pain 15 days after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). The diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis was made based on myalgia localized in the bilateral upper extremities (bilateral trapezius, deltoid, biceps brachii, and teres major muscles) on magnetic resonance imaging and increased levels of muscle-derived serum enzymes. In this case, some drugs administered during the clinical course of TACE (diclofenac, famotidine, and cefotiam dihydrochloride) were suspected to be involved in the rhabdomyolysis, but the exact cause of rhabdomyolysis was not identified. The symptoms were completely improved by right trisegmentectomy of the liver following conservative treatment.
