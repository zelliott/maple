Upper airway collapsibility may be influenced by both muscular and nonmuscular factors. Because mucosal blood volume (and therefore vascular tone) is an important determinant of nasal airway patency, vascular tone may be an important nonmuscular determinant of pharyngeal collapsibility. This hypothesis was tested in two experimental models. First, upper airway closing (CP) and opening (OP) pressures and static compliance were measured in nine anesthetized, sinoaortic-denervated, paralyzed cats with isolated upper airways. Vascular tone was decreased with either papaverine or sodium nitroprusside (NTP), and increased with phenylephrine (PE), whereas blood pressure and end-tidal CO2 were maintained constant. Vasodilation increased CP (control = -10.4 +/- 1.3, NTP = -7.3 +/- 1.2 cm H2O; p less than 0.05) and OP (control = -7.9 +/- 1.5, NTP = -3.3 +/- 1.8 cm H2O; p less than 0.05). In contrast, vasoconstriction tended to decrease CP (control = -10.7 +/- 1.5, PE = -11.7 +/- 1.4 cm H2O; p less than 0.09) and OP (control = -8.1 +/- 1.2, PE = -9.9 +/- 1.9 cm H2O; p less than 0.1). Thus, vasodilation increased and vasoconstriction tended to decrease upper airway collapsibility. Upper airway static compliance was unchanged during either drug infusion. In order to assess changes in pharyngeal cross-sectional area (CSA) that occurred during vasodilation, magnetic resonance imaging was utilized in seven cats. During vasodilation with NTP, pharyngeal CSA was reduced from 0.44 +/- 0.10 to 0.30 +/- 0.09 cm2 (p less than 0.05), and pharyngeal volume was reduced from 15.3 +/- 2.4 to 13.9 +/- 2.7 cm3 (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
