Osteoblastoma is a rare primary bone tumor that is curable by complete excision. There are few data about the effectiveness of chemotherapy or radiotherapy in the treatment of recurrent osteoblastoma. We report a 13-year-old girl wit recurrent osteoblastoma who, after in complete surgical excision, responded to treatment with radiotherapy and later with chemotherapy. Surgery remains the treatment of choice for osteoblastoma. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy either alone or together may be useful in selected patients with recurrent, aggressive tumor or in patients with surgically unresectable disease.
