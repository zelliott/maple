This article presents a case of tethering of the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon (checkrein deformity) and rupture of the posterior tibialis tendon after a closed Salter-Harris Type II ankle fracture. Delayed repair was affected by tenolysis of the FHL and flexor digitorum longus tendons and tenodesis of the posterior tibialis to the flexor digitorum longus tendon. This case represents the first such report of concomitant entrapment of the FHL tendon and rupture of the posterior tibialis tendon after a closed ankle fracture.
