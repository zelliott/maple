The guidance of minimally invasive procedures may become a very important future application of MRI. The guidance of interventions requires images of the anatomy as well as the information of the position of invasive devices used. This paper introduces continuous radial MRI for the simultaneous acquisition of the anatomic MR image and the position of one or more small RF-coils (mu-coils), which can be mounted on invasive devices such as catheters or biopsy needles. This approach allows the in-plane tracking of an invasive device without any prolongation of the overall acquisition time. The extension to three-dimensional position tracking is described. Phantom studies are presented demonstrating the capability of this technique for real-time automatic adjustment of the slice position to the current catheter position with a temporal resolution of 100 ms. Simultaneously the in-plane catheter position is depicted in the actually acquired MR image during continuous scanning.
