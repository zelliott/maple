A projection reconstruction multi-gradient-echo (prMGE) technique is presented. The introduced technique is an extension of a standard projection reconstruction steady-state gradient-echo technique allowing for the acquisition of several gradient echoes after each excitation of the spin system. Each echo train is used for acquiring data of a certain angular segment of k-space. By use of echo trains consisting of up to four echoes, the overall acquisition time for a 128(2) image can be reduced to 150 ms without sacrificing image quality. Results are presented for cardiac fluoroscopy, for the visualization of swallowing, and for the visualization of joint motion. For all investigated applications promising results have been obtained. Especially in parts of the body where motion on an even shorter time scale than the acquisition process or significant in-plane or through-plane flow are within the field of view, the introduced technique appears to be a promising technique for MR fluoroscopy.
