Five cases of adrenal cortical carcinoma examined with magnetic resonance (MR) are presented. Clinical histories, computed tomographic (CT) scans, and final pathologic findings were reviewed in each case. All masses were hypointense compared to the liver on T1-weighted images and became hyperintense compared to the liver on T2-weighted images. Signal intensity of adrenal masses, fat, and liver were measured. Adrenal/liver and adrenal/fat signal intensity ratios were then calculated. All the masses were readily identified with MR. The MR also demonstrated displacement or invasion of adjacent organs, as well as liver metastases. The inferior vena cava was also identified in each case. Even though there were no consistent MR findings to diagnose adrenal cortical carcinomas accurately, superior blood vessel identification and multiplanar capabilities may make MR the imaging modality of choice in evaluating the extent of disease and in planning surgical excision.
