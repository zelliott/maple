MR imaging is the imaging modality of choice for evaluation of the traumatized lumbar spine, providing critical information for determination of appropriate therapy. It is superior to other modalities for evaluating the supporting ligaments, disc, spinal cord, and the cauda equina. Major fracture patterns are readily discernable. Canal compromise caused by osseous fragments, epidural hemorrhage, or disc fragments is well visualized.
