We describe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropathological findings in a patient with chronic progressive radiation myelopathy (CPRM). An 81-year-old man with esophageal cancer underwent radiotherapy. Four years later he developed a progressive neurological deficit below the irradiated level of the spinal cord. Neurological examination revealed spastic paraplegia. MRI findings showed an area of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images of the thoracic spinal cord. On the basis of clinical and MRI findings, we diagnosed his condition as CPRM. MRI performed thirteen months after onset of neurological signs revealed mild atrophy of the spinal cord detected on T1-weighted images and an area of high signal intensity within the spinal cord detected on T2-weighted images. Neuropathological examination revealed findings consistent with radiation myelopathy. We speculate that the area of high signal intensity within the spinal cord detected on T2-weighted images might be a result of proliferation of small vessels, which was discovered upon autopsy.
