Deep and superficial body temperatures were measured by in vitro and in vivo experiments, using a fluoroptic procedure and a variety of magnetic and electromagnetic fields, in the course of magnetic resonance imaging (0.35 T; 1.5 T). In vitro experiments were performed to select and check the appropriate temperature method. Temperature measurements in the human body were carried out centrally (esophageal and rectal measurements). In vivo experiments in 30 volunteers showed no significant changes (p = 0.05) in central or peripheral temperatures resulting from the application of static or dynamic fields or radiofrequency.
