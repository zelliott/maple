A 72-year-old man with a history of hypertension had a left cerebellar infarction and followed by a right cerebellar infarction within about one and a half months after the initial stroke. Brain magnetic resonance images(MRI) showed infarctions in both middle cerebellar peduncles and in the mid-portion of lower pons. Right veretebral artery(VA) terminated in posterior inferior cerebellar artery(PICA). Left intracranial VA has a high-grade eccentric atherosclerotic stenosis(91%) proximal to the left PICA. No collateral circulation was developed from bilateral carotid arteries. Three months after the final ischemic episode, the patient had remained bed ridden and needed a whole assistance for regular daily life because of severe ataxia of four limbs and truncs and of left hemiparesis. The patient and his family gave us informed written consent, then cerebral angioplasty and stenting(CAS) was performed for the left VA stenosis, which was sufficiently dilated. Iodine-123 iodoamphetamine(123I-IMP) single photo emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed hypoperfusion in both cerebellar hemispheres before CAS. Post CAS 123I-IMP SPECT scans demonstrated improvement of the hypoperfusion in the left cerebellar hemisphere. Ataxia of four limbs, left hemiparesis and his will for physical therapy improved in a short period after the treatment. Ten months later, the left VA had a mild stenosis and patient presented mild truncal ataxia and needed less assistance for regular daily life. The present case indicated that improvement of neurological impairment was expected by the endovascular revascularization even in a chronic stage.
