Relations between panic disorder (PD) and epilepsy (E) have repeatedly been discussed. Three patients with juvenile E who had been free of seizures under anticonvulsant medication for many years and developed PD are presented. Increasing anticonvulsant medication resulted in complete and stable remission of PD. It is hypothesized that, in a subgroup of patients with PD, there is a pathophysiological relation to E. Further research into the usefulness of anticonvulsants in the treatment of PD, especially in therapy-refractory cases, is suggested.
