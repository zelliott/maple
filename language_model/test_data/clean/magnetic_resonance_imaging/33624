Cervical spine injury is often catastrophic and neurologic deficits that often accompany it commonly leave the victim permanently disabled. Radiology has always played a pivotal role in diagnosing, assessing and prognosticating these injuries. For decades, conventional radiography, tomography and cervical myelography have been the only modalities available. With the advent of computed tomography, the first major revolution in radiology occurred. For the first time, bony injury could be clearly defined in the axial plane and the cross-sectional anatomy studied. Magnetic resonance imaging has strengthened the radiological armamentarium. The spinal cord itself and the soft tissues of the neck can now be imaged directly.
