In this report a new enlarged approach to the anterior cervical spine is presented. A 66-year-old female, having a large C3-C4-C5 chordoma, recurrent after surgery and following radiotherapy, underwent a surgical resection. The approach allows a wide retraction of the nasopharynx, oropharynx and larynx from the midline, only sacrificing the superior laryngeal nerve on one side. Its continuity can be re-established later by adopting the stent in tube technique. The approach we used presents all the risks of infection common in trans-oral approaches. For this reason, closure of the pharynx in two layers must be meticulous and watertight and reinforced by using a myofascial sternocleidomastoid flap, according to the tracheoesophageal fistula closure technique. A correct alignment of the tongue, the pre-plating of the mandible and the correct suture of the vermillion border guarantee excellent cosmetic and functional results.
