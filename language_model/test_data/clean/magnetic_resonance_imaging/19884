Schistosomiasis is a common parasitic disease in the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, South America and the Caribbean. It is the second most common parasitic infection of humans after malaria. Acute and chronic clinical presentations of S. monsoni are well described. Presentation as a pseudotumor is considered rare. We present a case of a 58-year-old Nigerian who presented with recurrent abdominal pain and abdominal mass of one-year duration. Stool was negative for schisostomal eggs, but histological specimen obtained from surgical resection of part of the caecum showed S. mansoni. The case was treated successfully by excisional biopsy and praziquantel therapy. A review of the literature is discussed.
