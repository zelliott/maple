This work demonstrates the feasibility of using wireless, tuned fiducial markers with a limited projection reconstruction-fast imaging with steady-state free precession sequence (LPR-FISP) to accurately obtain tracking information necessary for interactive scan plane selection in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The position and orientation of a rigid interventional device can be uniquely determined from the 3D coordinates of three fiducial markers mounted in a known configuration on the device. Three fiducial markers were tuned to the proton resonant frequency in a 0.2T open MR scanner and mounted to the surface of a cylindrical water phantom. An LPR-FISP sequence was developed to suppress the water phantom signal while preserving that of the fiducial markers through a nonselective low-tip-angle excitation and a dephaser gradient applied prior to data acquisition. A localization algorithm was developed to accurately calculate the 3D coordinates of the fiducial markers using four LPR-FISP projections in two orthogonal scan planes. The sequence repetition time (TR = 21 msec) and the limited projection set resulted in fast LPR-FISP coordinate acquisition times of approximately 170 msec with an accuracy (max error) of 3 mm on a 0.2T MR system. This fast, accurate tracking method provides the fundamental technology for interactive MRI scan plane definition for rigid interventional devices without the need for stereotactic cameras or reference frames.
