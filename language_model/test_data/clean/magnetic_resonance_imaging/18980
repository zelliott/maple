Trigeminal neuralgia is a rare feature of basilar invagination, which is itself a complication of osteochondrodysplastic disorders. Microvascular decompression is an unattractive option in medically refractory cases. The conventional percutaneous approach to the trigeminal ganglion is anatomically impossible because the foramen ovale points inferiorly and posteromedially. We report a new technique for image-guided trigeminal injection in a patient with basilar invagination complicating osteogenesis imperfecta.

A 26-year-old woman with osteogenesis imperfecta presented with a 3-year history of typical left maxillary division trigeminal neuralgia, which was poorly controlled by carbamazepine at the maximum tolerated dose. She had obvious cranial deformities, left optic atrophy, delayed left eye closure, tongue atrophy, but normal facial sensation and corneal reflexes. A computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed severe basilar invagination.

Frameless stereotactic glycerol injection of the left trigeminal ganglion was performed under general anesthesia using the infrared-based EasyGuide Neuro system (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) with magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic registration. The displaced and distorted left foramen ovale was cannulated via a true frameless stereotactic method with the trajectory determined by virtual pointer elongation. The needle placement was confirmed with injection of contrast medium into the trigeminal cistern. The path needed to enter the foramen traversed the right cheek, soft palate, and left tonsil. The patient went home pain-free with a preserved corneal reflex and no complications.

Frameless stereotaxy allows customization to individual patient anatomy and may be adapted to a variety of percutaneous procedures used in areas where the anatomy is complex.
