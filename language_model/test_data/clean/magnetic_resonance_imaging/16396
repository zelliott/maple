A retrospective review.

The aim of this study is to highlight one of the under recognized and under reported aspects of ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF), namely, dural ossification in OLF and to discuss the incidence, radiologic signs, causes as well as the surgical and prognostic implications of dural ossification in OLF.

OLF is being increasingly recognized as a cause of myelopathy. One of the surgical pitfalls in the management of this condition is ossification of the dura mater in OLF. Preoperative identification of ossified dura mater will be helpful to the surgeon to modify the surgical technique and to counsel patients regarding the risks of surgery.

A retrospective analysis of a database of OLF maintained by this author was done to identify cases of OLF where there was intraoperative evidence of dural ossification and dural laceration. Only those patients who had both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were included in the analysis. Patients with MR imaging alone were excluded from the analysis as CT evaluation was not done routinely in the earlier part of the study. Nurick's grading was used to assess the neurologic status before and after surgery. The CT and MR images of these patients were analyzed to identify radiologic signs of dural ossification. The pattern of dural ossification, if present, was noted. The intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded.

During the study period from 1997 to 2006, there were 20 patients with OLF who had both CT and MR imaging evaluation. Of these 20 patients, 8 had intraoperative evidence of dural ossification and these patients also sustained dural laceration during surgery. Of these 8 patients, CT evidence of dural ossification was found in 7. In the remaining one patient, there was no radiologic evidence of dural ossification. The radiologic signs of dural ossification as depicted in the bone windows of CT were of 2 types: (1) the "tram track sign," where there was a hyperdense bony excrescence with a hypodense center and (2) the "comma sign," where there was evidence of ossification of one-half of the circumference of the duramater. Of these 7 patients, 4 developed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak following surgery and 1 of these 4 patients developed meningitis. Neurologic function improved by one Nurick's grade in 5 of the 7 patients. In the remaining 2 patients, there was no change in the neurologic status.

Dural ossification is a common finding in OLF. There are 2 radiologic signs of dural ossification, namely, the "tram track sign" and the "comma sign." Preoperative identification of dural ossification might help the surgeon to anticipate and appropriately deal with dural laceration during surgery. This will also help to counsel patients regarding the risks of surgery for OLF. The surgical and prognostic implications of dural ossification are being discussed.
