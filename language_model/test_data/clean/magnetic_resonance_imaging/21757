The authors report a case of tuberculous spondylodiscitis with an intracanalar ant retropharyngeal involvement. This pathology is recently increasing like the immunodeficiency syndromes. Cervical tissue compression and neurological signs are the main clinical findings. Among the radiological explorations of disco-vertebral infections, the value of MRI study is now admitted. Using of T1 and T2 weighted sequences and Gadolinium injection provides the positive diagnosis, and well visualizes the extent: low signal of vertebral body, decrease and low signal of discal space, prevertebral and retrovertebral enlargement with a low signal intensity of the abscess in T1 weighted sequence and enhancement following Gd-DTPA administration; high signal intensity of vertebral body, prevertebral and epidural masses and abscess in T2 weighted sequence. The authors describe the evolutive features of Pott's disease and the value of MRI in the post-therapeutic course: T1-signal increases while enhancement following Gd-DTPA administration decreases and T2-signal decreases. The differential diagnosis with chordomas, metastasis, and pyogenic spondylodiscitis is well assessed by MRI.
