To describe general movement in extremely premature infants and examine correlations with risk factors for antenatal, perinatal, and postnatal morbidity.

Prospective, single-center study. Nineteen patients were followed up.

The infants' general movement was analyzed using video recordings. Qualitative and quantitative assessments were performed during the writhing movement (WM) period and fidgety movement (FM) period. The quality of the general movements (GMs) and the scores achieved were then correlated with antenatal, perinatal, and postnatal factors.

Infants' motor activity fluctuated during the WM period, especially in extremely premature infants where poor repertoire is often observed. No correlations were found between WMs and obstetric factors. Gestational age correlated with WMs' quality (p=0.023). WMs correlated with factors of postnatal morbidity such as chronic lung disease (CLD) (p=0.034) and nosocomial infections (p=0.05). At 3 months corrected age, the spontaneous movement quality are correlated with neurological explorations such as US brain (p=0.032), MRI (p=0.039), EEG (p=0.036), and neurological follow-up assessments (p=0.015).

Prudence must be used when performing the analysis of general movement in extremely preterm infants. WMs may be influenced by perinatal morbidity, and possibly by the severe brain immaturity of these infants. WMs correlate with CLD and nosocomial infections. Analysis of general movement in infants of 3 months corrected age is a valuable means to detect neurological disorders.
