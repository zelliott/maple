The possibility of using MR imaging as a sensitive marker of the structural changes in Parkinson's disease has been a long-sought goal. We describe a new method for imaging and quantifying the morphologic changes of the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease and compare radiologic findings with clinical evaluation.

Using a combination of two MR imaging inversion-recovery pulse sequences, the substantia nigra was imaged in six patients with Parkinson's disease and six age-related control participants. A radiologic index was defined and used to quantify the signal changes that were observed in the patients. The radiologic index was compared with clinical scores obtained from the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale.

The images showed loss of signal in a lateral-to-medial gradient in cases of Parkinson's disease, corresponding to the known neuropathologic pattern of degeneration. The radiologic index was highly correlated with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score, and there was no overlap in radiologic indices between the patient and the control groups (P < .00005).

This study suggests that MR imaging is sensitive to structural changes in even the earliest cases of Parkinson's disease, thereby indicating the potential for detecting presymptomatic disease. Furthermore, a radiologic measure has been defined that correlates with the conventional clinical measure of disease severity. Therefore, MR imaging could prove to be a sensitive biological marker for objective staging of the disease.
