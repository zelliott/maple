Chordomas are relatively rare tumors of bone. These primary malignant lesions occur throughout the spinal column and often show advanced growth at the time of diagnosis. Because such tumors are minimally responsive to radiation and chemotherapy, surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment. Patient survival and local control are associated with the ability to achieve wide surgical margins during excision. However, surgical morbidity may be substantial given the propensity for chordomas to abut or surround neural, vascular, and visceral structures. Thus, early recognition is essential, and treatment by a multidisciplinary team is ideal.
