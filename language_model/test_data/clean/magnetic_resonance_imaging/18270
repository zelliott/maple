A 48-year-old male presented with a metastatic skull base tumor located on the right of the clivus and the sphenoid sinus, which originated from adenocarcinoma of the stomach. The initial symptom was abducens nerve paralysis and there were no symptoms of upper gastrointestinal tract throughout the course. This gastric cancer, which rarely metastasizes to the central nervous system or osseous system, caused multiple bone metastases which produced the neurological symptoms.
