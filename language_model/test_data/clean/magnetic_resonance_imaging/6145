Transmit B(1)(+) field homogenization in high-field ( > 3.0 T) human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is challenging due to radio-frequency wavelength effects. An approach based on appropriately coupling surface coils to a volume coil was investigated. Electromagnetic simulation results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of this method in proton MRI of the human head at 7.0 T.
