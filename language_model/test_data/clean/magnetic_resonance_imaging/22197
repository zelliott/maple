Assessment of hemodynamic parameters in patients who had transient basilar symptoms suggesting vertebrobasilar insufficiency requires a systematic and accurate detection of brainstem or cerebellar infarcts. Our aim was to detect with 133Xenon and 15O2 inhalation methods, a low flow state underlying vertebrobasilar insufficiency in a patient who had no impairment of cerebrovascular control related to infarction of brainstem or cerebellum. A woman with intermittent vertebrobasilar symptoms had an angiogram, magnetic resonance imaging and evaluation of hemodynamic parameters with vertebrobasilar circulation with 133Xenon inhalation and 15O inhalation methods MRI failed to show any border-zone or territorial infarcts or degenerative disease. Angiographic study showed significant arterial lesion involving vertebrobasilar vessels. A decrease of blood flow within vertebrobasilar circulation was observed according to 133Xenon and 15O inhalation methods. These preliminary results support the view that significant arterial changes within the vertebrobasilar system might account for a low flow state. 15O2 inhalation method might be in agreement with a previous study performed in vertebrobasilar insufficiency with 133Xenon inhalation method.
