Gaucher's disease is a sphingolipidosis which may be accompanied by severe pain in the bones. We report a case of Bacteroides fragilis osteomyelitis consecutive to surgical biopsy. The bone pain may be due to ischaemia of the bone or to a pyogenic osteomyelitis which is iatrogenic in most cases. The clinical and paraclinical features of these two entities are described after a review of the literature, and the main complementary examinations leading to their diagnosis are presented.
