Imaging patterns of benign proliferative processes often complicate the assessment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We investigated the pathologic and biologic characteristics of false positive enhancement by breast MRI.

DCIS (n = 45), benign (n = 5), and false-positive (MRI enhancement and nonmalignant pathology) (n = 10) cases were characterized by immunohistochemistry and MRI features.

For DCIS cases, images that overestimated pathologic size had heterogeneous enhancement on MR, were estrogen receptor positive, and were low grade by pathology. False-positives had higher rates of proliferation, angiogenesis, and inflammation compared with benign tissue but lower values than DCIS. Benign proliferative processes accounted for all false-positive and size overestimated cases.

Lesions that enhance on MRI have higher proliferation, angiogenesis, and inflammation compared with nonproliferative breast tissue. Benign proliferative processes often enhance on MRI and are difficult to differentiate from low-grade, ER+ DCIS lesions. False-positive MRI enhancement may reflect a spectrum of change within high-risk tissue.
