We analyzed the seizure outcome of 140 patients who underwent resective surgeries of extratemporal lobes including multilobar resection and hemispherectomy. The patients were followed for 2.0 to 16.7 years after surgery (mean, 6.2 years). The overall seizure outcome was Engel's class I in 87 patients (62%), class II in 14 (10%), class III in 13 (9%), and class IV in 26 (19%). The proportion of class I cases was 76% in 71 patients with discrete lesions under 5 cm in diameter on MRI, whereas the proportion was 52% in 46 patients with widespread lesions over 5 cm, and 39% in 23 patients with no MRI-detectable lesion. The seizure-free rates of extratemporal lobe resection was slightly lower compared with temporal lobe resection. Even in patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsies, clinicians should consider the option of surgical intervention from the early stage of disease.
