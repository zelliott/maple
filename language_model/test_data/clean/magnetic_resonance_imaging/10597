The objective of this study was to present a previously unknown association of visual loss and Meniere-like vestibuloauditory symptoms in Eales' disease (idiopathic retinal vasculitis) and to give a survey of other conditions affecting both the retina and inner ear. A 32-year-old man diagnosed with Eales' disease presented with recurrent deteriorations of visual acuity and simultaneous recurrent vestibuloauditory symptoms strongly reminiscent of Meniere's disease. Both the recurrent low frequency hearing losses and the losses of visual acuity could be restituted repeatedly by high dose i.v. corticosteroids. A literature review reveals that in a number of other retinopathic diseases associated with Meniere-like symptoms, microvasculopathy is also the pathomechanism. A common pathogenetic cause, e.g., autoimmune-mediated microvasculitis of retinal periphlebitis and vestibulocochlear symptoms, in this case is suggested. The presented case adds new evidence to microvasculopathy being a pathogenetic factor in Meniere's disease. In cases of coincidence of vestibulocochlear symptoms and retinal perivasculitis, a therapeutic attempt with high-dose corticosteroids is advisable.
