The purpose of this study is to use magnetic resonance imaging to monitor the response of human glioma tumor xenografts to single fraction radiation therapy. Mice were divided into four treatment groups (n = 6 per group) that received 50, 200, 400, or 800 cGy of 200 kVp x rays. A fifth group (n = 6) received no radiation dose and served as the control. Quantitative maps of the treated tumor tissue were produced of water apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and transverse relaxation time (T2). Mice were imaged before and at multiple time points after treatment. There was a statistically significant difference in tumor growth relative to that of the control for all treatment groups. Only the highest dose group showed T2 values that were significantly different at all measured time points after treatment. In this group, there was an 8.3% increase in T2 relative to controls 2 days after treatment, but when measured 14 days after treatment, mean tumor T2 had dropped to 10.1% below the initial value. ADC showed statistically significant differences from the control at all dose points. A radiation dose dependence was observed. In the highest dose group, the fractional increases in ADC were higher than those observed for T2. ADC was sensitive to radiation-induced changes in lower dose groups that did not have significant T2 change. At all doses, elevation of mean tumor ADC preceded deviations in tumor growth from the control. These observations support the potential application of ADC as a time and dose sensitive marker of tumor response to radiation therapy.
