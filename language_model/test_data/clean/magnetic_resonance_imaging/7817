The bacterial gene MagA imparts magnetic properties to mammalian cells and provides a basis for cell tracking by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In a mouse model of tumor growth from transplanted cells, we used repetitive MRI to demonstrate the in vivo imaging potential of MagA expression relative to a modified ferritin overexpression system, lacking regulation through iron response elements (HF + LF).

Subcutaneous tumor xenografts were monitored weekly from days 2 to 34 post-injection. Small animal MRI employed balanced steady-state free precession. Imaging was correlated with tumor histology using hematoxylin, Prussian Blue, Ki-67, and BS-1 lectin.

Tumor heterogeneity with respect to tissue morphology and magnetic resonance (MR) contrast was apparent within a week of cell transplantation. In MagA- and HF + LF-expressing tumors, MR contrast enhancement was recorded up to day 20 post-injection and 0.073-cm(3) tumor volumes. MagA-expressing tumors showed increases in both quantity and quality of MR contrast as measured by fractional void volume and contrast-to-noise ratio, respectively. MR contrast in both MagA- and HF + LF-expressing tumors was maximal by day 13, doubling fractional void volume 1 week ahead of controls.

MagA- and HF + LF-expressing tumor xenografts augment MR contrast after 1 week of growth. MagA expression increases MR contrast within days of cell transplantation and provides MR contrast comparable to HF + LF. MagA has utility for monitoring cell growth and differentiation, with potential for in vivo detection of reporter gene expression using MRI.
