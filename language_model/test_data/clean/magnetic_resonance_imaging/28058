Glutaracidemia/glutaraciduria type I is an acute or subacute neuropathic disorder of infancy or early childhood. The following symptoms characterize the clinical course: macrocephalus present at birth, cerebral atrophy revealed by CT or MRI scans, most striking in the frontal and temporal lobes, choreoathetosis and dystonia as neurological handicaps. The deficiency of glutaryl-CoA-dehydrogenase leads to glutaracidemia and glutaraciduria. It is reported on a three year old girl. The glutaraciduria is an important differential diagnosis to chorea minor.
