Echo planar imaging, a development of magnetic resonance imaging, can produce snapshot images of the stomach and antroduodenal segment in as little as 64 msec and can be more useful than conventional techniques when assessing motility. The aim of this study was to compare antroduodenal motility measured by simultaneous perfused tube manometry and echo planar imaging. Ten volunteers were studied following the ingestion of 500 mL water or 500 mL porridge. Antroduodenal images, with acquisition times of 130 msec, were taken at 3-sec intervals, synchronized with motility traces and presented as a split-screen video. This allowed direct visual comparison of gastric wall movement and motility to be made. Contractions were confined to either the stomach or the duodenum or propagated across the antroduodenal segment. Over 4550 images were available for analysis. A larger number of propagated contractions were recorded with echo planar imaging in both water (P = 0.03) and food (P = 0.02) groups, whereas manometry detected a greater number of isolated duodenal pressure waves (P = 0.005). The contraction rate for water and food studies was similar, but direct visualization indicated that the manometric technique under-detected propagated events. The ability of echo planar imaging to record antroduodenal contractile activity provides a new insight into the role of occlusive and nonocclusive contractions during gastric emptying.
