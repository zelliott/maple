Gossypiboma, a term used to describe a mass within the body composed of a cotton matrix which usually refers to a retained surgical sponge, is a rare complication of cardiac surgery. We report one case revealed by the recurrence of the anginal symptoms after successful myocardial revascularisation surgery. The preoperative diagnosis was suspected by a combination of imaging techniques and subsequently confirmed by surgical removal. We review the literature to summarise the diagnostic and therapeutic features of gossypibomas.
