A 48-year-old female with multiple sclerosis (MS) accompanied by intractable hiccups of over one month' duration and the sleep apnea syndrome was reported. This MS patient had been well controlled until September 16, 1991 when she experienced nausea, vomiting and hiccups. The patient was admitted to Kawasaki Medical School Hospital on October 9, 1991. A physical examination revealed intractable hiccups. T1-weighted MRI showed a low and T2-weighted image disclosed a high signal intensity area in the tegmentum of the medulla oblongata. The intractable hiccups and vomiting improved with intravenous high dose methylprednisolone injection therapy. The following day, she complained of insomnia and her family observed severe snoring and apnea during the night. These symptoms and the results of a breathing monitor were compatible with the sleep apnea syndrome. These symptoms disappeared following the administration of amitriptyline. There have been few reports of the combination of intractable hiccups and the sleep apnea syndrome in MS. The MRI findings suggest that the causative lesion of these symptoms is in the tegmentum of the medulla oblongata.
