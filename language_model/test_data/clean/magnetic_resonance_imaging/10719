We evaluated 20 patients with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia for structural abnormalities using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and compared them with 20 controls. Two experienced observers interpreted the MRIs. There were no differences in incidence of qualitative MRI findings in patients compared with controls. These findings do not favor an association between anatomic abnormalities and arrhythmia in these patients.
