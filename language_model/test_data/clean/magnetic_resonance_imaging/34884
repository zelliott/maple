Postinfectious encephalomyelitis is a kind of demyelinating disease with pathological characteristics and a monophasic clinical course. Herein, we describe a patient who had the symptoms of binge eating, fatigue, memory impairment, hypotalkativeness, hypoactivity, lethargy, incoherent speech, dysphoric mood, and episodic disorientation. Only elevation of CSF protein was noted upon initial admission; however, blurred vision of the eyes developed progressively after discharge. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) scanning of the brain demonstrated scattered lesions of low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high areas on T2-weighted images in the left thalamus, bilateral hypothalamus and midbrain. The findings of MRI image, CSF, and clinical course all suggested postinfectious encephalomyelitis. After a treatment of prednisolone, a follow-up MRI revealed evidence of improvement, and the binge eating also improved.
