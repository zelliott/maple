To evaluate the accuracy of arthrography, ultrasound and MR imaging in rotator cuff disease.

40 patients suffering from subacromial impingement syndrome for at least three months and who were selected for surgery, underwent ultrasound, double-contrast arthrography and MR imaging. Patient preselection focused on partial and small complete tears.

13/26 surgically confirmed tears were partial tears (articular surface: 10, bursal surface: 2, intra-substance tearing: 1). Arthrography, ultrasound and MR imaging yield a sensitivity for complete tears of 91%, 69% and 92% with a specificity of 100%, 93% and 93%. For partial tears sensitivity was 50%, 69% and 69% with a specificity of 100%, 79% and 86%. Concerning evaluation of localisation, extent and correct classification ultrasound was correct in 17/26 cases, MR in 21/26 cases.

Arthrography is not helpful in detecting partial tears. Ultrasound and MR imaging yield comparable accuracy. MR imaging has advantages concerning better evaluation of extent, location and classification as well as for the detection of associated pathologies.
