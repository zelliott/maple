Auditory feedback plays an important role in natural speech production. We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment using a transformed auditory feedback (TAF) method to delineate the neural mechanism for auditory feedback control of pitch. Twelve right-handed subjects were required to vocalize /a/ for 5 s, while hearing their own voice through headphones. In the TAF condition, the pitch of the feedback voice was randomly shifted either up or down from the original pitch two or three times in each trial. The subjects were required to hold the pitch of the feedback voice constant by changing the pitch of original voice. In non-TAF condition, the pitch of the feedback voice was not modulated and the subjects just vocalized /a/ continuously. The contrast between TAF and non-TAF conditions revealed significant activations; the supramarginal gyrus, the prefrontal area, the anterior insula, the superior temporal area and the intraparietal sulcus in the right hemisphere, but only the premotor area in the left hemisphere. This result suggests that auditory feedback control of pitch is mainly supported by the right hemispheric network.
