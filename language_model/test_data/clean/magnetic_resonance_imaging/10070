We investigated sequential changes in MRI and relevant histopathological findings after PRC.

A total of 15 rabbits were examined with MRI and sacrificed immediately (3), and 7 (4), 45 (4) and 90 (4) days after PRC. MRI studies were reviewed for the signal intensity of cryolesions and correlated with pathological findings. MRI and pathological measurements of cryolesion sizes were compared using the paired t test.

CCN was produced in central areas of cryolesions and associated with hemorrhage, hemolysis, fibrous granulation and fibrosis that was orderly through days 1 to 90. Signal intensity was slightly hyperintense on T1-weighted spin-echo images immediately after PRC, and hyperintense on T1 and T2-weighted fast spin-echo images at 7 days. On T2-weighted fast spin-echo images there was a hypointense zone in peripheral areas between the central area and renal parenchyma at the prior 2 stages, which was consistent with PCN histologically. It was enhanced at 7 days. At 45 and 90 days the signal intensity of cryolesions was isointense or hypointense on the 2 sequences. Parenchymal injury adjacent to cryolesions was histologically recognized and visible as a hyperintense zone in 2 lesions at 45 days. This zone was enhanced in 2 lesions at 45 and 90 days. No statistical significance was apparent between the 2 measurements of cryolesions and CCN sizes (p <0.05).

The MRI appearance of cryolesions reflects orderly histopathological findings. MRI distinguishes CCN from PCN, reveals injury to the renal parenchyma outside of cryolesions and accurately estimates the size of cryolesions and CCN.
