The experience of using magnetic++-resonance tomography to diagnose tuberculous spondylitis in 15 children admitted to a hospital for surgical treatment is described. The method proved to be highly effective for evaluating the condition of the spine and spinal medulla and for establishment of early diagnosis of the attendant neurotrophic changes in healthy vertebrae. The examination findings serve to determine the volume of surgical intervention, character of postoperative restorative management and allow the prognosis of treatment outcome. In this respect, magnetic++-resonance tomography is a valuable supplementary diagnostic method.
