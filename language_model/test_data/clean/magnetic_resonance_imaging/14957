Rotator cuff pathology accounts for most presentations of shoulder pain to primary care clinics. History and physical examination are important for excluding other causes of shoulder pain, while imaging assists in confirming the diagnosis and defining the severity of the abnormality. Treatment options include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, subacromial corticosteroid injections, and exercise therapy. Surgical intervention is generally reserved for those failing nonoperative measures and/or healthy, young, and middle-aged adults with full-thickness rotator cuff tears. No surgical technique has proved to be superior. Despite surgery, about 20% of patients experience retears, more likely occurring in those with larger tears.
