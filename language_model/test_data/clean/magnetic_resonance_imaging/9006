A study included 793 epileptic patients. Symptomatic epilepsy caused by initial precipitating injury (IPI) was diagnosed in 151 cases. Evaluation of anamnesis, clinical and neurological examination, routine EEG and/or video-EEG-monitoring and MRI of the brain were carried out. Period of observation was 6 months - 5 years (on average 3 years). Age of IPI was reversely correlated with duration of latent period (LP). High frequency of seizures was correlated with poor effectiveness of treatment. Different types of IPI differed by frequency of seizures, duration of LP and effectiveness of treatment.
