Although neuralgic amyotrophy can selectively affect discrete components of the brachial plexus including individual peripheral nerves, involvement of an individual nerve fascicle is rare. Discrete fascicular musculocutaneous neuropathy as a manifestation of neuralgic amyotrophy has not previously been reported to our knowledge. We report two cases of otherwise typical neuralgic amyotrophy with isolated brachialis muscle wasting. Abnormal spontaneous activity, motor unit remodeling, or both, was observed only in the brachialis muscle. Lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve conduction studies were normal. These cases serve to broaden the spectrum of the clinical presentation of neuralgic amyotrophy.
