Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used for the first time in the preoperative planning for separation of conjoined twins. In these omphalopagus infants, MRI showed normal biliary and cardiovascular structures and demonstrated, in detail, a relatively avascular plane through the liver bridge, which enabled safe separation with minimal blood loss at 3 1/2 months of age. A single MRI study supplied information superior to that obtained with multiple previously available imaging studies. MRI should be an essential part of the preoperative workup of all types of conjoined twins.
