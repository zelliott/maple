Thirteen patients who underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy for nonfunctioning adrenal tumors were compared with seven patients who underwent open adrenalectomy. Although a longer operating time was required for laparoscopic surgery, postoperative recovery was significantly more rapid. Performance of adrenalectomy for nonfunctioning adrenal tumors is controversial, but we cannot exclude the possibility of malignancy and the potential for hormone overproduction by presumably nonfunctioning small tumors. The minimally invasive nature of laparoscopic surgery may widen the indications for adrenalectomy in patients with nonfunctioning adrenal tumors.
