Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with multi-planar, gated Half-Fourier Acquisition Single-Shot Turbo Spin-Echo (HASTE) imaging was performed to evaluate a woman with dysrhythmia. MR examination for right ventricular dysplasia revealed a Morgagni hernia. The HASTE images depicted well the diaphragmatic defect and the organs involved, yielding valuable diagnostic and pre-operative information. HASTE imaging may be beneficial in the evaluation of Morgagni hernia.
