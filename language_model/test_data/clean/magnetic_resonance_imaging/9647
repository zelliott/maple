Parturition increases the risk of strokes of various types, including postpartum cerebral angiopathy (PCA), which is characterized by reversible multifocal vasoconstriction of the cerebral arteries. We describe an unusual presentation of PCA associated with postpartum non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A 31-year-old multiparous woman complained of sudden headache 3 hours after an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. She had no history of pregnancy-induced hypertension. SAH was found over the bilateral frontoparietal convexities with multifocal vasculopathy. Her symptoms resolved completely within 1 week. The findings of a follow-up neurological examination, cerebral angiography, and brain MRI were normal after 2 months. PCA syndrome may be associated with postpartum non-aneurysmal SAH.
