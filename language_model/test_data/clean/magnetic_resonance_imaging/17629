The typical presentation of breast cancer in a young woman is discussed. Diagnostic imaging of the breast showed the presence of an extensive pathological area, approximately 5 cm in size, at the level of the upper quadrants of left breast. On mammography the pathological sign was represented by numerous regional granular microcalcifications. On sonography an inhomogeneously hypoechoic area with intralesional hyperechoic spots was identified. On MRI a large area of pathological enhancement was visualized. For the tumor extent and the patient's young age neoadjuvant chemotherapy was performed. Post-treatment assessment showed good response to therapy, suggestive of possible better prognosis.
