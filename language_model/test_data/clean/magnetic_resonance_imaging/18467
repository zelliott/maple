A 34-year-old woman had three tonico-clonic seizures and aphasia revealing a left prerolandic infarct. Three weeks later, she began to develop psychiatric symptoms leading to the diagnosis of chronic hallucination psychosis. These symptoms were probably related to epilepsy and their cause was compatible with the diagnosis of interictal psychosis. It has been suggested that kindling of the mesolimbic system could account for psychosis in epilepsy. In our case, however, the sort time interval between the onset of epilepsy and the appearance of psychosis is not in favour of this mechanism.
