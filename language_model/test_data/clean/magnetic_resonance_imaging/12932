We report the case of a 32-year-old man with an epidermoid tumor of the fourth ventricle. About 14 years later, he showed a tumor recurrence which was removed. After this procedure the patient complained of presyncopal and syncopal crisis while attempting to stand or walk. On examination, severe orthostatic hypotension was confirmed and autonomic tests were abnormal. The brain MRI showed a tetraventricular hydrocephalus predominating in the fourth ventricle. A ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was performed, and after surgery the orthostatic intolerance improved. We believe that hydrocephalus has probably been a contributory factor to orthostatic hypotension, and suggest expanding testing for dysautonomia in patients with hydrocephalus.
