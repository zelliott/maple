Proton localized Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain allows the non invasive detection of intracellular cerebral metabolites. Localized MRS has been performed using short stimulated-echo times in various neurological diseases including stroke, multiple sclerosis, and AIDS-related leukoencephalopathies. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine the critical parameters defining the metabolic profile of normal and diseased brain. PCA clearly differentiates the demyelinating processes from ischaemic lesions and leukoencephalopathies. Localized MRS of the brain appears growingly as a tool of choice to discriminate, quantitate and assess cerebral metabolic damage in patients with neurological disorders.
