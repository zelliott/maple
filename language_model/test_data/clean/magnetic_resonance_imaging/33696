The authors have developed a hypermedia program for creating a tutorial of CT and MR anatomy of the upper abdomen. The program was created on a Mcintosh computer, with the Supercard software: it is made up of a series of windows, each of them containing images, texts, schematic representations and sound. Moreover, each window contains buttons which are activated with the mouse and allow different kinds of function, all created by the authors to be displayed. In particular, navigation buttons allow the users to move in the program either sequentially or non-linearly, according to their needs. The possibility of obtaining information and schematic representations is given by specific buttons. There are also multiple buttons hidden in the images which, when activated, allow the name of the selected organ to be displayed. In conclusion, this program can be especially helpful since it allows different data sets to be integrated to provide the user with complete information. Moreover, the program allows learning to be controlled, that is the user to be informed on timing and methods for more effective studying.
