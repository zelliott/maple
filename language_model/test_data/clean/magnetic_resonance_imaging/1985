Various neurological pictures attributed to human toxocariasis are sparsely reported in the literature. A case of toxocaral infection presenting as meningoradiculitis is described herewith. Etiological diagnosis was oriented by the finding of an eosinophilia in the spinal fluid, then confirmed by the result of the immunodiagnosis of toxocariasis from both serum and spinal fluid.
