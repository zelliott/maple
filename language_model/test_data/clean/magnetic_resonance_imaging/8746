Tarsometatarsal joint injuries are well described in adults. In children, these injuries have been less described and have been reported only as small case series. They frequently go unrecognized in children because of skeletal immaturity and lack of awareness among health care providers. However, these injuries if untreated can result in significant pain and deformity in children. It is important that treating physicians recognize the symptoms and signs of these injuries and initiate further diagnostic workup, especially when there is persistent foot pain in the absence of radiographic signs of a fracture. We present a case of an 11-month-old female infant who presented with foot pain after a fall.
