We report the MRI features of two cases of unicornuate uterus and occluded rudimentary horn. In one patient pregnancy had occurred in the occluded horn, prompting to urgent resection. The second patient illustrates more conventional findings in occluded rudimentary horn. In both cases MRI was able to correctly characterise the nature of the developmental anomaly. Furthermore, on the basis of signal intensities, differentiation between distended lumen due to blood accumulation and amniotic sac in the case of pregnancy could be made. Because of its high accuracy in determining the type of anomaly present, the lack of ionizing radiation, and the ability to evaluate, with the exception of the fallopian tubes, the entire genitourinary tract, MR imaging is essential and plays a key role in the evaluation of women who are consulting for infertility.
