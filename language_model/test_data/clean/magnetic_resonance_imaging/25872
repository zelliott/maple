Twenty-one patients with initial stage Legg-Calve-Perthes (LCP) disease were examined by three-phase bone scintigraphy, single photon emission scintigraphy (SPECT), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. On dynamic study, increased activity was present in the epiphysis or the growth plate in 39%; the corresponding figure for blood-pool images was 94%. Pinhole images demonstrated the lateral stripe of revascularization in 57% of patients. Decreased signal intensity in the epiphysis on T1-weighted images proved to be the most sensitive indicator of epiphyseal necrosis on MR imaging and was absent in only 10% of the cases. The subchondral fracture occurred in 62% (including the above 10% of cases), identified by T1-weighted image. Cartilaginous hypertrophy, detected by T1-weighted image, had a high incidence (81%). Joint effusion was identified on T2-weighted images in 90% of patients. The cross-sectional views provided by SPECT and MR imaging permits a better appreciation of the extent of epiphyseal necrosis in LCP disease.
