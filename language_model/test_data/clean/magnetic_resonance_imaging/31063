Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a proposed cliniconeuroradiological entity characterized by headache, altered mental status, cortical blindness, seizures, and other focal neurological signs, and a diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging picture. A variety of different etiologies have been reported like hypertension, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, cyclosporin A or tacrolimus neurotoxicity, uraemia and porphyria. With early diagnosis and prompt treatment, the syndrome is usually fully reversible. We report a case of recurrent PRES of unknown aetiology following intensive care unit treatment and only moderately elevated blood pressure. Clinicians as well as radiologists must be familiar with this clinically frightening, underdiagnosed condition to assure timely diagnosis and treatment to prevent persistent deficits.
