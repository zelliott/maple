To investigate the utility of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging for diagnosing multiple system atrophy-parkinsonism (MSA-P).

We retrospectively evaluated 49 subjects (19 with MSA-P including 11 with early-stage disease, 15 with Parkinson's disease and 15 matched controls) in order to compare the diagnostic value of FLAIR imaging to detect a hyperintense putaminal rim (HPR) with that of T(2)-weighted (T2W) imaging.

Compared with T2W imaging, FLAIR imaging detected HPR more conspicuously in the 19 MSA-P patients (p = 0.01); this trend was also observed in 11 early-stage MSA-P patients (p = 0.01). Furthermore, FLAIR imaging tended to increase sensitivity of detecting HPR compared with T2W imaging (all patients: 89 vs. 58%, p = 0.07; early-stage patients: 100 vs. 55%, p = 0.06).

FLAIR imaging might be more useful for detecting HPR in MSA-P patients, even though they are at an early stage.
