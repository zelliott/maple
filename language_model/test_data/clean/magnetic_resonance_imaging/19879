We report a case of acquired abducens-oculomotor synkinesis, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and abducens nerve palsy following brainstem hemorrhage. Weakening surgery on the medial rectus muscle did not eliminate the synergistic movement. The mechanism responsible for the abducens-oculomotor synkinesis is discussed.
