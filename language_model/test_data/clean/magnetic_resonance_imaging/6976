Multiple sclerosis (MS) is believed to be an autoimmune disease of the human central nervous system mediated by autoreactive T cells. Interferon-beta1b (IFN-beta1b) has been shown to be effective in reducing disease activity defined by clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) criteria in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Yet, the exact mechanisms by which these benefits are achieved remain unknown. CD45RA is a marker for naive T lymphocytes and intercellular adhesion molecule-3 (ICAM-3) is expressed on resting lymphocytes.

Forty-eight patients with RRMS, 24 of them treated with recombinant IFN-beta1b and 24 untreated, were enrolled in this prospective study over 18 months. We investigated the percentage of CD45RA+ ICAM-3+ cells within the total lymphocyte subset in the peripheral blood serially every 3 months and in CSF once at baseline. Detailed clinical examination including Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was performed every 3 months and cranial MRI scans were assessed every 6 months.

We found a temporary increase in the CD45RA+ ICAM-3+ lymphocyte ratio in peripheral blood of both untreated and IFN-beta1b-treated RRMS patients. Moreover, we determined a significant negative correlation (r = -0.5874; P < 0.01) between age as well as the EDSS score (r = -0.3629; P < 0.05) and the percentages of CD45RA+ ICAM-3+ lymphocytes in peripheral blood but a positive correlation between EDSS score and the CD45RA+ ICAM-3+ ratio (r = 0.3913; P < 0.05) in the CSF at baseline.

CD45RA+ ICAM-3+ lymphocyte ratio in peripheral blood might indicate immunosenescence in MS. However, from our data it cannot be finally concluded whether it is also influenced by IFN-beta1b treatment.
