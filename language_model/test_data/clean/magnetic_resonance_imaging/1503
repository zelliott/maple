The effect of the inhalation of pure oxygen on the kidney was evaluated by measuring monoexponential T1 and T2* relaxation times in nine volunteers using a multiple-shot turbo spin echo and multiple echo gradient echo sequences, respectively. The T1 of the renal cortex decreased significantly when breathing pure oxygen as compared to normoxia (from 882 +/- 59 to 829 +/- 70 msec, P < 0.05), while that of the renal medulla was unchanged. No significant changes were seen in the T2* of either compartment. Dynamic imaging using an inversion recovery sequence with an optimized inversion time typically produced signal changes of 20% in the renal cortex. Studies to assess if oxygen-induced changes in flow contributed to this effect showed that the flow contribution was not significant. Although longer inversion times (880 ms) produced optimal contrast, acceptable contrast was also obtained at shorter inversion times (450 msec) in the renal cortex, spleen, and lung, with the latter being of opposite polarity to the other two tissues, implying a shorter parenchymal T1 than previously reported in the literature. The results are consistent with oxygen acting as an intravascular contrast agent which induces a shortening of T1 in the arterial blood volume.
