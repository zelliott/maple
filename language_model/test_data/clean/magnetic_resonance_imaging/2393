Cabergoline (CAB), a long-lasting dopamine-agonist, specific for the D2 receptor, is effective in normalizing serum PRL levels in most patients with microprolactinoma or idiopathic hyperprolactinemia. Because few data are presently available on the effects of CAB treatment in macroprolactinomas, the aim of this open-label study was to investigate whether this drug was effective in producing tumor shrinkage, as well as in normalizing PRL levels. Twenty-three patients with macroprolactinoma entered this study 15 patients had had no treatment, whereas the remaining 8 patients had been previously treated with bromocriptine, which was with-drawn because of intolerance. Three of 23 patients had undergone unsuccessful surgery. Pretreatment serum PRL levels ranged from 100-3860 micrograms/L. CAB was administered at a dose of 0.5-3 mg once or twice a week for 12-24 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed before and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the beginning of treatment, to evaluate tumor shrinkage, defined as a decrease of at least 80% of baseline tumor volume. After 3-6 months of treatment with a low dose (0.5-1 mg/week), serum PRL levels normalized in 18 patients. In the remaining 5 patients, whose serum PRL levels were not normalized, the dose was increased to 2-3 mg/week. This schedule caused the normalization of PRL levels in 1 patient, whereas in the remaining 4 patients, PRL levels were reduced to 30-82 micrograms/L. A tumor volume reduction greater than 80% at MRI occurred in 14 of 23 patients (61%) after CAB treatment (from 2609.4 +/- 534.7 to 530.1 +/- 141.3 mm3 at the 12-24th month follow-up, P < 0.001). A volume reduction of 41.8 +/- 3.4% was already evident after 3 months (1436 +/- 285.9 mm3; P < 0.001). The complete disappearance of the tumor mass at MRI occurred after 6 months of treatment with CAB in 1 patient, and in 5 patients after 1 yr of treatment. An improvement of visual field defects was obtained in 9 of the 10 patients presenting visual impairment before CAB treatment. The drug was tolerated well by all patients. Only 1 patient experienced mild nausea, which disappeared spontaneously after the 2nd day of treatment. Long-term, a low dose of the D2 receptor agonist CAB significantly reduced tumor volume and normalized serum PRL levels in a great majority of patients bearing macroprolactinoma. This treatment met with excellent patient compliance. This study suggests that CAB can be used as a first choice drug treatment in macroprolactinomas, as already shown for microprolactinomas and idiopathic hyperprolactinemia.
