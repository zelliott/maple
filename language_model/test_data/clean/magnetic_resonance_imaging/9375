Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the brainstem yield a high risk of hemorrhage. Although stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is accepted, because of high surgical morbidity and mortality, outcomes are still unclear.

We previously reported the early results of SRS for brainstem AVMs. Here, we obtained data from a longer follow-up for a larger number of patients and present precise outcomes based on the latest follow-up data.

Forty-four patients with brainstem AVMs were treated by SRS. Outcomes such as the rates of obliteration, hemorrhage after treatment, and adverse effects were retrospectively analyzed.

The annual hemorrhage rate before SRS was 17.5%. The mean follow-up period after SRS was 71 months (range, 2-168 months). The actuarial obliteration rate confirmed by angiography was 52% at 5 years. Factors associated with higher obliteration rate were previous hemorrhage (P = .048) and higher margin dose (P = .048). For patients treated with a margin dose of â‰¥ 18 Gy, the obliteration rate was 71% at 5 years. Persistent worsening of neurological symptoms was observed in 5%. The annual hemorrhage rate after SRS was 2.4%. Four patients died of rebleeding, and disease-specific survival rate was 86% at 10 years after treatment.

Nidus obliteration must be achieved for brainstem AVMs because they possibly cause lethal hemorrhage even after SRS. Treatment with a high margin dose is desirable to obtain favorable outcomes for these lesions. Additional treatment should be considered for an incompletely obliterated nidus.
