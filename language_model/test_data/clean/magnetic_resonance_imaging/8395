A 110 kDa (ca. 5 nm in diameter) bivalent paramagnetic nanoprobe for detecting cell death using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is described, in which two biotinylated C2A domains of the protein synaptotagmin-I were complexed with a single avidin molecule, which had been labeled with gadolinium chelates. This nanoprobe bound with high affinity and specificity to the phosphatidylserine exposed by dying cells and was demonstrated to allow MRI detection of apoptotic tumor cells in vitro.
