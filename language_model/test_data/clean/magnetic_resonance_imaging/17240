Paragangliomas of the orbit are extremely rare tumors. We report a well-documented case of orbital paraganglioma in a 45-year-old man who presented with proptosis and decreased vision. The patient underwent complete excision of the tumor with preservation of orbital structures. There was total regression of symptoms after surgery and vision was well maintained.

Radiological and pathological features are described and differential diagnoses of this entity are discussed.
