Increasing neck pain in a 29 year old woman after a frontal car collision gave reason for a conventional x-ray that presented a traumatically displaced os odontoideum positioned at the top of the dens axis. No neurological defect was seen. Dynamic flexion/extension film showed a movement to an atlantoaxial dislocation with a shift of the os odontoideum. The sclerotic structure of the corresponding bony surfaces was confirmed by computed tomography, whereas magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a posttraumatic signal change in front of the base of dens axis and os odontoideum. Fusion was achieved by computed navigation with C1/C2 transfacetal screws as described by Magerl and interspinal fusion with a bicortical autologous iliac crest graft and a posterior tension band as described by Brooks. An exact positioning of screws past the asymmetric course of both arteria vertebrales was possible by navigation. The patient was free of pain 5 months after the fusion.
