It was the aim of this study to quantify the measurement of pulsatile flow in the renal artery with the noninvasive magnetic resonance cine phase-contrast (MRCPC) method and combine it with the simultaneous assessment of pulsatile flow with a transit-time ultrasound (TTUS) flowmeter. In seven foxhounds with a chronically implanted precalibrated TTUS flow probe, MRCPC flow measurements were made in the renal artery with a temporal resolution of 32 ms. Mean and pulsatile flow signal were compared by the simultaneous ipsi- or contralateral measurement of the renal blood flow signal by both methods (TTUS and MRCPC). In addition, comparative MRCPC and TTUS flow measurements were made with artificial renal artery stenosis and after the administration of angiotensin II. The mean flow data assessed by the noninvasive MRCPC flow measurements showed an excellent correlation with corresponding TTUS recording (r = 0.99). The MRCPC flow signal displayed a waveform of the renal artery flow profile that was very similar to the TTUS flow pulse. The hemodynamic changes induced by angiotensin II or due to renal artery stenosis were also reliably detected by MRCPC. MRCPC provides a reliable noninvasive method for the quantification of mean blood flow and the assessment of the pulsatile flow signal in the renal artery and proves to be sensitive to hemodynamic changes of pathophysiological importance. Alternatively, the method may be used for studies in physiology that demand a noninvasive approach.
