Primary diseases of the seminal vesicle are rare. Most seminal vesicle cysts are congenital, and two-thirds are associated with renal dysplasia or agenesis and ectopic ureter opening into the seminal vesicle. Acquired cysts may be due to genitourinary infections, surgical prostate resection or ejaculatory duct lithiasis. We report a case of video laparoscopic ablation of seminal vesicle cysts.
