Carcinoid metastases in the liver are typically solid, hypervascular lesions. We report 3 cases of cystic carcinoid tumors in the liver with radiographic findings. Two were metastatic from primary carcinoid tumors of the small intestine and one was not associated with any extra hepatic lesion at presentation or during 5 years of subsequent follow-up.
