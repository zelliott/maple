To correlate clinical features, imaging and pathologic findings in recurrent Solitary Fibrous Tumor of the orbit (SFT) in order to predict long-term behavior.

Clinical features, imaging and pathologic findings of three patients with biopsy proven SFT are reported. Demographic and clinical features were recorded at presentation and at each consultation; imaging was performed as a diagnostic tool and for follow-up. A biopsy was performed at presentation and subsequently when symptoms worsened. Pathology specimens were reviewed retrospectively to corroborate diagnosis. Intraoperative and histopathologic features were recorded. A correlation was made between clinical, imaging and pathologic results to identify outcome predictors of recurrence, locally aggressive behavior and malignant transformation.

All cases presented recurrent tumors with locally aggressive behavior over time. All were women in the fifth decade of life. Tumors induced proptosis, swelling of the lids and eye displacement at presentation and were diagnosed as other types of collagen-rich tumors before CD34 immunohistochemistry was available. Mean follow-up was 26.6 years (range 12-37). Relevant findings for all cases included a heterogeneous, irregular tumor containing cystoid spaces filled with mucoid material diffusely enhancing with imaging techniques. Intraoperative findings included a gelatinous matrix within the center of the tumor mass, which was not present at primary resection. Histopathology could not detect specific cellular patterns or immunological markers related to these changes.

Recurrence and locally aggressive behavior was better predicted by imaging and surgical findings rather than histopathological characteristics. Cystoid degeneration in recurrent tumors may suggest malignant transformation over time.
