Cerebral ischemia and infarction, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral venous thrombosis, and cerebral vasculitis are dreaded but largely uncommon complications of most rheumatic diseases.

A format for approaching the patient and localizing the cerebrovascular lesion has been presented along with a summary of the specific rheumatologic diseases implicated for each stroke subtype.
