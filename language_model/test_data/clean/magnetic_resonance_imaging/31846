Patients with pathological laughter and crying have episodes of uncontrollable laughter, crying or both. Pathological laughter is a well-described entity secondary to various conditions such as multiple sclerosis, pseudo-bulbar palsy, cerebello-pontine angle tumours, clival chordomas and brainstem gliomas. Pathological crying is rare and there have been no previous reports of brainstem compression causing this entity. We report a patient who presented with pathological crying caused by a trigeminal schwannoma with a tumor-associated cyst indenting the pons. This case report confirms the involvement of the cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathways in the pathogenesis of pathological crying.
