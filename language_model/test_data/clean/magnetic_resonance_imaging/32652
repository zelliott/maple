Of 67 consecutive patients with spontaneous CSF hypovolemia (SCH), 11 (16.4%) had subdural hematoma (SDH). Patients with SDH were older (p = 0.005), more likely to be male (p = 0.035), and displayed longer time to diagnosis of SCH (p = 0.019) than those without SDH. All patients with SDH showed the findings of pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage on CT and responded favorably to epidural blood patches and neurosurgical drainage.
