The syndrome of syringomyelia in children has been extensively described in the literature and is said to most commonly involve the cervical and thoracic spinal cord. We here present two children who had an unusual constellation of signs and symptoms, characterized by bowel and bladder disturbance in one, and in the other with intermittent paroxysmal severe pain and cramping and flexion of the lower extremities accompanied at times by episodes of incontinence. Both were found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to have a syrinx localized to the most distal cord. This was not associated with Arnold-Chiari malformation, trauma, tumors or any other form of spinal dysraphism. Both patients underwent placement of a syringomyelia-peritoneal shunt with complete resolution of symptomatology. Postoperative MRI revealed a complete collapse of the syringomyelia cavity. In those children presenting with bowel or bladder disturbances, associated or not with intermittent pain, flexion attacks, or cramping in the lower extremities, the differential diagnosis of a syringomyelia of the distal cord should be part of the clinical considerations.
