In general, orbital augmentation to correct enophthalmos is pursued to prevent or address an aesthetic deformity. In some cases, however, functional deficits may accompany enophthalmos and may serve as an indication for surgical intervention. The authors describe a series of patients with such deficits.

A retrospective review at a tertiary health care center of all patients with enophthalmos was conducted to identify a subset of cases in which the enophthalmos was associated with nonaesthetic, functional deficits that could not be attributed to muscular or neural dysfunction, or soft tissue scarring.

Six patients with either traumatic enophthalmos (orbital fractures) or non-traumatic enophthalmos (sinus disease and orbital soft tissue atrophy) demonstrated nonaesthetic ocular dysfunction, including gaze-evoked diplopia, eyelid retraction, lagophthalmos, and exposure keratitis. The symptoms and signs resolved in the three patients who underwent orbital augmentation.

In some patients with enophthalmos and globe ptosis, globe malposition may alter the underlying eyelid mechanics or extraocular muscle alignment, resulting in functional as well as aesthetic problems. In these patients, restoring the native orbital anatomy through orbital augmentation can reverse eyelid malposition, ocular surface exposure, and symptomatic diplopia, avoiding the need for eyelid or strabismus surgery.
