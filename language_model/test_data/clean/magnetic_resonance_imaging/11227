Synovial cyst of the proximal tibiofibular joint is a very rare condition, for which there is no consensus regarding treatment.

We present three patients who had synovial cysts of proximal tibiofibular joint that caused peroneal nerve palsy. We discuss the special features of synovial cysts and review the literature.

We consider the best treatment of synovial cysts originating from proximal tibiofibular joint and causing peroneal nerve palsy to be total surgical removal as soon as possible after the diagnosis is made. It should be kept in mind that despite surgical treatment the neurological symptoms may not recover.
