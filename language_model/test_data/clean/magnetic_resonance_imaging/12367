Libman-Sacks endocarditis is a non-infectious valvular damage associated with autoimmune disorders such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Antiphospholipid Syndrome. We report a 17-year-old female consulting in the emergency room due to a right hemiparesis and aphasia. A magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple infarctions in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery, presumably of embolic origin. A trans-esophageal echocardiogram showed a vegetation in the mitral valve. Blood cultures were negative. Antinuclear antibodies and serological tests for antiphospholipid syndrome were positive. Oral anticoagulation was started and the patient was discharged. After six months of follow up, antiphospholipid antibodies are still positive.
