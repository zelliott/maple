The PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) is a central radiologic image archiving system coupled with an information system which allows rapid access to these images. It permits rapid access of the entire file of radiologic images of a patient for radiologists and clinicians. After installation of an MRI and CT scan unit at the IGR, a PACS system was installed in July, 2000. The preparation phase and characteristics of the PACS system at the IGR are described here. The data in the literature and the short experience of the PACS system at the IGR show benefits of this system at several levels: improved efficiency (for technicians, radiologists, and secretaries), improved image quality and interpretation, improved clinical management of patients resulting from more timely image interpretation and execution of clinical decisions, increased ease of image transfer for tele-imagery, and improved teaching and publication possibilities. The PACS significantly modifies work habits since the interpretation and consultation of images is done exclusively at the console and progressively obviates the need for actual films.
