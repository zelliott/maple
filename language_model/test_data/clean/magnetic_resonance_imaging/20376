Craniospinal hyper- or hypotension leads to morphologic changes in certain intracranial structures. We tested the hypothesis that the amount of CSF in the ONS visible in MR imaging is reduced in patients with CSH.

Nineteen patients with CSH were prospectively studied. Three readers assessed the width of the peri-optical CSF rim at 4 different anatomic positions by using coronal STIR sequences from a 3T MR imaging scanner. The height of the pituitary gland was also measured. Results were compared with normal values obtained with the same imaging technique. Qualitative signs of CSH also recorded were engorgement of venous sinuses, dural enhancement, subdural effusion, narrow ventricles, and sagging brain.

CSF signal intensity surrounding the optic nerves was diminished in at least 2 of the 4 positions used for measurements so that decreased diameters of the ONSs were observed in all patients (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 97%). The height of the pituitary gland was above normal limits in 12 of 19 patients (sensitivity, 63%; specificity, 97%). Frequencies of qualitative signs of CSH varied from 32% to 81%.

The ISSON in patients with CSH is partially or fully collapsed due to reduced CSF content. In comparison with other anatomic markers, this sign showed the highest sensitivity for the diagnosis of patients with CSH in this study.
