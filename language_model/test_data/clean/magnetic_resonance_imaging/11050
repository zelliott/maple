The purpose of this study was to compare the relationship between the actual amnionic fluid volume that was measured at delivery and magnetic resonance amnionic fluid volume determination, largest vertical pocket, and amnionic fluid index.

Three hours before cesarean delivery, 80 women had sonographic measurement of the amnionic fluid index and the largest vertical pocket. Magnetic resonance imaging was then completed, and the magnetic resonance amnionic fluid volume was determined. At surgery, the amnionic fluid was collected. Pearson correlations were determined. Receiver operating characteristic curves were developed for each method as a measure of predictability for oligohydramnios.

The correlations for the magnetic resonance amnionic fluid volume, amnionic fluid index, and largest vertical pocket to amnionic fluid volume was 0.84, 0.77, and 0.71, respectively. Magnetic resonance amnionic fluid volume has a statistically higher correlation than the largest vertical pocket ( P = .046). The 3 methods, however, are statistically comparable for identifying oligohydramnios.

Magnetic resonance imaging is comparable with ultrasound evaluation for the prediction of oligohydramnios. Correlations to actual amnionic fluid volume are also comparable.
