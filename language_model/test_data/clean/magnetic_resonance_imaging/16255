Fractures of the forearm in children represent one of the most frequent injuries. Most are monotraumatic occurring during sport or leisure activities. Diagnosis can be made by conventional X-ray examination in 2 planes. Distal forearm fractures are classified into epiphyseolysis and epiphyseal fractures, metaphyseal greenstick and buckle fractures, complete distal radius and forearm fractures as well as Galeazzi lesions. The vast majority of cases without relevant dislocation can be treated with immobilization employing a cast. The remaining fractures have to be repositioned and restored depending on age and degree of dislocation.The state of the art in surgical therapy is the Kirschner wire osteosynthesis after closed reduction. Especially meta-diaphyseal fractures can alternatively be stabilized with plate osteosynthesis or external fixation. Following these therapeutic principles, prognosis is excellent and most of the injuries heal without any functional impairment.
