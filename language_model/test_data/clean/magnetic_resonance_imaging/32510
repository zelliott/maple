The thawing process for boiled and frozen edible vegetables was traced by a dedicated MRI for food research. The MRI system is small, with a 1.0-T static magnetic field, and can be placed in an ordinary research room with a light air conditioner. Images of green soybeans, broad beans, okra, asparagus and taro were measured by the spin-echo method (echo time=7 ms) with 0.1 or 0.2 s and 1 s repetition times. The images appeared along with the thawing time, and signals uniformly covered the sliced plane of the samples in the thawed condition. Information about the thawing process and tissue structures of the materials was obtained during transit thawing conditions. The thawing kinetics were examined with increased signal intensity, which were divided into two types. The signal increased linearly and saturated for okra and asparagus but exhibited convex curves for soybeans, broad beans and taro. The small MRI was stable, its handling was simple, and the internal structures of food materials could be accurately identified, although the grey-scale of the images was insufficient for determining precise textural fluctuations of tissue organization. We conclude that the devised MRI is useful for examining the quality of frozen foods and for developmental research into frozen foods.
