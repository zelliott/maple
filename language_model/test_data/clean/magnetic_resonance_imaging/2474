To date, cortical regions activated by olfactory stimulation have not been identified precisely in humans. In this study we used magnetic source imaging to localize neuronal activity following olfactory stimulation with two odorants, hydrogen sulphide and vanillin. Peak latencies of the olfactory event-related magnetic fields corresponded to the ascending and descending slopes of the major deflections of the olfactory event-related potentials (OERP). At these latencies we obtained consistent activation of the anterior-central parts of the insula (agranular-periallocortical and dysgranular regions) the parainsular cortex and the superior temporal sulcus. No reproducible equivalent current dipoles were found in other brain areas, including the orbitofrontal cortex. For the first time, brain areas were identified that generate most components of olfactory bioresponses (OERPs) in humans.
