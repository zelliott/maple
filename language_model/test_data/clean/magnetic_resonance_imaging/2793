Despite recent diagnostic advances, the laryngopharynx remains an area where accurate assessment of tumor size and extent is difficult. Computed tomography has proven helpful in delineating lesions in these areas, yet significant limitations exist. In an attempt to more accurately evaluate laryngopharyngeal neoplasms, MR imaging was performed in 25 consecutive patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx and hypopharynx. Mr imaging was analyzed for its utility in clinical staging, assistance in selection of candidates for conservation, Laryngeal surgery, and ability to reliably predict cartilage invasion. MR imaging improved the accuracy of tumor staging by 40% and was valuable in the selection of candidates for conservation surgery. In addition, MR imaging was able to predict cartilage invasion in 6 of 6 patients with pathologic confirmation with a single false-positive case. MR imaging appears to be a reliable indicator of tumor size and location and should be judiciously incorporated into the staging and pretreatment planning of patients presenting with laryngopharyngeal malignancies.
