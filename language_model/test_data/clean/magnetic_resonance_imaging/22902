In compliance with institutional regulations for care and use of laboratory animals, the aim of this study was to establish and characterize a rodent liver tumor model to provide a platform for preclinical assessment of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. A rhabdomyosarcoma tumor was implanted in the right and left liver lobes of 20 rats, for a total of 40 tumors. T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images, diffusion-weighted images, and dynamic susceptibility contrast agent-enhanced perfusion-weighted images were obtained up to 16 days after tumor implantation and were compared with postmortem three-dimensional computed tomographic (CT) images, digital microangiograms, and histopathologic findings. Fifteen tumors were examined with proton ((1)H) MR spectroscopy. All tumors grew, with a mean volume doubling time of 2.2 days +/- 0.9 (standard deviation) and a final size of 591 mm(3)+/- 124. The rhabdomyosarcoma tumor showed hypervascularity at MR imaging, three-dimensional CT, microangiography, and histologic analysis. On dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced perfusion-weighted images, the maximum signal intensity decrease differed in time and extent between the tumor and the liver, with a significantly (P < .001) higher relative blood volume, relative blood flow, and permeability value in the tumor than in the liver. With (1)H MR spectroscopy, the rhabdomyosarcoma tumor and the liver featured significant (P < .001) choline and lipid peaks, respectively. Implantation of a rhabdomyosarcoma tumor in the livers of rats is feasible and reproducible, and this animal model seems promising for future testing of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
