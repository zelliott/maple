Recently, the assessment of the muscles using limb MRI and whole body MRI has become widely available and more frequent. In cases of muscular dystrophies it may help to select the optimal muscles for biopsy, because the severely atrophic and degenerated muscles are not suitable for histological tests. It is also known that the pattern of muscle involvement is characteristic for a certain neuromuscular disease, and clinically silent muscle damage can be visualized, as well. Therefore, imaging of muscles is helpful in neuromuscular differential diagnosis and planning genetic tests.
