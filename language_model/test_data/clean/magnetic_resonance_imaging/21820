Primary pulmonary neoplasia in youth is uncommon, but malignant entities of varied histology predominate. A case of primary inflammatory pulmonary pseudotumor of the lung in an adolescent with a huge lung mass is presented. This finding represents the preponderance of benign lung neoplasms found in children and adolescents and must be considered when only inflammatory cells are recovered at bronchoscopy.
