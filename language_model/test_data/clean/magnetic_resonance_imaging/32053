We report on 4 boys from 3 families presenting initially in infancy with an acute onset of flaccid tetraparesis and areflexia, resembling Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS). However, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein was normal, while serum and CSF lactate were elevated. All patients had recurrent similar episodes, usually associated with infections. Brain MRI showed T (2) hyperintensities in the basal ganglia in two boys, in one of them at the first clinical presentation; the other one had a normal brain MRI during the first episode. A third boy had a normal MRI twice but an increased lactate peak in the basal ganglia in (1)H-MR spectroscopy. Motor nerve conduction velocities (NCV) were normal in all patients. Biochemical analyses of muscle tissue, performed in two patients, revealed a deficiency of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Molecular genetic analysis of the X-chromosomal E1alpha subunit of PDH showed three new mutations in phylogenetically conserved areas of the protein: Glu358Lys in patient 1; Arg88Lys in patient 2 and 3 (brothers); and Leu216Ser in patient 4. In conclusion, children with "atypical GBS" should be evaluated for a mitochondrial disorder, including pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, even after a first episode.
