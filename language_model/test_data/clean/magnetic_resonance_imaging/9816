The incidence of invasive aspergillosis has increased after solid organ transplant. However, aspergillus osteomyelitis in vertebrae is rare. We report a case of aspergillus spondylodiskitis after pulmonary aspergillosis in a renal transplant recipient. He was treated by antifungal therapy and surgical intervention. The transplantist should be alert for a diagnosis of aspergillus spondylodiskitis in recipients who developed back pain after aspergillosis infection in other sites.
