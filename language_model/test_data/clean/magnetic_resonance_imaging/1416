This report deals with five observations of tracheobronchial, pleuropulmonary and mediastinal amyloidosis. Exploration was performed with plain radiographs, computed tomography in three cases, and magnetic resonance imaging in one case of tracheobronchial and interstitial amyloidosis. After their review of literature, the authors describe the main features of extracardiac thoracic amyloidosis observed with imaging and establish the contribution of the various techniques to the diagnosis and follow-up of the disease.
