Baló's concentric sclerosis is a demyelinating disorder in which bands of demyelination alternate with concentric bands of myelin preservation. The pathogenesis of the lesion is unknown. Previous reports using modern histopathologic techniques have shown the bands of myelin preservation to be comprised of remyelinated or partially demyelinated myelin. Here we report a case of Baló's concentric sclerosis in a 24-year-old East Indian patient with a previous history of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Pathologically, the bands of myelin preservation showed myelin sheaths of normal thickness, with focal areas of demyelination. The findings, taken together with those of previously reported cases, suggest that Baló's concentric sclerosis is a variant of MS, and the concentric lesion may be an intermediary form in evolution of a chronic active MS plaque. The pathogenesis of this concentric lesion may be explained by periodic suppression of demyelination in the rapidly expanding border, allowing remyelination or only transient incomplete demyelination to occur.
