The aim of this study was to test an oral contrast solution with maghemite for the magnetic resonance imaging of small bowel diseases.

The study sample included 3 cohorts: 17 healthy volunteers (group A), 22 patients with small bowel disease (group C). Both groups underwent MR enterography and 24 patients with small bowel disease (group B) underwent magnetic resonance cholecystopancreaticography. Various concentrations in 1000 ml vs 500 ml of experimental solution were tested. All cohorts completed questionnaires evaluating the solution characteristics and side-efects during and after drinking.

A maghemite concentration of 800 mg /4 g bentonite in 1000 ml solution was sufficient for proper intraluminal lay-out. An experimental solution of 500 ml was sufficient for magnetic resonance cholecystopancreaticography and 1000 ml for MR enterography. There were no statistically significant differences between groups for taste, taste characteristic or appearance of the experimental solution. Side-effects experienced during drinking were: nausea (29.4%) and eructation (29.4%) in group A, in group B (42%) and diarrhoea (27.3%) in group C. Side-effects 2 h after drinking occured in group A (nausea 17.6%) and in group C (diarrhoea 47%). The best tolerance of experimental solution was found in group B with a higher median patient age than groups A and C. The experimental solution was evaluated more favorably in the older subjects (age over 50 years).

The experimental oral solution with maghemite was well tolerated in all 3 groups. Our study supports its use in magnetic resonance practice.
