Digital images generated by medical imaging form the basis for radiological diagnosis and surgical planning. Despite the advent of the DICOM 3.0 standard for medical image communication, widespread application of the existing information is often limited by incompatibility of the data formatting used by different equipment generations, and the manufacturer-specific standards employed. An exchange interface based on magneto optical discs has been developed to retrieve and present medical image data regardless of the technological hardware and the specific formats used. Specially adapted routines to retrieve the data first had to be developed. A modular program structure was used to allow flexibility in the implementation of further routines and other exchange media. Over 20,000 CT and MRI images including header information obtained from different General Electric and Siemens scanners were extracted successfully from MO discs. The image data were used for follow up and surgical planning and were transferred to a PAC-server. The interface proved reliable and easy to use. Support for further proprietary formats is currently being developed. The present exchange interface permits reliable retrieval of digital images for diagnostic and surgical planning purposes, regardless of the hardware generation and manufacturer-specific formats.
