Since the description in 1940 of Kasabach-Merritt syndrome (KMS) in patients with capillary haemangiomas, several other vascular tumours have been recognised as possible causes of this coagulopathy. The literature suggests a specific histological pattern of vascular tumours responsible for KMS, excluding capillary haemangioma [1]. There is an extensive literature on, haemangiomas accompanied by thrombocytopenia, and imaging of thrombosis in the lesion, especially cavernous haemangioma of the liver. However, no report has described a haemangioma of the mandible in the acute stage of the coagulopathy, or serial examinations of such a lesion. We report the features of a mandible lesion with KMS and discusses the interpretations of the changes observed.
