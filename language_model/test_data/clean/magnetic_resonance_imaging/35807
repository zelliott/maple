Two cases of progressive myelopathy occurring years after incomplete cervical spinal cord injury are presented. In both patients, the clinical features, as well as the "bull's-eye" appearance of the delayed computerized tomography (CT) myelography study and the circumscribed low density of the magnetic resonance image, were consistent with posttraumatic syringomyelia, but surgical exploration including intra-operative spinal sonography failed to reveal a syrinx. Although arachnoiditis was present in both patients, the striking abnormality found at surgery was the softened appearance and the microcystic degeneration of the cord. The microcystic spinal cord degeneration found in these cases represents a previously undescribed cause of late deterioration after spinal cord injury that may mimic the clinical, CT-myelographic, and magnetic resonance features of posttraumatic syringomyelia.
