Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) can manifest with 3 principal intracranial pathological entities: cortical tubers, subependymal nodules (SENs), and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs). The authors analyzed the location and growth of intraventricular lesions in a large cohort of patients with TSC.

After institutional review board protocol approval, the authors retrospectively reviewed brain MRI scans of TSC patients for whom at least 1 electronically stored cranial MRI study was available. Collected data included location, size, and growth over time of all intraventricular lesions.

The authors reviewed 560 scans in 103 patients, who harbored 496 intraventricular lesions. Of the 496 lesions, 157 lesions were located along the caudate-thalamic groove (CTG) in 88 patients. Twenty SEGAs were operated on. The remaining 339 lesions were distributed along the lateral ventricle, always in contact with the course of the caudate nucleus, and were presumed to be SENs. Twenty-two patients with more than 4 years of follow-up had 34 lesions along the CTG, of which 23 were stable in size and 11 grew. All other intraventricular lesions were stable. Seven-Tesla MRI showed the intimate association of SENs and the caudate nucleus in 1 patient.

Intraventricular lesions in TSC patients are located throughout the lateral ventricular wall. Their location exclusively follows the course of the caudate nucleus. Only lesions along the CTG showed the potential to grow, and these were then identified as SEGAs. The remaining lesions were SENs. Understanding why these lesions develop in relation to the caudate nucleus may offer insights into therapy.
