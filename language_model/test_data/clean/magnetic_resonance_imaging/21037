To review the literature on early visual manifestations of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) with regard to two patients who had visual problems preceding the onset of neurological symptoms. One patient had cortical visual disturbances and the other had visual loss due to retinal pigment epithelial changes.

SSPE is a chronic encephalitis characterized by a history of measles infection and a progressive disease of the central nervous system that still occurs frequently in countries with insufficient measles immunization. Visual manifestations can occur as a result of involvement of the pathways that lead from the retina to the occipital cortex during the course of the disease, but are rare as a presenting sign. Fundus changes, especially macular retinitis and macular pigment disturbances, appear to be the most common ocular manifestations of SSPE.

Ophthalmologists must be aware that SSPE can knock their door with ocular findings of SSPE, months or years before the onset of neurological symptoms.
