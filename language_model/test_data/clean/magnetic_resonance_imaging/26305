The aim of this study was to assess whether magnetic resonance imaging could predict the outcome of attempted vaginal delivery in a group of pregnant women whose parturition had to be induced by oxytocin. The signal intensity and morphology alterations in the cervix of 21 full-term pregnant women were analyzed before the induction of parturition. T2-weighted gradient echo sequences were utilized and signal intensity in the cervix was measured from the anterior and posterior lips of the cervix. An index indicating the brightness range of the cervix was formulated to overcome the effects of the individual intensity changes. Imaging features including the signal intensity and the evidence of effacement were correlated with the actual type of delivery performed. Images were also assessed visually by two independent radiologists. Statistical analysis of brightness indexes that were considered to have a predictive value as an indicator for possible delivery was not significant. However, visually assessed signal intensity of the cervix correlated strongly with the type of delivery. Effacement itself was the most reliable parameter in predicting the progress of the delivery. In conclusion, MR imaging seems to be useful for predicting normal parturition in full-term pregnant women who need oxytocin induction. However, the presence of effacement seems to be a more reliable and practical parameter that will be preferred in that prediction.
