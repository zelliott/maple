This study describes the linguistic and neuropsychological findings in three right-handed patients with crossed conduction aphasia. Despite the location of the lesion in the right hemisphere, all patients displayed a combination of linguistic deficits typically found in conduction aphasia following analogous damage to the left hemisphere. Associated cognitive deficits varied across the three patients. In addition, all cases showed deficits classically attributed to non-dominant hemisphere damage (visuoperceptual deficits and reduced figural memory). As a result, lesion-behaviour relationships in our study sample indicate both dominant and non-dominant qualities of the right hemisphere.
