In this retrospective study, 100 recently operated acoustic nerve tumors were reviewed to determine the success of the use of auditory brain stem response (ABR) as cross-check of the medical imaging studies. When the patient had sufficient hearing to obtain a diagnostic ABR (93 patients), the initial ABR was abnormal in 96.7%. However, the initial medical imaging procedure (enhanced computerized axial tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) was positive in 69% of the patients. Thus, it is recommended that the ABR be included in the evaluation of patients suspected of having acoustic nerve tumors to help in the determination of the need for additional studies. This use of the cross-check may speed the time it takes to reach a diagnosis.
