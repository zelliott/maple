A rare case of exophytic hepatic hemangioma preoperatively diagnosed as a non-functioning adrenal tumor is reported. A 62-year-old man was admitted for treatment of primary hyper-parathyroidism and an incidental adrenal tumor. A 4.0 x 2.5 cm heterogeneous tumor located between the liver and the right kidney was detected by abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Color doppler images revealed no apparent blood flow. Since the tumor seemed to have originated from the liver under laparoscopy, an open partial hepatectomy was performed. Histopathological examination revealed cavernous hemangioma of the liver. When diagnosing non-functioning right adrenal tumor, it may be necessary to carefully rule out an exophytic liver tumor.
