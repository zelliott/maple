Magnetic resonance imaging provides the possibility of a non-invasive method for the investigation of the soft tissues of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Between March 1991 and August 1992 we performed static and dynamic magnetic resonance images (MRI) on 47 TMJs of 37 symptomatic patients using a MR-tomograph with a 6.5 cm surface coil. MR diagnosis could be verified in 15 joints at operation and in 3 cases by arthrotomography. Disc position was confirmed in 80%, perforations were missed in 2 out of 3 cases and two more perforations became obvious during operation. One patient refused MR examination, in 2 cases MRI had to be abandoned because of the patient's claustrophobia. In our work we wanted to show that MRI is a reliable tool to determine disc position, disc shape and disc behaviour during motion. Detection of perforations is still the domain of arthrography.
