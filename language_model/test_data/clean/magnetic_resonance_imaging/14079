Arachnoid cysts are developmental anomalies that are most often diagnosed in childhood. They are often discovered as incidental findings found on imaging. Occasionally they may produce symptoms because of expansion or bleeding. There may be underlying maldevelopment of the cortex especially the temporal lobe. There is controversy regarding the role and the type of surgery indicated in its treatment. Recent descriptions of aphasia and attention-deficit disorders associated with these cysts indicate that we do not fully understand this entity. There is also no acceptable explanation for the male preponderance and increased incidence on the left side. The distribution, clinical features, treatment modalities, and some unusual syndromes associated with arachnoid cysts in children are discussed in this review.
