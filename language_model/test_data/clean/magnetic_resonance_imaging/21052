A 58-year-old man visited a local clinic after experiencing epigastric and dorsal pain. A computed tomography scan revealed a hypovascular mass in the pancreatic tail. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the tumor showed a heterogeneous isointense signal and T2-weighted MRI showed a hyperintense signal. Contrast studies revealed contrast enhancement, showing a cystic wall and parts of a septal structure and lumen. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed a multilocular hypoechoic tumor containing large quantity of debris. We experienced difficulty arriving at a diagnosis and are reporting this case of a pancreatic dermoid cyst, which was diagnosed based on pathological findings.
