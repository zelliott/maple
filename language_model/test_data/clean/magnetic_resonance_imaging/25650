Modern technology allows us to study the renal vascular diseases by means of many diagnostic procedures. In the past the main diagnostic technique was Urography, whereas Angiography were performed only in few selected cases. The new Imaging Techniques totally changed the diagnostic approach to this kind of diseases. Today in fact Echo-Color-Doppler and Nuclear Medicine are the early diagnostic techniques to be performed. Actually only few selected patients undergo Angiography, not the conventional one but the Digital; this new technique, in fact, in case of renovascular Hypertension is not only of diagnostic value but is often the definitive therapy.
