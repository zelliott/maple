A 64-year-old Caucasian woman presented with left eye pain and a transient left oculomotor nerve palsy. Subsequent imaging revealed a mass involving the sphenoid sinus and sella with suprasellar extension. A trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy was performed. Histopathology showed a fungal infection consistent with phaeohyphomycosis. Development of this lesion is probably attributed to allergic rhinitis and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Intravenous amphotericin and itraconazole treatment resulted in full recovery and the patient remains well at 6-month postoperative follow-up.
