The radiographic modalities discussed in this article are useful adjunctive techniques in the evaluation of arthritic disease. None of these modalities should be considered for baseline study. Rather, they should be considered following plain film examination when further information is required. The one modality that may be considered for a screening examination is radionuclide imaging. It is most useful when early diagnostic information regarding the extent of pathology is required. A pattern of activity can provide important information to the clinician, enabling an accurate diagnosis. Arthrography is best reserved for the evaluation of articular cartilage of a particular joint. A double-contrast arthrogram should be performed in this case. The technique has little application in the evaluation of polyarticular disease. Tenography is most useful in differentiating tenosynovitis from stenosing tenosynovitis. The differentiation is important because a diagnosis of stenosing tenosynovitis usually necessitates surgical intervention. Spontaneous rupture can be evaluated with tenography, but is is probably best evaluated with MRI. CT may be used in the evaluation of both soft-tissue and articular pathology. It is perhaps best employed in the evaluation of articular pathology of the rearfoot. This technique should not be used as a screening examination for vague foot pain. MRI is the newest and most exciting imaging modality available. The excellent soft-tissue contrast provides an accurate means of evaluating the extraarticular manifestations of arthritic disease. MRI may aid in differentiating rheumatoid nodules from neuromas in rheumatoid patients with excessive forefoot disease. It is also useful in the evaluation of tendon pathology, particularly spontaneous ruptures. This technique is only in its infancy, but technologic advances are rapidly making it a major force in the field of diagnostic imaging.
