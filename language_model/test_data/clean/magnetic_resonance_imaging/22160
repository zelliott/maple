A preliminary comparison of a prototype breath-hold magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) technique for non-invasive imaging of the pancreatic and biliary ducts with endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP).

Twenty ERCP and MRCP examinations were performed in 19 patients referred for routine ERCP with suspected biliary or pancreatic abnormalities. The MRCP technique employed a modified heavily T2-weighted thick slice RARE sequence that allowed up to three images to be obtained in a 16 second breath-hold. The examinations were reported independently and the findings compared.

MRCP accurately discriminated between patients without obstruction (n = 12) and those with (n = 8) and correctly diagnosed the cause of obstruction (three choledocholithiasis, five malignant stricture). In the 12 patients without obstruction the examinations were concordant in eight. In the remaining four patients MRCP provided more information than the corresponding ERCP study, diagnosing a pseudocyst in one patient and visualizing the entire pancreatic duct in three patients in whom this was not possible at ERCP.

These preliminary results suggest that a breath-hold MRCP technique may allow the selection of those patients with obstructive lesions that require therapeutic ERCP intervention, and may have the potential to reduce the need for diagnostic ERCP examinations.
