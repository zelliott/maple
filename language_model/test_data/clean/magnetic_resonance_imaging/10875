The field of cardiovascular disease in patients with dialysis has seen a tremendous increase in the number and diversity of diagnostic techniques available. Therefore, the newer methods have added new types of information to our diagnostic area. The plain chest roentgenogram and electrocardiogram are still simple and important tests. The other noninvasive procedures such as echocardiography, radionuclide techniques, CT and MRI supply important additional information concerning cardiac anatomy and function, but invasive cardiac catheterization remains the only method for accurately measuring intracardiac pressures and cineangiography is still necessary for defining the anatomy of the coronary arteries. Recently, the determination of natriuretic peptides (ANP,BNP), noradrenaline and troponin is added to evaluate cardiac function. The purpose of this paper discusses the use of these techniques in patients with dialysis.
