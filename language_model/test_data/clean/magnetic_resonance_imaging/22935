Clinical characteristics of central nervous system (CNS) pseudallescheriasis after near-drowning have not been systematically analyzed.

Review of cases reported in the English-language literature.

Sixteen patients were identified. The average period between the near-drowning episode and onset of clinical manifestations was 37 days. Common manifestations included fever, altered mental status, headache, seizures, and hemiparesis. All patients developed brain abscesses; however, imaging studies were normal at presentation in 6 patients. Cerebrospinal fluid neutrophilic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and decreased glucose were commonly observed. Most patients were treated with surgical resection and systemic amphotericin B or miconazole. Voriconazole was used in 2 patients. Twelve patients (75%) died. The average time between the near-drowning episode and death was 12 weeks. Four survivors received prompt treatment.

CNS pseudallescheriasis after near-drowning is highly lethal. Early diagnosis and aggressive medical and surgical interventions may improve survival.
