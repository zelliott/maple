The association of teratomas and spinal malformations such as spina bifida, partial sacral agenesis, hemivertebrae, and diastematomyelia has been described in the literature. Reported cases, however, are mainly presacral or sacrococcygeal with an extremely rare presentation of intradural extension.

A case of lumbar teratoma with an intradural extension and extramedullary component and the clinical outcome following surgical treatment are reported.

To our knowledge, among the reported teratoma cases with an intradural extension and extramedullary component, our case has a distinguishing feature regarding the involvement of the lumbar spine. It is also the first case, showing no neurological deficit during the postoperative period.

A full-term, female infant presented with a 30 x 30 x 10 mm lumbar mass covered with normal skin. The mass contained an irregular, bone-like, hard and mobile material accompanying cystic components. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a total closure defect of the first and second lumbar laminae and a subcutaneous mass with intradural extension. The lesion was found to penetrate the dural sac through an extended exposure from T12 to L3. There was no firm attachment of the intradural, extramedullary component of the lesion. Total removal of the tumor was achieved.

The patient was discharged on day 7 without any neurological deficit or sign of hydrocephalus. The pathological examination showed a benign teratoma containing mature cartilage, muscle, adipose tissue, and glandular tissue. Follow-up at 2 years showed no recurrence or neurological deficit and a normal sphincter tone. Urodynamic evaluation was within normal limits.

Accompanying a spinal dysraphic state, the mature teratoma in our case may support the idea of a tumor actually arising from a dysraphism and growing outward to produce the mass.
