Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a great modality for the assessment of the liver and biliary tree in the pediatric population. In this review, we illustrate and discuss MRI technique and a variety of congenital abnormalities and acquired conditions including infectious, inflammatory, metabolic, benign, and malignant processes. The role of magnetic resonance angiography and magnetic resonance venography is discussed in hepatic tumors and portal hypertension. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography protocol is also addressed. Although ultrasound remains a screening tool and computer tomography is readily available, MRI accurately depicts the pathology, leading to a better understanding of the disease process with optimal patient management and follow-up, without the use of ionizing radiation.
