The purpose of this article is to describe imaging features of head and neck inflammatory pseudotumor in the brain, orbit, sinonasal cavity, temporal bone or skull base, and other rare locations.

Although the radiologic differentiation from malignancy is not clearly possible, we suggest that familiarity with the manifestations of inflammatory pseudotumor can help avoid unnecessary radical surgery before histopathologic proof of malignancy.
