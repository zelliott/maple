The authors report a case of an intraosseous cyst located in the distal end of the tibia. A typical subchondral defect with a narrow opening in the ankle joint was well defined by CT scan and MRI. The diagnostic value of noninvasive techniques and differential diagnosis are specified after a review of the literature.
