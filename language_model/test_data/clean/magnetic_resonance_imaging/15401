Apical ballooning is an increasingly reported transient cardiomyopathy with yet unknown origin. In this study 2 cases of apical ballooning are described in whom we used a combined approach of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and 31-Phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS). Electrocardiogram showed ST abnormalities and cardiac serum markers were mildly elevated, but CAG demonstrated smooth coronary arteries. Cine-CMR revealed severe apical akinesia and significantly decreased ejection fraction. Furthermore we detected reduced myocardial phosphocreatine to beta-ATP (PCr/b-ATP) ratios during the first week of acute disease. After 1 week we observed an improvement of PCr/b-ATP ratios by 68% and 34%, which was associated with an increase in left ventricular function. Our data suggest that 31P MRS might be a valuable tool in the evaluation of apical ballooning, but larger cohorts are needed to improve the understanding of metabolic changes during transient apical ballooning.
