The aim of the present study was to establish a suitable method for virtual computed tomography (CT) gastroscopy.

Three-millimeter helical CT scans of a pig stomach were obtained after air insufflation and instillation of diluted diatrizoic acid (Gastrografin), and with double contrast. In addition, three patients with gastric tumors were studied after ingestion of an effervescent agent (Duplotrast, 6 g) and intravenous injection of hyoscine butylbromide (Buscopan, 1 ml). Virtual endoscopy images were computed on a Sun Sparc 20 workstation (128 megabytes of random access memory, four gigabytes of hard disk space), using dedicated software (Navigator, General Electric Medical System Company). The endoscopy sequences were compared with real endoscopic examinations and with anatomical specimens.

In the cadaver studies, the best results were obtained with plain air insufflation, whereas virtual CT gastroscopy with diluted contrast and with double contrast showed artifacts simulating polyps, erosions, and flat ulcers. Patient studies showed good correlation with the fiberoptic endoscopy findings, although large amounts of retained gastric fluid substantially reduced the quality of the surface reconstruction.

These preliminary results show that virtual CT gastroscopy is able to provide insights into the upper gastrointestinal tract similar to those of fiberoptic endoscopy. However, due to the limited spatial resolution of the CT protocol used, as well as inherent image artifacts associated with the Navigator program's reconstruction algorithm, the form of virtual CT gastroscopy studied was not capable of competing with the imaging quality provided by fiberoptic gastroscopy.
