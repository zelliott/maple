Catalepsy denotes a tendency to maintain postures. We prospectively looked for catalepsy in 216 acute stroke patients. We found five patients with cataleptic postures. They were seen on the nonparetic side in all cases. Other movement abnormalities seen in the catatonic syndrome were absent. CT scans of the head showed ischemic infarctions in the middle cerebral artery territory in the five cases. Cataleptic postures associated with hemispheric lesions due to stroke may be a more common phenomenon than is believed, and their mechanism remains to be elucidated.
