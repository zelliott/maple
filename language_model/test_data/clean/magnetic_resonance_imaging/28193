To evaluate the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enhanced with gadolinium-DTPA (Gd-DTPA) for the detection of the inflamed synovium and for the evaluation of the response to therapy in rheumatoid arthritis, we studied 49 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) according to the 1987 revised criteria of American Rheumatism Association (ARA), 6 patients of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) complicated by arthritis, 3 patients of osteoarthritis (OA), 2 patients of Sj√∂gren syndrome, 2 patients of progressive systemic sclerosis and 10 healthy volunteers as an age matched control. The 49 patients with RA were divided into three groups: (1) early phase of RA, (2) non progressing RA and (3) slowly progressing RA, and the stage classification of plain X-ray film and enhancement pattern of MR images were classified into three groups. Synovial enhancement showed a linear, band-like or diffuse pattern. Almost all cases in early phase of RA group and non progressing RA group showed a linear pattern, a band-like pattern or even no enhancement, while slowly progressing group of stage II or higher showed the diffuse pattern of enhancement in all except 2 cases. Moreover, the linear pattern, the band-like pattern or even no contrast enhancement were seen in all except 1 stage I patient, whereas 26 out of 29 patients with stage II or higher change showed diffuse contrast enhancement. Furthermore, a comparison of MR images before and after administration of DMARDs in 10 patients showed that the improvement of clinical symptoms correlated fairly well with reduction of contrast enhancement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
