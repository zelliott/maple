Dissemination of tumour cells via CSF occurs if there is close proximity of a malignant space-occupying growth to the CSF circulation system. According to the anatomic localisation of the metastases a distinction is made between intra- and extra medullary metastases. Magnetic resonance tomography is a highly sensitive method that can point not only to the pathological process, but also to its localisation and extent, especially if paramagnetic substances are used, to a much more accurate degree than had been possible so far with invasive myelography or computed tomography.
