In this work, the feasibility of using T2rho weighting as an MR contrast mechanism is evaluated. Axial images of a human brain were acquired using a single-slice spin-lock T2rho-weighted pulse sequence and compared to analogous T2-weighted images of the same slice. The contrast between white matter and gray matter in T2rho-weighted images was approximately 40% greater than that from T2-weighted data. These preliminary data suggest that the novel contrast mechanism of T2rho can be used to yield high-contrast T2-like images.
