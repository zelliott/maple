A 75-year-old gentleman presented to our department with dysphagia, nocturnal cough and dysphonia. Clinical examination revealed a large parapharyngeal mass extending from the left nasopharynx to the glottis. A magnetic resonance imaging scan confirmed the lipomatous nature of the lesion and elegantly demonstrated its anatomy. We discuss the aetiology and management of such lesions and focus on the diagnostic radiology of the parapharyngeal space.
