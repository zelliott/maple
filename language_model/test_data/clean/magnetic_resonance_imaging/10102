A massive supratentorial torcular meningioma was completely resected in a 50-year-old woman. On the tenth postoperative day she presented with spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea. The site of the CSF leak was through the region of the cribriform plate, remote from the site of surgery. The possible cause of the leak and the relationship with the massive meningioma are analyzed.
