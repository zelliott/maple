The authors present three cases of histologically proved synovial sarcoma. CT is useful in assessing erosive or destructive changes in bone, and in demonstrating calcifications. MR characteristics are nonspecific; calcifications within these tumors can be missed on MR. MR can help to assess tumor extension, vascular invasion, and hemorrhage within the tumor.
