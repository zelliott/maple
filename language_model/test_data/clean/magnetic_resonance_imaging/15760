Multi-slice CT coronary angiography is a rapidly developing noninvasive diagnostic technique that can be used to detect coronary stenosis. Detection of coronary stenosis by coronary angiography is usually hindered by limited image quality, motion artefacts caused by heart contractions, and artefacts caused by extensive calcification. In addition, the radiation exposure is relatively great. Multi-slice CT coronary angiography, however, can reliably rule out coronary stenosis. At this time, multi-slice CT coronary angiography is not a routine part of the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. In the future, the target population for this technique may include asymptomatic high-risk patients and symptomatic low- or intermediate-risk patients for severe coronary artery disease.
