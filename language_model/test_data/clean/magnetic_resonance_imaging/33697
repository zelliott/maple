An MR-based system for the accurate irradiation of small intracranial tumors, not less than 5 cm in diameter, is described. The system uses a home-made device (a support base with millimeter scales) and a series of thin individual wood moulds. A full size-enlargement of the central sagittal and of the tumor-containing transverse MR sections is the first operative step. On these enlarged sections the intracranial isocentre, the entry position of the orthogonal laser beams and the flexion-extension degree of the patient's head are chosen. Subsequently, from the sagittal full-size section the fronto-naso-labial outline is cut-out and accurately transferred on to a thin wood plank, which is finally cut with a fine saw. On the plank two orthogonal lines are drawn, crossing at the target-volume centre and matching with both laser beams during the treatment set-up. The millimeter scale on the support base allows the accurate lateral displacements of the treatment couch, when eccentric tumors most be irradiated. By this system, called with the Italian acronym SARO, the patient needs neither to be shaved, nor to be marked on his head skin. No special shell is necessary any more. Though intrinsically simple, the system needs skillful accuracy during all its procedure steps in order to reach the desired reliability when treating small intracranial tumors (not less than 5 cm in diameter).
