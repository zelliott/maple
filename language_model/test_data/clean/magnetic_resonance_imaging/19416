In the literature there are sporadic reports of spinal epidural abscesses after epidural anaesthesia (Staphylococcus aureus in 82%), whilst subdural empyemas are more often related to ear and sinus conditions.

A 32 year old woman with a clinical history of migraine and symmetrical frontal atrophy on a previous cerebral CT scan, after Caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia, presented with orthostatic headache two days later. On the fourth day it had become constant and she had a high temperature which was considered to be caused by infection of the surgical wound. Neurological examination was found to be normal, the CT scan was inconclusive and the CSF showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis without consumption of glucose. In view of her worsening clinical condition on the ninth day, in the absence of a cutaneous focus and on suspicion of a para-meningeal infective focus, lumbar MR was done and found to be normal, and cerebral MR which showed images compatible with a right fronto-parietal subdural empyema. After a parietal craniotomy and culture of the surgical specimen, colonies of Mycoplasma hominis were grown, similar to those grown from the exudates of the abdomical surgical wound. Treatment was started with ciprofloxacine.

We consider that following epidural anaesthesia the patient developed hypotension of the CSF with a secondary subdural hematoma or hygroma and this became infected by hematogenous spread of Mycoplasma hominis.
