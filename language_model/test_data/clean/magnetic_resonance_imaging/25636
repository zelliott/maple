Acute or chronic spinal cord syndromes with or without evidence of cord compression are a common diagnostic problem in neurology. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on 127 patients to assess the sensitivity of this examination in detecting local spinal cord lesions. The most common location noticed in this study were the cervico-thoracic (40.9%) and cervical regions (33.8%). A total spine examination accounted for 14.9% of the examinations performed, and the lumbar spine was evaluated in 10.2%. An increased signal corresponding to plaques of multiple sclerosis was the most frequent diagnosis (25 cases), followed by cervical narrowing of the spinal canal and cervical disk diseases (23 cases), neoplasms (15 cases), spinal cord infarctions (12 cases), spinal infections (6 cases) and spinal cord injuries (3 cases). A myelopathy of undetermined etiology was diagnosed in 19 cases. MRI is very sensitive in multiple sclerosis, but it is not possible to diagnose the disease from abnormal scan only, other supportive laboratory results, such as oligoclonal bands, are necessary. MRI is very useful in evaluating intraspinal cord parenchymal lesions, such as neoplasms or congenital abnormalities.
