Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) may develop due to pituitary apoplexy from pituitary adenoma. However, the occurrence of ICH or SAH after transsphenoidal surgery is very rare. Here, we report a case of delayed and massive subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage after transsphenoidal surgery for a suprasellar pituitary adenoma.
