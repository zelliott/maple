Many craniotomies require a watertight dural closure. When primary dural repair is not possible, a graft is necessary. Autograft material is not always easily accessible or available, necessitating the use of other material. We performed 200 craniotomies using an acellular human dermal graft (AlloDerm; LifeCell Corp., The Woodlands, TX) to determine its suitability as a dural substitute.

From June 1996 through March 1998, all patients at Allegheny General Hospital who required a dural substitute graft and in whom autograft harvest was impractical or impossible received the acellular dermal autograft. The running suture technique was used to form a watertight seal.

After follow-up for a minimum of 1 year, seven patients have required subsequent surgery. Three patients developed cerebrospinal fluid leaks that were repaired without removing the dermal graft. Four patients developed wound infections that required debridement. In each patient, the graft seemed to be uninvolved in the infectious process and was left in place. The patients were administered antibiotics postoperatively, and there have been no recurrent infections. No adhesion formation or scarring was noted around or underneath the graft in any patient.

AlloDerm is a reasonable alternative to the available dural graft materials. Its handling characteristics are similar to those of dura, it is biologically inert, and it does not produce adhesion formation.
