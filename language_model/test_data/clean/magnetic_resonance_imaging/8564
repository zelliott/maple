MR imaging is the preferred imaging modality for evaluating the meniscus. Overall, when strict criteria are followed, it is accurate in diagnosing meniscal tears in patients who have not had prior meniscal surgery. However, an accurate interpretation requires a through knowledge of the normal meniscal anatomy, common meniscal variants, and common diagnostic pitfalls. In this article, the author emphasizes the importance of describing meniscal tears properly and discusses treatment options. Diagnosing a recurrent tear is more complicated in patients who have had prior partial meniscal resection or repair, and the use of MR arthrography in this group of patients is discussed. Recent developments in areas such as 3 T and parallel imaging offer promise for accurate meniscal evaluation with even shorter scan times.
