We report the cerebral MR imaging findings in a patient with pathologically proved Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in whom predominant gray and white matter degeneration was seen within 1 year of symptom onset. The initial MR signal abnormalities in the basal ganglia were subtle. A follow-up MR examination revealed diffuse cerebral and cerebellar atrophy and demyelination.
