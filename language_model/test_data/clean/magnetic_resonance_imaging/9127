To determine regional and global left ventricular (LV) functional parameters and to perform segmental wall thickness (SWT) and motion (WM) analysis of dual-source CT (DSCT) with optimized temporal resolution versus MRI.

30 patients with known or suspected CAD, non-obstructive HCM, DCM, ARVCM, Fallot Tetralogy, cardiac sarcoidosis and cardiac metastasis underwent DSCT and MRI. The DSCT and MR images were evaluated: end-systolic (ESV), end-diastolic LV (EDV) volumes, stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF), and myocardial mass (MM) as well as LV wall thickening and segmental WM applying the AHA model were obtained and statistically analyzed.

The mean LV-EDV (r = 0.96) and ESV (r = 0.98) as well as LV-EF (r = 0.97), SV (r = 0.83), and MM (r = 0.95) correlated well. Bland Altman analysis revealed little systematic underestimation of LV-EF (-1.1 +/- 7.8 %), EDV (-0.3 +/- 18.2 ml), SV (-1.3 +/- 16.7 ml) and little overestimation of ESV (1.1 +/- 7.8 ml) and MM (12.8 +/- 14.4 g) determined by DSCT. Systolic reconstruction time points correlated well (DSCT 32.2 +/- 6.7 vs. MRI 35.6 +/- 4.4 % RR-interval). The LV wall thickness obtained by DSCT and MRI showed close correlation in all segments (Ã˜ diff 0.42 +/- 1 mm). In 413 segments (89 %) WM abnormalities were equally rated, whereas DSCT tended to underestimate the degree of wall motion impairment.

DSCT with optimized temporal resolution enables regional and global LV function analysis as well as segmental WM analysis in good correlation with MRI. However, the degree of WM impairment is slightly underestimated by DSCT.
