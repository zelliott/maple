Anti-psychotic treatment appears to be associated with striatal volume increase, but how early this change occurs is still unknown.

A single prospective cohort of 20 anti-psychotic-na√Øve patients, newly diagnosed with schizophrenia, underwent magnetic resonance imaging brain scan at baseline. This was repeated following up to 8 weeks of anti-psychotic treatment. Ten patients had repeat scan within only 3 weeks. The choice of anti-psychotic medication was naturalistic, i.e., clinician-led. Well-matched healthy individuals were also scanned to control for non-specific changes over a 3-week period.

After 3 weeks of anti-psychotic treatment, significant grey matter volume increase in the right caudate, superior and inferior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, and left inferior parietal lobule was noted. However, after 8 weeks of anti-psychotic treatment, volume increase in the right thalamus and bilateral cerebellum was observed. Significant grey matter reduction was detected in the left medial frontal gyrus at both 3- and 8-week intervals.

Early increase in striatal volume change occurs as early as 3 weeks after anti-psychotic treatment, whilst thalamic volume increase is apparent later, by 8 weeks of treatment. We speculate that drug-mediated neuroplasticity may provide a biomarker for clinical recovery.
