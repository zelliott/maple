This article describes a 76 year old man that, after lung cancer surgery, showed left extrinsic oculomotor paralysis and contralateral paralysis of the superior rectus muscle associated with bilateral ptosis. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a rare situation characterized by an isolated metastasis in the region of the left third cranial nerve nucleus, probably compromising the superior rectus subnucleus and the central caudal nucleus, therefore justifying the bilateral oculomotor involvement.
