Epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas are rare vascular tumors, mostly originating from soft tissue, lungs or liver.

A 58-year-old woman was admitted to hospital because of upper congestion, Horner's syndrome and segmental sensory disturbance. MRI of the spine showed a spinal mass, reaching from the seventh cervical vertebra to the fourth chest vertebra. Because of worsening of upper congestion and progressive neurological impairment, the patient had to be operated twice. Unfortunately a surgical excision of the infiltrating tumor in sano was not possible and the patient died 4 weeks after the second operation. Histologic examination revealed the diagnosis of infiltrating epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, originating from the first chest vertebra.

Prognosis of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is mainly determinated by its location. In advanced stages of disease or lack of surgical cure epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas may be fatal. Therefore epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas should be considered early in the differential diagnosis of patients with uncertain bone lesions.
