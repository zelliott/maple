Rapid progress has been made in cardiac MRI (CMRI) over the past decade, which has firmly established it as a reliable and clinically important technique for assessment of cardiac structure, function, perfusion, and myocardial viability. Its versatility and accuracy is unmatched by any other individual imaging modality. CMRI is non-invasive and has high spatial resolution and avoids use of potentially nephrotoxic contrast agent or radiation. It has been extensively studied against other established non-invasive imaging modalities and has been shown to be superior in many scenarios, particularly with respect to assessment of cardiac and great vessel morphology and left ventricular function. Furthermore, its clinical use continues to expand with increasing experience and proliferation of CMRI centres. As worldwide prevalence of cardiovascular disease continues to rise, CMRI provides opportunity for improved and cost-effective non-invasive assessment. Continued progress in CMRI technology promises to further widen its clinical application in coronary imaging, myocardial perfusion, comprehensive assessment of valves, and plaque characterisation.
