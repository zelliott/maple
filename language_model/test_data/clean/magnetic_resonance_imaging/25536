Two rare cases of benign submucosal pharyngo-oesophageal mesenchymoma are presented in this paper. One patient was treated by tumour removal via a combined thoracic and laterocervical approach and the other by resection through a laterocervical approach. The paper discusses the pathology and diagnosis of benign mesenchymomas. The authors suggest that for large tumours located in the pharynx and extending down the oesophagus without adhesion to the oesophageal wall, the laterocervical approach can avoid complications associated with the thoracic approach. The new technique caused less tissue damage and provided a quicker recovery and shorter hospitalization.
