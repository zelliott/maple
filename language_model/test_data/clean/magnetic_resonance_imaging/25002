Three hundred and fifty cases of patients with head injury were admitted to our hospital from 1998 to 2000. Among these cases, 10 cases manifested isolated, localized subarachnoid hemorrhage on the first computed tomographic image after the trauma. Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage was found in the ambient, suprasellar, and sylvian fissure, Bleeding was seen in the ambient cistern or suprasellar cistern at the site of the blow on the frontal or occipital area of the head. The bleeding was seen in the sylvian fissure at the site of the temporal head blow. The bleeding was washed out after one day. None of the patients had symptomatic spasms, and all of the patients had a good prognosis. The mechanism of isolated, traumatic, localized subarachnoid hemorrhage was considered as shear strain or coup and contre-coup injury.
