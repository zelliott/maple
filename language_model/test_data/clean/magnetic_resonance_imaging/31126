Because of the low incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in Japan, few studies have reported on the use of concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) for treatment of this disease. The present study investigated the efficacy and toxicity of CCRT with Carboplatin (CBDCA) and UFT for NPC.

CCRT with injection of CBDCA and oral administration of UFT was given to 21 patients in our institution during 1996-2000. We compared the patients treated with CCRT with those treated with RT alone from 1976 to 1995 or those treated with RT after chemotherapy (Pre-RT chemotherapy) from 1985 to 1995. Overall survival rate (OS), progression free survival rate (PFS) and cause specific survival (CSS) rate were analyzed.

The actual 2-year OS, PFS, and CSS of CCRT were 85.7, 66.7 and 90%, respectively. The rates were improved compared to RT alone (37.9, 31.0, and 56.6%) and Pre-RT chemotherapy (58.8, 41.2, and 64.7%). The most frequent and severe acute toxicities were leukopenia (42.9%) and mucositis with grade 3-4 (28.6%), both of which eventually resolved.

CCRT with CBDCA and UFT is considered to be an effective, convenient, and tolerable treatment, which improves survival rates for NPC patients. Therefore, we recommend this CCRT method for the treatment of NPC.
