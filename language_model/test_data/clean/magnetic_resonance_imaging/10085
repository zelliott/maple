Little is known about how visceral adiposity and apolipoprotein CIII in apoB-containing lipoproteins influence atherogenic lipids profiles. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationships of visceral adiposity and apoC-III in apoB-containing lipoproteins (LpB:C-III) with lipoprotein lipids in circulating plasma.

A subgroup of 46 men (n = 20, aged 29.1-33.4 years) and women (n = 26, aged 29.1-33.8 years) were recruited from an ongoing population study at our institution. Anthropometric variables including weight, height, and waist circumference were measured using standard procedures, and body mass index was calculated (kg/m(2)). Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was measured with magnetic resonance imaging. Plasma apolipoproteins, lipids, glucose, and insulin were measured after an overnight fasting.

The men had a significantly higher waist circumference, glucose, and TC/HDL-C ratio, while the women had a significantly higher HDL-C and apoA-I. In particular, this is the first study to report that VAT and LpB:C-III were independent predictors in determining plasma triglyceride concentrations.

The relations of plasma triglyceride concentration with VAT and LpB:C-III suggest that information on VAT and apoC-III in apoB-containing lipoproteins may provide additional information on the atherogenic lipid profiles.
