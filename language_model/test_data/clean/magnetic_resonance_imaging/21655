Eleven patients surgically treated for fracture of the acetabulum were examined postoperatively by MRI in order to reveal any signs of necrosis of the femoral head at an early stage. The means of osteosynthesis used underwent preliminary testing in order to exclude magnetic or thermal phenomena. The study confirmed the usefulness of this test in the early diagnosis of this serious complication. In 3 cases the presence of the means of osteosynthesis obstructed a correct interpretation of the images.
