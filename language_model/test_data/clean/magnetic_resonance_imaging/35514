To assess concerns that the European Union Physical Agents Directive (EU PAD) on Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) could seriously restrict the use of MRI for research, diagnosis, and treatment, this study was conducted to examine the impact of the EU PAD on research practice, following a previous survey that assessed its impact on clinical practice.

Data were collected through an online survey. E-mail invitations were sent to every UK grant-holder funded by Cancer Research UK, Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), Medical Research Council (MRC), and the Wellcome Trust in the last three years, who use MRI technology.

A total of 70% of researchers responding to the survey reported that some of their MR research is conducted with at least one researcher in the scanner room during operation. Of those researchers in the scanner room, more than three-quarters are within 1 m of the scanner, for any scanner strength, and would therefore exceed the limits set in the Directive. Over half of these researchers also reach into the magnet bore, while at least one in five researchers spend over an hour in the scanner room during operation.

The results suggest the EU PAD could have a very prohibitive impact on research practice. The current exposure limits would prohibit interventional MRI, limit the provision of patient care, and restrict researchers from reaching into the magnet bore to position and check equipment or to provide technical support. The use of new, more powerful high-field scanners will be particularly restricted.
