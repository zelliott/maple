Ultrasonography (US) is currently the reference technique for evaluating gallbladder pathology. The aim of this study was to prospectively determine the diagnostic efficacy of magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRCP) in evaluating the gallbladder, as compared with US. The study included 80 patients (mean age, 69.3 years; male-to-female ration, 1.3:1) who underwent prospective US and MRCP; 5 patients in whom MRCP was contraindicated were excluded. In all cases, US was performed before MRCP. Ultrasound was the reference technique for evaluating MRCP sensitivity and specificity. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography provided good image quality in 65 patients (81.2%) and poor image quality in 15 (mostly because of poor patient cooperation). Artefacts did not influence visualization of the gallbladder or evaluation of the background pathology. The sensitivity of MRCP in diagnosing gallbladder stones (43 patients; 97.7%) was comparable to US (44 patients). In contrast, MRCP diagnosed biliary sludge or microlithiasis in 13 patients, versus 5 in the case of US. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is a good technique for diagnosing cholelithiasis and biliary sludge. However, its high cost, contraindications, and the need for patient cooperation limit the use of the technique in routine clinical gallbladder studies. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography could contribute to the diagnosis of microlithiasis, provided that future studies confirm its greater sensitivity versus US.
