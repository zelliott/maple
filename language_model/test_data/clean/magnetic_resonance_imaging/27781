The use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is known to be associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). We report a case of PML in a patient receiving MMF, who showed improvement upon discontinuation of the drug. He was restarted on MMF, following which he went into coma. He showed prompt recovery upon stopping the drug again and made full recovery without any residual neurological deficit. This case is being reported to further highlight this neurological side-effect of MMF.
