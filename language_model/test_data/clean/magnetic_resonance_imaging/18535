Despite the plethora of technologic advances, the most common technique for diagnosing burn depth remains the clinical assessment of an experienced burn surgeon. It is clear that this assessment is accurate for very deep and very shallow burns. But since clinical judgment is not precise in telling whether a dermal burn will heal in 3 weeks, efforts to develop a burn depth indicator are certainly warranted to accurately determine which dermal burns to excise and graft. This review summarizes the considerable literature in which a variety of techniques to determine burn depth have been used.
