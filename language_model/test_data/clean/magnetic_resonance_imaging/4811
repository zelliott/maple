To determine whether the echo time of magnetic resonance gradient-echo and spin-echo imaging sequences may be important for the occurrence of high signal strength from tendon with pathological alterations, imaging sequences with sufficient spatial resolution and very short echo times were developed for whole-body imagers with standard gradient system. The sequences were applied on the Achilles tendons of five healthy volunteers and seven patients with achillodynia. Some affected regions inside tendon, probably corresponding with tissue with subtle edema in the collagen bundles were only revealed in images recorded with very short echo times TE < 5 ms, whereas stronger affections and protons in liquids between the fiber bundles were also shown in images with longer echo times TE > 10 ms. Gradient-echo methods allow shorter echo times than spin-echo techniques for a given gradient system of the imager and given spatial resolution. So minimum echo time gradient-echo sequences should be used for sensitive imaging of tendon alterations, because no considerable signal dephasing due to susceptibility effects were found in tendon.
