Intramedullary spinal cryptococcosis is very rare. We describe a case of intramedullary spinal cryptococcoma at the T12 level in a 60-year-old man who presented with a 3-month history of progressive bilateral lower limb weakness and no obvious immunocompromise. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed a 1.2 cm diameter mass within the spinal cord at T12 with intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images, a slight degree of homogeneous low signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and intense enhancement after infusion of gadopentetate dimeglumine. These findings led to a preoperative diagnosis of intramedullary tumor. After 2 months of postoperative antifungal treatment, the patient's clinical condition had markedly improved. Cryptococcoma should be considered when an enhancing lesion of the spinal cord is found on MR imaging, even in apparently immunocompetent patients. A careful lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid analysis to diagnose cryptococcosis of the central nervous system should be made promptly, as early treatment is associated with a good prognosis.
