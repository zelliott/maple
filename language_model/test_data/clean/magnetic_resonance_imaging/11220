A 32-year-old man developed an extremely rare subdural hematoma after syringosubarachnoid shunting for syringomyelia. He presented with a 4-year history of neck pain and spastic paraparesis resulting from T-7 and T-8 vertebral body fracture suffered in a traffic accident at age 22 years. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed syringomyelia between the craniocervical junction and the T-10 level. The symptoms were slowly progressive, and a syringosubarachnoid shunting was performed. His spasticity improved after surgery, but he developed orthostatic headache 7 days after surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated a thin subdural hematoma over the right cerebral convexity. The subdural hematoma resolved spontaneously within a week with conservative treatment. Vigorous cerebrospinal fluid outflow observed during surgery presumably lowered the pressure in the syrinx cavity, leading to significant but transient intracranial hypotension and consequently the formation of subdural hematoma.
