Lipoblastoma and its infiltrative variant lipoblastomatosis are rare adipose tissue tumours seen in infants and children. Many surgeons are unfamiliar with these uncommon lesions and hence they are suboptimally treated. We report a case series of six patients in our tertiary paediatric hospital. Cases were reviewed retrospectively with reference to demographics, investigations, diagnosis and their management. Lipoblastomas are easily misdiagnosed and excision before proper investigations may result in incomplete resection, recurrence and further potentially mutilating surgery.
