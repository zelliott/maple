Cervicothoracic neuroblastoma arising from the stellate ganglion in children has always been a challenge to the pediatric surgeon. Localized thoracic neuroblastoma in children has a very good prognosis if excised completely even without adjuvant therapy. Several approaches have been described to resect cervicothoracic neuroblastoma arising from the stellate ganglion with limited success. The muscle and bone sparing transmanubrial transcostal approach which spares the clavicle and the sternomastoid muscle provides excellent exposure for the complete excision of the tumor and excellent functional outcome. We report a 2-year-old girl with cervicothoracic neuroblastoma who had an excellent outcome with this approach.
