A case of multifocal fibrosclerosis is presented with MR images. Bilateral sclerosing orbital pseudotumor invading cavernous sinuses were the presenting disorder. Magnetic resonance imaging showed involvement of paranasal sinuses bilaterally and multiple supratentorial dural masses. Retroperitoneal fibrosis was associated with the condition. Multifocal involvement should be considered in patients with sclerosing orbital pseudotumor and an imaging approach should be performed on the appropriate clinical condition to document possible coexistence of other disorders including retroperitoneal fibrosis, mediastinal fibrosis, sclerosing cholangitis, and Riedel's thyroiditis
