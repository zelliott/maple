Malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) is a rare and highly aggressive tumor that primarily occurs in very young children. We report here a patient with a primary MRT of the orbit who received tandem high-dose chemotherapy and gamma-knife radiosurgery. Although the tumor was not completely removed, and the initial chemotherapy failed, the patient achieved long-term survival after this modality of treatment. This approach may be one to be further considered in patients with MRT.
