Imaging pain pathways in rats offers a tool to investigate CNS systems in acute and chronic rodent models of pain, neural plasticity associated with the latter, and the opportunity to evaluate pharmacological effects of analgesics on these systems. Furthermore, the evaluation of CNS circuits (e.g., sensory, emotional, endogenous analgesic) offers the potential for defining the complexity of circuit-based behaviors that are difficult to evaluate in current preclinical behavioral models of pain. In these studies, we performed functional MRI in trained, acclimated, awake rats to define neural systems activated by noxious thermal stimuli. Analysis revealed activation in response to a 48Â°C stimuli in cortical, subcortical and brainstem areas, known to be substrates of the pain pathways. Our results demonstrate the ability to characterize CNS patterns of activation in response to pain in rodents while avoiding the potential complicating effects of anesthesia.
