Analysis of cerebral magnetic resonance images of 24 subjects with Sydenham's chorea and 48 age-, height-, weight-, gender-, and handedness-matched controls demonstrated increased sizes of the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus in the Sydenham's chorea group. In contrast, neither total cerebral, prefrontal, or midfrontal volumes or thalamic area were increased. These results indicate the selective involvement of the basal ganglia in Sydenham's chorea.
