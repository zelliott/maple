A family with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) (15-year-old boy, his 17-year-old sister and 45-year-old father) is described. The first sign of HCM was cardiac arrest (CA) due to ventricular fibrillation (VF) in a boy. A few months later sister of proband had the episode of CA due to VF. Both had implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Echocardiography revealed HCM in both cases and in a father, who also received prophylactic ICD. During 24-month follow-up fast VT was observed in sister of proband. We review electrocardiographic changes in HCM and their correlation with magnetic resonance.
