The detection and prognosis of prostate cancer in its early stages are critically important. It is therefore essential to improve the existing dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE MRI) techniques commonly used for the assessment of the tumour vascular environment. The goal of this study was to describe a method for the estimation of the arterial input function (AIF) in DCE MRI by measuring R(2) * values in the femoral artery of patients with early-stage prostate cancer. The calculation of contrast agent concentrations was based on calibration curves determined in whole blood samples for a range of normal haematocrit (HCT) values (HCT = 0.35-0.525). Individual AIFs corrected for HCT were compared with individual AIFs calibrated with a mean whole blood [R(2)*-Gd-DTPA-BMA] [Gd-DTPA-BMA, gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate-bis(methylamide) (gadodiamide)] curve at an assumed HCT = 0.44, as well as a population AIF at an assumed HCT = 0.45. The area under the curve of the first-pass bolus ranged between 0.6 min mM at HCT = 0.53 and 1.3 min mM at HCT = 0.39. Significant differences in magnitude at peak contrast agent concentrations (HCT = 0.36, [Gd-DTPA-BMA](max) = 9 ± 0.4 mM; HCT = 0.46, [Gd-DTPA-BMA](max) = 4.0 ± 0.2 mM) were found. Using model-based simulations, the accuracy of the kinetic parameters estimated using individual AIFs corrected for HCT demonstrated that, for the use of individual calibration curves with HCT values differing by more than 10%, K(trans) and k(ep) values were largely underestimated (up to 60% difference for K(trans)). Moreover, blood volume estimates were severely underestimated. Estimates of kinetic parameters in early-stage prostate cancer patients demonstrated that the efflux rate constant (k(ep)) was influenced significantly by the definition of AIF. Regardless of whether an individually calibrated AIF or a population AIF (average of all individually calibrated AIFs) was used, pixel-by-pixel mapping of k(ep) and v(b) in the prostate gland appeared to be more sensitive than with the usual biexponential approach.
