Stereotactic radiosurgery, known for efficacy in the noninvasive treatment of tumors or arteriovenous malformations that are otherwise difficult to access through traditional surgery, is an emerging technology in the treatment of focal epileptic lesions. Recent studies in the treatment of hypothalamic hamartoma and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy further suggest that seizures in these medically intractable syndromes remit at clinically significant rates with stereotactic radiosurgery. Further studies will be required to determine whether efficacy attains that of traditional surgery while offering a noninvasive technique with potentially lower morbidity.
