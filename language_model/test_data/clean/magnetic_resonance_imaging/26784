Kimura disease (KD) is a rare entity that occurs primarily in Asian people characterized histopathologically by a lymph-folliculoid granuloma with infiltration of the mass and the surrounding tissues by eosinophils, often with concomitant peripheral blood eosinophilia and elevated serum immunoglobulin E, generally seen in the head and neck region, especially preauricular area. In this article, we present the case of a 14-year-old male patient with KD on his left parotid area. The clinical, radiologic, surgical, and pathologic findings of KD are discussed in this article.
