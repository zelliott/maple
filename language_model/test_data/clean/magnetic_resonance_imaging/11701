We describe a case of pituitary adenoma penetrating to the sphenoidal sinus and nasal cavity in a patient with recurrent nasal polyps. Histopathological examination of the removed polyps revealed transitional carcinoma. CT and MRI of the head showed a solid tumour filling the spheniodal sinus and the sella, penetrating to posterior ethmoid cells and superior nasal duct. In hormonal investigations increased concentration of prolactin (PRL) was found. Histopathological examination performed after neurosurgical operation revealed pituitary adenoma, and the diagnosis of pituitary adenoma was established. About 30% of tumour cells gave positive reaction with anti-PRL antibody in the immunocytochemical investigation. The immunocytochemical investigation of the nasal polips was also done--similarly about 30% of cells showed strong positive reaction with anti-PRL antibody. The investigations indicate the presence of pituitary macroadenoma (prolactinoma), manifesting initially as nose tumour. Considering cases of ectopic pituitary adenomas covered with transitional epithelium (for example some nasal tumours and paranasal sinuses tumours) immunocytochemical investigations are recommended in such cases.
