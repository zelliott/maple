Recent advancements in functional neuroimaging have furthered our understanding of the normal and pathological brain. These non-invasive imaging modalities have allowed us to study the human brain in vivo. Concurrently, the revival of neurostimulation in the treatment of pain, movement disorders, and epilepsy has allowed the synergistic combination of these two technologies. Several studies focusing on the use of functional imaging in patients with implanted neurostimulation devices are reviewed. The anticipated roles of these two disciplines are discussed.
