We report a patient with a temporal lobe syphilitic gumma mimicking a malignant brain tumour in a 43-year-old immunocompetent man. The diagnosis was confirmed histologically and using polymerase chain reaction. Syphilitic gummatous involvement of the central nervous system is rare, with only a few cases having been reported. The unique feature of this case was the extensive oedema surrounding the lesion, suggestive of an active process.
