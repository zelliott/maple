The case is reported of a rosette-forming glioneuronal tumour of the fourth ventricle (RGTFV) in a 27-year-old male. Symptoms included headache, severe vomiting and clumsy walking that had progressively worsened over 14 days. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging indicated a 3.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm solid-cystic mass in the fourth ventricle and obstructive hydrocephalus. The tumour showed evidence of previous intra-tumour haemorrhage, with heterogeneous enhancement after contrast administration. Complete excision of the lesion was performed. Signs of previous intra-tumoural haemorrhage were seen intra-operatively. The detailed clinical, radiological and pathological features in this patient are described and compared with existing literature on this type of tumour. Despite benign histological features and a reported favourable post-operative course, there is still limited clinical experience with this type of tumour, however intratumoural haemorrhage may result in morbidity and mortality. This report will help provide better characterization of this entity, improving the diagnosis and potentially reducing mortality in RGTFV.
