The authors report the case of a 6-year-old boy with a spinal cord arteriovenous malformation (AVM) who presented with acute flank pain and a delayed onset of paraplegia. An early diagnosis of a spinal cord AVM was made difficult by the absence of neurological findings on initial evaluation. Included is a description of his clinical course, and the presentation of spinal AVMs to the emergency physician is discussed.
