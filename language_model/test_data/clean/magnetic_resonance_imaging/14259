Thirty-four patients with a presumptive diagnosis of carcinoma of the bladder diagnosed at EUA and cystoscopy have been staged by MRI and the findings correlated with pathology in 15 patients and clinical follow-up, including repeat cystoscopy, in the remainder. MRI is accurate in identifying tumours confined to the bladder wall or extending beyond the wall to involve perivesical fat or adjacent organs. Whilst it is not possible to distinguish between T1, T2 or early T3a tumours they can be distinguished from advanced T3a lesions and this may affect management. MRI is superior to clinical staging, particularly in detecting lymphadenopathy and provides information for optimal radiotherapy planning. The problem of distinguishing between the effects of radiotherapy and suspected recurrent tumour is discussed.
