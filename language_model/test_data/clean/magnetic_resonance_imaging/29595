The evolution of magnetization during repeated application of the double-quantum-(DQ)-CRAZED sequence is analyzed, with the aim of identifying sequence parameters that maximize sensitivity to signal produced by the distant dipole field (DDF). Phase cycling schemes that allow cancellation of signals following undesired coherence pathways are also described. Simulations and imaging experiments carried out at 3 T on phantoms and the human head were used to verify the analysis. The results indicate that in the absence of phase cycling, the DDF-related signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per unit time is maximized using TR=2.05 T1, along with values of the RF flip angles (alpha approximately 90 degrees and beta approximately 60 degrees ), and echo time (TE=T2) that have previously been shown to maximize the DDF-related signal at long TR. However, with TR=2.05 T1 there can also be a significant signal contribution due to stimulated echo effects (up to 40% of the signal for water at 3 T and TE=70 ms). Using a two-step phase cycle, the stimulated echo signal is eliminated and the maximum SNR per unit time occurs for TR=2.76 T1. It is also demonstrated that sensitivity to signal changes caused by small variations in T2 is maximized by setting TE=2T2.
