We report a case with a primary giant cardiac lipoma in the right ventricle attached to the interventricular septum that involved the chordae of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. As the potential for malignancy was low, tricuspid valve replacement and minimum tumor resection were performed to obtain a suitable route to the right ventricular outflow tract.
