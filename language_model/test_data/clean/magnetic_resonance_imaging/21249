INFLAMMATORY myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), also known as inflammatory pseudotumor or plasma cell granulomas, is an uncommon fibro-inflammatory lesion which is composed of inflammatory cells and myofibroblastic spindle cells. Its pathogenesis is still unknown. The tumor commonly occurs in the lung, upper respiratory tract, live, orbit, abdominal membrane, retroperitoneum, and genitourinary tract.It rarely involves the central nerve system, especially the middle cranial fossa. As far as we know, there are no more than 5 reports of IMT that developed in the middle cranial fossa without involving temporal bone. IMT can occur at any age but primarily affects children and young adults. It is difficult to diagnose IMT by clinical and imaging characteristics only. Here we present an 82-year-old female with intracranial IMT arising from the meninges and without involving temporal bone, which was diagnosed as malignant meningioma before operation.
