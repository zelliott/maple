A feasibility study was started in January 2003 on neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by interval cytoreductive surgery (ICS) and postoperative chemotherapy for stage III/IV müllerian carcinomas such as ovarian, tubal and peritoneal carcinomas. The purpose is to assess the safety and efficacy of the treatment starting with NAC and also to know whether we can accurately diagnose these advanced carcinomas by imaging studies, cytologic findings and tumor markers without staging laparotomy or laparoscopy. Fifty-six patients with advanced müllerian carcinomas will be recruited to the study. After confirmation of diagnosis by laparoscopic inspection and biopsies, patients undergo four cycles of chemotherapy as NAC, followed by ICS and an additional four cycles of post-surgical chemotherapy. The primary endpoint is proportion of clinical complete remission after accomplishment of the protocol treatment, while the major secondary endpoint is positive predictive value of diagnosis before laparoscopy regarding tumor origin, histology and stage. Based on the results of this study, we will conduct a phase III study to compare the treatment starting with NAC and primary cytoreductive surgery followed by post-surgical chemotherapy.
