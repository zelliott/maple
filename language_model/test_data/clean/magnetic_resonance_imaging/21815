Pregnancy in a woman with active acromegaly is very rare, because amenorrhea, due to hyperprolactinemia and disturbed pituitary gonadotropin secretion may cause infertility. We report a 28-year-old pregnant woman with untreated acromegaly, who was followed up from early pregnancy to delivery. Her pregnancy was uneventful, and she went into spontaneous labor at 38 weeks and delivered a normal infant. Her serum GH levels were further increased in late pregnancy, followed by decreased in postpartum periods, which may be associated with enlargement of pituitary adenoma during pregnancy. In contrast with serum GH, her serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels were dissociated with her serum GH levels during late pregnant and postpartum period. Her serum GH and IGF-1 levels in late pregnancy were different from the levels in pregnant women with acromegaly reported previously.
