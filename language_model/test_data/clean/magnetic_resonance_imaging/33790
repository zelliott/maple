A case of an amnestic syndrome caused by a subcortical haematoma in the right occipital lobe is reported. A 62-year-old right-handed man presented with a sudden onset of headache to the hospital. On admission, he had a left homonymous hemianopsia, disorientation and recent memory disturbance, but had normal remote memory and digit span. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a subcortical haematoma in the right occipital lobe. These findings suggest that the patient's amnesia was caused by a lesion of the retrosplenial region in the non-dominant hemisphere.
