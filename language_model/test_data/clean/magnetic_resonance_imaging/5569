A 70-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension presented with bilateral abduction deficits consistent with bilateral sixth nerve paresis. A diagnostic evaluation including magnetic resonance imaging and lumbar puncture was unrevealing. The bilateral sixth nerve paresis spontaneously resolved suggesting ischemic or microvascular disease as the underlying etiology.
