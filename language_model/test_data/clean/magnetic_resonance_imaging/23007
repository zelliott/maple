We report a case of solitary metastasis of lung carcinoma into the internal auditory canal. On admission, the 60-year-old patient was complaining about a rapidly developing hearing loss with ipsilateral facial nerve paralysis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intracanalicular tumor, which was interpreted as vestibular schwannoma. After tumor resection, the histopathologic examination revealed a metastasis of a squamous cell carcinoma. Computed tomographic scan and bronchoscopy identified an asymptomatic primary pulmonary neoplasm.
