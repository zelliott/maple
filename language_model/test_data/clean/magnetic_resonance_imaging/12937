We present our own experience of assessment of effect of cell therapy on functional state of the myocardium in patients with lowered contractile capacity of the left ventricular myocardium. Intracoronary administration of stem cells in acute myocardial infarction is a safe method of treatment. It does not cause additional damage of the myocardium and does not provoke appearance of malignant arrhythmia. Cell therapy does not affect global left ventricular function. Data we have obtained demonstrate tendency to improvement of myocardial contractile function in dynamics in the majority of studied patients, including patients of the comparison group. This most probably indicates that the given process has been caused by restoration of blood flow to surviving cardiomyocytes after transluminal coronary angioplasty and improvement of function. Confirmation of participation of administered cells in myocardial contraction and improvement of perfusion requires further clinical investigations.
