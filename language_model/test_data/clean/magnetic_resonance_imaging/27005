Numerous studies testing the use of pacemakers with MRI have been published. Our aim was to analyze these trials to determine the safety of MRI for patients with cardiac pacemakers. We performed a systematic search of peer-reviewed databases. A total of 31 articles were reviewed.

The data are heterogeneous with regard to MRI being considered for patients with pacemakers, and the benefits of the imaging should outweigh the risks.
