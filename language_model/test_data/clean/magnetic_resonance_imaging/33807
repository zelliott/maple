Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be a robust and noninvasive method to assess left ventricular (LV) cardiac function. This study sought to assess volumes and mass calculated with MRI using fast techniques for acquisition and postprocessing, and to compare results in terms of cost-effectiveness with those of radionuclide angiography (RNA) or contrast angiography (CA).

Thirty-five patients and 15 healthy volunteers were studied. All patients underwent an MRI examination during the same period that they underwent ventriculography (26 patients) or radiography (25 patients). From 7 to 11 short-axis slices were acquired with a breath-hold fast-gradient echo-segmented sequence from apex to base. Contours were drawn with an automated border detection software.

Ejection fraction (EF) correlated well between modalities (r = 0.77, P<0.001, for MRI and RNA; r = 0.72, P< 0.001, for MRI and CA).

Cardiac MRI is a fast and accurate technique for estimation of LV volumes, EF, and mass.
