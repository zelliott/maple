We present the design, construction, and performance of a novel multi-injector gas jet delivery capable of operating in a magnetic resonance imaging environment. This apparatus is computer controlled and built with two separate pneumatic circuits enabling gas jet applications at variable sites through four independently activated injectors. Gas jet delivery is fully controllable in terms of pressure, flow rate, gas temperature, application time, and duration of interstimulus interval. We characterized these parameters, considering effects such as pressure drop by flow transport, transient effects, and delays in activation. The system offers new possibilities for use in various biomedical contexts such as, e.g., quantitative sensory testing or dental hypersensitivity assessment.
