A case involving a 14-year-old girl having clival chordoma with symptoms of diplopia, acute esotropia, and bilateral abducens palsy is reported. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a clival tumor invading the posterior edges of the bilateral cavernous sinuses. After removal of the tumor, no ocular manifestations were noted. The importance of acute esotropia as a sign indicating a possible brainstem mass is emphasized.
