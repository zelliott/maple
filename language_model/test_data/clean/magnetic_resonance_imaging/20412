The Lisfranc joint encompasses 6 articulations, weak dorsal ligaments, and strong plantar ligaments. The Lisfranc ligament serves to secure the second metatarsal in the keystone of the midfoot. Traumatic ligament injury and fracture can result in deformity, instability, pain, and degenerative joint disease of the Lisfranc joint. Increased awareness of Lisfranc joint anatomy and advanced imaging has allowed more accurate diagnosis and treatment of this injured joint complex. Nontraumatic degenerative joint disease can also result from congenital and acquired deformity such as first ray insufficiency, abnormal metatarsal parabola, and equinus. Open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) demands accurate anatomic alignment to prevent the need for salvage arthrodesis. Early studies have shown that primary arthrodesis of the medial 3 rays has performed equally well or better than ORIF for the displaced primarily ligamentous and severe injuries. A paradigm shift may emerge as more studies favor primary arthrodesis.
