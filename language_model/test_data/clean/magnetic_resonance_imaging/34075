An 11-month-old, neutered female miniature schnauzer presented with a severe head injury. The dog was treated for the acute effects of craniocerebral trauma and was hospitalized for just over a week. Several weeks later, she became weak and lethargic. A diagnosis of hypoadrenocorticism was confirmed with an adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. An endogenous ACTH assay confirmed secondary hypoadrenocorticism. The dog was tested for hypopituitarism with canine thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine serum assays and an insulin-like growth factor assay. These tests could not confirm panhypopituitarism in this dog. The hypoadrenocorticism was treated with prednisone, and the dog remains controlled adequately three years later.
