In tissue perfusion studies, FT velocity distribution imaging (VDI) intrinsically distinguishes signals from moving blood and volume-averaged tissue. Results in human thyroid gland, in vivo, using VDI line scan technique demonstrated separation of moving blood signal from glandular tissue, while VDI inner-volume echo-planar imaging of brain showed only CSF velocity above the image noise level. New alternating polarity gradient sequences which permit separation of diffusion and slow velocity are discussed. A novel method of 3D FT imaging (two spatial and one velocity dimension) combining inner-volume imaging and echo-planar imaging with velocity resolution of 0.15 mm/s per pixel is demonstrated. A novel graphical method of calculation and display of diffusion dependence in pulsed gradient sequences is presented.
