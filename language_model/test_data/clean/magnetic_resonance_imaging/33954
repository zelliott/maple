We examined a patient who was clinically much better at reporting tactile stimulation when he could see his stimulated hand. Experimentally, we found that he had difficulty detecting taps accompanied by a salient (but not predictive) light located directly above his concealed hand. However, his performance was dramatically improved if the light was attached to a rubber hand situated in line with the patient's hidden hand. Previous studies have suggested that tactile sensitivity can be improved by nearby visual stimulation. However, our effect shows that crossmodal sensory facilitation does not only depend upon simple spatial proximity alone. Rather, a simultaneous visual event dramatically improves perception of touch specifically when it is attributed to the perceiver's stimulated limb.
