Visual and auditory hallucinations in relation to a cerebellar tumor are rarely reported in children. Primary origin of extraventricular neurocytoma (EVN) in the cerebellum is very rare.

We report on a case of a cerebellar EVN in a 13-year-old girl with the initial symptoms of psychiatric manifestations for more than 2 months. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a patchy enhanced tumor in the paramedian left cerebellar region. No obstructive hydrocephalus was noted.

Total surgical removal of the tumor was performed. The tumor was initially diagnosed as an oligodendroglioma. After special immunohistochemical studies, the final definitive diagnosis was an EVN without isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation.

EVNs located in the cerebellum are extremely rare. We discuss the clinical symptoms and histological-immunohistochemical features of this rare tumor in that rare location.
