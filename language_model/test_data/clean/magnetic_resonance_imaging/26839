A 64-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with carcinoid tumor of the large intestine over a decade earlier presented with an acute right periorbital inflammatory reaction. On examination, 2 disc-shaped, gelatinous masses were noted on the right upper and lower tarsal conjunctivae. Excisional biopsies of these masses revealed metastatic carcinoid tumor. Her total burden of metastatic carcinoid tumor continued to increase during 2 years of follow-up, with new metastatic foci in the right choroid, in the left upper and lower eyelids, and subcutaneously in the neck and chest. Despite a comprehensive treatment approach including radionuclide therapy with the somatostatin peptide analog, Y-DOTATOC, the patient succumbed to the disease and died. The authors report an unusual case of a gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor metastatic to the tarsal conjunctivae, eyelids, choroid, and orbit.
