Recurrent ameloblastoma presenting in the temporal fossa is a rarely reported clinical entity. This report presents a case of temporal recurrence that occurred 30 years after the initial surgical treatment. A 45-year-old woman had a history of multiple enucleations for recurrences of her right mandibular ameloblastoma. The tumor was finally resected and reconstructed with an autogenous rib graft, after which the lesion reappeared in the temporal fossa 10 years later. We hypothesized that this temporal ameloblastoma is an implantation lesion seeded via the intraoral wound during the previous resection and reconstruction.
