We reported a case of trigonal cavernous malformation (CM) with intraventricular hemorrhage. This 67-year-old woman experienced sudden onset of loss of consciousness and her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 5 points (E1V1M3) on admission. CT scan demonstrated intraventricular hemorrhage and acute hydrocephalus. Angiography did not demonstrate any vascular abnormality. Ventricular drainage was performed for acute hydrocephalus and the postoperative course was good. CT showed a hyperdense lesion in the left trigone, which was contrast-enhanced on T1-weighted MR. Removal of CM was performed via the left middle temporal sulcus. We conducted a Pub Med search for trigonal CM and found 17 cases. Herein we discuss the symptoms, CT and MR findings and treatment.
