An 11-year-old girl presented with excessive growth, headache, left visual loss and seizures. Her growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) levels were high and magnetic resonance imaging findings showed an invasive macroadenoma. Gross total tumor removal was performed and then radiotherapy and medical therapy were given. During the follow-up, she developed ACTH deficiency, secondary hypothyroidism and hypogonadism requiring replacement therapy. It is still unclear whether the biological characteristics of GH- and PRL-secreting tumors are different in children from those in adults. More data are needed before a definitive conclusion can be established.
