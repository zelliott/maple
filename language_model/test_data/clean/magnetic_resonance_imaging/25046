Chemotherapy-induced encephalopathies occur in a variety of clinical settings and the most detailed accounts have been described following combination methotrexate and radiation therapy. The case described herein developed severe encephalopathy following a high-dose chemotherapy protocol used in the treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the breast. Visual symptoms developed 3 weeks after completing high-dose chemotherapy and peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Over the next several weeks, additional neurologic deficits developed and continued to progress despite various treatment interventions. Diffuse deep gray matter damage was identified on MR imaging and a brain biopsy revealed pathological findings similar in many respects to those described for methotrexate/radiation, cisplatin, BCNU and/or 5 FU/levamisole-related leukoencephalopathy. The patient succumbed to complications resulting from the CNS disorder, 8 weeks after the onset of symptoms. This case is unusual for two reasons. First, the patient developed severe encephalopathy following a high-dose chemotherapy protocol commonly used in the treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma and second, the encephalopathy involved primarily deep gray matter structures rather than white matter.
