We described a case of neurosarcoidosis with necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis in a 22-year-old man. Contrast-enhanced brain computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed intracerebral multiple nodular lesions. Noncaseating and partial necrotizing granulomas were detected in the specimen resected by neurosurgery. In addition, immunohistochemical examination revealed the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme in necrotizing granuloma. Thus, these findings were consistent with neurosarcoidosis. Clinical and pathological presentation, immunological features, and treatment modalities of neurosarcoidosis are discussed.
