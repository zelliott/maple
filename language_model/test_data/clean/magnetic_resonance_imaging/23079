The design of intraoperative suites require significant inputs from the neurosurgeons. Prior consideration of specific surgical objectives before investment of capital resources will enable to surgeon to yield maximum value from the project. We describe the setup of the integrated neurosurgical centre at our institution which comprises of a hybrid high field MRI suite, an OR's consisting of a multi-slice CT scanner and iso-C 3D respectively. The iCT and ioMRI OR's carry ICG angiography capabilities. These ORs are linked to also the Novalis radiosurgery suites and outpatient clinics and offices to facilitate pre-surgical review, planning as well as treatment plans on a common interface via the BRAINSUITE net.Design considerations include right sit-ing of imaging equipment as well as a focus of ergonomics and design features to maximize workflow. Whenever possible, standard neurosurgical instrumentation is utilized. With widespread availability of technology, neuro-imaging in the operating room may become more prevalent. The surgeon is the lead individual in the team with regards to planning and designing the ORs to accommodate the new imaging equipment.
