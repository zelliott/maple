Velocity-encoded Cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure blood flow in the anterior tibial artery (AT), posterior tibial artery (PT), and popliteal artery of adult human subjects (mean age 29 yr) before and after 90 s of ankle dorsiflexion exercise. Before exercise, mean flow, peak systolic velocity, and end-diastolic velocity in AT were 8.1 +/- 1.6 (SE, n = 6) ml/min, 26.9 +/- 2.6 cm/s, and -0.6 +/- 0.4 cm/s, respectively. After exercise, mean flow and peak systolic velocity in AT increased by 19-fold and 3-fold, respectively, and end-diastolic velocity increased to 8.7 +/- 1.1 cm/s. Flow in popliteal artery above its bifurcation was similar to the sum of flows in AT and PT, both before and after exercise. Flow in AT declined exponentially after exercise with a mean half-time of 4 min. The results demonstrate the utility of MR phase-encoded flow-velocity measurements for physiological studies of peripheral vascular dynamics after exercise.
