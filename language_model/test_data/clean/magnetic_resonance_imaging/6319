The use of a phase mapping technique for detection of brain perfusion is described. The method was used in a patient with epilepsia partialis continua and displayed an area of abnormal perfusion in the frontal lobe during the ictal phase. Following improved treatment the perfusion pattern was near normal 12 weeks later.
