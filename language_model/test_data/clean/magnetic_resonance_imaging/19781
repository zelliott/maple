Wrist pain is a common presenting complaint in patients both for the hand specialist and the primary care physician. Knowledge of wrist anatomy and a thorough and systematic wrist examination remain the mainstays of evaluation. Radiologic as well as arthroscopic technology and techniques continue to evolve and provide useful adjuncts to wrist evaluation that expand our diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities.
