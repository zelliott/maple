Meningeal melanocytomas are rare benign neoplasms of meningeal melanocytes, and are most frequently located in the posterior fossa and along the cervical spinal cord. We report a case of a 16 year-old girl with a melanocytoma located in the upper cervical part of the spinal canal. The patient presented severe neurological signs, but had a very good outcome following surgery.
