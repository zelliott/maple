Primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) are the second most common neoplasms in children and the leading cause of death in this patient population. The primary objective of this article is to describe the most common pediatric brain tumors and to offer an overview of their respective imaging features, primarily on magnetic resonance imaging. Precise anatomic characterization is essential for developing an appropriate differential diagnosis. Once equipped with this critical information, physicians should be better able to make firm diagnoses, leading to improved disease management and patient outcomes in the setting of CNS tumors of childhood.
