This study evaluated the long-term follow-up results of balloon angioplasty (BA) in adolescent and adult patients with discrete coarctation of the aorta.

Although the immediate and intermediate term results of BA for patients with aortic coarctation (AC) have been encouraging, there is a paucity of data on long-term follow-up results.

This basis of this study was follow-up of 49 patients (mean age, 22 +/- 7 years) undergoing BA for discrete AC at median interval of 10.2 years, including cardiac catheterization, magnetic resonance imaging, and Doppler echocardiography.

No early or late deaths occurred. Balloon angioplasty produced a reduction in peak AC gradient from 66 +/- 23 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI]: 59.5 to 72.7) to 10.8 +/- 7 mm Hg (95% CI: 8.8 to 12.5) (p < 0.0001). Follow-up catheterization 12 months later revealed a residual gradient of 6.2 +/- 6 mm Hg (95% CI: 4.4 to 7.9) (p < 0.001). Four patients (7.5%) with suboptimal initial outcome with peak gradient >20 mm Hg had successful repeat angioplasty. Aneurysm developed at the site of dilation in four patients (7.5%). Magnetic resonance imaging follow-up results revealed no new aneurysm or appreciable changes in the size of pre-existing aneurysms, and no recoarctation was observed. Also, no appreciable changes in the Doppler gradient across the AC site were noted. The blood pressure had normalized without medication in 31 (63%) of the 49 patients.

Long-term results of BA for discrete AC are excellent and should be considered as first option for treatment of this disease.
