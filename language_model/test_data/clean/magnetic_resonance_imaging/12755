A 10-year-old boy with unilateral ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and proptosis underwent diagnostic examination. Symptoms of headache, nausea, dyspnea, fatigue, weakness, and loss of appetite began 14 days after the onset of ocular manifestations and 7 days before he was examined. Complete blood count showed an increased white blood cell count with 64% blast cells, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient was transferred to a pediatric hematology unit, where he underwent bone marrow aspiration biopsy. Bilateral ocular inflammatory findings and left-sided mild proptosis became evident. He was diagnosed as having B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma infiltrating the bilateral cavernous and sphenoid sinuses.
