Brain metastasis is one of the most common diagnoses encountered by neurologists, neurosurgeons, radiologists, and oncologists. The aim of this article is to review imaging modalities used in the diagnosis and follow-up of brain metastases. Through the use of various imaging techniques more accurate preoperative diagnosis and more precise intraoperative planning can be made. Post-treatment evaluation can also be refined through the use of these imaging techniques.
