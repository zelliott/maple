Parainflammatory leukoencephalomyelitis is a broad term used to include the spectrum of disorders that affect the central nervous system following infection, immunization, or other noxious stimuli. There is a wide range of clinical and pathologic severity, ranging from acute cerebellar ataxia to acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalopathy. With the improved survival of these patients, magnetic resonance imaging provides a window to the pathologic process, which can aid in the long-term management of these patients. Although lesions of the brainstem and spinal cord correlate well to clinical symptoms, multiple cortical lesions may be present without specific localizing signs. The distribution of magnetic resonance lesions is different from that commonly seen in multiple sclerosis. In some cases, prolonged immunosuppression may be required to prevent recrudescence of the inflammatory response.
