A patient who had undergone his third orthotopic liver transplantation nearly 9 years prior to presentation developed worsening hepatic and renal function, as well as severe bilateral lower extremity edema. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated vena caval thrombosis from the suprahepatic venous anastomosis to the infrarenal inferior vena cava, obstructing the renal veins. This was treated by percutaneous placement of metallic stents from the renal veins to the right atrium. At 16 months clinical follow-up, the patient continues to do well.
