Changes in vision after non-ophthalmic surgery are a serious complication that can have devastating consequences due to its potential irreversibility. This not only leads to medical problems, but also legal ones. Many causes that affect sight during the peri-operative period have been identified, whether due to optic nerve damage or of extra-ocular origin (in the neuro-optic pathways and/or cerebral cortex). AU these may have a multifactorial origin, and there is still controversy as regards it pathogenesis and treatment. We present the case of a thoracic surgery patient who had a bilateral amaurosis in the post-operative period, which had a favourable outcome.
