Injuries to the lateral and medial supporting structures of the knee can be significantly disabling and somewhat difficult to detect and evaluate clinically. An accurate imaging evaluation of these structures requires the use of the appropriate MR imaging sequences and the detailed knowledge of the anatomic structures that are present in these locations. Normal function is dependent on the integrity of the complex functional structures and effective clinical treatment, including surgical repair, of these structures is predicated on an optimal diagnostic evaluation. A successful diagnostic evaluation can expedite treatment and provide the best opportunity for a favorable long-term outcome.
