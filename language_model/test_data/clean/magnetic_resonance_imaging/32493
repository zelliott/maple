To study the adaptation process and extent of articular cartilage in the canine knee joint to different modes of movements and to investigate if levels of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), matrix metalloproteinases-1 (MMP-1), matrix metalloproteinases-3 (MMP-3), and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) in serum and synovial fluid can be used to predict effectively early sports injury and remolding degree of articular cartilage in the canine knee.

Twenty adult dogs divided randomly into three groups (eight in the common training group, Training Group; eight in the intensified training group, Intensified Group; and four in the Control Group) were trained daily at different intensities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were performed regularly (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 weeks) to investigate changes of articular cartilage in the canine knee, while concentrations of COMP, MMP-1, MMP-3, and TIMP-1 in serum and synovial fluid were measured by ELISA assays. All of the dogs were euthanized after training for 10 weeks, and all of the knee joints were taken out to be examined histologically.

We could find imaging changes of early sport injury of articular cartilage in the Training Group and Intensified Group by MRI examination after 2 weeks of training; the damage images were most severe in 4-6 weeks, and then lightened gradually. We could not find the difference of cartilage injury and repair degree in MRI images between these two groups at different time points. Elevations of levels of COMP, MMP-1, MMP-3, TIMP-1, and MMP-3/TIMP-1 in serum and synovial fluid were seen during the training period, and their levels changed remarkably at different times. Levels of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-3/TIMP-1 in the Intensified Group were lower than that in the Training Group in general, and levels of COMP were higher, which hinted that the injury trend of articular cartilage in the Intensified Group was lower than that in the Training group, and the repair trend was higher. Furthermore, there were statistically significant associations between biomarker levels in serum and in synovial fluid. Histological examinations in 10 weeks demonstrated that the signs of cartilage damage and repair in canine knee joint in the Training Group and the Intensified Group were obvious, and the Intensified Group could do better than the Training Group in promoting remodeling reconstruction of articular cartilage.

High-intensity and repetitive movement may easily induce sports injury, and it is followed with a repair process; intensified training can do better than common training in promoting remodeling reconstruction of articular cartilage. The sensitivity of these biomarkers reflecting articular cartilage pathological changes is better than MRI, and the associated application of several biomarkers to predict the extent of damage and repair, as well as changes of metabolism in articular cartilage, and to monitor change of disease course has very good value for clinical application.
