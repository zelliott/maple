Patients with Muir-Torre syndrome, an autosomal-dominant familial tumor condition caused by germline mutation of the DNA mismatch repair genes, MSH2 or MLH1, present with tumors of the sebaceous gland and visceral malignancies characterized by microsatellite instability. Here we show development of glioblastoma multiforme in a patient with Muir-Torre syndrome. Immunohistochemical analysis of the brain tumor and colon cancer revealed loss of the DNA mismatch repair gene detected by the genetic test, suggesting a pathogenic link.
