The authors describe a patient with Carney's complex who presented with sciatica due to a lumbar nerve root sheath tumor. A far-lateral approach was used to resect a nonpsammomatous melanotic schwannoma. Neurosurgeons surgically treating peripheral nerve sheath tumors should be aware of the features of Carney complex because the extent of the preoperative evaluation and postoperative management of an otherwise routine surgical condition can be significantly affected.
