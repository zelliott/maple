Tumors metastatic to the pituitary gland are uncommon, and they are difficult to differentiate radiologically from pituitary adenomas. We retrospectively reviewed the MR examinations and clinical records of nine patients with radiographic and/or clinical evidence of pituitary metastases. The most common clinical symptoms included cranial nerve deficits (67%) and/or pituitary dysfunction (30%). Both occurred acutely and progressed rapidly over 1-4 weeks in all patients. Cranial nerve involvement was predominantly multiple (83%), a reflection of involvement of the adjacent cavernous sinus. In contrast to previous reports indicating a predilection for symptoms related to posterior lobe involvement (71%), our study shows that symptoms related to the anterior lobe are as common as posterior lobe symptoms. Useful MR findings included a relatively small, enhancing pituitary lesion (< or = 1.5 cm in 56%) that was relatively isointense to brain on both T1- and T2-weighted images (78%) and involvement of the hypothalamus/pituitary infundibulum (44%) or cavernous sinus (56%).
