Tuberculosis is common in the developing world and in developed nations secondary to increasing immunocompromise in the population. It commonly causes meningitis and parenchymal tuberculomas. We present a case of an unusual masslike "giant" extra-axial tuberculoma during pregnancy. Unusual morphology and size at imaging made meningioma a close differential. MR spectroscopy served to complement MR imaging, providing diagnostic confirmation and depicted findings characteristic of a tuberculoma.
