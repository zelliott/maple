Uterine leiomyomas commonly undergo degenerative change, which can lead to variable imaging features. Diffuse hydropic change is an unusual form of degeneration that presents a considerable diagnostic challenge to both radiologists and pathologists, as it can mimic a malignant neoplasm on imaging and at histological analysis. We present the case of a giant diffuse hydropic leiomyoma presenting in the first trimester of pregnancy in a 36-year-old woman, the imaging features of which were suggestive of a more aggressive neoplasm. The sonographic and MRI appearances of the lesion are discussed, and the varied imaging features of leiomyomas are reviewed.
