The feasibility and efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) has offered new possibilities for treatment of movement disorders. Mechanical failure of the DBS system is a potential complication. Here we report five patients who presented with mechanical failure of the DBS system. Radiographs of the skull and cervical spine were analyzed for disruptions. Seven instances of lead breakage near the connection of the DBS electrode with the extension wire were identified. In one patient this was in the paramastoid area over the skull, while in all others were in the supraclavicular location. The patients consisted of three men and two women ranging in age from 24 to 78 (at the time of first operation), one person suffering three breakages. The length of spanned time from implantation to presentation ranged from 8 to 32 months. Palpation of the electrode lead wire in the neck for breakage proved unreliable. Radiography localized the site of breakage in all but one patient who required intraoperative exploration, which revealed that although the lead wire was disrupted, the two ends remained in contact. The fact that all breakages occurred near the connection wire suggests that to-and-fro motion of the DBS electrode with repeated head turning leads to fatigue and eventual disruption.
