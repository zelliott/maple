To report the results of surgery for tendinopathy of the main body of the patellar tendon.

Retrospective study.

A teaching hospital of the University of London.

Twenty-eight patients reviewed at an average follow-up of 42 months from surgery for tendinopathy of the main body of the patellar tendon after failed conservative treatment.

Exploration of the affected patellar tendon, stripping of the paratenon, excision of pathological areas, and multiple longitudinal tenotomies.

Postoperative complications, ability to return to sport, and subjective satisfaction, as measured by formal clinical assessment or telephone questionnaire.

At follow-up, 23 patients were completely free of pain and had resumed full sporting activity at the same preoperative level. Three patients were improved enough to have returned to their preoperative sporting level or just below it. In two patients, the initial operation failed. In the patients who resumed sport, the average time from surgery to resuming full sporting activity was 7 months (range 6 weeks to 12 months). The most common early postoperative complications were wound hematoma and superficial infection. The most common late complications were related to the incision, with anterior knee pain on kneeling and skin dysesthesia.

Surgical decompression of the patellar tendon with multiple longitudinal tenotomies is an effective treatment for patellar tendinopathy. In the middle term, patients do not seem to relapse once they have recovered, whereas those who do not respond to surgery do not recover at all and may need a new operation.
