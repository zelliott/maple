The visual world consists of static pictures as well as of coherent visual events. The present study investigated neural substrates underlying the perception of coherence of visual events that evolves over time. We measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while adults watched briefly presented static images that were extracted from movie clips depicting coherent visual events. The images were presented either in the coherent order as they were displayed in the movie clips or in a random order. Relative to the random order presentation condition, static images presented in the coherent order generated stronger activation in the right middle temporal cortex, the right posterior superior temporal cortex, and the right inferior postcentral gyrus. The results provide neuroimaging evidence for the dominance of the right hemisphere in perceiving coherent visual events.
