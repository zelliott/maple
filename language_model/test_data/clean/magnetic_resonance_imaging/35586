The present study investigated the functional reorganization of ipsilateral and contralateral auditory pathways in hemispherectomized subjects. Functional reorganization was assessed using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and stimulation with complex sounds presented binaurally and monaurally. For neurologically intact control subjects, results showed that binaural stimulations evoked balanced activity in both hemispheres while monaural stimulations induced strong contralateral activity and weak ipsilateral activity. The results obtained from hemispherectomized subjects were substantially different from those obtained from control subjects. Specifically, activity in the intact hemisphere showed a significant decrease in response to contralateral stimulation but, concomitantly, an increase in response to ipsilateral stimulation. The present findings suggest that a substantial functional reorganization takes place in the auditory pathways following an early hemispherectomy. The exact nature of this functional reorganization remains to be specified.
