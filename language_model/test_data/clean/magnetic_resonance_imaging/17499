Pleural fibromas are rare malignant or benign tumors requiring pathology study for certain diagnosis. From January 1985 to January 2001, 7 patients underwent surgery in our unit for pleural fibroma: 4 females and 3 males, mean age 60 years. The inaugural symptoms were chest pain (3 patients), dyspnea (2 patients), joint pain in a patient with Pierre-Marie pneumonic hypertrophic osteo-arthropathy, and acute hypoglycemia. Radiological investigations were decisive in orienting the diagnosis (chest X-ray, ultrasound, computed tomography and MRI). Surgical resection and pathological study of the surgical specimen is required to confirm the diagnosis. Patients should be carefully followed due to the risk of malignant recurrence.
