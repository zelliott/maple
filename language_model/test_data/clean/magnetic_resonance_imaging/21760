Seven recent malignant external otitis are described. The authors report criteria of both etiology, bacteriologic, radionuclide scanning computed tomography. Now, for the positive diagnosis, the radionuclide scanning is essential. The computed tomographic scan provided the best anatomic imaging of the infection process. The treatment of choice is systemic antibiotic therapy as fluoroquinolones antibiotic. This antibiotic is active against P. Aeruginosa and has an excellent bone penetration. Only one patient died and another suffered from osteomyelitis of the base of the skull. The radionuclide scanning is very important for criteria of healing, particularly about stoppage of systemic antibiotic therapy.
