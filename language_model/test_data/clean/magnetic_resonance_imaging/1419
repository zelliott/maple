A case of spontaneous dissection of the cervical internal carotid artery documented by angiography and MRI is reported. Angiography showed an irregular stenosis of the upper part of the cervical internal carotid artery extending up to the base of the skull, suggestive of spontaneous dissection. The diagnosis was confirmed beyond doubt by MRI which showed a sub-intimal collection of blood with a typical hyperintense appearance.
