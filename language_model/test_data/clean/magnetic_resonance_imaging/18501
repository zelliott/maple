Due to the development of new surface coils and the use of thin slices, MRI has become an essential diagnostic tool in wrist pathology. After several technical considerations, the authors describe the normal MRI appearance of the various anatomical structures of the wrist, particularly the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex of the wrist and the elements of the carpal tunnel. They review the principal indications for MRI: chronic diseases such as carpal tunnel syndrome and traumatic ligamentous and cartilaginous lesions. The bone marrow lesions detected in the presence of occult fractures and osteonecrosis of the lunate or scaphoid are then briefly considered. The diagnostic criteria of median nerve compression (carpal tunnel syndrome) include morphological and signal changes in the nerve, abnormal palmar convexity of the flexor retinaculum and signs of tenosynovitis of the intracarpal flexor tendons. However, in practice, MRI is only useful when there is disagreement between the clinical and EMG findings and in postoperative recurrences, in which case it may reveal insufficient section of the retinaculum or the presence of exuberant postoperative fibrosis responsible for persistent nerve compression. Traumatic tears of the triangular fibrocartilage are characterised by a linear high signal intensity image (on T1 and T2 weighted sequences), usually situated in the periphery of the articular disk. Degenerative lesions tend to be central, within the disk and are frequently observed after the age of 40 years.
