The surgical intraoperative findings in spinal cord vasculitis have not been previously described. The imaging appearances can mimic intramedullary spinal cord tumours. We present a patient with spinal cord vasculitis and mixed intraoperative findings of spinal vascular lesion and intramedullary tumour. Based on the absence of a confirmatory intraoperative smear, vessel obliteration and tumour debulking was avoided, preventing a catastrophic surgical complication. The limited literature and management options are also reviewed.
