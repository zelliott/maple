A healthy 13-year-old girl, previously diagnosed with amblyopia in her right eye, was seen in consultation after her vision continued to decrease.

A complete ophthalmologic examination including visual field testing and optic nerve photography was performed in the neuro-ophthalmologic clinic. Magnetic resonance imaging study was also obtained.

Visual sensory deficits and pale optic nerves were noted on clinical examination. Visual field testing showed a chiasmatic junctional defect. Magnetic resonance imaging verified a large chiasmatic mass, histologically proven to be a juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma.

Early recognition of signs and symptoms of chiasmatic lesions is essential for preventing visual loss.
