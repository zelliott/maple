A 7-month old infant presented with an effusion and multiple lesions in his spleen. A diagnosis of lymphangiomatosis was made based on chylous effusion and an MRI demonstrating numerous enhancing lesions within the spleen on T2-weighed images. Conservative measures, including the withdrawal of feeds and octreotide, did not significantly reduce the rate of chyle production and increasing requirement for respiratory support. Resection of the patient's spleen and partial pleurectomy were associated with a dramatic improvement in his condition. At 27 months the patient was well with no evidence of further lymphangiomas or a recurrence of his chylothoraces.
