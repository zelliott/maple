We report a 4-year-old child who developed hemiplegia 6 months after varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection. Cerebral angiography showed complete occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery with basal moyamoya vessels. Elevation of anti-VZV antibody in the cerebrospinal fluid indicated central nervous system involvement. The association between VZV cerebral angitis and unilateral occlusion of right middle cerebral artery is discussed.
