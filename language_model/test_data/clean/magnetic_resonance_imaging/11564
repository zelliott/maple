A 34-year-old woman was hospitalised with hypotension, lethargy and ventricular tachycardia, five months after an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. Laboratory values were compatible with anterior (abnormal concentrations of adrenocorticotropin hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, prolactin) and posterior (diabetes insipidus) pituitary gland insufficiency. An MRI scan revealed that there was no pituitary enlargement and that the pituitary stalk was normal. The prompt recognition of hypophysitis as a potentially fatal condition is important, as a life-saving treatment is available.
