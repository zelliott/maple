To determine and compare the imaging features of hepatic alveolar Echinococcosis using color Doppler US, CT, and MRI.

Abdominal CT and MRI with and without contrast agents and color Doppler US were performed on seven patients with hepatic alveolar Echinococcosis. The lesions were evaluated for location, features of echogenicity, intensity and density, calcification, and vascular, hilar, and perihepatic involvement. The diagnosis was confirmed histopathologically in all patients.

Six patients had solitary lesions, and one displayed multiple lesions. The lesions were generally seen as heterogeneous and hyper- or hypoechoic when imaged with color Doppler US, hypodense with CT, and hypointense with MRI, in comparison with the liver parenchyma. Calcification, central necrosis, and small peripheral cysts were observed in six, seven, and four patients, respectively. Vascular flow or contrast enhancement was not observed in any of the cases. A look at the respective advantages of each method reveals that calcification was best rendered visible via CT, small peripheral cysts with T2-weighted MRI, central necrosis with CT and MRI, and perihepatic invasion with multiplanar MRI. Vascular involvement was revealed by all methods.

Color Doppler US, CT, and MR imaging function extremely well as complementary methods in the diagnosis of HAE. Color Doppler US should be performed in these patients owing to its ability to efficiently detect the disease. Knowledge of imaging characteristics makes it possible to radiologically ascertain an early diagnosis.
