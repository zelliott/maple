Muscle volume investigation by different imaging techniques has proven useful in the diagnosis and follow up of treatment in dysthyroid ophthalmopathy. However, no study on muscle volume measurement by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been done in this disease.

Six patients with monocular or asymmetric binocular dysthyroid ophthalmopathy and eight controls were examined with orbital MRI using a surface coil. In the muscle volume study, 2 mm coronal slices were used for measuring the six extraocular muscles (EOM), i.e., medial rectus (MR), lateral rectus (LR) superior rectus (SR), inferior rectus (IR), superior oblique (SO), and inferior oblique (IO) muscles, as well as the orbital fatty tissue (OFT). In the muscle thickness study, 3 mm transverse and sagittal images were used for measuring the four rectus muscles during fixation in different gaze positions in horizontal and vertical planes.

In dysthyroid ophthalmopathy, the muscle volume of the six external eye muscles was significantly larger than in controls, except for the IO. The IR and MR showed the largest increase in muscle volume. The correlation between muscle thickness and different degrees of eye deflections was linear for all four rectus muscles both in patients and controls, and no significant differences in the slopes of the regression lines were found. The volume of OFT was significantly larger in patients than in controls, and the change in volume was larger than that of muscle volume.

MRI technique makes it possible to observe and evaluate quantitatively the volume of all six extraocular muscles and the orbital fatty tissue in dysthyroid ophthalmopathy. It also makes it possible to evaluate changes in morphology during eye muscle contraction.
