Upper tract dilatation presenting as renal pelvis dilatation with or without ureteric dilatation is one of the more common abnormalities detected on prenatal ultrasound scanning. The majority of cases are due to pelvi-ureteric and vesico-ureteric junction anomalies, and vesico-ureteric reflux. Prenatal diagnosis with ultrasound may be aided by biochemical analysis of fetal blood and urine. The natural history of prenatally detected abnormalities remains under review. Precise diagnosis, and therefore prognosis, may not be made until after birth.
