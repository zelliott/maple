This paper reports the case of a young patient with extensive pre-frontal damage in whom we tested the hypothesis that intensive training improves executive performance as assessed by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). As long as her declarative memory, complex perceptual abilities and global cognitive status were spared, we surmised that any deficit in executive learning would have occurred in relative isolation. We showed that her abnormal performance on the WCST, both on the standard as well as on the post-instruction condition, was due to an impairment of shifting attention across perceptual dimensions (extra-dimensional). In contrast, her ability to shift attention within perceptual categories (intra-dimensional) was spared, as were her declarative memory, object and visuospatial perception, oral language comprehension and praxis (ideomotor, tool use and constructional). This case supports the hypothesis that executive amnesia is a type of amnesic disorder distinct from the classic amnesic syndrome due to mamillo-temporomedial damage. As such, it is probably closely related to procedural learning and may depend on the same fronto-subcortical loops that mediate the actual execution of behaviour.
