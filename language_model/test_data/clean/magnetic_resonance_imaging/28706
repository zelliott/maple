A series of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of 188 pathologic and normal hip joints has been reviewed to evaluate usefulness of this method for 3-D imaging of this joint. The age of patients ranged from 3 years to 22 years. MRI was done for diagnosis, pre-operative planning or post-operative assessment. Fifty-four hips were normal. Normal hip, dysplastic and the one after septic arthritis have been delineated. All MRI examinations were done with Magnetic Impact. Spin Echo, Turbo Spin Echo and FLASH 3D FAT SAT techniques were employed, all three planes included. All hip joint elements were separately described, the difference between the immature and adult hip were presented. Objective parameters were introduced. MRI proved extremely useful for diagnostics, surgery planning and follow-up of immature hip joint.
