The recent approval of an "MR-conditional" pacemaker system by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allows patients with that pacemaker system to undergo MRI examinations within specific conditions. These examinations must be attended by radiology health care professionals with training for the use of the pacemaker system.

Radiologists should be knowledgeable of the specific limitations with regard to patient isocenter and coil positioning within the required 1.5-T MR system and the importance that the pacer be programmed before and after scanning.
