To evaluate the effectiveness of vertebroplasty in symptomatic vertebral haemangiomas (VHs) with no neurological deficit, with or without features of aggressiveness in imaging studies.

A retrospective study was conducted to review 31 consecutive patients with symptomatic VHs that underwent vertebroplasty procedures (13 males, 18 females; mean age, 57.5 years), for a total of 33 affected vertebral levels (range, T4-L5 levels). Pre procedure radiological examinations were reviewed. The presence of predominant soft tissue stroma on CT, low signals on T1W of MRI, epidural tissue, and cortical erosion are considered features of aggressiveness. The clinical effects were evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and modified Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) at the pre and each postoperative follow-up time point (mean follow-up of 15.8 months).

Symptomatic VHs with no signs of aggressiveness were observed in 26 lesions and those with signs of aggressiveness in 7 lesions. Vertebroplasty was successfully performed under fluoroscopic guidance with a unipedicular approach in 16 levels, a bipedicular approach in 17 levels. VAS scores and RDQ scores were significantly improved after vertebroplasty (P < 0.001). Extraosseous cement leakage was observed in 4 patients without clinical complications.

Vertebroplasty is an optional treatment for symptomatic VHs with no neurological deficit.

• Vertebral haemangiomas with or without aggressive signs may cause pain. • Radiological signs of aggressiveness include evidence of lesions that contain less fat predominance, evidence of epidural soft tissue and evidence of cortical erosion. • Vertebroplasty provides effective treatment for symptomatic vertebral haemangiomas causing no neurological deficit.
