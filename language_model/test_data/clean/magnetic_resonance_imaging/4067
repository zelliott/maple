The motion sensitivity of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be exploited to measure the motion patterns within the heart wall and thus to noninvasively calculate the intramyocardial strain. The resulting large data sets pose a challenge for visualization, but offer the potential of a greatly improved picture of cardiac dynamics. This may have both basic research and clinical applications.
