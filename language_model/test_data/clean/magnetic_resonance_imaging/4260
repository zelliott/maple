Measures of intelligence, neuropsychological functions, academic skills, and behavioral adjustment were obtained at school-age from children born preterm with no hydrocephalus (N=29), arrested hydrocephalus (N=19), and shunted hydrocephalus (N=17), and a term comparison group (N=23). Most children also received concurrent neurological examinations and MRI brain scans. Results revealed significantly poorer neurobehavioral development in all four domains in preterm children with shunted hydrocephalus. Despite abnormal MRI findings in virtually all children with arrested hydrocephalus, significant differences between preterm children with arrested hydrocephalus and those with no hydrocephalus were largely in areas involving attentional and academic skills. Preterm children with no hydrocephalus tended to show poorer motor development relative to term children. Neurological abnormalities were restricted to children with spasticity in the arrested (N=2) and shunted (N=10) groups. These results highlight the importance of separating cases according to residual neurological and neuroimaging abnormalities in accounting for variations in the neurobehavioral development of preterm, low-birth-weight infants.
