It is hypothesized that pauses at major syntactic boundaries (i.e., grammatical pauses), but not ungrammatical (e.g., word search) pauses, are planned by a high-level cognitive mechanism that also controls the rate of articulation around these junctures. Real-time magnetic resonance imaging is used to analyze articulation at and around grammatical and ungrammatical pauses in spontaneous speech. Measures quantifying the speed of articulators were developed and applied during these pauses as well as during their immediate neighborhoods. Grammatical pauses were found to have an appreciable drop in speed at the pause itself as compared to ungrammatical pauses, which is consistent with our hypothesis that grammatical pauses are indeed choreographed by a central cognitive planner.
