Tears of the superior portion of the glenoid labrum in patients without shoulder instability have recently been described. These tears, which include the "anchor" of the biceps tendon to the labrum, have been labeled "SLAP lesions" (superior labrum anterior to posterior). This study was performed to determine the magnetic resonance (MR) findings in patients with SLAP lesions. Retrospective review of the shoulder arthroscopy reports on patients who underwent MR imaging using a 1.5-T unit and subsequent arthroscopy by a single surgeon identified six patients with SLAP lesions (average age 36 years, range 17-65 years). MR images demonstrated atypical morphology indicative of tear in the superior portion of the labrum in four of the six patients, but only one tear had been identified preoperatively. Radiologists interpreting MR images of the shoulder should be aware of the MR findings of SLAP lesions as these tears can be a significant cause of patient disability and are difficult to diagnose clinically.
