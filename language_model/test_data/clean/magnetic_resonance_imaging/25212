MR imaging has become a valuable modality in the evaluation of the female pelvis. In many cases, it follows the performance of HSG or US. These cases include infertility and pelvic pain. In some cases, it should serve as the test of choice. This is true in the local staging of cervical cancer and the evaluation of pain or disability in the pregnant patient. Finally, in the evaluation of advanced gynecologic cancers, it is usually a secondary choice with CT preferred.
