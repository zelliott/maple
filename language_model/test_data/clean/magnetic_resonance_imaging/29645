Inverted papilloma of the nose and paranasal sinuses is noted for its high rate of recurrence. The feasibility of endoscopic treatment for inverted papilloma has been shown in the literature; however, reports discussing the efficacy of endoscopic surgery for recurrent diseases are rare. The study determined the effectiveness of endoscopic surgery for recurrent inverted papilloma and described when endoscopic medial maxillectomy was indicated.

Retrospective.

Seventeen patients with recurrent inverted papilloma were treated over a 10-year period. Krouse's staging system was used for tumor grading. Because of the extent of the tumor in the majority (70.6%) of the patients, en bloc resection could not be regularly achieved; therefore, sequential segmental endoscopic surgery was the chosen treatment. Some diseases that extensively involved the maxillary sinus were treated by the combination of endoscopic medial maxillectomy (EMM) and sequential segmental surgery (SSES) to extirpate the whole disease.

Efficacy was evaluated strictly by radiographic study. Successful treatment was accomplished in 14 (82.4%) patients. Three (17.6%) patients had residual disease; each required one revision surgery. None of the patients had recurrence at the time of writing. There were no major complications or associated malignancies encountered in the patients.

Endoscopic surgery is an effective treatment for recurrent inverted papilloma. Precise determination of the sites of tumor origin and attachment during the operation is the key to the successful treatment. Recurrent inverted papilloma tends to behave more aggressively and has a higher postoperative recurrence rate than the primary lesion. Stage III disease had a higher recurrence rate (27.3%) than that of other stages (0%).
