Avulsion fractures of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus are uncommon and must be differentiated from a loose body. The authors present a displaced avulsion fracture of the medial meniscus posterior horn through the intercondylar notch into the anteromedial compartment of the knee, which was treated by arthroscopic reduction and internal fixation using pull-out suture technique.
