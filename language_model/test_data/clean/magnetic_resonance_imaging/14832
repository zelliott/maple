An intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suite (ie, a type of hybrid OR) is a high-risk zone that requires well-defined safety procedures to avoid adverse events related to magnetic forces. At one facility, the opening of an MRI suite necessitated the creation of a safety plan to establish guidelines, procedures, education, and nursing care specific to the use of MRI technology in the operative environment. Formation of a steering committee enabled a multidisciplinary approach to planning and implementation. The addition of two new perioperative nursing roles (ie, MRI control room monitor, MRI safety nurse) addressed staffing challenges related to strictly enforcing MRI safety procedures and delineating duties different from those of the RN circulator. Benefits of a safe approach to an MRI-integrated operative setting included the elimination of an entire surgical experience for patients who underwent additional resection of the tumor during their initial surgical procedure instead of postoperatively or during a subsequent return to the OR.
