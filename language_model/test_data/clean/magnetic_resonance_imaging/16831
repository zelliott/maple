An analysis of factors was made which influence the choice of approach trajectories in preoperative planning the diagnostic and medical stereotaxic interventions in patients with intracerebral tumors. Stereotaxic operations were planned and fulfilled on 124 patients with glial tumors of different supratentorial localizations. In planning trajectories with using MRI the passage of stereotaxic cannula through the pial folds and functionally significant zones of the brain were avoided. At the postoperative period no parenchymatous hemorrhages were noted in the approach zone, even with great number of trajectories. It was also noted that in passing the stereotaxic instrument through the lateral venticles of the brain the risk of complications was minimal.
