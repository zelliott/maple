Solitary plasmocytoma (SP) represent only about 5% of plasma cell neoplasia. Most patients have generalized disease, that is, multiple myeloma (MM). Solitary bone plasmocytoma (SBP) is a localized plasma cell tumor and is a very rare disease in young patients. We reported here, a case of SPB in a 14-year-old girl with a 10-year disease-free survival after an aggressive treatment. The relationship of SBP to MM continues to be controversial. Recommendations on the diagnosis and management of SBP in adults, based on a literature search and consensus of expert opinion, were recently published on behalf of the Guidelines Working Group of the United Kingdom Myeloma Forum 1. MRI of the spine is necessary to assess local disease. Radiotherapy with doses of 45-50 Gy is the recommended treatment and gives a high rate of local control (83-96%). Chemotherapy remains controversial in contrast to MM, in which intensive chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) is widely accepted. At the present time, considering the good prognosis of patients with a normal MRI at diagnosis and a complete disappearance of the M protein after radiotherapy, we believe that ABMT should be reserved for relapse or primary therapeutic failure.
