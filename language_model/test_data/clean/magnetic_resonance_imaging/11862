Nasopharynx carcinomas (NPC) are a very special head and neck cancer, in term of epidemiology, clinic and pathology. Endemic disease in South East Asia, undifferentiated nasopharynx carcinoma are very frequent CT scan and NMR allow a better knowledge of the modalities of the clinical presentation. Prognostic factors include local and regional extension. NPC is a wellknown radiosensitive disease with a dose-response curve well established. Modern imaging modalities and modification of the ballistic explain the amelioration of the local control and the diminution of therapeutic sequellae. Brachytherapy is an interesting modalities for the boost and the treatment of recurrent disease. The exact place of 3 D CRT and IMRT is not yet known as modifications of fractionation. Local control for T1T2 tumor is excellent but is related to clinical extension (cranial and neurologic involvement) and nodal extension (supra clavicular N3) and show the interest of combined chemo-radiotherapy protocols.
