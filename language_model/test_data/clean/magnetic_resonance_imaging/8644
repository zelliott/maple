According to the guidelines, ultrasonography (US) is now established as the cross-sectional imaging technique of choice in postoperative care of colorectal carcinoma. Although conventional percutaneous US is inferior to computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detecting hepatic metastases, the application of specific contrast media has significantly increased sensitivity and specificity to 87% and 88%, respectively. The combination of US and CT/MRI achieves the highest detection rates. During follow-up of rectal carcinoma, in up to 20% of locoregional recurrences are diagnosed solely by endorectal sonography and result in repeat resection with curative intention. In noncolorectal carcinoma, US is recommended in the guidelines for following up hepatocellular carcinoma and malignant thyroid disease, but the available data are insufficient to support those recommendations.
