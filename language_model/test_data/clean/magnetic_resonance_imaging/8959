We investigated the association between brain lesion distribution and the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands (OCBs) in Italian multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.

We retrospectively selected brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uniformly performed in 56 relapsing patients (41 patients OCB positive).

Brain lesions in periventricular areas occurred in 92.86% of the patients (100% OCB+ and 73.33% OCB-) (P = 0.004), but we did not find a significant difference for their median volume (P = 0.553) and median number (P = 0.606) between the two groups. Parenchymal lesions occurred in 76.8% of the patients with a similar distribution (P = 1.00) and no significant difference in the median volume (P = 0.818) and number (P = 0.643) between the two groups.

The present study on cohort of Italian MS patients demonstrated a lack of correlation between lesion distribution and OCBs, suggesting that B cells producing them could be localized both in meningeal niches and cerebral parenchyma.
