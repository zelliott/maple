Few studies have examined the relationship between local anatomic thickness of the cortex and the activation signals arising from it. Using structural and functional MRI, we examined whether a relationship exists between cortical thickness and brain activation. Twenty-eight participants were asked to perform the Go/NoGo response inhibition task known to activate the anterior cingulate and the prefrontal cortex. Structural data of the same regions were simultaneously collected. We hypothesized that cortical thickness in these brain regions would positively correlate with brain activation. Data from the structural MRI were aligned with those of functional MRI activation. There was a positive linear correlation between cortical thickness and activation during response inhibition in the right anterior cingulate cortex (Brodmann's Area 24). No significant thickness-activation correlations were found in the prefrontal cortex. Correlations between cortical thickness and activation may occur only in certain brain regions.
