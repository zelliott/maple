Esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare malignant tumour that originates from the olfactory region. Its incidence is about 0.4 per million per year. The most common symptoms include epistaxis, headache, nasal obstruction, hyposmia and eye symptoms. Diagnosis of this rare tumour is often delayed. We present a case in which a 61-year-old male was referred due to proptosis and loss of vision. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a tumour in the nasal cavity involving the orbit, the frontal lope of the brain and lymph nodes in the neck. The case was staged according to Kadish as a stage C. Surgery was performed and postoperative radiotherapy planned.
