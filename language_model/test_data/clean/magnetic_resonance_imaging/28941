For years, investigators have sought after faster MR scanning techniques. Gradient echo and echo planar imaging were potential candidates that met with limited success. Fast spin echo (FSE) imaging was an innovation that revolutionized the clinical utility of MR imaging and fulfilled the promise of fast diagnostic MR scanning. FSE allows for the acquisition of MR images that often equals and occasionally exceeds the quality of conventional spin echo imaging, all during less or similar scanning time.
