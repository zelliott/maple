MR tomography of the brain, MR angiography of extra- and intracranial arteries and veins, duplex scanning of the extracranial arteries and veins were performed according to the technique spin-echo, by the technique 2D, 3D time-to-flight (unit "Magnetom 63 SP", 1.5 T), Acuson 128 technique, respectively, in 21 patients with high and malignant blood hypertension (BH) and 11 healthy controls. In BH patients magnetic resonance has detected signs of hypertensive encephalopathy: dilation of the liquor-conduction system, small hyperintensive foci in the white substance, zones of periventricular hyperintensity. MR angiograms visualized flexures of the extracranial arteries. MR phlebograms were characterized: 1) reduction of or absence of the signal from the blood flow along the cross, sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein of the hemisphere associated with enlargement of the contralateral structures; 2) lowering of the signal intensity from the blood flow along the upper sagittal sinus; 3) dilation of the emission veins and superficial cerebral veins. These abnormalities should be considered in the treatment of BH.
