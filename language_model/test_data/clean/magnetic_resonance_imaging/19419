Fungal infections in both their invasive and non-invasive forms can prove difficult to diagnose. The often characteristic appearances on imaging are of great assistance. CT is the primary imaging modality and is probably more accurate than MRI in diagnostic specificity and determining the extent of bone erosion. However this may require a modified scanning technique to adequately demonstrate the typical soft tissue density variations of fungi. MRI should be used to supplement CT when intra-cranial or intra-orbital extension is suspected.
