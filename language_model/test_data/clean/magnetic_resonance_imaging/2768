A double-echo two-excitation pulse sequence encoding fat and water signals for a phase-sensitive three-point Dixon-type analysis (DE-3PD) was developed and implemented on a 1.5 T MR imager. Data processing was performed using a previously developed two-dimensional (2D) region-growing algorithm, adapted to use double-echo data. Density-, T1-, and T2-weighted fat suppression images were obtained from six volunteers using the new fat suppression method. The images were compared with corresponding images obtained using frequency-selective excitation fat suppression (FATSAT) and a single-echo three-point-Dixon method (SE-3PD). The results demonstrate that the DE-3PD sequence shortens the imaging time by one-third compared with the SE-3PD method, without loss in image quality. The data also show that a 2D region-growing algorithm effectively unwraps the phase of DE-3PD data sets, and that results of DE-3PD fat signal suppression are consistently better than those obtained using a standard FATSAT method. The authors conclude that the double-echo sequence provides density-, T1-, and T2-weighted images that appear to be promising for routine clinical applications.
