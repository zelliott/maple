A case of a duplication of the left vertebral artery associated with a premedullary epidermoid cyst at the level of the foramen magnum is described. The close proximity of the two malformative lesions in the present case and the overlap of the periods when such developmental abnormalities can arise suggest that they might be causally linked.
