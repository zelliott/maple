Cortical and central white matter (WM) volumes were measured to assess short- and long-range connectivity in autism, respectively. Subjects included 23 boys with autism and 23 matched controls, all without intellectual disability. Magnetic resonance imaging data obtained at 1.5 T were analyzed using BRAINS2 software (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA). Central WM volume was quantified by subtracting cortical from supratentorial WM volumes. Reduced central WM volume was observed in the autism group. IQ was higher in controls with no observed correlations between WM volumes and IQ. This preliminary evidence of reduced central WM volume in autism suggests abnormal long-range connectivity.
