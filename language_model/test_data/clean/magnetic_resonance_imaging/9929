To evaluate renal oxygenation in patients with type 2 diabetes using blood oxygenation level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD MRI).

The R2* values of cortex and medulla as well as cortical thickness were measured in 25 patients with type 2 diabetes and 30 normal controls. The associations between R2* values and clinical parameters were analyzed.

The medulla R2* value of the patients with diabetes was significantly higher than that of the normal controls. No significant difference in cortical thickness was found between the patients with diabetes and the normal controls. The medulla R2* value increased with eGFR in the patients with diabetes.

BOLD MRI is a non-invasive and efficient method to assess the oxygenation in different regions of kidney. Abnormality of kidney in diabetic patients can be detected earlier by BOLD MRI than traditional imaging.
