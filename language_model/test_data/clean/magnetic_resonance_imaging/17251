A 57-year-old man, who had received a heart transplant 14 years earlier, underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and transmyocardial laser revascularization for left main, left anterior descending, and circumflex coronary artery disease. The procedures were performed through a left thoracotomy incision without cardiopulmonary bypass. Because the patient was of the Jehovah's Witness faith, no blood or blood products were transfused.
