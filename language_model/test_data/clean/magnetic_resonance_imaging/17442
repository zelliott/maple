Body fat distribution and ectopic fat deposition are important determinants of insulin sensitivity. Fat deposition in muscle and the liver, in particular, has been found to impair insulin signalling in these insulin-sensitive tissues. Thus, exact quantification of fat content may help to distinguish between different sites of insulin resistance. Increased fat deposition in the visceral compartment compared with the subcutaneous depot also represents an important factor leading to insulin resistance. Recent data clearly showed that visceral fat is a strong determinant of liver fat content. Exact quantification of fat distribution by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy may help to define distinct 'fat-distribution phenotypes'. This may allow a search for new candidate genes for type 2 diabetes mellitus and identify, at an early stage, individuals at risk for decline in insulin sensitivity.
