MYC/BCL2 double hit lymphoma (DHL) is a rare, recently recognised and highly aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with an affinity to involve the central nervous system and the head and neck either at initial presentation or during relapse. We present a case of 43-year-old woman with MYC/BCL2 DHL relapse in the nasopharynx with extensive spread to the neck, skull base, and the central nervous system. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in the literature describing the MRI and CT scan findings and the profound pattern of disease involvement of this rare neoplasm.
