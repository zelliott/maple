Presented herein is a case of successful repair of thoracic aortic aneurysm by endograft in a female patient 21 years after replacement of the descending aorta for coarctation. During scheduled examination the patient was found to have aneurysm of proximal anastomosis. Additional examination was followed by the stenting of the thoracic aorta using endograft manufactured by the "GORE" Company (USA). The immediate results were classified as good: aneurysm was not opacified, the patency of the vessels of the aortic arch was well preserved. According to the data of check examination carried out 5 months after operation, no graft dislocation was marked, aneurysm was not detectable. The given case demonstrates low-invasive endovascular intervention permitting the avoidance of complicated and traumatic open regrafting of the aorta and attainment of beneficial short- and long-term treatment results.
