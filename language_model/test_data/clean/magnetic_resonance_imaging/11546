The authors describe a rare case of inflammatory pseudotumor involving the clivus, where a soft tissue mass lesion, with extension into the prevertebral retropharyngeal space and the cavernous sinuses, was detected by CT and MRI. The mass resembled a malignant tumor or aggressive infectious lesion, and the final diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumor was a diagnosis of exclusion, decided after histopathological examination.
