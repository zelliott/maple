Among 43 adult patients with meningitis, 8 (18.6%) had cerebral infarction associated with meningitis during their clinical course. The total number of cerebral infarctions was 18. In 4 patients of good outcome (ambulatory in 3 cases and wheelchair in 1 case) with a mean age of 39 years, the number of cerebral infarctions was 1 per patient, and did not increase. In 4 patients of poor outcome (vegetative in 2 cases and died in 2 cases) with a mean age of 68 years, the number of cerebral infarctions was 1 in two cases and 2 in two cases, and later increased in 3 of the cases. Locations of cerebral infarctions were 3 in the striatocapsular lesion, 1 in the posterior limb of internal capsule, 1 in the middle cerebral artery territory, 5 in the tuberothalamic artery territory, 5 in the capsular genu, 1 in the posterior choroidal artery territory, and 2 in the medial striate artery territory. Patients of poor outcome had capsular genu infarction. It was concluded that multiplicity and multiplication of cerebral infarction were markers of the severity of the meningitis.
