We report a case of a spinal intradural capillary hemangioma. On MR images, a well-circumscribed intradural mass was detected at the T8-T9 level. The signal intensity of the mass relative to the spinal cord was isointense on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and showed homogeneous, strong enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. The mass had both extramedullary and intramedullary components.
