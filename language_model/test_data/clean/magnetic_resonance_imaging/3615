The case is reported of a 28-year-old subject with a bioprosthesis (Shelhigh 31) in the aortic position, with symptoms of heart failure and possible prosthetic dysfunction. As the echocardiographic interrogation remained inconclusive, the patient underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, which revealed an impaired movement of the non-coronary cusp. In addition, computed tomography (CT) demonstrated severe calcification of the immobile prosthetic component. Hence, in selected patients, both CMR and CT can be used as complementary tools to evaluate the dysfunction and pathology of heart valve bioprostheses.
