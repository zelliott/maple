Nasal and paranasal malignant tumours account for less than 5% of all head and neck malignancies. Epithelial malignancies overwhelmingly predominate, with squamous cell carcinomas representing the most frequent histological subtype in this location. Soft-tissue sarcomas of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses are exceedingly rare. Here, we report two cases of myxoid liposarcomas that occurred in the nasal and paranasal regions, both of which presented diagnostic challenges and could not be diagnosed definitively from intraoperative frozen sections. These cases reinforce the notion that, while they are uncommon, sarcomas in general and liposarcomas in particular should still be considered as part of the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with obstructive symptoms in the nasal and paranasal sinuses.
