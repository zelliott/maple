Thirteen patients with recurrent symptoms after lumbar discectomy were evaluated. All the patients were enrolled in the study on the basis of clinical symptoms and signs only. The patients were examined with MRI, CT, and myelography in order to compare a) the clinical findings with the imaging investigations, b) the predictive value of the different investigations, and c) the clinical and investigative results with the operative findings. All patients were operated upon according to the clinical findings, and the surgical results were used as the final diagnosis. In six patients a new disc herniation was detected. In the remaining cases surgery revealed either scar tissue or nothing to explain the recurrence of the symptoms. The three imaging modalities were analysed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The areas under the ROC curves were 0.68 for MRI, 0.83 for CT, and 0.43 for myelography. The difference in areas between CT and myelography was significant (p less than 0.05). The results indicate that CT has the highest predictive value for demonstrating the recurrence of a lumbar disc herniation.
