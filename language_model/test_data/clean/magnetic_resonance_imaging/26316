A newly developed desktop microtomograph was used to evaluate whether it is suitable for visualizing the three-dimensional (3D) morphology of the mouse inner ear (at a micrometer level) and whether it is applicable as a fast screening tool to detect hereditary abnormalities in this organ. To this end, the epistatic circler, a mutant mouse showing abnormal circling behaviour, was used as a model. The inner ears were dissected out, formaldehyde-fixed, and scanned at maximal resolution along the longitudinal axis. After segmentation, stacks of tomographic images were used for 3D reconstruction of the bony labyrinth. Finally, the obtained data were correlated with subsequent conventional histological examination. The spatial resolution (8 microm) achieved by this instrument, was found to be far superior to that obtained by conventional computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR)-imaging equipment. The technique provides detailed tomographic images of the bony labyrinths and enables an adequate 3D reconstruction of the inner ear structures in this small mammal. In addition, it allows a screening for pathologic specimens prior to the more time- and labour-consuming histological techniques, which are still essential to gather information at a (sub)cellular level. This imaging technique can be regarded as a valuable tool in future research on hereditary inner ear abnormalities.
