Pulmonary embolism represents a major public healthcare problem and it also imposes frequent clinical diagnostic issues. Despite the availability of the D-dimer tests, imaging remains the mainstay for its diagnosis. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is now the most widely used diagnostic test and its utility has been well validated in a large number of trials. Nuclear medicine techniques, which are also well established, are now used significantly less frequently. Magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography is developing as an alternative to CTPA in patients who have contraindications to iodinated contrast media. Catheter pulmonary angiography remains the gold standard, although it is being used increasingly less frequently. In this article, we review the current knowledge on the imaging diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism with special emphasis on the noninvasive techniques.
