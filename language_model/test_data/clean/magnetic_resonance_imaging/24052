Picibanil (OK-432) is a sclerosing agent derived from a low-virulence strain of Streptococcus pyogenes that induces regression of macrocystic lymphangiomas. This report describes a prospective, nonrandomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of Picibanil in the treatment of 13 affected children ranging in age from 1 to 94 months. On average, 4.1 fluoroscopically guided intracystic injections were performed per child, with an average total dose of 0.56 mg of Picibanil. As judged by physical examination and radiographic studies, 5 children (42%) showed a complete or substantial response, and 2 children (16%) showed an intermediate response. No response was seen in 5 children (42%), 2 of whom had massive craniofacial lymphangioma. Factors that contribute to failure with Picibanil sclerotherapy are the presence of a significant microcystic component to the lesion, massive craniofacial involvement, and previous surgical resection. Macrocystic lymphangiomas of the infratemporal fossa or cervical area have the best response to therapy.
