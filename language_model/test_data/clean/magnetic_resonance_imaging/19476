There are many vascular and neoplastic diseases as well as normal variants that produce the vestibulocochlear symptoms of pulsatile tinnitus, hearing loss, dizziness, and ataxia. Magnetic resonance imaging may be diagnostic, and magnetic resonance angiography/magnetic resonance venography have added to the ability of magnetic resonance to image vascular abnormalities. The extent of neoplasms is accurately assessed and complication of vascular lesions are clearly seen. However, detailed vascular anatomy requires high-quality selective angiography. This enables optimal treatment planning. Endovascular therapeutic intervention has a major role to play in conjunction with surgery of skull base lesions and may be curative in certain conditions, avoiding major surgical procedures. The interventionalist, however, must have an excellent knowledge of the external carotid circulation and all of its potential communications with the internal circulation to avoid serious embolic complications.
