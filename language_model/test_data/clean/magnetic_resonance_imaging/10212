We report the imaging features of an occult parathyroid adenoma with unusual location in the carotid sheath. Our patient presented with primary hyperparathyroidism. Following negative neck ultrasound and scintigraphy, exploratory neck dissection with partial thyroidectomy was performed twice over a 2 day period without biological response. Cervical and mediastinal CT and MRI were performed with no result. Digital angiography showed a tumoral blush supplied by the left inferior thyroid artery and located in close contact with the carotid artery. Venous sampling of the neck confirmed the left location of the adenoma and a third surgical intervention found the adenoma embedded in the left carotid sheath. This is an unusual case of parathyroid adenoma that necessitated the use of several imaging techniques.
