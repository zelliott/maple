Causes of nocturnal paroxysmal events include a variety of disorders such as epileptic seizures, parasomnias, sleep-related movement disorders, and psychiatric disturbances. Timing and semiology of the events, simultaneous video-electroencephalographic observation, presence of any daytime events, and relevant psychiatric and medical history may help in sorting out various possibilities considered in the differential diagnosis of such events. Timely diagnosis of these events is crucial for appropriate management; under-recognition and misdiagnosis of nonepileptic events is not uncommon. Described here are two cases within the spectrum of nocturnal paroxysmal events, one with nocturnal panic attacks and the other with frontal lobe epilepsy, each presenting with choking episodes.
