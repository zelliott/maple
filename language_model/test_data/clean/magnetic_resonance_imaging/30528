Clinical features, brain magnetic resonance imaging findings and EDSS scores of 11 patients with neurodegenerative central nervous system Langerhans cell histiocytosis were analyzed in Japan. All patients initially had multi-system-type Langerhans cell histiocytosis; 8 at 1-2 years of age and 3 at a later age. Neurodegenerative central nervous system Langerhans cell histiocytosis disease developed after a median time interval of 3.9 years from initial diagnosis. With a median follow-up of 4.5 years, 6 patients showed progression of disease with an EDSS score >3. This study demonstrates the importance of early detection of neurodegenerative central nervous system Langerhans cell histiocytosis by brain magnetic resonance imaging, particularly in the follow-up of patients who developed multi-system-type Langerhans cell histiocytosis in early infancy.
