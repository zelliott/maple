This case-based discussion focuses on the clinical presentation and diagnostic assessment of a uniquely challenging group of elderly patients: those with symptoms of mild memory problems. Such patients present a challenge to clinicians because of flux in our understandings of normal, age-related cognitive changes; of cognitive changes due to neurodegenerative illnesses; and of the relationships between depression and cognitive impairment. In addition, symptoms of memory problems may be reported by an observer rather than by the patient. These challenges warrant stepwise evaluation of elderly patients who present with symptoms of memory loss.
