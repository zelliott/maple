A 2-year-old boy presented with weakness of both lower limbs with bladder and bowel involvement and history of frequent falls. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed a T2 altered signal intensity enhancing mass lesion seen in the spinal epidural space extending from sixth cervical to fourth thoracic vertebrae, which was compressing the adjacent spinal cord. Histopathology of the lesion was suggestive of hamartoma. A brief review of the literature including its embryogenesis is discussed here. The child subsequently developed pseudopancreatic cysts possibly because of repeated falls leading to blunt trauma abdomen.
