To determine an optimal magnetization transfer (MT) technique for diagnosis of malignancies in the head and neck.

Lesion magnetization transfer ratios (MTRs) and lesion-to-muscle MTRs were prospectively measured in 52 head and neck lesions of 52 patients at frequency offsets of 0.3, 0.5, and 1 kHz from water resonance. The diagnostic capability for each MT pulse was calculated by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and an optimal MT technique was determined for diagnosis of malignancies.

The lesion MTRs and the lesion-to-muscle MTRs in malignant tumors were statistically significantly greater than those in benign lesions at both 0.5- and 1-kHz MT pulses, but no significant differences were noted between them at the 0.3-kHz MT pulse. Diagnosis with the lesion-to-muscle MTRs was better than that with the lesion MTRs at each MT pulse. Among all MTRs, lesion-to-muscle MTRs at the 1-kHz MT pulse showed the highest diagnostic capability for malignancies (area under the ROC curve = 0.82+/-0.06). With a lesion-to-muscle MTR at a 1-kHz MT pulse of 0.61 or greater, the highest accuracy of 85% was attained with 90% sensitivity and 77% specificity.

Lesion-to-muscle MTRs at a 1-kHz MT pulse were optimal for diagnosis of malignancies in the head and neck.
