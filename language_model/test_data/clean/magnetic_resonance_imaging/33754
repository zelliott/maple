Hemangiomas are common vascular tumors of children. They always regress. Surgery takes place for late sequelae, such as cutaneous scarring and distortion of the facial structures. Early surgery is beneficial for the nasal cyrano hemangioma, of for some eyelid hemangiomas. Venous malformations need to be manage from childhood to adulthood as they slowly worsen. Percutaneous embolization with Ethibloc and surgery are performed in order to minimize, or to improve the skin, muscle and bone distortion. Arteriovenous malformations are the most dangerous vascular anomalies of the face. Superselective arterial embolization prepares the surgical excision of the nidus. Difficulties in covering the excised area are frequently solved by flaps or cutaneous expansion.
