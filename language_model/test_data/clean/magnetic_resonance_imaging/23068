From its inception intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (ioMRI) was envisioned to have significant applications in neurosurgery in general and pediatrics specifically. Over the last 9 years we have noted a dramatic shift in our ioMRI usage from intracranial tumors to cerebrospinal fluid management and complex cysts. Here we present seven selected cases to illustrate lessons learned from our operative experience within the GE Signa SP/I open-configuration "double-doughnut" MRI. These cases including a ganglioglioma, ependymoma, and pilocytic astrocytoma tumor resection, as well as arachnoid cysts, complex cyst, and microabscess drainage reflect our current use of ioMRI in pediatric neurosurgical cases. Namely that ioMRI is optimal for (1) resection of small tumors with poorly differentiated tumor margins, (2) large tumors with mass effect, and (3) shunt or catheter placement requiring either extreme accuracy or intraoperative confirmation of catheter placement. We also comment on the legitimate limitations of this technology in certain operations. Additionally emphasized are cases in which ioMRI imaging drives operative decision making, highlighting the unique and unequaled abilities of this technology for a subset of pediatric neurosurgical cases.
