Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a relatively new, noninvasive technique, provides comprehensive information on the myocardial anatomy through its excellent contrast resolution, high spatial resolution and intrinsic high contrast between the blood pool and the surrounding soft tissues. Cine MRI possesses an adequately high time resolution for the analysis of the global and regional function of the left ventricle. 31phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a unique tool for the assessment of alterations of the myocardial high energy phosphate metabolism in the intact, working heart. On the basis of personal data and an overview of the literature, the current relevance and future perspectives of MRI and MRS in the diagnosis of cardiomyopathies are presented.
