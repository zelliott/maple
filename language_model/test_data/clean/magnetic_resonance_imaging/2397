Magnetic resonance imaging with its excellent contrast resolution and direct multiplanar imaging capacity, has become a valuable tool to improve understanding of lower urinary tract function and pelvic floor physiology. Review of the current English language literature shows that the domain of magnetic resonance imaging is research. In comparison with other imaging techniques, magnetic resonance imaging has been shown to yield better soft tissue differentiation and anatomic resolution. Newer techniques also allow some form of dynamic imaging.
