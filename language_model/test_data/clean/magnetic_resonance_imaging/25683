The feasibility of diagnosing the malignancy and viability of intraparenchymal brain tumours using Gd-DTPA, enhanced and unenhanced T1-weighted MRIs was investigated. The relationship between the Gd-DTPA enhancement pattern, the growth fraction (GF) determined by using the anti-bromide-oxyuridine (BrdU) monoclonal antibody, the clinical condition, the proliferative potential and the change of Gd-DTPA enhancement over time was studied. Forty-five patients with intracranial tumours were studied with the static method of Gd-DTPA MRI. The enhanced effect in Gd-DTPA MRIs was dependent on tumour-cell density, vascularization, necrosis, and dilatation of vascular lumen. Tumour-cells were observed in eighty-seven of eighty-nine specimens taken from areas with Gd-DTPA enhanced MRIs. Seventy-four percent of these specimens (64 of 87) showed a malignancy of more than 5% growth fraction. On the other hand, tumour cells were observed in twenty-seven of fifty-six specimens taken from areas with Gd-DTPA unenhanced MRIs. Eighty-five percent of these specimens (23 of 27) showed a malignancy value of less than 5% GF. However, fifteen percent of these specimen showed values between 5 and 15% GF. In the kinetic study of Gd-MRIs five patients who were in a clinically stable condition and one patient who had radionecrosis showed a constant pattern of enhancement or slightly increased enhancement 30 min after injection compared to 4 min after injection. Therefore, GD-DTPA MRI can be used effectively in the diagnosis of tumour viability and malignancy after treatment.
