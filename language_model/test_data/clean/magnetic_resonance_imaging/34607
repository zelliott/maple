We present a case of mucus escape reaction in which we encountered difficulty in interpreting the images acquired by plain radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The 48-year-old male Japanese patient was referred for evaluation of a gradual swelling subjacent to the inferior border of the left mandible. At the early imaging examinations, magnetic resonance imaging provided information crucial to resolving the issue of whether the lesion consisted of a central malignant disease process or a malignant disease in the submandibular space or both of these two separate disease entities. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated no evidence of tumorous lesion, but rather showed a fluid-containing cavity that was also confirmed by the subsequent intrasurgical inspection. On further consideration of these imaging findings, we concluded that the entity was mucus escape reaction with simultaneous occurrence of an intraconnective tissue hemorrhage adjacent to the left submandibular gland, concomitant extensive bony defect of the left mandible and lingual cortical defect, and chronic sialoadenitis of the left submandibular gland.
