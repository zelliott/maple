A major obstacle to using paramagnetic MR contrast agents for in vivo cell tracking or molecular sensing is their generally low cellular uptake. In this study, we show that a paramagnetically labeled DOTA chelator derivatized with a 13-mer HIV-tat peptide is efficiently internalized into mammalian cells. Intracellular concentrations were attained that were readily detectable by MR imaging using both gadolinium and dysprosium chelates. Using this paradigm, it should be feasible to internalize a variety of chemically different agents into mammalian cells.
