Magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiopancreatography is a new, noninvasive method of assessing the biliary tract and pancreatic duct. MRCP sequences are based on heavily T2-weighted pulse sequences, resulting in the bile ducts and pancreatic duct having very high signal intensity. Preliminary results indicate that the results of MRCP in most biliary tract diseases are similar to those of more invasive techniques of direct cholangiography, such as, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
