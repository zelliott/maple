Aim of this study was to assess effectiveness of high-frequency denervation of facet joints in facet pain syndrome in patients who underwent microdiscectomy. The analyzed series included 42 patients treated by microdiscectomy 2 to 56 months before minimally invasive manipulation. The control group was made of 50 patients of similar age with facet pain syndrome who did not undergo spinal surgery. Effectiveness of treatment in the main group reached 62% while in the control group it was 82%. VAS score after 6-12 months changed from 7.6 to 3.2 and from 7.9 to 2.2 in control and mail groups, respectively. Conclusions are made about effectiveness of high-frequency denervation of facet joints in patients with failed back surgery syndrome in conditions of their careful selection for this procedure.
