Wall-eyed bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (WEBINO) is an uncommon neuro-ophthalmologic syndrome consisting of both eyes primary position exotropia and bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia. It is thought to be caused by medial midbrain lesions involving both bilateral medial longitudinal fasciculi and medial rectus subnuclei. We report the clinical and neuroimaging findings of a WEBINO syndrome associated to bilateral ptosis, non-reactive mydriasis and complete vertical gaze palsy in a 55-year-old man who suffered a top of the basilar artery stroke causing tegmental midbrain infarction.
