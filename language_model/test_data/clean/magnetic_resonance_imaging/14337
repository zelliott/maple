Correct evaluation of myometrial infiltration is essential in patients with stage I and II endometrial cancer who are candidates for hysterectomy without lymphadenectomy, if extensive infiltration of the myometrium is not present. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to improve staging of patients with endometrial cancer. Thirty patients with histological diagnosis of endometrial cancer were studied with MRI at 1.5 T and subsequently underwent abdominal hysterectomy. The MRI results were compared with those of the histological tests. MRI was performed with a 1.5-T magnet and spin-echo (SE) technique [repetition time/echo time (msec) = 2.000/35-90]. Contiguous 4-mm sections of were obtained from the sagittal plane. Clinical staging was not confirmed in two patients who presented with cervical extension of the tumor. The overall accuracy of MRI in determining the grade of myometrial and cervical invasion was 86 and 90%, respectively.
