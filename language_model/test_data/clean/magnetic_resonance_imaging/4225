We compared unenhanced and contrast-enhanced fast MRI and CT in the detection of liver metastases. Eleven patients with single or multiple hepatic lesions (42 in all) were submitted to CT and MR studies; T1- and T2-weighted TSE, T2-weighted TSE with fat suppression, unenhanced breath-hold TFE and early or delayed enhanced breath-hold TFE images were acquired with a 1.5 T super-conductive magnet (Philips NT). The quantitative analysis of all MR images was performed for contrast/noise ratio (CNR) and number of detected lesions; MR and CT images were also compared qualitatively for lesion conspicuity, anatomical structure identification and artifacts. The results were compared with Student's t test. Early enhanced breath-hold TFE was statistically superior to T1-weighted TSE (p = .0009), T2-weighted TSE (p = .01) and CT (p = .0004) for lesion conspicuity and to T1-weighted TSE, T2-weighted TSE, unenhanced TFE (p = .0001) and CT (p = .01) for anatomical structure identification. CT was superior to T1- and T2-weighted TSE (p = .0001) and unenhanced TFE (p = .004) for the lack of artifacts. Fat-suppressed T2-weighted TSE images had a statistically higher CNR than T2-weighted TSE (p = .02), T1-weighted TSE (p = .0006) and unenhanced and delayed TFE sequences (p = .007; p = .0001, respectively). To conclude, MRI appears superior to CT in the detection of liver metastases; the examination should include early enhanced breath-hold T1-weighted TFE and T2-weighted fat-suppressed TSE images.
