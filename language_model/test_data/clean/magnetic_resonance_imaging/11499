To evaluate the technical feasibility and the clinical effectiveness of sclerotherapy for the treatment of peritoneal inclusion cysts (PICs).

Between June 1996 and February 2001, eight PICs in seven female patients aged 28-43 (mean, 36) years were instilled with sclerosant (povidone-iodine in three, ethanol in three, both povidone-iodine and ethanol in one). All seven patients subsequently experienced less abdominal pain. After drainage via an 8.5-Fr pigtail catheter inserted in the PICs (transabdominally in six cases, transvaginally in one), sclerosant equivalent in volume to about one-third that of drained fluid was introduced daily until the drained volume was less than 5ml. Follow-up by means of clinical procedures and ultrasound was performed every three months, at which time the success rate, possible complications and recurrence were determined.

Sclerotherapy was technically successful in all seven patients, though immediately after the procedure, minor complications were noted in three patients (mild pain in two, mild fever in one). During the follow-up of 4-60 (mean, 24.7) months, sclerotherapy proved successful and without long-term complications in all seven patients: lower abdominal pain disappeared and the diameter of the cysts decreased more than 50%, with complete regression in four cases. During the follow-up period there was no recurrence.

Sclerotherapy following catheter insertion is technically feasible and effective for the treatment of PICs.
