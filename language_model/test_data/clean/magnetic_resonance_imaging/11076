Elastofibroma dorsi is a tumor or pseudotumor typically located under the tip of the scapula. It is far from uncommon in older individuals. The mass contains both fibrous tissue and fatty tissue. Imaging studies can provide the definite diagnosis in many cases. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are particularly effective, as they visualize the characteristic layered pattern of fatty tissue (low-density by CT, high-signal on T1 images and intermediate signal on T2 images by MRI) and fibrous tissue (similar to muscle in terms of density by CT and signal intensity by MRI). To a lesser extent, plain radiographs and ultrasonography identify a number of suggestive features (location and layered structure). When the lesion exhibits typical imaging features and produces no symptoms, as is usually the case, further investigations are probably unnecessary.
