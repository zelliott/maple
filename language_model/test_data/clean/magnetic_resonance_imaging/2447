We present a case of giant calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe (pilomatrixoma) in the right upper arm of a 62-year-old man. It measured 18 x 12 x 8 cm in size, making it the largest of all the cases reported previously. CT clearly demonstrated a well-defined, subcutaneous mass with amorphous calcifications. The mass showed intermediate signal intensity on T2*-weighted MR images and slight contrast uptake on contrast-enhanced MR images. Histopathologically, this tumor showed no aggressive or malignant nature. The patient is without evidence of recurrence or metastasis 3 years following the resection.
