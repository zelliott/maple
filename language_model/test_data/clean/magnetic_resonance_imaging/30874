The purpose of the present study was to review retrospectively our experience with MRI in patients over the age of 50 who present to the emergency department with inability to weight bear following a fall and whose initial radiographs were normal. The study was designed to establish the incidence and pattern of bone and soft tissue injuries in these patients and to determine whether MRI could provide predictive information regarding length of hospital stay. The present study demonstrated the practicality of a protocol using MRI to obtain rapid definitive diagnosis in patients with occult fractures of the pelvic ring and neck of femur. The present study also suggests that significant prognostic information with regard to length of hospital stay can be obtained from an early MRI scan.
