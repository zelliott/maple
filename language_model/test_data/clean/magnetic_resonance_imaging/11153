The authors examined a cognitive function mediated by the cerebellum, classical eyeblink conditioning, and its relationship to cerebellar volume in healthy controls (n = 59) and temporal lobe epilepsy subjects (n = 77). Controls demonstrated better conditioning, larger cerebellar volumes, and an association between conditioning and cerebellar volume that was not observed in epilepsy patients. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that cerebellar atrophy in epilepsy affects procedural memory.
