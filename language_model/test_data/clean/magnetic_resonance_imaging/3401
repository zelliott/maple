Lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have attracted considerable attention for their application in biomedicine. Here, silica-coated NaGdF(4):Yb,Er/NaGdF(4) nanoparticles with a tetrasubstituted carboxy aluminum phthalocyanine (AlC(4)Pc) photosensitizer covalently incorporated inside the silica shells were prepared and applied in the photodynamic therapy (PDT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of cancer cells. These UCNP@SiO(2)(AlC(4)Pc) nanoparticles were uniform in size, stable against photosensitizer leaching, and highly efficient in photogenerating cytotoxic singlet oxygen under near-infrared (NIR) light. In vitro studies indicated that these nanoparticles could effectively kill cancer cells upon NIR irradiation. Moreover, the nanoparticles also demonstrated good MR contrast, both in aqueous solution and inside cells. This is the first time that NaGdF(4):Yb,Er/NaGdF(4) upconversion-nanocrystal-based multifunctional nanomaterials have been synthesized and applied in PDT. Our results show that these multifunctional nanoparticles are very promising for applications in versatile imaging diagnosis and as a therapy tool in biomedical engineering.
