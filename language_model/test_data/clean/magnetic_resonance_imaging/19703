Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is a life-threatening disease and is difficult to diagnose. We aim to promote the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in TBM diagnosis and survey.

This was a retrospective study undertaken between 1996 and 2003 in which we reviewed all cases of TBM that had undergone cerebral computed tomography (CT) and MRI performed with and without contrast.

We reviewed 29 patients; all had had subacute lymphocytic meningitis. Diagnosis was definite in only 11 cases and presumptive in 18 cases. MRI was performed showing one or more abnormalities in 26 cases. The use of MRI allowed the detection of CNS lesions in both brain and spine.

Cerebrospinal MRI performed when TBM is suspected aids in its diagnosis and is also a useful means of monitoring the course of the disease under treatment.
