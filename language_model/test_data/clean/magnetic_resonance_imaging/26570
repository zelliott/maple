Endovascular occlusion balloon catheters can be placed preoperatively in internal iliac vessels of patients perceived to be at risk of major obstetric haemorrhage during caesarean section. Their safety and efficacy remains undefined, and we report our experience of 14 patients over four years.

We undertook a chart review of all patients who had undergone prophylactic internal iliac balloon catheters before caesarean section in our institution.

Balloon catheters were placed in 14 and inflated in 11 (78.6%) patients. Five of the 14 patients (35.7%) underwent emergency balloon catheter placement before unscheduled caesarean section. Surgeons reported that balloon inflation provided favourable surgical conditions in six of 11 cases (54.5%), no improvement in four and was not required in one due to lack of pathology. Within the balloon-inflated group, nine patients underwent a hysterectomy: two electively, the remaining seven because of perioperative confirmation of placenta accreta or for control of bleeding. One patient suffered massive haemorrhage leading to three perioperative hypovolaemic cardiac arrests. Four patients required intervention to avoid complications related to balloon catheters: three minor and one related to catheter displacement and prolonged resuscitation.

Internal iliac balloon catheters can be inserted electively or in an emergency in patients at risk of major obstetric haemorrhage. Although useful in some, they are not universally effective; patients are still at risk of significant blood loss and at high risk of requiring a hysterectomy. In our experience, catheters can be placed electively or in an emergency but have been associated with adverse outcomes. These lessons have been important learning points in perioperative management.
