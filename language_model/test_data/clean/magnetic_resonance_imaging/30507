The hereditary polyposis syndromes and non-polyposis colorectal carcinoma have been considered as scarcely occurring but inheritable dominant autosomal syndromes. The increasing risk of small bowel carcinoma and prevention of obstruction and intussusception have been making frequent and acute surgical interventions unavoidably led to the necessity of screening and surveillance the patients. Earlier the diagnosis of these symptoms was difficult to establish because traditional radiological methods have a low yield for small polyps. Furthermore, small bowel is only partially accessible with traditional endoscopic techniques such as upper endoscopy, colonoscopy and push-enteroscopy. The "wireless" capsule endoscopy has opened the way then for the non-invasive and painless test of the entire small intestine. - Test results have been cumulated to justify the efficiency and safety of capsule endoscopy concerning the syndromes above. This method can be applied safely even consequently to repeatedly performed surgical interventions by low risk of capsule retention. As the results compared of the diagnosed familial adenomatous polyposis and of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome reflect on capsule endoscopy, its diagnostic sensitiveness is stated as significantly higher than the Barium-contrast X-Ray and MR-enterography. Nevertheless, determination of size and location of polyps has become more problematic when evaluating the test results.
