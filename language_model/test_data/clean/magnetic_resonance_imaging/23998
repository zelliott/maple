Early posttraumatic cerebral hypoperfusion is implicated in the evolution of secondary damage after experimental and clinical traumatic brain injury (TBI). This is the first report of cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurement by continuous arterial spin-labeled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) early after TBI in rats using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model. CCI reduced CBF globally at approximately 3 hr (versus normal), with 85% and 49% reductions in a contused cortical region and contralateral cortex, respectively. In contrast, a prior MRI study from this laboratory showed at 24 hr post trauma a focal CBF reduction restricted to the injury site. In vivo spin-lattice relaxation time (T(1obs)), which is used in CBF quantification, was spatially heterogeneous early after CCI, a time when edema is developing in injured brain tissue. At 4.7 T, T(1obs) values are increased 29% in the contusion (versus normal), consequently reducing CBF quantification to a similar degree. MRI should facilitate coupling posttraumatic CBF with long-term functional outcome. Magn Reson Med 42:673-681, 1999.
