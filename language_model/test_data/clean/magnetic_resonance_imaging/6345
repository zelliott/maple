Sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis is a rare disease characterized by soft-tissue ossifications and hyperostosis of the clavicles, anterior segments of the upper ribs and sternum. These changes may imitate other disorders and thus may be misinterpreted. We present the radiologic appearances of this entity and discuss the diagnostic value of computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and scintigraphy.
