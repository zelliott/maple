A spectrum of embolic agents including PVA, avitene, gelfoam, ethanol, IBCA, silicone microspheres, metal and platinum coils, and balloons containing contrast of HEMA were imaged in vitro at 0.3 Tesla using spin echo, gradient echo, and inversion recovery sequences. Signal intensities associated with these agents and changes created by addition of blood are presented. The in vitro model is also correlated with clinical MR material. Recognition of embolic materials is important to avoid confusion with persistent flow void, hemorrhage, or thrombus.
