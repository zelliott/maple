Incidentally found brain lesions will increase as magnetic resonance imaging of the brain becomes more common. What should be told to a patient, who has undergone brain imaging e.g. for headaches, and the image reveals lesions compatible with multiple sclerosis? A demyelinating lesion should be related with the patient's age, other diseases, earlier symptom history and results of a clinical neurological examination. Multiple sclerosis cannot be diagnosed merely based on magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical monitoring is required if a significant number of plaques typical of multiple sclerosis is present.
