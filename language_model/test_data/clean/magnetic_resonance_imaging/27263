To study the MRI manifestation of testicular tumor and the value of MRI in the diagnosis of the disease.

We retrospectively analyzed 23 cases of pathologically confirmed testicular tumor, and observed the morphological characteristics, signals and surrounding conditions of the tumor using plain and enhanced MRI scanning.

Of the 23 cases, seminoma was identified in 7, mixed germinoma in 3, teratoma in 3, endodermal sinus tumor in 2, epidermoid in 1, Leydig cell tumor in 1, leucoma in 1, nonspecific inflammatory mass in 3, and tuberculosis in 2. MRI revealed the precise locations and specific characteristics of

Based on MRI findings and clinical manifestation, most testicular tumors can be diagnosed correctly.
