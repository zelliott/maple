To investigate multi-echo chemical shift-encoded MRI-based mapping of proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and fat-corrected R2* in bone marrow as biomarkers for osteoporosis assessment.

Fifty-one patients (28 female; mean age 69.7 ± 9.0 years) underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). On the basis of the t score, 173 valid vertebrae bodies were divided into three groups (healthy, osteopenic and osteoporotic). Three echo chemical shift-encoded MRI sequences were acquired at 3 T. PDFF and R2* with correction for multiple-peak fat (R2*MP) were measured for each vertebral body. Kruskal-Wallis test and post hoc analysis were performed to evaluate differences between groups. Further, the area under the curve (AUC) for each technique was calculated using logistic regression analysis.

On the basis of DXA, 92 samples were normal (53 %), 47 osteopenic (27 %) and 34 osteoporotic (20 %). PDFF was increased in osteoporosis compared with healthy (P = 0.007). R2*MP showed significant differences between normal and osteopenia (P = 0.004), and between normal and osteoporosis (P < 0.001). AUC to differentiate between normal and osteoporosis was 0.698 for R2*MP, 0.656 for PDFF and 0.74 for both combined.

PDFF and R2*MP are moderate biomarkers for osteoporosis. PDFF and R2*MP combination might improve the prediction in differentiating healthy subjects from those with osteoporosis.
