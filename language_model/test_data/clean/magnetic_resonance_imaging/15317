We report the case of a 25-year-old Malay woman, admitted for preterm delivery at 35 weeks' gestation. Vaginal swab did not isolate any organism. She delivered a baby girl who developed respiratory distress syndrome, requiring ventilation. Although chest radiograph showed hyaline membrane disease with pneumonia, septic workout was negative. The mother was discharged on the next day. Seven days postpartum, the mother presented with fever and fits and was diagnosed to have meningo-encephalitis. Lumbar puncture isolated group B Streptococcus (GBS) and MRI revealed a superior cerebellar abscess. She was treated and survived the episode. This case illustrates the uncommon situation where GBS infection was confirmed via maternal septic workout rather than neonatal, although both presented with severe disease.
