Cardiac fibroma is a rare and benign tumor usually seen in infants and children. We report a 3-year-old asymptomatic child who presented with a giant right ventricular (RV) fibroma. He underwent complete surgical resection and is doing well at follow-up. Because of the size of the tumor and the potential need for resection of RV free wall, it is essential to have contingency plans to deal with postoperative RV failure.
