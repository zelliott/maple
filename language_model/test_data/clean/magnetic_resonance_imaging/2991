Thirty-five patients age 9 to 67 were evaluated for chronic sinusitis by history, physical and laboratory examination, and imaging techniques (X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and flexible rhinoscopy). MRI was the most predictive. To establish the diagnosis of sinusitis, it was more sensitive than plain X-ray for intrasinus disease. Findings of edema, erythema, and drainage on flexible rhinoscopy were consistent with chronic sinusitis and were confirmed by MRI and sinus X-rays in 41% of the cases. Nasal smears for polymorphonuclear cells and eosinophils were suggestive of a diagnosis of chronic sinusitis, but other laboratory tests (CBC, sedimentation rate, quantitative immunoglobulins, total IgEs) were of very limited value in the diagnosis of chronic sinusitis.
