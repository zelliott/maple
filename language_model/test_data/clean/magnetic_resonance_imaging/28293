We report a case of Lhermitte-Duclos disease (cerebellar gangliocytoma) in a 7-year-old child with caf√© au lait spots and mild cerebellar symptoms. Findings on computed tomography 4 years earlier had been normal. Subsequent development of intracranial hypertension caused by hydrocephalus led to ventriculoperitoneal shunting. The appearance of the cerebellum on magnetic resonance imaging was supportive of the diagnosis, and open biopsy confirmed it.
