Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and pharmacokinetic models have been used to measure tumour permeability (K(trans)) and leakage volume (ve) in numerous studies. The construction of pharmacokinetic models describing such tissue properties relies on defining the blood plasma concentration of contrast agent with respect to time (Cp(t)). When direct measurement is not possible a bi-exponential decay has been applied using data from healthy volunteers. This work investigates, by simulation, the magnitude of errors resulting from this definition with respect to normal variation in renal function and for cases with renal impairment. Errors up to 23% in ve and 28% in K(trans) were found for the normal simulations, and 67% in ve and 61% in K(trans) for the impaired simulations. If this bi-exponential curve is used as an input function to the generalized kinetic model and used in oncology, estimates of tissue permeability and leakage volume will possess large errors due to variation in Cp(t) curves between subjects.
