To determine the feasibility of measuring diffusion into human intervertebral disks by means of MR imaging with an intravenous nonionic gadolinium complex (gadoteridol).

In 18 patients undergoing lumbar spine MR imaging, signal intensity was measured in the intervertebral disks after a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg and after a supplemental dose of 0.2 mmol/kg.

Signal intensity in the intervertebral disks increased with both gadoteridol doses. A greater increase was consistently achieved with the 0.3 mmol/kg (total) dose than with the 0.1 mmol/kg dose. The increase was greater near the endplates than in the midportion of the disk.

Diffusion into human intervertebral disks can be detected with MR imaging after intravenous administration of gadoteridol. MR imaging with a paramagnetic contrast medium can be used to study diffusion into disk cartilage in vivo and noninvasively.
