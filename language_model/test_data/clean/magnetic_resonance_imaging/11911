Right ventricular structure and function were characterized in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) using non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. These studies therefore complement previous reports preoccupied with left ventricular changes associated with this condition. Eight SHR and eight control normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were each subdivided into equal age-matched groups of 8 and 12 weeks. The right ventricle was imaged through a series of twelve contiguous 1.37-1.75 mm transverse sections at twelve equally spaced time-points that covered both systole and most of diastole thereby completely reconstructing right ventricular anatomy. This gave measurements of right ventricular myocardial mass that were consistent through all twelve time-points in all four experimental groups throughout their cardiac cycles. However, spontaneous hypertension increased this right ventricular myocardial mass, as well as the end-diastolic (EDV) and end-systolic volumes (ESV). Although stroke volume (SV) was conserved, decreases in ejection fraction (EF), a positive shift in the relationship between SV and EDV, and reduced indices of systolic ejection rates in SHR rats compared with the age-matched normal WKY controls indicated significant systolic dysfunction. Additionally, reductions in the rates of diastolic relaxation suggested the onset of diastolic dysfunction. Thus, the non-invasive nature of MRI has made it possible for the first time to demonstrate alterations in structure of the right ventricle and in quantitative indicators of its systolic and diastolic function in the SHR model of hypertension.
