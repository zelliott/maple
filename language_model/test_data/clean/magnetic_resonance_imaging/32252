We present a 27-year-old woman with an epidermoid cyst at the cerebellopontine (CP) angle with caudal extension into the upper cervical spinal canal. The lesion showed unusual hyperintensity on T1-weighted images, and hypointensity on T2-weighted images. We used microneurosurgical techniques for tumour dissection and excision. To our knowledge, this is the fifth example in Index Medicus/MEDLINE of histopathologically proven CP angle epidermoid with cervical spine extension.
