Clinical applications of MR imaging in the setting of acute extremity injuries are discussed in general and by anatomic regions. General indications include physeal injuries, occult fractures, stress fractures, musculotendinous injuries, and ligamentous injuries. Indications of MR imaging in the acute injury setting have been expanding. MR imaging is often used to triage patients definitively to surgical versus conservative treatment for such conditions as suspected hip fracture. High-performance athletes are also often imaged acutely. Radiologists need to be familiar with the possible applications of MR imaging to acute extremity injuries, and discuss with referring physicians what indications are appropriate locally. In this way, the role of MR imaging in this area will be further defined in the future.
