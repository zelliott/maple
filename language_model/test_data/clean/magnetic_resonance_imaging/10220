This study was performed to test whether the dissociation rate of free Gd3+ ions from gadoterate meglumine is significantly increased when the contrast agent is dissolved in ethanol and whether the magnetic resonance (MR) signal of gadolinium/ethanol solutions is enhanced to a degree that promises reliable detection during MR imaging-guided intralesional administration, such as for the treatment of low-flow venous malformations.

The apparent gadoterate meglumine-induced enhancement of the longitudinal proton relaxation rate of sterile ethanol/water solutions, stored at a temperature of 24 degrees C +/- 5 degrees C in the dark, was monitored for 2 weeks. The content of dissociated Gd3+ ions was determined after 6 and 8.5 months of storage. The signal difference between contrast agent/ethanol solutions and muscle tissue was assessed with imaging at 0.5 T and 1.5 T.

Commercialized gadoterate meglumine diluted with 94% ethanol was not shown to have released toxic Gd3+ during storage times that exceed its physiologic circulation and excretion times after intravenous injection by a factor of more than 100. A maximum dissociation rate of 0.05% per month was estimated from the detection limit of the analysis. The apparent molar relaxivity of the contrast agent in the mixtures varied by less than 0.1 L/mmol per second with no temporal trend. Gradient-echo ethanol/muscle contrast increased with Gd concentrations to maximums of 15 mmol/L (at 0.5 T) and 25 mmol/L (at 1.5 T).

Neither limited solubility nor release of Gd3+ ions could be identified as a general safety hazard associated with the application of gadoterate meglumine/ethanol solutions at Gd concentrations of 0.5-25 mmol/L, and such ablation mixtures could be efficiently and reliably visualized.
