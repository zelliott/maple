Despite the significant success achieved in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) that allows to control the disease course, neurologists have to use immunosupressors in cases of progressive course or ineffectiveness of the first-choice drugs (beta-interferons and glatimer acetate). Currently, mitoxantron is one of the widely used immunosupressors. Thirty patients with MS with relapsing and secondary-progressive MS receiving mitoxantron were studied in the Tyumen's MS center. Neurological status, frequency of exacerbations, progression index were evaluated. Brain MRI was conducted. Safety and tolerability of mitoxantron were assessed as well. Duration of the study was on average 39 months. The significant reduction of pathological process activity reflected in stopping exacerbations in relapsing MS was found. The rate of disease progression was decreased significantly in secondary-progressive MS. The first results of this study revealed that mitoxantron was well tolerated in the monotherapy and in the combination with immunomodulators. Because of remote risks of side-effects, all patients treated with mitoxantron should be examined not only during the treatment but in the following years.
