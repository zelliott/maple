Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has superseded computed tomography (CT) in the diagnostic assessment of cancer of the uterus (endometrial and cervical carcinoma). Contrast-enhanced MR imaging is highly accurate in staging endometrial carcinoma, in particular in terms of the depth of myometrial invasion. MR imaging will in the future provide a good basis for preoperative therapeutic decision making, especially to answer the question whether or not lymphadenectomy is necessary based on myometrial infiltration depth. - This article outlines the potential of MR imaging for staging endometrial cancer, provides a brief description of the imaging strategies, and discusses the role of MR imaging in the diagnostic assessment of endometrial cancer.
