The spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia has been reported infrequently. In patients with Chiari I malformations, resolution of the syringomyelia has sometimes been associated with improvement of their malformation. The authors present a case of spontaneous resolution followed by recurrence of syringomyelia and a corresponding change in the Chiari malformation. This case is of interest in light of the theories postulated to explain spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia.
