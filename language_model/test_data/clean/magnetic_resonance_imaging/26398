Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques allow for significantly better imaging of the temporal lobe compared to computed tomography (CT) or other non-invasive modalities. For detection of foreign tissue lesions, MRI surpasses CT. For the highest non-invasive yield for detection of mesial temporal sclerosis, optimal sequences that should be employed are a heavily T1-weighted volumetric acquisition (to enable both volumetric calculation of hippocampal volume, and, if needed, intracranial volume), T2-weighted coronal sequences, with or without T2-mapping, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and, to exclude subtle susceptibility effects from hematoma or cavernoma, gradient echo scans. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) may show a decrease in N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) concentration, or NAA: Choline + creatine ratio. Functional MRI is a new and exciting tool that offers the promise of accurately localizing hemispheric functions; its role in the preoperative evaluation of temporal lobe seizures remains uncertain at present.
