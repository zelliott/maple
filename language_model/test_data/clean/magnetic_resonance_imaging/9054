Patients with a PROP1 inactivating mutation present combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) and pituitary maldevelopment. A retrospective analysis of 31 CPHD patients with a PROP1 mutation revealed two individuals, aged 18 and 4.5 years, who had undergone subtotal surgery to remove pituitary tumors, 16.8 x 12 mm and 9 x 10 x 12 mm in size. Histological reassessment of tissue samples revealed epithelial cells, partially oxyphilic, forming gland-like microcystic structures, most of them filled with eosinophilic colloid. These structures were directly linked with fragments of the posterior lobe. Neither atypia nor any traces of proliferation activity (Ki-67 LI=0%) were noted. Immunohistochemistry showed the presence of all hormonal phenotypes of cells. These findings corresponded to the intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland. For this type of pathology we propose the term 'cystic hyperplasia of the intermediate pituitary lobe' and suggest PROP1 gene assessment in patients with CPHD in order to avoid unnecessary neurosurgical interventions.
