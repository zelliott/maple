Monodisperse and uniform AuNP-decorated, dye-doped, superparamagnetic nanocomposites (Fe3 O4 @dye-hybrid@Au) are fabricated by using a simple method in which the Au NP formation and their attachment onto the core surface via S-Au covalent bonds proceeds almost simultaneously in a one-pot synthesis. The as-synthesized nanocomposites can simultaneously enhance the contrast effects for MR, CT, and cellular-sensitive optical imaging.
