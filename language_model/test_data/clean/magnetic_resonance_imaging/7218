Thirty-five patients, selected according to the criteria of Onik and operated on by automated percutaneous lumbar discectomy, were evaluated in a retrospective study in order to assess correlation between clinical results and characteristics of the disc herniation and the value of current imaging techniques in selecting patients for percutaneous discectomy. Percutaneous discectomy is not indicated for narrow, postero-lateral herniated discs (3 cases, 3 failures). Two-thirds of the failures are consequences of inaccurate CAT scan images (false-negative images of subligamentous migration of the herniated disc).
