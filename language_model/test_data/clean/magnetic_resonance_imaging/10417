The aim of the current study was to show if contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) could be improved without loss of diagnostic accuracy if a phase-sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) single-shot TrueFISP sequence is used at 3.0 T instead of 1.5 T.

Ten patients with myocardial infarction were examined on a 1.5 T magnetic resonance (MR) system (Avanto, Siemens Medical Systems) and at a 3.0 T MR system. Imaging delayed contrast enhancement was started 10 minutes after application of contrast material. A phase-sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) single-shot TrueFISP sequence was used at 1.5 and 3.0 T and compared with a segmented IR turboFLASH sequence at 1.5 T, which served as the reference method. Infarct volumes and CNR of infarction and normal myocardium were compared with the reference method.

The PSIR Single-Shot TrueFISP technique allows for imaging nine slices during a single breathhold without adaptation of the inversion time. The mean value of CNR between infarction and normal myocardium was 5.9 at 1.5 T and 12.2 at 3.0 T (magnitude images). The CNR mean value of the reference method was 8.4. The CNR mean value at 3.0 T was significantly (P = 0.03) higher than the mean value of the reference method. The correlation coefficients of the infarct volumes, determined with the PSIR single-shot TrueFISP technique at 1.5 T and at 3.0 T and compared with the reference method, were r = 0.96 (P = 0.001) and r = 0.99 (P = 0.0001).

The use of PSIR single-shot TrueFISP at 3.0 T allows for accurate detection and assessment of myocardial infarction. CNR is significantly higher at 3.0 T compared with 1.5 T. The PSIR single-shot technique at 3.0 T provides a higher CNR than the segmented reference technique at 1.5 T.
