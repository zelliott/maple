A 47-year-old woman with a history of myomectomies and uterine artery embolization 15 years previously presented with increasing menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated multiple enhancing fibroids, extensive uterine supply from what appeared to be patent uterine arteries, and significant supply from what appeared to be the left ovarian artery. Aortography demonstrated no ovarian supply, but extensive collateral supply from distal branches of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), with further collateral supply from the anterior division of both internal iliac arteries. There was no filling of the uterine arteries distal to the coils. Embolization was performed with technical and clinical success. This case highlights the potential for recruitment of collateral vessels following coil embolization and is the first reported case of successful fibroid embolization from distal IMA branches.
