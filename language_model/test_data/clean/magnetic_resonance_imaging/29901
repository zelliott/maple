The aim of this study was to create an experimental model of disc degeneration that closely mimicked human disc degeneration. In six domestic pigs, an L4 cranial endplate perforation into the nucleus pulposus was made. Three months postoperatively, compressive testing was performed on the L2-L4 motion segments, and intradiscal pressure was measured in the intervening discs. Histochemical and morphologic examinations were made on the excised degenerated and adjacent discs. A significant reduction in water content was observed in the outer anterior annulus of the degenerated disc. In the nucleus, the proteoglycan content was significantly reduced, as well as the cellularity, although not significantly. The nucleus lost its gel-like structure and was discolored, and there was delamination of annular layers. Intradiscal pressure in the nucleus was significantly lower in the degenerated disc. In conclusion, experimental degeneration of the intervertebral disc induced by endplate penetration resembled human disc degeneration, as exemplified by biochemical and structural changes.
