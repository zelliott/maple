The presence of an atlantoaxial degenerative articular cyst is rare; when present this lesion extends posteriorly to the dens, causing cervicomedullary compressive myelopathy. The authors describe a symptomatic case of this lesion associated with atlantoaxial subluxation in a 76-year-old man. The patient's neurological symptoms resolved and corresponded to a reduction in the size of the cyst. After 8 months of continued conservative treatment, in which the patient wore a Philadelphia collar, the cyst spontaneously regressed. Subsequently, a C1-2 posterior fusion was performed to treat the atlantoaxial subluxation.
