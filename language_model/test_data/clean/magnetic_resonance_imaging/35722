"Diffusion of Innovation" is a marketing theory that predicts the pattern of adoption of new products, with specific characteristics of the product determining the rate of adoption.

A computer Medline search to assess the number of articles printed on MRI shows that MRI is being adopted more slowly than CT, but like CT, MRI is following the pattern predicted by the Diffusion Theory.
