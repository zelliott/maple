Total spondyloptosis of the cervical spine is a very rare injury. The authors describe an unusual case of post-traumatic total spondyloptosis of the cervical spine at C7-T1 level.

A 40-year-old man presented with weakness of all four limbs, impaired sensations in all limbs and neck pain after a fall. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the cervical spine revealed a total spondyloptosis at C7-T1 level. He was managed successfully with ventral decompression and uninstrumented in situ fusion. The patient had a good neurologic outcome.

Selected patients with spondyloptosis of the cervical spine can be successfully managed with uninstrumented ventral surgery.
