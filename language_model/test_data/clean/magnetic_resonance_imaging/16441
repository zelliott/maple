A 40-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of double vision combined with left ptosis. Although at 25 years of age she had already been diagnosed with limb weakness associated with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), she had never experienced double vision until her latest condition. Neurological examination revealed left oculomotor palsy without other cranial nerve involvement. Serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies demonstrated a temporal correlation between clinical severity of oculomotor palsy and segmental enhancement of the oculomotor nerve. Gadolinium enhancement on MRI may be a significant finding indicating relapse of oculomotor involvement of CIDP.
