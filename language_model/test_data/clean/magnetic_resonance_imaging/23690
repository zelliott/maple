Magnetic resonance images were carried out in the children with Down syndrome aged 2-4 years old compared with the values of the age-matched controls. The pons and cerebellar vermis were significantly smaller and the cerebral peduncles were narrower in Down syndrome. None of the patients showed delay of myelination. These findings suggest hypoplasia of the pons and cerebellum in Down syndrome.
