To assess the ability of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) to measure functional vascular pharmacokinetic parameters of normal human ovaries in vivo using an open linear two-compartment pharmacokinetic model.

Twenty-one women with no ovarian disease underwent DCE-MRI. Sequential images were acquired during injection of a contrast bolus. Ovarian volumes were calculated and pharmacokinetic data analyzed using a pharmacokinetic model. Ovarian tissue was compared with skeletal muscle to demonstrate the pharmacokinetic parameters.

Normal ovarian tissue was found to enhance rapidly and dramatically. When compared with skeletal muscle as a control, ovarian tissue was seen to demonstrate a significantly higher maximum enhancement factor and amplitude of the upslope, although there was no significant difference in the exchange rate. Sample size precluded conclusions about differences due to menstrual cycle or menopausal status.

The results reflect the vascular physiology of the normal ovary. Definition of the pharmacokinetic properties of normal ovaries will allow DCE-MRI to be applied prospectively to conduct noninvasive, in vivo studies of ovarian angiogenic function, including response to drugs, contraceptive research, assessment of polycystic ovary syndrome, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, diagnosis of malignancy and prediction of response to antiangiogenic chemotherapy.
