Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the normal eyeball and orbital tissues is introduced, along with the MRI manifestations in 39 patients comprising 6 cases of intraocular and 29 cases of intraorbital disorders, and 4 cases of vascular diseases. The advantages and limitations of MRI in ophthalmology are discussed. It appears that MRI is more sensitive than ultrasonic B-scan or CT.
