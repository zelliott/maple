Primary ectopic meningiomas are rare, but may be seen in the head and neck region. The temporal bone and its neural foramen are rarely the site of a primary meningioma. This report describes the CT and MRI appearance of an ectopic meningioma arising at the anatomic location of the geniculate ganglion, and discusses the differential diagnosis as well as the possible origin of the tumor.
