The aim of this study was to investigate the progression of dopaminergic hypofunction in striatal subregions in Parkinson's disease (PD). We studied 12 patients with early PD and 11 healthy controls with a dopamine transporter ligand 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-[(18)F]-fluorophenyl)tropane ([(18)F]CFT) positron emission tomography (PET). The PET scan was carried out twice with an average interval of 2.2 years. The regions of interest (anterior and posterior putamen, caudate nucleus, and cerebellum) were drawn on individual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, matched with the PET images, and copied onto the PET images. At the first PET scan in PD patients, the [(18)F]CFT uptake in the anterior putamen was 1.92 +/- 0.67, which was 45% of the control mean, and in the posterior putamen 1.02 +/- 0.55, being only 27% of the control mean. For the caudate nucleus the corresponding figure was 2.55 +/- 0.58 (71% of the control mean). The uptake ratios had declined significantly by the time of the second PET scan and the absolute annual rate of decline of the tracer uptake was 0.23 +/- 0.14 (P < 0.001) in the anterior putamen, 0.13 +/- 0.13 (P = 0.005) in the posterior putamen, and 0.20 +/- 0.15 (P < 0.001) in the caudate nucleus. There was a statistically significant difference of the decline in the tracer uptake between the anterior and posterior putamen (P = 0.033). When the rate of progression was calculated compared to the normal control mean, the rate of annual decline was 5.3% in the anterior putamen, 3.3% in the posterior putamen, and 5.6% in the caudate nucleus, without significant changes among striatal subregions (P = 0.10). When ipsi- and contralateral sides were analyzed separately, the absolute decline of [(18)F]CFT uptake in the putamen was higher in the side ipsilateral to the predominant symptoms than in the contralateral side (P = 0.035 for anterior putamen and P = 0.026 for posterior putamen). In the caudate nucleus the absolute decline was not different between ipsi- and contralateral sides (P = 0.76). In healthy controls, no significant decline of [(18)F]CFT uptake was detected. The results are suggestive of slower progression in the posterior putamen, where the disease is more advanced, but studies to follow up the same patient at several time points are needed to resolve this question.
