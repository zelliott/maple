We report four cases of focal myositis. The patients, three men and one woman, had painful muscle hypertrophy, affecting four different sites. MRI confirmed the muscle enlargement and oedema. Electromyography revealed evidence of acute and chronic denervation in all four cases. Muscle biopsy was available in three and confirmed features suggestive of focal myositis. Based on our patient material, we suggest that chronic nerve irritation, such as compression, can lead to muscle hypertrophy which, when prolonged, provokes fibre necrosis and secondary inflammation. Our finding in four patients having hypertrophy involving four different sites, leads us further to suggest that this may be the common mechanism behind focal myositis.
