In the present report we describe a case of an asymptomatic splenic cystic lymphangioma in a 43 year-old female. Only a few cases of this benign tumor have been reported in adult patients so far. Clinical examination revealed a tender mass in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen. Abdominal ultrasound and CT-scan revealed a large well-defined splenic cystic mass surrounded by multiple peripheral cysts, all divided by thin septa. MRI confirmed these findings and excluded the possibility of malignant degeneration. Histologic examination permitted the accurate diagnosis to be made. Different imaging findings of this tumor have been described but only a few reports have focused on the value of MRI imaging.
