A 10-yr-old gymnast, training well below the elite level, reported a 3-wk history of bilateral dorsal wrist pain. Physical examination and radiographic findings were consistent with stress injury to the distal radial growth plates. The patient's radiographs also displayed rare findings including cleft radial and ulnar epiphyses, as well as epiphyseal spur formation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated evidence of metaphyseal and epiphyseal ischemia of the growth plate. The patient responded well to conservative treatment, including ice, splinting, and activity modification. This case illustrates several potentially confusing radiographic abnormalities and the emerging role of MRI in evaluating wrist pain in young gymnasts.
