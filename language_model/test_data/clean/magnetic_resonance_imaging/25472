We sought to compare the biometry of the fetal head on MR imaging with sonographic measurements in fetuses with and without suspected central nervous system abnormalities.

Blinded retrospective measurements of biparietal diameter, head circumference, and cerebellar width obtained on MR imaging were assigned a gestational age on the basis of median sonographic measurements and compared with sonographic and clinical assignment of gestational age in fetuses with no central nervous system abnormalities. In fetuses with central nervous system abnormalities, the same MR measurements were compared with sonographic measurements obtained within 1 week. Single-shot fast spin-echo sequences were obtained. Pearson's product moment correlation coefficients and paired sample t tests were performed.

In 22 fetuses with no suspected central nervous system abnormalities, significant correlation was seen in the assignment of gestational age by MR measurements and sonographic gestational age. In 25 fetuses with central nervous system abnormalities, significant correlation was also seen between biparietal diameter and head circumference measurements. The mean biparietal diameter on MR imaging was greater than on sonography in those fetuses with central nervous system abnormalities (p = 0.038).

MR imaging measurements of biparietal diameter, head circumference, and cerebellar width are strongly correlated to gestational age in fetuses without central nervous system abnormalities. Significant correlation is found between MR imaging and sonographic measurements of biparietal diameter and head circumference in fetuses with central nervous system abnormalities. Larger biparietal diameter measurements were seen with MR imaging than with sonography in the abnormal group. Fetal central nervous system biometry can be performed as part of the MR imaging evaluation of the fetal central nervous system.
