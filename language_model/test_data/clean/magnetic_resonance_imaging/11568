Osseous involvement is common in sarcoidosis, but most cases of osseous sarcoidosis occur in the long bones of the hands and feet. Vertebral involvement in sarcoidosis is rare. A case of vertebral sarcoidosis in a 19-year-old male football player is presented. The patient had clinical, radiologic, laboratory, and pathologic findings consistent with a case of vertebral sarcoidosis. A review of the literature on sarcoid involvement of the spine is also presented. Although rare, sarcoid infiltration of the vertebrae is a recognized entity. Magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful in making the diagnosis, but biopsy is needed for confirmation.
