Pheochromocytomas are rare endocrine tumors. They can be associated with a wide variety of symptoms, although hypertension is the most consistent clinical sign. Ultrasonography is very effective in localizing these tumors, but extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas are best diagnosed with 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scanning. Extensive investigation is ongoing to determine markers for the presence of these tumors and diagnostic tests that localize the site of pheochromocytomas, with extensive research at the molecular level. New surgical techniques are being employed, particularly laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Finally, complications of pheochromocytomas are discussed in several papers; the primary concern is cardiac problems.
