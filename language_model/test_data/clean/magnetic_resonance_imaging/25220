Plasma cell granuloma of the central nervous system is rare and less than 30 cases have been reported in literature.

A 64-year-old woman complained of headache, and computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain revealed a tumour at the right anterior-third parasagittal region which led us to diagnose a parasagittal meningioma. We performed total resection of the tumour and the pathological diagnosis was plasma cell granuloma. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangements produced no monoclonal band. This patient underwent no supplementary treatment and no recurrent tumour was observed for 3 years.

A case of plasma cell granuloma which is diagnosed with genetic analysis is presented. An analysis of the clonality using the PCR procedure would play an important role in supporting the pathological and clinical diagnosis.
