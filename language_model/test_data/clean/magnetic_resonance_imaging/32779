Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion is a rare occurrence that results in defects to oxidative phosphorylation. The common clinical presentations of mtDNA deletion vary but include mitochondrial myopathy, Pearson syndrome, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia. Here, we report the case of a 10-year-old boy who presented with progressive deterioration of his clinical status (which included hypoglycemia, short stature, sensorineural hearing loss, retinitis pigmentosa, and chronic gastrointestinal dysmotility) that progressed to acute deterioration with pancreatitis, Fanconi syndrome, lactic acidosis, and acute encephalopathy. Following treatment, the patient was stabilized and his neurological condition improved. Through a combination of histological examinations and biochemical and molecular analyses, mitochondrial disease was confirmed. A novel 3670-base pair deletion (deletion of mtDNA nt 7,628-11,297) was identified in the muscle tissue. A direct repeat of CTACT at the breakpoints was also detected.
