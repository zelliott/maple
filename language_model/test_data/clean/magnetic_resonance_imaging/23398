We report a patient with an unusual presentation of a temporal low-grade glioma with visual symptoms of formed, coloured meaningful images without coexistent psychiatric symptoms or epileptiform activity consistent with a diagnosis of visual hallucinosis. The location and extent of the lesion on the MRI differs from the lesions commonly associated with this diagnosis.
