Regional three-dimensional (3-D) right (RV) and left ventricular (LV) geometry was studied in eight dogs before and 5-6 mo after induction of mitral regurgitation (MR). Ventricular shape changes were quantified with a 3-D finite-element model fitted to chamber contours traced on cardiac magnetic resonance images. MR increased LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV; 99 vs. 57 ml; P < 0.001) and LV stroke volume (LVSV; 55 vs. 26 ml; P < 0.001). In contrast, RVEDV decreased (45 vs. 55 ml; P < 0.01), whereas SV was maintained. LV mass (free wall plus septum) increased (115 vs. 94 g; P < 0.05), whereas RV free-wall mass was relatively unchanged. Shape changes due to MR were characterized by a marked (7.4-mm) rightward shift of the septum relative to the lateral LV free wall at end diastole. In contrast, the distance from the RV free wall to the lateral LV free wall was relatively unchanged (2.7 mm). The distance between the LV lateral free wall and septum increased more than the distance between the anterior and posterior LV walls (22 vs. 15%; P = 0.04). During systole, the displacement of the septum into the LV increased significantly (7.3 vs. 2.9 mm; P < 0.01). Consistent with the end-diastolic dimension changes, LV endocardial circumferential curvature was decreased at end diastole to a greater extent in the anterior and posterior walls than in the septal and lateral walls (P < 0.01). Thus chronic MR produced an asymmetric LV dilatation with regional variation in geometry. The septum increased its contribution to the LVSV at the expense of RVEDV. RVSV was maintained, possibly by ventricular interaction.
