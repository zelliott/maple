To compare six MR sequences (plain and gadolinium-enhanced fat suppressed T1-weighted spin echo, T2-weighted standard spin echo, fat-suppressed and non-fat-suppressed T2-weighted fast spin echo, and inversion-recovery T2-weighted fast spin echo) in their ability to detect, delineate, and characterize lesions of the parotid gland.

Fifty-eight parotid gland lesions imaged on 47 examinations were retrospectively evaluated by three blinded observers. Several outcome-related variables were compared by the above six sequences: imaging time, image quality, anatomic sharpness of parotid space, subjective lesion conspicuity, detected abnormality volume, number of individual lesions or discrete lobulations, conspicuity of invasion into adjacent boundaries and structures, and overall diagnostic value.

Differences in the above outcome variables between sequences did not correlate with MR scanner software upgrade level, coil type, or lesion-dependent characteristics. Fat-suppressed fast spin-echo T2-weighted and inversion-recovery fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequences resulted in significantly higher scores for lesion conspicuity, detected abnormality volume, and overall diagnostic value. T1-weighted images resulted in the next highest scores, whereas gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted and standard spin-echo T2-weighted sequences performed poorly for most parotid lesions.

MR imaging of the parotid gland should include fat-suppressed, long-repetition-time, fast spin-echo T2-weighted, and T1-weighted sequences. Gadolinium-enhanced images need not be obtained routinely.
