In the postoperative period of posterior spinal surgery, surgeons usually encounter a wide spectrum of complications, including retained surgical sponge, gossypiboma.

Retrospective review of case records of eight patients diagnosed with gossypiboma with emphasis on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings.

All the eight patients presented with low back pain and/or symptoms of infection, such as draining from the incision site, fever, and tenderness. The diagnosis was confirmed by the imaging findings on MRI with gadolinium enhancement.

Retained paravertebral surgical sponges are seldom reported due to medicolegal implications. Awareness of this complication among neurosurgeons and radiologists is essential to avoid unnecessary morbidity.
