A 6-year-old ShihTzu presented with tonic-clonic cluster seizure. T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images showed bilateral diffuse hyperintense lesions at the cerebral cortex with enlarged sulci. Computed tomography revealed a portosystemic shunt (PSS) and azygos continuation. Based on the clinical signs, blood examinations and diagnostic images, the dog was diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy secondary to PSS. The neurologic signs were gradually improved after medical therapy for hyperammonemia. This is the first report of hyperintensity of the cerebral cortex on T2-weighted MR images associated with acute hepatic encephalopathy in a dog.
