The technique of simultaneous acquisition of magnetic resonance images from two different locations was combined with a modification of a commercially available oblique multisection method. By angling the sections slightly from the coronal plane and rotating the subject, simultaneous sections can be obtained within the given repetition time through both regions without a loss of the signal-to-noise ratio that would result from the use of true coronal sections. The technique has allowed simultaneous imaging of both shoulders and, with rotation of the subject, both knees.
