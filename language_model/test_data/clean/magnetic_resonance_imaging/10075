Cerebral dyschromatopsia is traditionally evaluated by color discrimination tests such as the Farnsworth-Maunsell 100 Hue Test. These tests are also used to evaluate color-perception deficits caused by eye disease, and they do not tell us whether color perception is impaired in the eye or in the brain. Here, we used color afterimage to isolate color-perception deficits in the brain from those in the eyes, in a patient with cerebral dyschromatopsia. The results showed that the patient perceived color afterimage of yellow and blue with abnormal duration and chromaticity. On the other hand, the patient performed normally on the Farnsworth-Maunsell 100 Hue Test. We conclude that the color afterimage test would be useful to evaluate color perception in the brain.
