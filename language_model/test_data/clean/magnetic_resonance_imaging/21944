We present two cases of unusually large skull base paragangliomas. The first tumor was accompanied by marked bony destruction of the central skull base and multiple associated cysts. The second tumor arose along the petrous ridge, with a large intracranial component. The CT, MR imaging, angiographic, histologic, and electron microscopic findings of these unusual lesions are described.
