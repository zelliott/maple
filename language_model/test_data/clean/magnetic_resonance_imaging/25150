The objective of this study is to report on the complete arthroscopic repair of full-thickness tears of the supraspinatus.

Prospective cohort study.

Between 1995 and 1999, 139 full arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs were performed; 37 were repairs of full-thickness supraspinatus tears. Between 1997 and 1999, there were 24 patients who had a complete arthroscopic repair of supraspinatus tears. The preoperative and postoperative status of these patients was analyzed using the Constant score, American Shoulder and Elbow Society Index (ASES Index), a Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS), a single question of percent function compared with the opposite unaffected extremity, and a single question reflecting satisfaction, "Would you undergo the surgery and the postoperative rehabilitation to achieve the result you have today?" There were 37 patients who had preoperative to postoperative VAS, percent function, postoperative acromiohumeral interval, and clinical rerupture incidences evaluated. The null hypothesis was tested and there was no difference between the preoperative to postoperative outcomes. Two groups were evaluated, those who had concomitant decompression and those who did not.

The null hypothesis was not supported. The 4 scoring systems used for evaluation showed statistically significant improvement from preoperative to postoperative. There were no differences in outcome based upon sex or age as a variable. All patients would have surgery again to achieve their postoperative state.

The arthroscopic repair of supraspinatus tears is effective for improving the functional status of the shoulder.
