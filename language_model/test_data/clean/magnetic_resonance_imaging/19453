Diagnosis of congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (L-TGA) with situs inversus totalis in two adult patients was made by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Visualization of the complete anatomy and quantification of ventricular function was possible. Relevant concomitant disease such as perimembraneous ventricular septal defect, atrial secundum septal defect, tricuspid regurgitation, valvular pulmonic stenosis, and pulmonary artery dilatation were clearly depicted by MRI using standard spin-echo and gradient-echo techniques. Findings were confirmed by cardiac catheterization in both patients. In this rare and complex congenital cardiac anomaly, MRI is an excellent imaging modality as echocardiography may be difficult to interpret due to restricted imaging windows. MRI may help in the decision about the necessity to undergo further invasive evaluation and may help to make cardiac catheterization a straightforward procedure.
