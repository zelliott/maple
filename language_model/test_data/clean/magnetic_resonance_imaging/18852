The neurocentral junction (NCJ) is a cartilaginous growth plate in the vertebra that has been implicated as a potential cause of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) since the early 1900s. Studies to date have focused on the age of closure without characterizing normal NCJ development. Using MRI, the normal development of the NCJ image can be determined and the stages preceding the disappearance of the NCJ image can be characterized. 405 NCJs from 11 pediatric patients were examined using MRI and the various images were categorized. NCJ development encompassed five stages, with a specific pattern of absence of the NCJ image noted in each vertebra and in the vertebral column as a whole. The image of the NCJ first became absent in the cervical region (age 6), then in the lumbar region (age 12) and finally in the thoracic region (age 14). These patterns of development serve as a baseline to evaluate NCJ pathology in conditions such as adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).
