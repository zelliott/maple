A PC based system for simulating image-guided interventional neuroradiological procedures for physician training and patient specific pretreatment planning is described. The system allows physicians to manipulate and interface interventional devices such as catheters, guidewires, stents and coils within 2-D and hybrid surface and volume rendered 3-D patient vascular images in real time. A finite element method is employed to model the interaction of the catheters and guidewires with the vascular system. Fluoroscopic, roadmapping and volume rendered 3-D presentations of the vasculature are provided. System software libraries allow for the use of commonly employed catheters, guidewires, stents and occluding coils of various shapes and sizes. The results of an initial clinical validation suggest that the experience gained from our simulator is comparable with that of using a vascular phantom. We are conducting further validation with the aim of providing patient specific pretreatment planning.
