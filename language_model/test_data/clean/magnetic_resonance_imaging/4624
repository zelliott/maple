Although the correlation between fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and intracranial aneurysm is well established, the combination of FMD with a giant aneurysm is rare. This paper reports a patient with extracranial FMD associated with a giant intracavernous aneurysm compromising the trigeminal and abducens nerve. A review of the literature uncovered only four documented cases of FMD with concurrent giant intracranial aneurysms. The present case adds further weight to the argument for including FMD in the differential diagnosis list when confronted with a patient with a giant intracranial aneurysm. Absence of adequate collaterals in this patient eliminated ligation as a treatment strategy for the aneurysm.
