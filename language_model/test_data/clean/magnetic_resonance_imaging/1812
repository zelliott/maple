To assess by MRI, using a pelvic phased array coil, the accuracy for staging prostate carcinoma and to correlate the results with the rate of positive surgical margins.

Between January 1995 and December 1999, 176 patients with localized prostate carcinoma underwent a preoperative MRI examination using a pelvic phased-array coil (1 Tesla). MRI and histological results were compared in a prospective study.

131 were classified T2 and 45 were classified T3 at MRI. Pathologic findings showed 103 pT2 and 73 pT3. The accuracy of MRI (extra capsular or vesicle extension) was 75%. The risk for a patient labelled T2 or T3 at MRI to have a positive surgical margin was respectively 13.7% and 31%.

This study shows that the phased-array coil has a low sensitivity but a good specificity to distinguish between organ-confined cancer or not. It shows that the risk of positive surgical margins is higher for T3 lesions at MRI. The low sensitivity should be improved by using a multi coil phased array.
