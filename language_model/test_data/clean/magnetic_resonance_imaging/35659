Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SPONK) usually involves a single condyle or plateau. The medial femoral condyle (MFC) is most often involved and spontaneous osteonecrosis of the medial tibial plateau (MTP) is a rare condition, representing only 2% of all necroses reported in the knee. SPONK involving both the MFC and the MTP is extremely rare. SPONK occurring in either the MFC or the MTP individually might extend to the corresponding side of the knee in the advanced end-stage; however, in that situation, significant degenerative changes would exist and it might be difficult to differentiate end-stage SPONK form severe osteoarthritis. SPONK affecting both the MFC and the MTP without significant secondary osteoarthritic changes has not been reported, even though it is difficult to know which occurs first. We have cared for three patients with histologically proven osteonecrosis of the MFC and MTP and report their radiologic features.
