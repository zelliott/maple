Spinal cord injured persons have limited possibilities to perform physical training. By use of computerized, feed-back controlled electrical stimulation of the gluteal, the hamstrings and the quadriceps muscles cycle ergometry can be performed by the spinal cord injured individual. The cardiovascular demands of this training is higher than with voluntary upper body training using the intact innervated muscles. The inactivity related conditions caused by the spinal cord injury are reversed in part by regular electrically stimulated training. An increase is seen in maximal oxygen consumption, in the insulin stimulated glucose uptake and in the muscular mass and bone mineral content of the lower extremities. Electrically induced cycle ergometry is thoroughly investigated, relatively safe, but time consuming. As this training in addition results in the same well being as seen by training in able bodied individuals it can be recommended for motivated patients.
