Pseudoephedrine is a nasal vasoconstrictor and is contained in many cough and cold medications. It is generally harmless when used in recommended doses. Hypertensive crisis, psychosis, hemorrhagic stroke, and intracranial hemorrhage have been reported as severe complications. We report a 4-year-old girl with nasopharyngeal rhabdomyosarcoma who developed stroke while on pseudoephedrine therapy for 3 days and had no hematological abnormalities.
