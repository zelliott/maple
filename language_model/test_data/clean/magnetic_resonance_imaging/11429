Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed in patients with Parkinson's disease during deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (three patients) and during deep brain stimulation of the ventral intermedius nucleus of the thalamus (one patient). All showed an increase in blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in the subcortical regions ipsilateral to the stimulated nucleus. This effect cannot be simply explained by a mechanism of depolarization blockade; rather, it is caused by overstimulation of the target nucleus, resulting in the suppression of its spontaneous activity. We confirm that fMRI during deep brain stimulation is a safe method with considerable potential for elucidating the functional connectivity of the stimulated nuclei.
