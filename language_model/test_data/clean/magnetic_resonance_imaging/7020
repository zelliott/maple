The hippocampal formation (HF) of healthy control subjects and schizophrenic patients was examined using an MRI experiment that implements sequences for relaxometry and magnetization transfer (MT) quantification. In addition to the semi-quantitative magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), all of the observable properties of the binary spin bath model were included. The study demonstrates that, in contrast to the MTR, quantitative MT parameters (especially the T2 relaxation time of restricted protons, T2b) are capable to differentiate functionally significant subregions within the HF. The MT methodology appears to be a promising new tool for the differential microstructural evaluation of the HF in neuropsychiatric disorders accompanied by memory disturbances.
