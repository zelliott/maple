Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is particularly well suited to cardiovascular studies since the spontaneous contrast between circulating blood and the cardiac and vascular structures is excellent. The theoretical principles and technical modalities of MRI are summarized prior to describing its cardiovascular applications. Owing to the quality of its anatomical images MRI was first used in daily practice to complete or replace other imaging methods. Its applications are illustrated here. They include aortic pathology (aneurysm, dissection, postoperative control), complex congenital cardiac pathology, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, heart tumours, post-infarction ventricular aneurysms, and pericardial pathology. The applications of MRI that are currently being evaluated or developed are described. Due to the recent acquisition of cinematographic images MRI is now capable of evaluating the cardiac function. As for the use of MRI to characterize the cardiac muscle, this is a highly original application which may soon become an interesting diagnostic tool.
