We report two cases of rare direct cervical vertebro-venous fistula (VVF) presenting with chronic radiculopathy as part of the symptom complex. We describe the MRI and intra-arterial angiography findings before and after successful embolisation. These demonstrate occlusion of the fistula with collapse and thrombosis of the draining extradural venous plexus and, in one case, resolution of MRI signal abnormality in the cervical spinal cord.
