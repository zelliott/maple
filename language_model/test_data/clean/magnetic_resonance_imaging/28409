Standard radiography of the cervical spine is still the first imaging procedure applied in degenerative disease of the cervical spine. Spondylosis deformans, osteochondrosis and uncovertebral arthrosis are well depicted by such images. Whether or not additional imaging is needed depends on the clinical symptoms. Special projections (anteroposterior oblique radiographs, lateral radiographs in flexion and extension) may be the next step. For many abnormalities, mainly of the intervertebral discs and the myelon, MR imaging has become the standard procedure, largely because of its multiplanar capabilities and its excellent contrast resolution. CT can be used instead of MR imaging if the latter method is not available, and its strength lies in the depiction of bone abnormalities. Scintigraphy is suitable for early detection of abnormalities with unclear clinical symptoms and may then indicate the correct level of the cervical spine for MR imaging or CT. Myelograms and myelo-CT can no longer be considered routine imaging methods. A number of imaging abnormalities are not strictly related to clinical findings and should therefore always be discussed in the clinical context.
