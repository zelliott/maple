Ultrasound examination of the sublingual region is a non-invasive, safe, inexpensive and widely available procedure, unaffected by the amalgam in teeth which is a source of considerable artefact on CT and MRI images. With a little practice and good understanding of the anatomy, ultrasound can be a very helpful primary examination. If the lesion is clearly seen, no further imaging may be required.
