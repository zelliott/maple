The purpose of our study was to determine the accuracy of MRI for preoperative staging of renal cell carcinoma using the 1997 TNM classification.

We conducted a retrospective review of MRI performed in 40 consecutive patients with 42 renal cell carcinomas before radical (n = 35) or partial (n = 4) nephrectomy or exploratory laparotomy (n = 3). The interval between imaging and surgery ranged from 1 to 59 days (mean, 17.9 days). Imaging was performed with T1- and T2-weighted, dynamic gadolinium-enhanced, and time-of-flight sequences. MRI and surgical-pathologic staging was performed using the 1997 TNM staging system. MRI staging was compared with surgical-pathologic staging as the gold standard. Agreement between the two staging methods was assessed using the kappa statistic.

Agreement between MRI and surgical-pathologic staging was good for T staging (kappa = 0.72 and 0.78 for reviewers 1 and 2 respectively), poor for N staging (kappa = 0.13, both reviewers), good for M staging (kappa = 0.66, both reviewers), and excellent for the assessment of venous involvement (kappa = 0.93, both reviewers). MRI overestimated the T stage in five patients and the N stage in five and underestimated the T stage in three, the N stage in four, the M stage in one, and the extent of venous thrombosis in two patients.

MRI is a reliable method for preoperative staging of renal cell carcinoma using the 1997 TNM classification, in particular for assessing venous involvement.
