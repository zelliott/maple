We report a series of children with clinical myocarditis presenting with chest pain and elevated cardiac troponin I mimicking coronary syndrome. Our series illustrates the complementary role the magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic angiography can play in the evaluation of these patients. Elevated cardiac troponin I levels were found to be related to the extent of myocardial involvement, but did not necessarily indicate poor prognosis in children with myocarditis.
