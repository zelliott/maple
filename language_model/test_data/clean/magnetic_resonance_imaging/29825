The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible contribution of (3)He-MRI to detect obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) in the follow-up of lung transplant recipients. Nine single- and double-lung transplanted patients were studied by an initial and a follow-up (3)He-MRI study. Images were evaluated subjectively by estimation of ventilation defect area and quantitatively by individually adapted threshold segmentation and subsequent calculation of ventilated lung volume. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) was diagnosed using pulmonary function tests. At (3)He-MRI, OB was suspected if ventilated lung volume had decreased by 10% or more at the follow-up MRI study compared with the initial study. General accordance between pulmonary function testing and (3)He-MRI was good, although subjective evaluation of (3)He-MRI underestimated improvement in ventilation as obtained by pulmonary function tests. The (3)He-MRI indicated OB in 6 cases. According to pulmonary function tests, BOS was diagnosed in 5 cases. All diagnoses of BOS were also detected by (3)He-MRI. In 2 of these 5 cases, (3)He-MRI indicated OB earlier than pulmonary function tests. The results support the hypothesis that (3)He-MRI may be sensitive for early detection of OB and emphasize the need for larger prospective follow-up studies.
