A 27-year-old patient with traumatic brain injury and neuropsychiatric symptoms fitting the obsessive-compulsive disorder was investigated. Brain CT-scan revealed left temporal and bilateral fronto-basal parenchymal contusions. Main Outcome Measure was the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale at pre- and post-treatment and at 6 months follow-up. The combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy resulted in lower intensity and frequency of symptoms. Our case illustrates the importance of a detailed diagnostic procedure in order to provide appropriate therapeutic interventions. Further studies are needed to guide the clinician in determining which patients are likely to benefit from a psychotherapeutic intervention in combination with pharmacotherapy.
