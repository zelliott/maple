An imaging method is presented to measure the water-diffusion coefficient. The sequence (MISSTEC) uses the simultaneous acquisition of a spin echo and several stimulated echoes with the same intensity except for diffusion weighting. The optimal number of stimulated echoes was calculated to minimize the diffusion coefficient error (D). D values obtained in vitro and in vivo were in good agreement with those from the spin-echo sequence (IntraVoxel Incoherent Motion [IVIM] method). The total acquisition time is half that of the classic IVIM method.
