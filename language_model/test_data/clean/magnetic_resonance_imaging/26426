Chylous ascites due to constrictive pericarditis is an extremely rare clinical entity, possibly caused by the augmented lymph production and high impedance to lymph drainage due to central venous hypertension. The authors describe a patient with chylous ascites caused by constrictive pericarditis in the absence of lymphatic obstruction. Cardiac catheterization is essential for the confirmation of accurate diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the heart is also very helpful in the diagnosis. The patient was symptom free and his ascites and edema completely resolved after pericardiectomy.
