The role of diagnostic imaging modalities in pancreatic inflammatory diseases is to assess gland damage and peripancreatic tissue involvement. The artifacts related to breathing and to peristaltic movements can be partially resolved with the optimization of acquisition parameters, which allows MRI to be suggested for the assessment of pancreatic inflammatory conditions. Sixty-nine patients with pancreatic inflammatory diseases (20 acute and 49 chronic pancreatitis cases) were examined. MRI was performed with a 0.5-T superconductive magnet and T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) sequences. In 4 of 20 acute pancreatitis patients image quality was poor. MRI in acute pancreatitis demonstrated glandular edema, intraparenchymal necrosis and the extent of peripancreatic fluid collections; in chronic pancreatitis MRI depicted glandular atrophy and Wirsung duct dilatation and detected the presence of pseudocysts. Even though its spatial resolution is lower than that of CT, MRI can provide useful pieces of information in inflammatory diseases of the pancreas, much more so after the introduction of Fast SE sequences and of fat-saturation techniques which are likely to make MR examinations of the pancreas more widely used.
