A case of a congenital fistulous communication between the left circumflex coronary artery and coronary sinus that presented as a pericardial effusion and was diagnosed using a comprehensive cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation is presented. This is an unusual presentation of an uncommon condition, and the MRI features have not been described previously. Noninvasive cardiac assessment via MRI allows for identification of the anatomic basis and functional consequences of an unusual anomaly such as a coronary artery fistula.
