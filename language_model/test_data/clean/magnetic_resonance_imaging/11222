A 40-year-old male presented with hemangiopericytoma in the lateral ventricle manifesting as headaches persisting for 6 months associated with vomiting and visual obscurations for one month. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a large tumor in the trigone of the right lateral ventricle. The highly vascular tumor was completely excised. The histological diagnosis was hemangiopericytoma. Hemangiopericytoma is rarely located in the lateral ventricle and is difficult to differentiate from meningioma by neuroimaging methods.
