We assessed the age-related changes in magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) value and the ratio of water content in rat brain (frontal lobe and pons) during normal development. All studies were done on 42 normal Wistar rats. MTR was calculated by using the equation (Moff-Mon)/Moff, where Moff and Mon were the measured signal intensities on the conventional and MT-prepared SPGR images, respectively. The ratios of water content were measured by comparing the wet weight with the dry weight of the frontal lobe and the pons, which were extracted from a rat brain soon after MTR measurements. The ratio of water content was calculated by using the equation 100 x (wet weight-dry weight)/wet weight (%). The ratio of water content decreased markedly during the first 30 days, but the decrease was very slight there after both in the frontal lobe and the pons. The change in MTR was similar to that of the ratio of water content, though the direction of change was opposite. Statistically significant inverse relationships existed between MTR and the ratio of water content both in the frontal lobe and the pons. MTR could be a new parameter with which to assess brain development.
