A 45-year-old healthy man presented with 2 weeks history of continuous rippling and quivering movements of his right side of face and neck suggestive of myokymia. MRI scan of the head revealed neurocysticercus in the pons. Treatment with steroids and carbamezapine produced a significant benefit. This is the first report of pontine neurocysticercosis presenting as an isolated facial myokymia.
