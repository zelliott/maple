MR imaging has represented a significant advance in the diagnosis and management of adult supratentorial neoplasms, and indeed MR has become the modality of choice for the initial diagnosis and follow-up in these cases. It is clear that the overall sensitivity has increased significantly, due to both the use of MR itself and to the implementation of IV contrast agents. It appears that some inroads have been made with regard to specificity, but significant overlap still exists in the imaging appearance of many of these entities. A thorough knowledge of neuroanatomy, pathophysiology, and neuropathology aid markedly in the imaging diagnosis of these processes.
