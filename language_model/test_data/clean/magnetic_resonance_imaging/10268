Investigation of canine dysphagia is performed by a combination of diagnostic imaging, direct visualisation of the upper gastrointestinal tract, and ancillary diagnostic testing to differentiate between structural and functional causes. Video fluoroscopy may be especially helpful. The case of a seven-year-old Border collie that presented with a history of progressive pharyngeal dysphagia is described. Fluoroscopic investigation was initially suggestive of functional pharyngeal disease, but magnetic resonance imaging and surgical exploration demonstrated the presence of a diffuse, scirrhous, poorly differentiated carcinoma with extensive oesophageal involvement. This case highlights that, in some circumstances, fluoroscopy may occasionally be of limited use in the investigation of dysphagia in the dog.
