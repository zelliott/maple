We report 2 rare cases of vascular lesions in the scrotum and penis: an arteriovenous malformation in a young man and a lymphohemangioma in a boy. Both patients had undergone previous treatment and had recurrent lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed preoperatively for detailed information regarding lesion extent and involvement of adjacent structures.
