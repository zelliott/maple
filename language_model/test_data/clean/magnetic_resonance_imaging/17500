The introduction, 15 years ago, of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in the treatment of salivary gland calculi, has changed the therapeutic approach in these patients. Aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of lithotripsy in sialolithiasis, after 10 years follow-up. A review has been made of the literature to establish current opinions in diagnosis and treatment of sialolithiasis. The role of ultrasonography, radiography and, in particular, of sialomagnetic resonance imaging in diagnosis of salivary lithiasis has been evaluated. The greater efficiency of the extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy treatment for parotid, compared to submandibular calculi, has been demonstrated (57% versus 33%). In 68% of our patients, lithotripsy was resolutive after 10 years. Ultrasonograpy should be considered first choice examination in diagnosis of salivary calculi. Sialo-magnetic resonance imaging is a recent, non-invasive diagnostic procedure with the advantage of no radiation exposure, and with better definition of anatomical and functional state of glandular parenchyma and duct, compared to other available techniques.
