Visual stimulus naming was studied in a 66-year-old male patient with optic aphasia subsequent to left occipito-temporal infarction. While having difficulty in naming objects perceived visually, he was able to name objects by viewing gestures illustrating their use, and to name actions shown in pictures. These results suggest that naming performance depends on the kind of stimulus that is visually presented (object vs. action). The present findings lend support to congnitive models which postulate the existence of visual and functional semantic systems.
