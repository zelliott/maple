A circular spirit level guidance system was tested for control of CT- and MR-guided punctures. The device consists of a needle holder fixed to a ground plate and two protractors. This allows adjustment of the fixed needle according to the angulation of the supposed puncture path as measured on tomographic images. A circular spirit level is fixed to the needle and leveled. Now the needle can be removed from the needle holder; by leveling the circular spirit level during the puncture, the formerly adjusted angulation is achieved. The system was tested in vitro and in vivo (22 patients) under CT and MR guidance. The average needle deviation was measured to be 1.96 degrees in vitro and 2.51 degrees in vivo. This simple device allows accurate puncture under CT and MR guidance.
