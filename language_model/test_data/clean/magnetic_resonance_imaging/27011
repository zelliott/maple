Cardiac hemangiomas are extremely rare benign vascular tumors of the heart. We present the unusual case of a 60-year-old man with a large cavernous hemangioma involving the left ventricular apex. The tumor was completely excised under cardiopulmonary bypass. The pertinent literature is reviewed and the technical steps, clinical presentation, and histopathologic findings are discussed.
