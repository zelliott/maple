The degree of preoperative cerebrovascular disease in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery has not been well studied. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and severity of cerebrovascular disease in such patients.

The subjects were 91 patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery. We investigated the prevalence and severity of cerebral infarction (CI), intracranial artery stenosis (ICAS) of > or =50%, cervical carotid artery stenosis (CCAS) of > or =50%, and periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).

The prevalence of cerebrovascular diseases was: CI, 79 patients (86.8%) [33 had some small infarctions, 38 had multiple small infarctions, eight had broad infarctions greater than 15 mm); ICAS, 17 patients (18.7%)]; CCAS, 30 patients (33.0%) [21 had stenosis of <70%, and nine had stenosis of > or =70% or occlusion]; and PVH, 79 patients (86.8%).

Patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery have a high prevalence of cerebrovascular disease in varying degrees.
