To investigate the brain of patients with anorexia and bulimia nervosa by localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and to look for metabolic alterations.

Twenty patients with anorexia and bulimia nervosa were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 1H-MRS in three regions of the brain. Age and sex-matched healthy subjects were investigated as controls.

1H-MRS revealed metabolic changes, such as a significant decrease of both myo-inositol and lipid compounds within the frontal white matter. The concentration of these compounds was further reduced with decreasing body mass index. Reduced lipid signals were also found in the occipital gray matter. In the cerebellum, the concentration of all metabolites including water, except lipids, was increased.

The metabolic changes found in this study seem to be a consequence of nutritional deficiency. It has to be further investigated whether these findings have any relevance for brain function. 1H-MRS might serve as a valuable investigative tool to observe eating disorders as anorexia and bulimia nervosa and to follow the success of therapy.
