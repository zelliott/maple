Technologic advances in ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging over the past decade have greatly improved the noninvasive evaluation of the liver and biliary tree. Each imaging modality offers unique and valuable information that aids in the evaluation of the liver and biliary tree. Improved spatial resolution, harmonic imaging, and color and power Doppler have transformed hepatobiliary ultrasound such that it is often the initial examination for many patients. Helical CT permits the characterization of the hepatic parenchyma during multiple phases of contrast enhancement. New rapid magnetic resonance sequences allow images of the liver to be obtained without motion artifact. The multiplanar techniques of magnetic resonance cholangiography allow noninvasive visualization of the biliary and pancreatic ducts. This article reviews the noninvasive imaging approach to patients with suspected hepatobiliary disease.
