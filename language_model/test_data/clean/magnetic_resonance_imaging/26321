A previously healthy 25-yr-old female developed flaccid areflexic tetraplegia, with intact cranial nerve function, 36 h after the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. Polymerase chain reaction studies of cerebrospinal fluid and blood were positive for Neisseria meningitidis, serogroup B. Magnetic resonance of the cervicothoracic spine revealed increased signal intensity and expansion in the lower medulla, upper cervical cord and cerebellar tonsils. Neurosurgical consultation recommended hyperventilation, dexamethasone and regular mannitol therapy rather than decompressive intervention. The clinical course over the following 12 days was complicated by the development of progressive central nervous and multisystem organ failure with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Autopsy revealed cerebral oedema with cystic infarction extending from the medulla to the upper cervical cord and cerebellar tonsils. Flaccid areflexic tetraplegia with spinal cord infarction has not been reported following bacterial infection in an adult. The clinical implications would suggest complete central nervous system evaluation of patients recovering from meningococcal meningitis, since spinal cord lesions, although uncommon, do occur. In those very rare situations where a patient develops significant peripheral neurological deficits, urgent magnetic resonance imaging is warranted, to rule out an infective focus or an underlying anatomical anomaly.
