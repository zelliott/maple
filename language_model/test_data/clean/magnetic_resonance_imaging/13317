Vertical retraction is a special form of retraction syndrome. In the past, the cause of this retraction has been thought to be a limiting fibrous band at the level of the inferior rectus muscle rather than co-contraction. Here the authors present a girl with unilateral retraction in upgaze and report the magnetic resonance imaging findings associated with retraction and narrowing of the palpebral fissure.
