Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour of the liver is a rare disease in children and is characterized by an inflammatory mass of uncertain aetiology which simulates a true neoplasm, often resulting in a diagnostic dilemma. We report a pathologically proven case of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour of the liver in a 14-month-old boy with jaundice. CT and MRI showed an ill-defined, homogeneously enhancing mass located in the hilar portion of the liver with biliary obstruction. He underwent percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage to relieve obstructive jaundice, followed by lobectomy and, finally, liver transplantation.
