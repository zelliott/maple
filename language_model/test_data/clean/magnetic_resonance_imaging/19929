The authors report one case of cauda equina paraganglioma and review the neurosurgical, radiological and pathological literatureon this rare tumour. Although it is difficult to distinguish preoperatively the paraganglioma from other tumours of the cauda equina, like neurinoma or ependymoma, this neuroendocrine tumour should be included in differential diagnosis.
