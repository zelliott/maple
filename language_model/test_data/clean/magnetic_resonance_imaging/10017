To characterize the clinical value of an fMRI task activating the amygdala in controls and patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE).

A fearful face fMRI paradigm using video sequences was developed and investigated in 17 patients with epilepsy (12 had MTLE [6 right- and 6 left-sided]) and 17 healthy control subjects. Reproducibility was demonstrated by reimaging 12 of the control subjects. In addition, parahippocampal activation was measured using Roland's Hometown Walking Task within the same session in all patients and in nine of the control subjects.

A fearful face paradigm led to significant amygdala activation (p < 0.001) in all subjects. Amygdala activation was bilateral in control subjects and clearly lateralized in patients with MTLE. Dissociated amygdala and parahippocampal activation was found in three MTLE patients. A combination of results from both fMRI paradigms improved the lateralization of the side of seizure onset in patients with MTLE.

fMRI activation of the amygdala evoked by an animated fearful face paradigm is strong, reproducible, and specific in individual subjects. The combination of the fearful face paradigm and Roland's Hometown Walking Task provides a more reliable presurgical mapping of mesial temporal lobe structures.
