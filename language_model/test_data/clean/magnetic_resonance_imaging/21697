To determine the value of functional (flexion) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) suspected of having cervical (C)-spine involvement.

Four patients with RA suspected of having C spine involvement, with neurological symptoms and/or signs, and who had normal MRI in neutral position, underwent functional MRI.

In all 4 patients functional MRI provided additional information. Cord compression (3 patients) and angulation of the cord (1 patient) were evident only in this view.

Functional MRI provided additional information in these patients and may be indicated in patients with RA suspected of having C spine involvement who have a normal MRI study in a neutral position.
