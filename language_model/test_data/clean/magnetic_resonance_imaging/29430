To determine the frequency and clinical predictors of sacroiliitis diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a psoriatic arthritis (PsA) population.

The studied comprised 103 patients with PsA. A careful clinical assessment for sacroiliitis was made from history and examination, and HLA-B27 testing was performed. Sixty-eight patients underwent tilted coronal fat-saturated T1-weighted and STIR MRI of the sacroiliac joints.

Clinical features of moderate or severe sacroiliitis were found in 24/68 (35%) patients. MRI features of sacroiliitis were found in 26/68 (38%) patients. Clinical features of sacroiliitis were present in 14/42 (33%) with normal MRI scans and 10/26 (38%) with abnormal scans (normal vs abnormal scans, P = 0.7). The presence of sacroiliitis on MRI was associated with restricted spinal movements (P = 0.004) and the duration of PsA (P = 0.04). There was no correlation between HLA-B27 and sacroiliitis diagnosed by MRI.

Sacroiliitis diagnosed by MRI occurs commonly in PsA but is difficult to detect clinically.
