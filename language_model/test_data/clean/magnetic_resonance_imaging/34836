Myelopathy is an infrequently reported complication of bacterial meningitis. We report the case of a preterm neonate with group B streptococcal meningitis who developed acute transverse myelopathy with subsequent spinal cord cavitation noted by MRI. The destruction of the cerebellum and obstructive hydrocephalus resulted in a posterior fossa cyst.
