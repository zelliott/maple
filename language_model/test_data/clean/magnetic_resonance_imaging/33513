We present the cranioencephalitic alterations of twelve patients with neurofibromatosis (eleven type 1 and one type 2) we studied using both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR). In addition, we made a comparison of the two techniques. MR allows greater differentiation of gliomas, neurinomas, and neurofibromas and better characterizes tumoral vascularization. Lesions undetected by CT can be identified, and it is a non-invasive method. For these reasons, we consider MR the technique of choice in the study of neurofibromatosis, even though CT continues to be superior in examining osteal dysplasias and calcifications and should thus be used as a complementary technique for an exact assessment of the lesions.
