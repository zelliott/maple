The current role of intra-operative ultrasound (IOUS) is questioned because of recent progress in medical imaging. The aim of the present study was to determine the accuracy of IOUS in the detection of a hepatic tumour (HT) compared with a pre-operative multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

This retrospective study included 418 patients evaluated using an 8-slice MDCT scan (SCAN8), 64-slice MDCT scan (SCAN64) and MRI alone or combined with a computed tomography (CT) scan. The pathological result was used as a gold standard.

Correlation rates for the number of detected lesions compared with pathology results were 0.627 for SCAN8, 0.785 for SCAN64, 0.657 for MRI and 0.913 for IOUS. Compared with pathology, the rate of concordance was significantly higher with IOUS (0.871) than with SCAN8 (0.736; P=0.011), SCAN64 (0.792; P<0.001) and MRI (0.742; P<0.001). IOUS was responsible for a change in operative strategy in 16.5% of patients. Surgery was extended in 12.4%, limited in 1.7% and abandoned in 2.4%.

Compared with cross-sectional pre-operative imaging, IOUS is still superior for the detection of HT and the planning of surgery. IOUS remains recommended as a routine procedure in patients having a hepatic resection in the era of modern pre-operative imaging.
