We report a case of large vestibular aqueduct syndrome with a markedly dilated endolymphatic sac bilaterally. The density and signal intensity of the extraosseous portion of the sac were higher than those of cerebrospinal fluid on CT and MR studies. The findings may represent protein-rich and hyperosmolar fluid within the endolymphatic sac.
