Multiple and large cysts, located in the cervical stroma, can cause significant enlargement of the cervix.

A woman with two large intracervical cysts, one complex, underwent evaluation with ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hysterectomy revealed Nabothian cysts.

In rare cases in which the intracervical cysts assume very large dimensions, ultrasound and MRI can aid diagnosis, but may not always prevent the need for excision or hysterectomy.
