Predicting functional outcome following surgery performed for spinal cord compression is still a considerable problem. Recent observations, though, strongly suggest that with serial measurements of serum S100b, this might be possible in patients with subacute spinal cord compression. The aim of this study was to examine whether this potential significance of S100b applies as well to patients with spondylotic cervical myelopathy. A further purpose was to assess the value of NSE in this regard, another biochemical marker widely used to monitor cerebral lesions.

Fifty-one patients were included in this prospective study. Outcome was considered as favourable in case of neurological improvement with preservation or retrieval of walking ability, whereas non-improvement without restoration of gait function was regarded as unfavourable. The preoperative levels of S100b and NSE were correlated with the degree of paresis, duration of symptoms, and presence of intramedullary high signal intensities on MRI. The postoperative values of both markers were correlated with outcome.

The preoperative levels of S100b were neither correlated with degree or duration of paresis nor with outcome. In case of an uncomplicated course the postoperative levels of S100b were also not correlated with outcome. In complicated courses with acute postoperative deterioration normal values on the 3rd day after the event were associated with a favourable outcome, whereas one patient with unfavourable outcome showed a persistent pathological increase. The serum levels of NSE were not correlated with clinical parameters or with outcome in any of the cases.

Serial S100b serum measurements do not permit prediction of functional outcome in patients with spondylotic cervical myelopathy in case of an uncomplicated postoperative course. In complicated courses with postoperative deterioration, such measurements reflect postoperative events with possibly prognostic relevance. NSE does not have any significance in these patients with chronic lesions of the spinal cord.
