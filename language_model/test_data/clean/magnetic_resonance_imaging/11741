The demand for advanced diagnostic imaging procedures such as nuclear scintigraphy, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging has increased dramatically over the past 10 years. Veterinarians, seeking to improve their diagnostic capabilities and clients willing to pursue "best medicine" have driven this demand, resulting in installation of advanced imaging facilities at most academic and private referral practices. Knowledge of potential benefits of various modalities will allow the veterinarian to optimize his or her use of diagnostic imaging in his or her own practice or in a referral practice.
