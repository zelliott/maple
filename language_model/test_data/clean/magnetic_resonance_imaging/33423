Plantar fibromatosis is a slow growing nodular thickening that occurs most often within the central band of the plantar aponeurosis. Since the lesion is not encapsulated, clinical margins are often difficult to define. Inadequate excision is the primary cause of recurrence. MRI is a nonionizing radiation technique that demonstrates excellent definition between pathological entities and normal anatomy. This may aid in the preoperative planning.
