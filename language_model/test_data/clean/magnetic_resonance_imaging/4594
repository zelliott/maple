We present a case of possible myocardial sarcoidosis suspected by the presence of multiorgan sarcoidosis along with cardiac dysrhythmia. The diagnosis of a highly probable sarcoid infiltrate was made by magnetic resonance imaging, depicting a high intensity mass in the ventricular septum. Following corticosteroid treatment the mass disappeared, and remains absent after 3 years followup. Also, only minor dysrhythmia has been observed during this period. The aeromedical implications are discussed.
