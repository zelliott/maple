Injuries and degenerative alterations of the shoulder predominantly affect the soft tissue. To investigate this area we use a multitude of diagnostic examinations: apart from clinical and functional diagnosis also the image reproductive methods of arthrography, ultrasound and computer tomography in addition to the classical X-ray. To ascertain pathological changes to shoulder soft tissue the simplest and quickest, least dangerous and most straightforward examination is the sonograph as it includes dynamic movement procedures. Warning: a high degree of experience and anatomical knowledge is a must! Computer- and especially nuclear spin tomography--being static examining forms a comprehensive picture of every anatomic structure and its pathology--may well represent a valuable addition to shoulder diagnostics. Nevertheless, as yet the clinical and material requirements are still enormous.
