To improve the drug concentration in liver metastases, docetaxel was encapsulated in polyethyleneglycol-liposomes and administered regionally with degradable starch microspheres (DSM).

A rodent model of solitary metastasis (CC-531 adenocarcinoma) was studied. The animals were randomized into six groups and treated with 15 ng/kg docetaxel: I: intravenous (i.v.). II: PEG-liposomes i.v.; III: intraartial (i.a.) via the hepatica artery; IV: i.a.) + DSM; V: PEG-liposomes i.a.; and VI: PEG-liposomes i.a. + DSM. The docetaxel concentration in the serum, liver and liver tumor at defined times (5, 15, 30, 60,120 240 min and 24 h) was measured using HPLC.

The area under the concentration (AUC) versus time curves showed an 11-fold higher concentration in the tumor tissue when comparing the docetaxel-PEG-liposomes i.a. + DSM group to the i.v. group (p<0.01).

Compared to intravenous therapy, i.a. therapy with docetaxel-PEG-liposomes + DSM results in higher tumor tissue concentrations.
