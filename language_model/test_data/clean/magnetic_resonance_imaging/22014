The mediastinal and cardiovascular anatomy is complex. We have developed a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction system for the major mediastinal structures using magnetic resonance imaging data on a NeXT workstation. The program uses a combination of automatic and manual procedures to determine the contours of the cardiac structures. The geometric centers of the contours are connected by a 3D space curve, and the central axis of each cardiac structures is determined. The contours are projected on the perpendicular plane to the central axis and semiautomatically processed until the contours of one pixel are obtained. Then the surface rendering with transparency is performed. Compositing combines two images so that both appear in the composite, superimposed on each other. Demonstration of the various mediastinal lines and cardiovascular diseases by the composits of the partly transparent 3D images has promoted a better understanding of the complex mediastinal and cardiovascular anatomy and diseases.
