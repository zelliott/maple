An 81-year-old woman with chronic dementia developed lethargy, confusion, binocular blindness, and episodic left-beating nystagmus. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed high signal in the right occipital region suggesting recent ischemia. A concurrent electroencephalogram (EEG) showed a right occipital seizure focus that spread to the opposite occipital lobe. A single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) performed during the seizure epoch showed bilateral occipital lobe hyperperfusion. This is the second report to document SPECT bi-occipital hyperperfusion in seizure-related cortical blindness.
