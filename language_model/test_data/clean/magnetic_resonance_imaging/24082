Tympanometry provides a rapid, non-invasive and objective assessment of middle ear (ME) status and is widely used for the clinical diagnosis and follow-up of otitis media with effusion (OME). ME pressure, acoustic admittance and tympanometric gradient are the main test parameters used in making assignments to diagnostic classes (i.e. presence or absence of effusion, effusion quantity). Of these, the tympanometric gradient was suggested to be more sensitive to the presence of effusion, but this has not been demonstrated conclusively and no standard definition of that gradient is accepted. In this study, 10 cynomolgus monkeys with experimental OME were used to compare the diagnosis of OME made using three different methods to estimate tympanometric gradient with that provided by simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the ME. All three methods of tympanometric gradient measurement were highly correlated with the quantity of ME effusion measured by the MRI. Although not significant, the MRI results were better correlated with those for the 'width' method when compared to either the 'difference' or the 'ratio' method of gradient estimation. This study demonstrates the use of MRI as a gold standard for evaluating the accuracy of other methods to diagnose ME effusion.
