Olfactory schwannomas are very rare. For this reason they have never been diagnosed preoperatively. We report a case and describe the CT and MR imaging findings. Clinically, the young age of presentation, and radiologically the presence of bone scalloping, and the absence of both bone sclerosis and a dural tail, may help in the differential diagnosis of meningioma.
