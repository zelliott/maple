The wrist is an articular complex composed of the radio-carpal, distal radio-ulnar and all of the carpal joints. Despite progress in imaging techniques, conventional radiology with plain x-rays and arthrography are still very widely used. Plain x-rays, numerous because of the anatomical complexity of the wrist, must be selected in relation to the clinical context and suspected diagnosis and must be performed according to a perfect technique. Contrast arthrography may be uni-, bi-, or tri-compartmental depending on the information required. It allows assessment of the integrity of the intra-articular synovial and ligamentous structures. The specific indications for computed tomography are uncommon, but those of MRI are becoming increasingly frequent due to refinement of the machines, especially the development of surface coils.
