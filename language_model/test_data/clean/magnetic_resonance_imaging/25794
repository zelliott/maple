A 37-year old man, who had repeatedly suffered from transient ophthalmoplegia in his left eye at the age of 29 and 36, developed left painful ophthalmoplegia accompanied by ipsilateral facial nerve palsy in August, 1991. Neurological examination revealed involvement of the left oculomotor, trochlear, ophthalmic division of the trigeminal, abducens, facial and vestibular nerves. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI which was taken at the acute phase of the illness demonstrated markedly enhanced left cavernous sinus and adjacent thickened dura mater in the middle cranial fossa. At the remission phase after starting corticosteroid therapy, these enhanced lesions were no longer observed even in enhanced MRI studies. We diagnosed him as suffering from Tolosa-Hunt syndrome presently accompanied by facial and vestibular nerve damage because of his history of illness, confined lesion in the left cavernous sinus and steroid-induced remission. We concluded that Tolosa-Hunt syndrome may be accompanied by damage of other cranial nerves in its course and that repeated gadolinium-enhanced MRIs are necessary for diagnosis and observation of the patients.
