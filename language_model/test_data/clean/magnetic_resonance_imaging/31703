Inhibiting inappropriate behavior and thoughts is an essential ability for humans, but the regions responsible for inhibitory processing are a matter of continuous debate. This is the first study of somatosensory go/nogo tasks using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Fifteen subjects preformed two different types of go/nogo task, i.e. (1) Movement and (2) Count, to compare with previous studies using visual go/nogo tasks, and confirm whether the inhibitory processing is dependent on sensory modalities. Go and nogo stimuli were presented with an even probability. Our data indicated that the response inhibition network involved the dorsolateral (DLPFC) and ventrolateral (VLPFC) prefrontal cortices, pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), inferior parietal lobule (IPL), insula, and temporoparietal junction (TPJ), which were consistent with previous results obtained using visual go/nogo tasks. These activities existed in both Movement and Count Nogo trials. Therefore, our results suggest that the network for inhibitory processing is not dependent on sensory modalities but reflects common neural activities. In addition, there were differences of activation intensity between Movement and Count Nogo trials in the prefrontal cortex, temporal lobe, and ACC. Thus, inhibitory processing would involve two neural networks, common and uncommon regions, depending on the required response mode.
