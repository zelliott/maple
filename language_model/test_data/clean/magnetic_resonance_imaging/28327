CPMG imaging is applied to the visualisation of porosity and wetting heterogeneities in water saturated sandstone samples at 0.1 T. Porosity profiles from NMR imaging are in agreement within 1% with the standard core analysis. T2 calculated profiles show a factor greater than two between water-wet and oil-wet samples; thus, wettability contrast can be easily visualised.
