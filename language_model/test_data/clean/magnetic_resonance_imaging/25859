The imaging investigations in six patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) are reviewed. Five patients presented with a pelvic or lower limb mass and one with haemoptysis from pulmonary metastases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT, Doppler US and angiography studies demonstrated the highly vascular nature of this rare tumour and the frequent occurrence of pulmonary and intracranial metastases. Previously unreported Doppler US and MR evidence of multiple enlarged vessels and high blood flow within primary and secondary ASPS tumours is emphasized. Imaging is of considerable importance both for pre-operative localization and long term surveillance of this slow growing but invariably disseminating tumour.
