Mikulicz's disease (MD) has been considered as one manifestation of SjÃ¶gren's syndrome (SS). Recently, it has also been considered as an IgG(4)-related disorder.

To determine the differences between IgG(4)-related disorders including MD and SS.

A study was undertaken to investigate patients with MD and IgG(4)-related disorders registered in Japan and to set up provisional criteria for the new clinical entity IgG(4)-positive multiorgan lymphoproliferative syndrome (IgG(4)+MOLPS). The preliminary diagnostic criteria include raised serum levels of IgG(4) (>135 mg/dl) and infiltration of IgG(4)(+) plasma cells in the tissue (IgG(4)+/IgG+ plasma cells >50%) with fibrosis or sclerosis. The clinical features, laboratory data and pathologies of 64 patients with IgG(4)+MOLPS and 31 patients with typical SS were compared.

The incidence of xerostomia, xerophthalmia and arthralgia, rheumatoid factor and antinuclear, antiSS-A/Ro and antiSS-B/La antibodies was significantly lower in patients with IgG(4)+MOLPS than in those with typical SS. Allergic rhinitis and autoimmune pancreatitis were significantly more frequent and total IgG, IgG(2), IgG(4) and IgE levels were significantly increased in IgG(4)+MOLPS. Histological specimens from patients with IgG(4)+MOLPS revealed marked IgG(4)+ plasma cell infiltration. Many patients with IgG(4)+MOLPS had lymphocytic follicle formation, but lymphoepithelial lesions were rare. Few IgG(4)+ cells were seen in the tissue of patients with typical SS. Thirty-eight patients with IgG(4)+MOLPS treated with glucocorticoids showed marked clinical improvement.

Despite similarities in the involved organs, there are considerable clinical and pathological differences between IgG(4)+MOLPS and SS. Based on the clinical features and good response to glucocorticoids, we propose a new clinical entity: IgG(4)+MOLPS.
