A new contrast preparation based on modified driven equilibrium Fourier transfer is introduced and evaluated for generation of T1-weighted images for assessment of the myocardial perfusion with contrast agent first-pass kinetics. The new preparation scheme produces T1 contrast with insensitivity to arrhythmias in prospectively triggered sequential imaging thereby eliminating one of the major sources of problems in potential patient studies with previously employed contrast preparations schemes.
