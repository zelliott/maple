We describe a patient with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) who presented with symptoms of subacute onset of dysautonomia. Autonomic testing indicated a peripheral autonomic neuropathy while magnetic resonance imaging revealed brainstem involvement. We propose that this patient's autonomic dysfunction could be the result of a paraneoplastic syndrome and PCNSL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of dysautonomia.
