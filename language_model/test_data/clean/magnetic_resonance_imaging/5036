Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a disease characterized by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Brain abscess is a complication of HHT with AVMs. Literature provides evidence that Enterococcus faecalis can cause endodontic infections. We present the case of an HHT patient who developed brain abscess due to E. faecalis after a dental procedure.
