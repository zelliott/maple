We report a patient in whom computed tomography (CT) scanning demonstrated bilateral para-aortic lesions, originally misinterpreted as lymphadenopathy, but shown by a combination of CT, lymphangiography and magnetic resonance imaging to represent dilated lumbar lymphatic trunks. This case illustrates a further para-aortic lesion which may be mistaken for lymphadenopathy on cross-sectional imaging.
