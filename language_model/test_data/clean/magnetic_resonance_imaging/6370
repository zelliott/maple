A series of 81 patients operated for intramedullary spinal cord tumours over a span of 12 years (1975-1986) is presented. The mean age of the patients was about 37 years and 9 patients were in the paediatric age (0-15 years). In 29 cases (36%) the tumours were located within the cervical region; in 34 cases the tumours were located in the thoracic region (42%) and in 18 cases the tumours were located within the medullary cone (22%). Ependymoma accounted for 52% of the cases (42 cases), astrocytoma for 20% (16 cases), lipoma for 7% (6 cases), hemangioblastoma for 6% (5 cases), metastatic tumours for 5% (4 cases); in the remaining 8 cases (10%) rare or very rare spinal tumours were found. The 9 patients in the paediatric age and 8 additional cases who had undergone previous surgery were then excluded from this review. In 59% of the patients with ependymoma and in 90% of the patients with astrocytoma severe neurological deficit were already present before the operation. Total tumour removal was accomplished in 81% of the cases with ependymoma, total or subtotal removal was achieved in 50% of the cases with astrocytoma. At long term follow-up study fair or good functional results were observed in 19 out of 41 cases of ependymoma (46%) and in 3 cases out of 10 of astrocytoma (30%). The surgical outcome was mostly related to the preoperative neurological conditions and to tumour malignancy grade.
