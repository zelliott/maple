Diabetes and insulin resistance have a variety of detrimental effects on cardiovascular health and outcomes. Cardiac magnetic resonance offers a non-invasive means to obtain many layers of information at a tissue level, including fibrosis, edema, intramyocardial motion, triglyceride content, and myocardial energetics. The role of cardiovascular magnetic resonance is particularly important in the evaluation of recognized and unrecognized coronary artery disease. In this review, we address the current state-of-the-art in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging - for both clinical and investigational use - as it applies to diabetic cardiovascular disease.
