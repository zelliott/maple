Twelve patients with central neurofibromatosis underwent MR examination of the head. Among these, chiasma glioma was the most common CNS tumour (6/12). Seven patients had multifocal areas of increased T2-signal without mass effect predominantly involving the region of the basal ganglia. No corresponding CT abnormalities were present. These lesions may represent multifocal dysplasia and seem to be characteristic of central neurofibromatosis.
