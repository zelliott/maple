While color Doppler ultrasonography and microvascular Doppler recordings have been used intraoperatively for spinal cord vascular malformations, they have not been employed for similar spinal cord lesions preoperatively.

We report the usefulness of color Doppler ultrasonography through a lumbar laminectomy defect in the management of a spinal arteriovenous fistula.

Color Doppler ultrasonography should be considered for spinal lesions in which a laminectomy defect is present.
