We report the successful stent placement and secondary coil placement in a wide-necked persistent trigeminal artery (TA) aneurysm, in which the internal carotid artery (ICA) was preserved and the TA "jailed." Nine-month follow-up angiography revealed a completely obliterated aneurysm and patent parent ICA and TA. MR images obtained at 16-mo follow-up showed no infarction of the brain in the distribution of the jailed TA. The risks of stent jailing and possible solutions are discussed.
