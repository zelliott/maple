To examine whether gray and white matter volumes are preferentially reduced and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) increased with starvation in patients with anorexia nervosa compared with healthy controls and to determine what changes occur with weight normalization.

Whole intracranial volumes of patients and controls were segmented into gray matter, white matter, and CSF volumes and results compared. A subgroup of patients were rescanned after weight normalization.

Total white matter and several regional white matter volumes were significantly reduced and total and regional CSF volumes were significantly increased in patients versus controls whereas gray matter was not significantly reduced. Total and regional CSF volumes were significantly decreased in patients upon weight normalization whereas white and gray matter volumes increased.

These changes in brain tissue may be related to a variety of pathophysiologic mechanisms. We hypothesize that insulin-like growth factor-1 may be involved.
