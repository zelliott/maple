To emphasize the importance of recognizing the Virchow Robin spaces as normal anatomic structures on magnetic resonance (MR).

Presentation of four patients seen in the Pediatric Neurology Department in La Paz Hospital. They consulted for different reasons, having been studied by MR to help identify their pathology.

The MR showed cystic structures which correspond to dilated Virchow Robin spaces in several zones of the cerebral white matter.

Although dilated Virchow Robin spaces have been associated with various pathologies, they constitute normal anatomic structures, which consists of perivascular spaces surrounding the cerebral perforating arteries, which should always be kept in mind when visualizing cystic structures in the cerebral white matter and basal ganglia, circular or elongated, following the path of the perforating blood vessels, and which have the same intensity of cerebrospinal fluid on T1 sequences as on T2 on MR, especially if they are bilateral and multiple.
