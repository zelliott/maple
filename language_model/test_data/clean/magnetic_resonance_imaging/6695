This paper presents a case of intercostal hemangioma, in which a complete surgical resection was accomplished based upon a tentative diagnosis provided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A 27-year-old man visited our hospital for the evaluation of chest pain and shortness of breath after exertion. Computed tomography showed a soft tissue mass, 5.5 x 3.5 cm in size, arising from the right lateral 7th intercostal space. Dynamic MRI showed that the mass was enhanced rapidly in the early phase and that this early enhancement was maintained during the delayed phase, which was compatible with a diagnosis of intercostal hemangioma. The patient underwent surgery, and a complete resection of the tumor with the right 7th and 8th ribs and their intercostal muscles was accomplished. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of intramuscular hemangioma of the large-vessel type. Presently, 6 months after the operation, the patient is doing well, without any evidence of local recurrence.
