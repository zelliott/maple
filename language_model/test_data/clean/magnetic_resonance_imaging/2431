It is generally considered that mass effect caused by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is evidence of ruptures. In the present study, the incidence of mass effect in clinically unruptured AVMs was evaluated, and the underlying causative factors and pathophysiological mechanisms were studied.

Twenty-seven patients with clinically unruptured supratentorial pial AVMs were examined. The majority were suffering from epilepsy, and frontal lobe involvement was revealed in approximately half of the patients. Angiographic studies, computed tomographic scans, and magnetic resonance images were obtained for all patients. Twenty-one patients underwent removal of AVMs. In 10 of the surgically treated patients, intraoperative vascular pressure measurements were obtained before removal of the AVMs.

Mass effect was detected in 12 (44%) of the 27 patients. Cortical sulci obliteration (eight patients) and lateral ventricle displacement (seven patients) were frequently noted. The volume of AVMs was significantly larger in patients with mass effect than in those without mass effect (P < 0.001). Large dilated venous sacs or ectatic veins were observed to be associated with mass effect (P < 0.001). In only one patient was gross displacement related to a surrounding massive brain edema. Draining vein pressure in patients with mass effect was significantly elevated as compared to the average value in patients without mass effect (22 +/- 5 versus 12 +/- 3 mm Hg) (P < 0.01).

The present study suggests that mass effect is not infrequent in clinically unruptured AVMs. Furthermore, multiple causative factors were detected, including the large size of AVMs, marked draining vein dilatation, and brain edema around the AVMs. Findings also indicated that a pathophysiologically high pressure in the venous drainage system may contribute to mass effect.
