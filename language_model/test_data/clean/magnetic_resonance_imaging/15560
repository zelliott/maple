Diffusion tensor imaging is a magnetic resonance imaging technique that provides details on tissue microstructure and organization well beyond the usual image resolution. With diffusion tensor imaging, diffusion anisotropy can be quantified and subtle white matter changes not normally seen on conventional MRI can be detected. The aim of this article is to review the principles of diffusion tensor imaging and fiber tracking and their applications to the study of the brain, including Alzheimer disease, neuropsychiatric disorders, strokes, multiple sclerosis, brain tumors, and intractable seizures. Emerging applications to spinal cord disorders are also presented.
