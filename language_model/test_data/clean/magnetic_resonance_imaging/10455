Two bullmastiffs with calvarial hyperostosis syndrome are described and are the first documented examples in females. The clinical and radiologic features were similar to those previously reported in males. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings have not previously been reported. One dog underwent MR imaging and abnormalities included thickening of the frontal bones with loss of normal fat signal and changes in the overlying soft tissues. In one of the dogs, long bone changes were seen in the femora and resembled those seen with craniomandibular osteopathy.
