Scapular winging is a rare disorder often caused by neuromuscular imbalance in the scapulothoracic stabilizer muscles. Lesions of the long thoracic nerve and spinal accessory nerves are the most common cause. Numerous underlying etiologies have been described. Patients report diffuse neck, shoulder girdle, and upper back pain, which may be debilitating, associated with abduction and overhead activities. Accurate diagnosis and detection depend on appreciation of the scapulothoracic anatomy and a comprehensive physical examination. Although most cases resolve nonsurgically, surgical treatment of scapular winging has been met with success.
