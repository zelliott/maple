80-90% of individuals suffering from aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) are children or adolescents. Primary ABC is a non-neoplastic lesion. Diagnostic assessment and detection of recurrence demands repeated plain x-rays or CT scans. These repeated radiographic examinations expose these young patients to large doses of ionizing radiation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is found to be an effective and reliable noninvasive technique for the diagnosis and follow-up controls of ABC.
