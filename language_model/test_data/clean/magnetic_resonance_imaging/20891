Dengue infection is endemic in developing countries posing a major public health problem. Clinical manifestations form a broad spectrum and include uncomplicated dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. We report three confirmed cases of dengue infection in pediatric population with central nervous system involvement with certain unreported manifestations resulting in diagnostic dilemma. Increasing evidence of neurotropism by dengue virus emphasizes that clinician be aware of such association and consider dengue infection in cases of febrile encephalitis and myelitis in endemic areas. Early diagnosis and appropriate supportive cars can reverse this potentially fatal disease.
