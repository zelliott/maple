Functional neuroimaging of neuropsychiatric disorders is a complex discipline requiring skills in medical science, philosophy, and technical physics. This review first examines the broad categories of functional imaging studies that have been utilized in this area, comparing the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. This review then looks at much of the available literature on functional imaging in Tourette syndrome (TS) and provides a synthesis of data. The review will also examine the different methodologies employed and will suggest which methodologies are most likely to lead to elucidation of the pathophysiology of TS and related conditions.
