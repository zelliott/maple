Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis is considered to be an inflammatory disease of the adenohypophysis that is commonly present with visual disturbance and hypopituitarism. Its etiology remains unclear but it is often related to an autoimmune disorder involving other organs, such as the thyroid, parathyroid, or adrenal glands. We encountered a rare case of lymphocytic adenohypophysitis associated with sarcoidosis of the lung and eye during the follow-up period. A 23-year-old woman was hospitalized in July 1986, with a one-month history of headache and visual disturbances which began three days after her second normal delivery. On admission, she showed slight visual impairment and had a left temporal superior quadrantanopia. Endocrinological evaluation revealed thyroid and adrenal hypofunction, and low response of human growth hormone to the loading test. A skull X-ray showed normal shaped sella with some erosion of the dorsum. CT scan showed a rounded contrast-enhanced intrasellar mass extending into the suprasellar cistern. MRI (SR: 500/30) showed a homogeneous low intensity mass which contained a small high intensity area on the relative T2-weighted image (2000/50). A biopsy was performed via right frontotemporal craniotomy. The consistency of the resected tissue was firmer than that of pituitary adenoma. Histologically, the tissue showed diffuse lymphocytic infiltration with some normal adenohypophysis. Her postoperative course was uneventful and the visual impairment improved two months later after the operation. Six months after the operation, she was readmitted with complaints of general fatigue and breathlessness. Chest X-ray showed diffuse infiltration throughout both lung fields, but there was no bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
