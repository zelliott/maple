A 51-year-old male patient presented with right-sided swelling of the neck and a 2-year history of decreasing olfaction that had culminated in complete anosmia. CT and MRI showed a calcified ethmoid tumor and destruction of the lamina cribrosa extending into the anterior fossa and frontal lobes. Contrast material demonstrated marked enhancement on the CT and MRI. Bilateral angiography of the external and internal carotid arteries failed to show tumor vascularity typical for an esthesioneuroblastoma but rendered an olfactory meningioma unlikely. Histological findings of cervical lymph nodes removed during neck dissection showed infiltration by an esthesioneuroblastoma (Kadish C classification). Tumor calcifications in these neoplasms are generally well seen on CT and--while not specific--may suggest the diagnosis. CT and MRI are the most sensitive methods of demonstrating local tumor growth, metastasis and bone destruction.
