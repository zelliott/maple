We report a patient who presented with the clinical features of obturator mononeuropathy. Abdomino-pelvic computed tomography revealed a fusiform mass in the right perivesical space; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed characteristic "coaxial-cable-like" appearance in cross-section and "spaghetti-like" appearance in longitudinal section, pathognomonic of lipomatosis of the nerve. Nerve lipomatosis as the cause of obturator neuropathy has not been previously reported. MRI provides definite and graphic proof of the diagnosis.
