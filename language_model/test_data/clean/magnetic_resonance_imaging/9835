Leptomeningeal meningitis occurs in 4-15% of patients with solid tumors. It is a severe disease which seriously affects patients' neurological status and quality of life. Intrathecal chemotherapy increases survival and improves quality of life. Administration of drugs by lumbar puncture causes pain and discomfort, reducing therapeutic compliance. Implantation of an intraventricular catheter fixed to a subcutaneous reservoir overcomes these drawbacks. To evaluate complications compared with implantation of an intraventricular chemotherapy device, between June 2006 and December 2009, 50 patients with a solid tumor underwent implantation of a catheter to treat leptomeningeal metastases. Clinical evaluation of all patients was performed every two weeks and magnetic resonance imaging at one month then every three months. Surgical data (operative time, blood loss) and all clinical and radiological complications were prospectively monitored. All patients underwent surgery with local anesthesia. The mean operative time was 15 min, with no complication during surgery. We report five complications (10%) during the follow-up; three required the removal of the device and another was lethal. There was no case of misplacement or obstruction of the catheter. Intraventricular chemotherapy is an effective treatment procedure which improves therapeutic compliance with acceptable morbidity.
