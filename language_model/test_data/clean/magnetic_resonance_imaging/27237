To investigate the utility of interstitial MR lymphography with gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) or gadoxetate disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA) in mice.

We performed MR lymphography after the subcutaneous injection of Gd-DTPA or Gd-EOB-DTPA (0.1, 0.5, or 2.0 Î¼mol per mouse) into the right footpad in six healthy mice, and the time courses of contrast enhancement were assessed. Additionally, the lymphatic pathways from two distinct sites were assessed in tandem by interstitial MR lymphography studies.

Subcutaneous injection of Gd-DTPA or Gd-EOB-DTPA caused lymph node enhancement immediately after injection, followed by a rapid decline. Dose dependency was shown for the lymph node enhancement, and a high-dose injection caused prominent visualization of the veins. Lymph node enhancement did not differ significantly between Gd-DTPA and Gd-EOB-DTPA or between Gd-EOB-DTPA premixed and not premixed with bovine serum albumin. The tandem assessment of two lymphatic pathways was feasible, and image fusion aided detailed comparison.

Interstitial MR lymphography with Gd-DTPA or Gd-EOB-DTPA allowed clear visualization of the lymphatic pathway in healthy mice, and no significant difference was found between the two agents. Their rapid kinetics limits the imaging timing window, however, facilitates repeated assessment in a single imaging session.
