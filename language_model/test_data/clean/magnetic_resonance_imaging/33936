Topotecan activity was evaluated for the treatment of malignant glioma.

Sixty-three patients with newly diagnosed (n = 25) or recurrent (n = 38) malignant glioma were treated with topotecan [AU: Please verify all dosages here and throughout text.]at a dose of 2.6 mg/m2 over a 72-hour period weekly. Recurrent tumors included glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (n = 28) and anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) (n = 10). Newly diagnosed tumors included GBM (n = 14), AA (n = 8), and anaplastic oligodendroglioma (n = 3).

Partial responses were observed in 2 of 14 evaluable patients with newly diagnosed GBM, 1 of 8 patients with newly diagnosed AA, 3 of 10 patients with recurrent AA, and none of 28 patients with recurrent GBM. Four patients with recurrent AA and 7 patients with recurrent GBM demonstrated stable disease (range, 8-52 weeks; median, 21 weeks). Toxicity was limited to infrequent National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 3 myelosuppression.

These results suggest that topotecan has modest activity against malignant glioma and continued evaluation of its effectiveness may be warranted when alternative schedules or combination regimens are used.
