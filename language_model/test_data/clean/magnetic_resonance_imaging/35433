There have been fewer than 60 cases of malignant teratocarcinosarcoma (TCS) described in the literature, usually arising in the nose and paranasal sinuses. The authors report on a patient who presented with neurological symptoms caused by a frontal lobe TCS, and in whom widespread spinal tumor dissemination developed. In rare cases, TCSs can occur with a predominantly cranial and neurological presentation and spread to the spinal canal.
