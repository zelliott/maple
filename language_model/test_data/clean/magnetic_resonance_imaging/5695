Management of a sporadic vestibular schwannoma (VS) is still a subject of controversy, mainly due to distinct and unpredictable growth patterns. To embark on an appropriate therapy it is necessary to dispose of a reliable prediction about tumor progression. This study aims to design a risk profile with predictors for VS growth. A total of 234 VS patients who were managed conservatively were included. Data concerning (duration of) symptoms and localization of VS were analyzed with Cox proportional hazards regression models. Predictors for growth are unsteadiness/vertigo, no sudden onset of hearing loss and short duration of hearing loss. High-risk patients have (1) VS with an extrameatal localization, short duration of hearing loss and at least one of the two other predictors (unsteadiness/vertigo or no sudden sensorineural hearing loss) or (2) VS with an intrameatal localization and all three other predictors. Low-risk patients have (1) VS with an extrameatal component and no other predictor or (2) VS with an intrameatal localization and at most one other predictor. High-risk patients have a risk of growth of 36.9% in the first year and 64.6% in the second year. For patients with a low risk this is 2.5 and 12.7%, respectively. Simple data gathered at the moment of diagnosis may provide useful information since they may lead to a risk profile for growth.
