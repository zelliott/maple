Pharmaceutical tablets made of modified high-amylose starch have a hydrophilic polymer matrix into which water can penetrate with time to form a hydrogel. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging was used to study the water penetration and the swelling of the matrix of these tablets. The tablets immersed in water were imaged at different time intervals on a 300 MHz NMR spectrometer. Radial images show clearly the swelling of the tablets and the water concentration profile. The rate constants for water diffusion and the tablet swelling were extracted from the experimental data. The water diffusion process was found to follow case II kinetics at 25 degrees C. NMR imaging also provided spin density profiles of the water penetrating inside the tablets.
