Neuroanatomical abnormalities are considered to be related to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Reversal or reduction of normal structural cerebral asymmetries in schizophrenia is particularly striking. The current study investigated the alteration of gray matter volume and cerebral asymmetry in early stage of first-episode schizophrenia (FESZ), and their correlations with clinical measures. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from a total of 89 participants. Thirty-three FESZ patients and 41 matched healthy controls were included in the analysis. Compared to healthy controls, the FESZ patients showed decreased gray matter volume (GMV) in the frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, temporal cortex, parahippocampal, fusiform, insula, and lingual; and increased GMV in cerebellum. Both male and female patients displayed an increased rightward lateralization in frontal and temporal cortex, which was significantly correlated with the severity of symptoms and social functioning. These findings may provide the neurological substrate for the etiology and clinical manifestations of the illness.
