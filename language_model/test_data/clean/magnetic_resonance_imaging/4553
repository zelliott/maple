We present a case of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the liver (EHL). The imaging techniques did not permit the diagnosis. A liver biopsy was done under laparoscopy. One year later, the patient remains without symptoms in spite of the presence of lung metastases and the therapeutic abstention. The most outstanding aspects of this rare hepatic tumor are discussed.
