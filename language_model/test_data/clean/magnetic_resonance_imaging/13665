A method for rapid morphologic phenotyping is demonstrated by using magnetic resonance microscopy. Whole fixed C57BL/6J mice were imaged at 110-microm isotropic resolution; limited volumes of the intact specimen, at 50-microm isotropic resolution; and isolated organs, at 25-microm isotropic resolution. The three-dimensional imaging technique was applied to uricase knockout mice to demonstrate the method for the evaluation of morphologic phenotype.
