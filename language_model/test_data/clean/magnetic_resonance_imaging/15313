This study was to clarify the long-term subjective functional state and the therapeutic factors that may influence the outcome and ADL of patients with intracranial germinoma.

Subjects were 19 patients with an average age of 16.5 years. All patients received radiotherapy with a mean dose of 42.8 Gy, while 14 patients also received chemotherapies. After a median follow-up of 137 months (41-271), a written questionnaire was sent to each patient.

Estimated 5- and 10-year event-free survival rates were 78% and 71%, respectively. Recurrence occurred in 5 patients, and 1 patient died of tumor. The extent of surgery did not affect the incidence of recurrence. Chemotherapy remained adjuvant. Radiotherapy administered to the field encompassing the whole ventricle was essential for long-term tumor control. Only one patient complained of a major treatment-related complication at the time of the questionnaire: radiation-induced cavernomas.

Adverse effects related to treatment are not significant in this study. Radiotherapy of 24 Gy to the field encompassing the whole ventricle is essential, and elective use of chemotherapy and/or additional local boost radiotherapy may prevent recurrence and maintain quality of life (QOL) of the patients for a relatively long period.
