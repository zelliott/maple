Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is typically the first indicator of relapse in patients treated for prostate cancer. Though radiographic progression with an undetectable PSA is clearly documented in the literature, this is an unusual event. We describe two cases of patients treated with a combination of androgen deprivation and chemotherapy for early stage but high risk prostate cancer who manifested clear evidence of radiographic relapse despite PSA values of <0.1 ng/mL. We hypothesize that patients with early stage prostate cancer treated with combinations of androgen deprivation and chemotherapy may be at high risk for this unusual pattern of relapse.
