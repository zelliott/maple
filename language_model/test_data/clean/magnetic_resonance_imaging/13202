Sixty-eight patients (mean age 60,5+/-2,8 years) in the early rehabilitation period of ischemic stroke were included in the study. Thirty-five patients of the main group received peptide cortexin in dose of 10 mg daily intramuscular in the complex therapy, 33 patients of the control group received only the basic therapy. Treatment duration was 10 days. Changes in neurological status (the Orgogozo scale, the modified Ashworth scale and the Barthel index) and cognitive deficit (the Mini-Mental State Examination, verbal associations, the Schulte test and the 10 words test) were assessed. Patients underwent electroencephalography. To the end of treatment, the improvement in global state was seen in 27 (77,1%) of patients of the main group and 18 (54,5%) patients of the control group. The significantly better rehabilitation (p<0,05) of motor and cognitive functions after stroke damage, improvement in the brain bioelectric activity (the increase of alpha-activity and the decrease of slow-wave activity and sharp waves in the projection of ischemic zone) were found in patients treated with cortexin. No side-effects of the treatment were observed.
