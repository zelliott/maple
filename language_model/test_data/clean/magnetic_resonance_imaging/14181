Thyroid imaging has evolved from early radionuclide rectilinear thyroid scanning to the recently developed technique of single photon emission computed tomography. At the same time, x-ray fluorescent scanning, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography have improved identification of the thyroid gland. The appropriate use and relative roles of these imaging modalities in the investigation of patients with thyroid disease are discussed.
