Metallic implants used in neurosurgery, comprising vascular clips, shunt valves, and metallic surgical wire for spondylodesis, induce distortion of magnetic resonance images. The image deformation usually pertains to small areas of signal suppression in its immediate vicinity, when the implant is non-ferromagnetic. The image deformation is more pronounced when the implant is ferromagnetic, but more important, as is the case with some strongly ferromagnetic aneurysm clips, the magnetic field may cause movement of the clip. Therefore, it is advisable to refrain from magnetic resonance imaging in patients harbouring intracranial aneurysm clips, as the movement in the magnetic field may be hazardous.
