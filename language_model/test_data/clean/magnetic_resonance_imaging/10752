Intrathoracic meningocele is rare and is usually associated with neurofibromatosis type I. Most of the reported thoracic meningoceles are not strictly anterior in location, but also lateral or anterolateral. We report a case of true anterior thoracic meningocele with no associated generalized mesenchymal dysplasia.
