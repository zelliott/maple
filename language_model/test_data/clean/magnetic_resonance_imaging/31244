As advances in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis continue, TNF-alpha blocking agents may eventually be used as a first-line treatment. MR imaging could then be used to aid in the early diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis by identifying early sacroiliitis, followed by immediate initiation of treatment to prevent the progression of the disease with its accompanying morbidities. Currently, radiographic identification of sacroiliitis remains the mainstay in diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis. In ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis, MR imaging can demonstrate areas that are undergoing active inflammatory changes and enthesitis, aiding in the diagnosis of a spondyloarthropathy.
