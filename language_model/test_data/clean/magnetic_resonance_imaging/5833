To compare contrast material-enhanced three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3.0T and multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) in the same patient with regard to image quality of pancreatobiliary disease and hepatic vascular conspicuity.

This study enrolled 32 patients with pancreatobiliary disease who underwent both gadolinium-enhanced 3D dynamic MRI and multiphasic CT using 16-MDCT. Data analysis of image quality was performed by two radiologists based on source images, multiplanar reconstruction (MPR), curved planar reconstruction (CPR), and maximum intensity projection (MIP) reconstruction. Determination of image quality was based on a 4-point image quality rating scale.

The overall image quality of the MRI axial images was superior to that of the axial MDCT images. The MRI protocol yielded an average score of 3.8 points versus 3.5 for the CT imaging. No significant difference was found between 3.0T MRI and MDCT images in MPR or CPR image quality. Image quality for visualization of the distal intrahepatic segmental arteries was significantly improved using MDCT imaging. No significant difference was found between the MDCT and 3.0T MR in portal vein branch image quality.

High-resolution dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging at 3.0T is a comprehensive technique which provides high image quality in pancreatobiliary disease.
