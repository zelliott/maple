We describe the case of a 13-year-old boy, in good health, with transient occipital MRI abnormalities just after one generalized seizure and the appearance of macropsia. The EEG showed a 3-5 Hz sub-continuous left occipital activity, with sporadic sharp waves. Macropsia disappeared in 2 years. This case may suggest that the presence of transient MRI abnormalities does not exclude a favorable prognosis.
