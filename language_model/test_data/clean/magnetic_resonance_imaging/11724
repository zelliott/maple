Ependymomas are tumours derived from ependymal cells, found lining the cerebral ventricles and central canal of spinal cord. Intracranial ependymomas account for 2 6% of all neoplasms of the central nervous system and at least half present in the first two decades of life.

We review the epidemiological, clinical, neuropathological details, neuroradiological aspects and treatment of intracranial ependymomas.

Ependymomas of the posterior fossa predominate in children, while supratentorial tumours are more common in adults. This analysis of the literature further highlight that total tumour removal is the treatment of choice for intracranial ependymomas. Postoperative survival was predominantly dependent on the histological grade of malignancy, the extension of surgery and the age of the patient.
