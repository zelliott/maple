We report a case of large temporal giant cell reparative granuloma in a 72-year-old man. MR imaging depicted a right temporal expansile multiloculated lesion, with hyper- and hypointense signal areas on T2-weighted images, heterogeneously enhancing after gadolinium administration. Cortical thinning and bone remodeling of the temporal squamous portion were better seen on CT. The patient underwent surgery, and the diagnosis was achieved by the correlation of imaging, histologic, and laboratory findings.
