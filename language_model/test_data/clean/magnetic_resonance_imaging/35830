To determine if there is a relationship between neurological abnormalities and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in patients with lymphadenopathy syndrome (LAS), we studied 39 homosexual/bisexual men with LAS (mean duration of LAS, 4.1 years) and 38 homosexual/bisexual men who were seronegative for HIV (controls). Six LAS patients had histories of symptoms suggesting mononeuropathy, 9 had symptoms suggesting distal symmetrical polyneuropathy, and 9 had histories of herpes zoster radiculitis. Overall, significantly more LAS patients (18) than controls (3) had histories of symptoms or signs of neurological abnormality (odds ratio, 10.0; p = 0.0003). By neuropsychological assessment, 9 of 18 LAS patients and 2 of 26 controls were abnormal (odds ratio, 12.0; p = 0.004). Of those abnormal on the neuropsychological assessment, the majority scored in the mildly impaired range. Magnetic resonance imaging was abnormal in 1 LAS patient and in 1 control. Neither neurological nor neuropsychological abnormalities correlated with duration of LAS, absolute T-helper lymphocyte count, or T-helper/T-suppressor lymphocyte ratio. These results indicate an association of neurological and neuropsychological abnormalities with HIV in patients with LAS. They suggest that mild neurological abnormalities in LAS are common and that HIV may directly or indirectly be the cause.
