Distant soft-tissue metastases in gastric leiomyosarcoma (LMS) are extremely rare. In a 65-year-old woman, a large, low-grade LMS originating from the stomach wall was treated by partial gastrectomy. Eight years later, the patient developed multifocal, soft-tissue, high-grade LMS. These tumors were presumably metastases of the gastric LMS. However, due to the demonstration of mutations in some cases of leiomyosarcoma, the possibility of multifocal sarcoma should be kept in mind.
