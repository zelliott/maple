The aim of the study was to evaluate feasibility, survival rate, complications and length of hospital stay in 47 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated by radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFTA). Though the treatment of choice for HCC is surgical resection, the strong association of this disease with cirrhosis often rules out this procedure. Many investigations have been conducted in order to identify alternative therapies. Preliminary studies of radiofrequency thermal ablation have shown that the technique is effective and safe, achieving a predictable area of tumor tissue coagulative necrosis and sparing the surrounding cirrhotic parenchyma, without any significant side effects. In addition, this technique, which can be performed percutaneously, allows very short hospital stays.

We report the results of a series of 47 cirrhotic patients with 52 HCC nodules (mean diameter 2.9 cm, range 1-6 cm) treated in our Institute between May 1997 and June 1999 by RFTA using an expandable needle with four hooks at its tip. All patients had hepatic cirrhosis (32 Child A, 13 Child B and two Child C). We treated patients with both unifocal (35 patients) and multifocal HCC (12 patients); 33 patients underwent percutaneous RFTA (54 passes), while in 14 cases RFTA was performed during laparotomy (22 passes).

The mean number of passes to achieve complete necrosis was 1.43 in 28 patients with unifocal HCC treated by percutaneous RFTA, 1.7 in 7 patients with unifocal HCC treated by intraoperative RFTA, 2.8 in 5 patients with multifocal HCC treated by percutaneous RFTA and 1.43 in 7 patients with multifocal HCC treated by intraoperative RFTA. No deaths related to the procedure or major complications occurred. Post-treatment dynamic CT was performed in all patients. All patients but one were followed-up for a mean period of 11.8 months (1-25 months). Six patients died during the follow-up (three Child A, two Child B and one Child C. The actuarial survival, computed by the Kaplan-Meier method, was 83% at 24 months. The mean hospital stay was 3.4 days in patients treated by percutaneous RFTA and 11.2 days in those treated by intraoperative RFTA.

In our opinion RFTA is an effective, safe technique capable of achieving good results in the conservative therapy of small HCC. We believe that curative ablation is possible for HCC nodules measuring up to 3 cm in diameter. Further studies of longer duration are necessary.
