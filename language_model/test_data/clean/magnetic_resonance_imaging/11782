Normalized maximal ventricular power (nPWRmax) is an index of cardiac function which measures the innate blood pumping ability, or contractility, of the left ventricle (LV), and its noninvasive assessment could prove useful in a variety of patients. nPWRmax is defined as the maximum instantaneous product of LV pressure and the rate of change of LV volume, divided by the end diastolic volume squared. We have quantified nPWRmax noninvasively in humans by pairing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) LV volume measurements with aortic pressure estimated using radial artery tonometry and a frequency domain transfer function. In healthy volunteers undergoing cardiac MRI we have tested the sensitivity of nPWRmax to LV contractility with dobutamine and to cardiac loading with methoxamine, a vasoconstrictor. We have found that aortic pressures can be reliably estimated using a transfer function, which we generated and validated in a group of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Furthermore, we found that nPWRmax was unchanged by methoxamine, yet sensitive to contractility, with a 325% increase at dobutamine levels half that given during routine clinical cardiac stress tests for ischemia. In conclusion, we have shown that ventricular contractility can be assessed independent of cardiac loading in patients during routine noninvasive cardiac imaging examinations.
