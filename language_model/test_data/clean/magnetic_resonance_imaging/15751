This study compared the mean signal change method and the voxel count method in evaluating the sensitivity of individual variability in visuospatial performance using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Sixteen right-handed male college students (mean age 23.2 years) participated in this study as subjects. Functional brain images were scanned with a 3T MRI single-shot EPI method during a visuospatial task. No correlation was found between visuospatial performance and the number of activated voxels in the activated brain areas. Significant positive correlations, however, were found between visuospatial performance and the mean signal changes of activated voxels in the parietal, frontal and other areas. In conclusion, the mean signal change is more sensitive to individual variability in visuospatial performance than the number of activated voxels.
