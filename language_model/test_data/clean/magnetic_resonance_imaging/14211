The radiologic work-up of a patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) syndrome and multiple endocrine nodules, with coincidental renal cell carcinoma, is described. Parathyroid adenoma was differentiated from multiple thyroid nodules by gadolinium-enhanced MRI. Adrenal enlargement due to a nonfunctioning adenoma and a renal cell carcinoma next to a simple renal cortical cyst were identified by typical signal intensities on T1- (pre- and post-Gd-DPTA) and T2-weighted images. Insulinoma was visualized only retrospectively.
