To characterize Gd-DTPA-enhanced T1-weighted images (Gd-T1WI) in the acute phase of cerebral ischemia, sequential magnetic resonance images of 84 Mongolian gerbils with occlusion of the left common carotid artery were evaluated.

Twelve gerbils were used for each group, among which the occlusion time (5-180 minutes, permanent) varied. Histopathologic changes developing within the first 2 weeks were compared with patterns on T2-weighted images and Gd-T1WI on a 7.05-Tesla system.

Although T2-weighted images and Gd-T1WI both demonstrated abnormal findings as early as 3 hours after occlusion, Gd-T1WI demonstrated more definite abnormalities with shorter occlusion than T2-weighted images (especially when there were only mild histologic changes). The earliest changes were an abnormal enhancement around and within the lateral ventricles in temporary occlusions; this was not demonstrated in permanent occlusions.

Magnetic resonance images using Gd-DTPA demonstrated abnormal permeability within 3 hours after occlusion, and the pattern is correlated with intensity of ischemia.
