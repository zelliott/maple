A 26-year-old female pianist suffered from an intracerebral hematoma caused by an arteriovenous malformation of the left occipital parasplenial region, which was operated on seven months after the onset. Incomplete right hemianopsia, mild pure alexia, and partially disturbed naming of visual objects persisted several months after the removal of the malformation. Evaluation of musical ability one and three months after surgery showed that her auditory recognition of music was intact. She could sing and play melodies already learned and could dictate well the notes after hearing tones. However, she had difficulty in reading music, especially the pitch of notes, even for simple sequences of 4 notes. In contrast, her rhythm reading was fairly good. Her visual recognition of other symbolic figures like road signs was also markedly impaired. These results suggest that her visual recognition of written music as well as of other symbolic figures underwent a preliminary verbal decoding in the left hemisphere and that pitch reading was more dependent on verbal processing than rhythm reading.
