The role of ENT surgery in the management of anterior skull base defects has become increasingly important in recent years. Transnasal endoscopic surgical techniques and intraoperative navigation enable a minimally invasive approach in a large proportion of patients, thus helping to avoid morbidity typically associated with neurosurgical subfrontal approaches. Whereas traffic accidents and sport injuries are the main causes of anterior skull base trauma in the civilian setting, penetrating injuries caused by gunshots and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) play an increasing role in the military arena and terroristic attacks. Minor injuries to the anterior skull base are usually managed by ENT surgeons. Major injuries, involving the midface or neurocranium, require an interdisciplinary approach including maxillofacial surgeons and neurosurgeons. A centre for head and neck medicine and surgery is an ideal setting for such interdisciplinary teams to provide appropriate care for patients with complex skull base trauma in cooperation with ophthalmologists and interventional neuoradiologists. The present article describes concepts for the treatment of anterior skull base trauma established at the head, neck and skull base center at the Ulm military hospital in Germany.
