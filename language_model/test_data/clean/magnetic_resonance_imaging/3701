Common fMRI data processing techniques usually minimize a temporal cost function or fit a temporal model to extract an activity map. Here, we focus on extracting a highly, spatially reproducible statistical parametric map (SPM) from fMRI data using a cost function that does not depend on a model of the subjects' temporal response. Based on a generalized version of canonical correlation analysis (gCCA), we propose a method to extract a highly reproducible map by maximizing the sum of pair-wise correlations between some maps. In a group analysis, each map is calculated from a linear combination of fMRI scans of a subset of subjects under study. The proposed method is applied to BOLD fMRI datasets without any spatial smoothing from 10 subjects performing a simple reaction time (RT) task. Using the NPAIRS split-half resampling framework with a reproducibility measure based on SPM correlations, we compare the proposed approach with canonical variate analysis (CVA) and a simple general linear model (GLM). gCCA provides statistical parametric maps with higher reproducibility than CVA and GLM with correlation reproducibilities across independent split-half SPMs of 0.78, 0.46, and 0.41, respectively. Our results show that gCCA is an efficient approach for extracting the default mode network, assessing brain connectivity, and processing event-related and resting-state datasets in which the temporal BOLD signal varies from subject to subject.
