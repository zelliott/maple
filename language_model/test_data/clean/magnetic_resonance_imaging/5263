We describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings for the spine in patients with seronegative spondyloarthropathy (SNS) and discuss the indications for MRI in the diagnosis and follow-up of this type of patients. We describe the pathological aspects of four patients diagnosed with SNS (Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriasis) with spinal involvement. The MRI findings in SNS vary in function of the type and stage of disease. Osteitis of the anterior vertebral bodies is a very early sign of spinal involvement in this group of diseases. Inflammatory involvement of the discovertebral complex that involves the adjacent vertebral bodies to a greater or lesser extent occurs later. MRI of the spine makes it possible to evaluate incipient signs of disease that are characteristic of these patients, so it is a useful tool for the diagnosis of SNS.
