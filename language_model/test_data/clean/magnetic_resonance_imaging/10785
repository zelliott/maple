To determine whether the BOLD signal used in fMRI is age dependent in childhood, 332 healthy children (age 4.9-18.9 years) performed tasks in a periodic block design during 3 T fMRI: (1) a verb generation task interleaved with a finger tapping task; (2) a word-picture matching task interleaved with an image discrimination task. Significant correlations between percent signal change in BOLD effect and age occurred in left Broca's, middle frontal, Wernicke's, and inferior parietal regions, and anterior cingulate during the verb generation task; in precentral, postcentral, middle frontal, supplementary motor, and precuneus regions during the finger tapping task; and in bilateral lingula gyri during the word-picture matching task. Thus, BOLD effect increases with age in children during sensorimotor and language tasks.
