A novel dual-modality molecular probe composed of biocompatible Fe(3)O(4) nanocrystal, monoclonal antibody and radionuclide was designed and prepared. All functional components in the dual-modality molecular probe, i.e., Fe(3)O(4), PEG, mAb 3H11 and (125)I, were chemically bonded together for forming a stable molecular probe. Systematic in vitro experiments were carried out for evaluating the biological activity of the antibody in the targeting probe. A series of in vivo experiments were performed based on the dual-modality imaging probe for detecting xenografted tumors in nude mice by MRI and gamma-imaging techniques. The pharmacokinetics of the dual-modality molecular probe in tumor-bearing nude mice was studied.
