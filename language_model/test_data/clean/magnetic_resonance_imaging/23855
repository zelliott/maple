A 12-year-old girl who had zoster ophthalmicus 10 months earlier presented with hemiparesis and corresponding basal ganglionic infarction related to middle cerebral artery branch thrombosis ipsilateral to the zoster. Hematologic evaluation disclosed protein C deficiency. This represents the first zoster-associated stroke reported in childhood associated with protein C deficiency, with extension of the latency period between zoster and infarction, previously reported to be 6 months.
