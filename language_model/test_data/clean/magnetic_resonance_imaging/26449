Molecular motion in the polar organic solvent nitrobenzene induced by an electric field is studied by magnetic resonance imaging. Rf pulse sequences that correlate images obtained at two different times under conditions of both continuous and pulsed electric fields are introduced. The resultant image correlation spectra indicate that the time scale of motion in a 9.6 kV/cm electric field is tens of milliseconds. Comparison of the results to an analytic solution for the Fokker-Planck probability function for one-dimensional bounded diffusion yields an electric field dependent effective diffusion coefficient for perdeuterated nitrobenzene of D = 1.08 x 10(-5) cm(2)/s + (3.33 x 10(-3) cm(4)/kV(2)s) E(2) at room temperature. Characteristics of this electroconvection and its consequences for combining multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance with electrical orientation are also discussed.
