We report a case of spinal subdural hematoma in the lumbar spine of a 75-year-old woman. Magnetic resonance imaging showed lesions of homogeneous high intensity in the spinal canal on both T₁- and T₂-weighted images, findings closely resembling those for epidural lipomatosis. Identification of 2-layered signal intensity surrounding the cauda equina on axial images is the key for accurate diagnosis.
