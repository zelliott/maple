Multiparametric MRI of the prostate is an essential examination for the diagnosis, preoperative evaluation and planning of treatment for prostate cancer. This examination can accurately detect cancer foci in the gland so that the most appropriate management can be offered, reduce the risk of over-treatment and also ensure that certain aggressive lesions or unusual locations, which might affect the prognosis, are not ignored. We present here its main indications, focusing on the techniques for interpreting MRI, its performance and its limitations, as well as the recent European recommendations underlining the need for international harmonisation.
