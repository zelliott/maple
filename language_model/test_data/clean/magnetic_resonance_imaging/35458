Neurological symptoms of tuberculosis are rare, even if there this pathology has been on the rise for a number of years because of HIV. Intramedullary tuberculoma is an exceptional location. We report the case of a patient with no HIV or immunodepression symptoms with intramedullary tuberculoma, revealed by a clinical presentation of insidious onset of myelopathy. We will discuss the diagnosis, treatment and clinical functional follow-up. The optimal treatment seems to be a combination of microsurgical resection and antibiotic therapy.
