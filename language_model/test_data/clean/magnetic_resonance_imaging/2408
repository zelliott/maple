We present the CT and MRI findings of 12 cases with vertebral hydatid cysts. All except 3 patients were admitted with neurological symptoms. The CT and MRI findings and their correlation with pathologic and histologic findings are included. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the usefulness of CT and MRI in the evaluation of vertebral hydatid disease, detection of the various stages of hydatid cyst, and characterization of the lesion as well in monitoring and planning of the surgical approach. Although MRI is the method of choice, we emphasize the complementary role of these two techniques for the evaluation of vertebral echinococcosis.
