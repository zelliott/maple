EEG mathematical analysis in 59 patients with hemorrhage fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) revealed significant changes of bioelectrical brain activity, being expressed most distinctly during severe course, in the different stages of the disease. Re-convalescents after HFRS severe type showed lower EEG coherence indices in all frequency bands that argued for consistency of electric process dysfunctions in great brain cortex and might reflect structural brain damage. The data obtained exhibit higher informative ness of the EEG mathematical analysis not only in the context of differential and diagnostic perspectives but also for adequate evaluation of cerebral disturbance expression and their manifestation prognosis in the HFRS patients.
