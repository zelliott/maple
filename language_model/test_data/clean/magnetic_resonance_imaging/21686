A 62-year-old woman, who frequently had numbness seizures in the right half of her body, is reported. Weakness and consciousness disturbance did not occur during the seizure, and an abnormal electroencephalogram was not observed during the seizure or between seizures. The seizure was completely inhibited by a single-blind administration of phenytoin. It also disappeared on administration of carbamazepine, suggesting that the numbness seizures in this patient were of an epileptic nature.
