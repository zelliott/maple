We analyzed sex differences in 696 patients with spontaneous cervical artery dissection. There were more men (n = 399; p < 0.0001), and men showed a higher frequency of hypertension (31% vs 15%; p < 0.0001). Women were younger (42.5 +/- 9.9 vs 47.5 +/- 9.3 years; p < 0.0001), had more often multiple dissections (18 vs 10%; p = 0.001), migraine (47 vs 20%; p < 0.0001), and tinnitus (16 vs 8%; p = 0.001). Outcome and mortality were similar in both sexes.
