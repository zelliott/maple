The paper assesses the present-day role of MRI in the diagnosis of gastric cancer. The authors consider the major prerequisites for the main aim of their study to be: 1) a dramatic incidence of diffuse (endophytic) gastric carcinoma, which requires significant correction of today's approaches to its diagnosis and 2) a rather biased and, in the authors' opinion, present-day mainly negative attitude towards MRI of the stomach as a diagnostic method for its tumor lesions. By applying the X-ray-MRI anatomic principle to the comparative study of MRI findings in 50 patients with predominantly gastric intramural carcinoma and in 25 patients without gastric tumors (controls), the authors present their methods for gastric MRI, the MRI semiotics of gastric cancer by concurrently touching upon a variety of problems that characterize the potentialities of MRI of the stomach in the diagnosis of its tumor lesions, including their differential diagnosis. As a result, the authors highly appreciate gastric MRI and consider this method to be included into the diagnostic algorithm of radiation techniques used in the diagnosis of gastric cancer, which should occupy its definite diagnostic place.
