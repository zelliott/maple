Bacterial vaginitis is commonly seen in the pediatric population. Severe or recurrent cases may be associated with ulcerative lesions. We report a case of vaginal biopsies of ulcerative lesions in a 9-year-old which led to severe vaginal adhesions, stenosis, and hematocolpos. A vaginoscopy and resection from below were not successful and an exploratory laparotomy with uterine perforation and sounding into the upper vagina were required to reopen the lower vaginal canal. We recommend the limited use of vaginal biopsies in the face of a typical vaginitis presentation, and aggressive treatment to promote mucosa healing when biopsies are required.
