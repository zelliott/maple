Recent research into the non-invasive assessment of hepatic iron concentrations using magnetic resonance imaging has shown that the proton transverse relaxivity (1/T(2)) varies linearly with liver iron concentration. However, the development of an image-based system for the assessment of hepatic iron distribution has been confounded by the presence of motion induced artifacts in the T(2)-weighted images. We report on the development of a single spin-echo imaging methodology that enables the generation of transverse relaxivity maps over the liver. A simple smoothing technique is used to accommodate the image intensity perturbations caused by abdominal motion. The relaxivity maps are consistent with the variation of iron concentration throughout the liver. A Parzen density estimate and histogram of the relaxivity distribution are generated to assist in the visual assessment of the degree and variability of T(2) shortening with liver iron loading. It was found that one or two Gaussian functions could be used to characterize the relaxivity distributions with a small number of parameters. We propose that this methodology may be used in the clinical setting to monitor hepatic iron concentrations in the advent of an accurate transverse relaxivity calibration curve.
