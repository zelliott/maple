Cases of longstanding (median, 60 months) tarsal tunnel syndrome were decompressed surgically in 14 female and four male patients. Patients reported intermittent dysesthesia, paresthesia, or anesthesia at the medial plantar aspect of the foot. Symptoms were aggravated by physical activities. Previous trauma was noted in four patients. Tinel's sign was positive in 16 patients. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 10 patients but was conclusive in only two. At surgery, the posterior tibial nerve or one of its branches was found to be entrapped in 15 patients. Entrapments were observed isolated or in combination within the fascial septa (n = 5), varicose veins (n = 6), scar tissues (n = 4), tenosynovitis and edema (n = 1), or within the abductor hallucis muscle (n = 1). Two neuromas were excised. In three patients no obvious entrapments were found. Clinical followup was performed a median 18 months after surgery. Relief of symptoms was reported as long as 1 year after surgery. All symptoms were relieved in 11 (61%) patients. Three (17%) patients with previous trauma had relatively severe pain after surgery and were considered to have failed results. Surgical decompression was beneficial in most patients with longstanding tarsal tunnel syndrome.
