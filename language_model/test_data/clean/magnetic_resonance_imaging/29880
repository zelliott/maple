Giant mucoceles of the frontal sinus are a rare pathology but their recognition is important in the differential diagnosis of paediatric proptosis and fronto-orbital lesions. Four patients with giant mucoceles of the frontal sinus were retrospectively analyzed. All the patients were females in the paediatric age group presenting with massive cosmetically unacceptable bony swelling in the frontal region along with unilateral extra-axial proptosis. Radiological imaging revealed giant mucoceles of the frontal sinus with extracranial, orbital and anterior cranial fossa extension. One patient had co-existent craniofacial fibrous dysplasia. Single stage surgery was performed in three patients and two-stage surgery in one. Fronto-orbital craniotomy, removal of the posterior wall of the sinus, obliteration of the sinus and its ostium, dural repair and remodeling cranioplasty were performed. Histopathological examination revealed mucoceles in all, and co-existant fibrous dysplasia in one patient. All the patients made excellent cosmetic recoveries with complete resolution of their visual symptoms. Their clinical presentation, radiological manifestations and treatment modalities are analyzed and an extensive review of the literature is presented. Our case of giant frontal mucocele associated with fibrous dysplasia is furthermore the first such report in the existing medical literature.
