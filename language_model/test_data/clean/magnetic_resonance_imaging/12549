Cryptococcosis is a common opportunistic systemic disease in immunocompromised patients. Pulmonary or brain cryptococcosis is the most common clinical presentation. Immunocompetent patients can also be affected, especially in tropical and subtropical zones where the life cycle of the causal agent, Cryptococcus gattii, is completed. We present a previously healthy man with progressive intracranial hypertension and a right paraventricular mass on CT scan and MRI. Cryptococcus gattii yeasts were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed and the patient was treated with amphotericin B, fluconazole and dexamethasone. The patient died due to severe intracranial hypertension.
