Nine patients with vertebrobasilar artery dissections who presented with neurological symptoms or subarachnoid haemorrhage were identified and treated in the Neurosurgical Unit at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. An account of these patients is given and their treatment described. This paper further reviews selected literature to outline the concepts and appropriate management of vertebrobasilar artery dissections.
