We studied somatosensory evoked magnetic fields (SEFs) following stimulation of bilateral posterior tibial nerves ('bilateral' waveform) in normal subjects to determine the inter- and intra-hemispheric interference effects caused by activation of sensory areas in bilateral hemispheres. Activated areas in the primary and second sensory cortices (SI and SII) in each hemisphere following bilateral stimulation were clearly identified by estimation of the double best-fitted equivalent current dipoles (ECD) using the spherical head model, and the large inter-individual differences were identified. SEFs following the right posterior tibial nerve stimulation and those following the left stimulation were summated ('summated' waveform). The 'difference' waveform was induced by a subtraction of 'bilateral' waveforms from the 'summated' waveform. Short-latency deflections showed no consistent changes between the 'summated' and 'bilateral' waveforms, but the long-latency deflection, the N100m-P100m, in the 'bilateral' waveform was significantly (P < 0.02) reduced in amplitude as compared with the 'summated' waveform. The differences were clearly identified in the 'difference' waveform, in which the main deflections, U100m-D100m, were found. The ECDs of the short-latency deflections were located in SI contralateral to the stimulated nerve, but the ECDs of the N100m-P100m were located in bilateral SII which are considered to receive ascending signals from the body bilaterally. Therefore, some inhibitory interactions might take place in SII by receiving inputs from the body bilaterally.
