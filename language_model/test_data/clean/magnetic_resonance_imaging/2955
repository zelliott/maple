We report an MRI morphometric study of the posterior segment of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) in twenty young male schizophrenics and their individually matched normal controls. In particular the more posterior segment of STG was examined, since it has been identified as the approximate site of Wernicke's language area and is a marker for the planum temporale, a region believed to be abnormal in schizophrenia. Total volumes and grey and white matter volumes were measured in middle and posterior STG in each hemisphere. STG grey matter volumes and percentages were significantly reduced bilaterally in both regions in schizophrenic subjects. No significant differences between patients and controls were noted in STG white matter volumes. A significant correlation was detected between delusion scores in schizophrenics and the total volume of the left dominant posterior STG. Replicating the findings of a recent study (Shenton et al., 1992), we found an inverse correlation between thought disorder scores and grey matter reduction in the left posterior STG in schizophrenia.
