An 11-year-old neutered male Labrador Retriever presented to Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine for a 2-week history of seizures and altered behavior. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a homogeneously enhancing mass involving the surface of the left temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes of the brain, causing secondary hydrocephalus. Cytology samples obtained during rostrotentorial craniectomy contained abundant amorphous pink material suggestive of neuropil, scattered leukocytes, capillary fragments, large polyhedral nerve cell bodies, and other smaller cells with pale blue cytoplasm that occasionally were vacuolated and contained fine eosinophilic granules. The cytologic diagnosis was neoplasia, possibly meningioma. Ninety days after surgery the patient was euthanized after MRI results confirmed regrowth of the tumor. Histologic samples of the meningeal lesion collected at necropsy consisted of sheets and nests of loosely packed, large polygonal cells that compressed the brain parenchyma. The cytoplasm was eosinophilic and slightly granular, whereas nuclei were dense and eccentric. Neoplastic cells stained positive for S-100 protein, periodic acid-Schiff, and were partially diastase resistant. Vimentin staining was negative. Ubiquitin staining was light but diffusely positive. Ultrastructural features of the neoplastic cells included numerous secondary lysosomes and irregular pleomorphic nuclei. The final diagnosis was meningeal granular cell tumor. This case documents the cytologic and histologic features of an uncommon type of meningeal tumor.
