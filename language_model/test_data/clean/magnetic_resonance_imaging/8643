The majority of primary cardiac tumors are benign; of these tumors, cardiac paragangliomas are among the rarest. We report a case of biatrial cardiac paraganglioma discovered during workup for palpitations and fatigue. The tumor involved the interatrial septum, with a lobulated portion protruding through the foramen ovale into the right atrium. The tumor was successfully excised, leading to uneventful recovery.
