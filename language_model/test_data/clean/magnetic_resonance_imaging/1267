A technique to spatially correlate multi-modality or serial imaging studies of the head is described. Surface fitting of a well defined structure in different imaging studies is used to determine the optimal three dimensional transformation between the coordinate systems. The transformation is then used to map volumes of interest between studies or to reslice the studies along comparable planes. The approach is feasible in the presence of variations in slice thickness, pixel size, imaging plane, or head position, and for correlations between different modalities. Correlations have been performed between serial CT, CT/MRI, and PET/CT/MRI studies. Phantom studies and clinical cases are presented. Accuracy is typically on the order of the sum of the pixel sizes between studies. Applications in radiation therapy treatment planning are described.
