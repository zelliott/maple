The aim of this clinical study was to evaluate the use of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of facial haemiatrophy. A total of 14 patients with clinically suspected facial haemiatrophy were investigated using high-resolution MRI. The T1- (500/25) and T2- (2200/50) weighted images were analysed visually and numerically. The results of the affected skin portions were compared with the contralateral skin and correlated with the clinical results. The subcutis could not be delineated by high-resolution MRI in 9 patients with facial haemiatrophy. The dermis was not discernible in 6 cases and was "smooth" in a further 6 patients. The signal-to-noise ratio of affected skin portions and contralateral skin or clinical severity did not correlate. The higher the clinical severity, the more pronounced was the magnetic resonance ratio between dermis and subcutis thickness. Thus high-resolution MRI is a useful method for objective description of pathological changes in clinically suspected facial haemiatrophy.
