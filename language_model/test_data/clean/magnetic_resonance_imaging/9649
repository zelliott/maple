Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by paroxysms of pain in the sensory distribution of the trigeminal nerve usually caused by vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve at the root entry zone. We describe a 57-year-old woman who experienced complete resolution of trigeminal neuralgia following hypertensive pontine haemorrhage.
