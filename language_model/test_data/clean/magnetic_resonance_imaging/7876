To evaluate the effect of different cylindrical and close-conforming receive-only array designs on spin excitation and specific absorption rate (SAR) of a 7 T transmit-only head coil.

We developed finite difference time domain (FDTD) models of different receive-only array geometries. Cylindrical and close-fitting helmet arrays with varying copper trace widths, a TEM Tx coil model, and two head models were used in numerical simulations. Tx coil coupling was experimentally measured and validated with FDTD modeling.

Changing copper trace width of loops in array models caused subtle changes in radiofrequency (RF) absorption (<5%). Changes in SAR distribution were observed in the head models with Rx-only inserts. Peak SAR increased (-1 to +15%) in different tissues for a mean B1 (+) in the brain of 2 Î¼T. Total absorption in the head models for 1 W forward power increased (5%-21%) in the heads with Rx-only inserts. Changes in RF absorption with different Rx inserts indicate a change in RF radiation of the Tx coil even when changes in B1 (+) and coupling between ports of Tx coil were minimal.

Changes in local/global SAR and subtle changes in B1 (+) field distributions were observed in the presence of Rx-only inserts. Thus, incorporation of the receive-only array effects are needed when evaluating SAR and designing RF transmit pulse waveform parameters for shimming and/or Tx-SENSE for 7 T MRI.
