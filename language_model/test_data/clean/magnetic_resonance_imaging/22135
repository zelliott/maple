Magnetic resonance has assumed a preeminent role in the imaging evaluation of the spine. Owing to its multiplanar capability and superior soft tissue contrast, magnetic resonance imaging is the procedure of choice for a host of spinal disorders including degenerative disc disease, tumor evaluation, trauma, and spinal deformities. It represents the most accurate means of distinguishing between recurrent disc herniation and epidural fibrosis, and it excels at the assessment of many postoperative abnormalities such as infection, adjacent segment disc degeneration, and arachnoiditis. Magnetic resonance imaging is also helpful in the evaluation of numerous diagnostic challenges that are less well resolved by other means. This includes the distinction between disc herniation and epidural hematoma, synovial cyst from nonspecific fibrous thickening of a facet capsule, and the evaluation of numerous other soft tissue abnormalities. Computed tomography, computed tomography myelography, and scintigraphy continue to be useful for numerous specific disorders and in those patients with metal hardware or contraindications to magnetic resonance scanning. Overall, however, magnetic resonance is the imaging procedure preferred for many spinal disorders. This article is the first installment of a 3-part series discussing the role of magnetic resonance imaging of spinal disorders. Section 1 will describe the varying imaging modalities available and their relative advantages and disadvantages. A consideration of magnetic resonance imaging techniques will follow, followed by a discussion of the imaging manifestations of early degenerative disc disease. Section 2 will be devoted to an in depth discussion of specific pathologic processes encountered in patients with degenerative disc disease. Section 3 will end the series with a consideration of postoperative imaging followed by a discussion of spinal deformities, trauma, and neoplasms.
