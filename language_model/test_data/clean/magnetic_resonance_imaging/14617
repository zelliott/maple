The combination of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with polymeric air-filled microbubbles is used to produce two types of multimodal contrast agents to enhance medical ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. The nanoparticles are either covalently linked to the shell or physically entrapped into the shell. In this paper, the characterization of the acoustic properties (backscattered power, fracturing pressure, attenuation and dispersion of the ultrasonic wave) and ultrasound imaging of the two types of magnetic microbubbles are presented. In vitro B-mode images are generated using a medical ultrasound scanner by applying a nonconventional signal processing technique that is suitable to detect polymeric bubbles and based on the combination of multipulse excitation and chirp coding. Even if both types of microbubbles can be considered to be effective ultrasound contrast agents, the different structure of the shell loaded with nanoparticles has a pronounced effect on the echogenicity and the detection sensitivity of the imaging technique. The best results are obtained using microbubbles that are externally coated with nanoparticles. A backscattered power of 20 dB was achieved at lower concentration, and an increment of 8 dB in the contrast-to-tissue ratio was observed with respect to the more rigid microbubbles with particles entrapped into the shell.
