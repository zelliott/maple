This study was undertaken to define the MR appearance of splenic tumors in 16 cancer patients with focal splenic lesions; 50 volunteers and liver cancer patients without splenic abnormalities served as controls. In 14 patients with focal splenic lesions, differences between splenic and lesion signal intensities permitted detection of splenic lesions on MR images, either because of cystic or necrotic areas lengthening T2 within the tumor, because of T1 shortening from tumor-associated hemorrhage, or because of T2 shortening of surrounding spleen in two cases of suspected transfusional iron overload. In one spleen, a lesion appeared isointense on both T1- and T2-weighted pulse sequences and was detected only by gross splenic deformity. In one other case, CT defined splenic metastases not visible on MR images. Measurements of signal intensity of normal spleens and tumor are so similar that spin-echo MR imaging can underestimate the size and extent of focal splenic disease or may miss lesions entirely. We conclude that MR imaging is a less sensitive technique for detecting focal lesions of the spleen than for detecting focal hepatic lesions.
