Three-dimensional (3D) medical graphics is becoming popular in clinical use on tomographic scanners. Research work in 3D reconstructive display of computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans on conventional computers has produced many so-called pseudo-3D images. The quality of these images depends on the rendering algorithm, the coarseness of the digitized object, the number of grey levels and the image screen resolution. CT and MRI data are fundamentally voxel based and they produce images that are coarse because of the resolution of the data acquisition system. 3D images produced by the Z-buffer depth shading technique suffer loss of detail when complex objects with fine textural detail need to be displayed. Attempts have been made to improve the display of voxel objects, and existing techniques have shown the improvement possible using these post-processing algorithms. The improved rendering technique works on the Z-buffer image to generate a shaded image using a single light source in any direction. The effectiveness of the technique in generating a shaded image has been shown to be a useful means of presenting 3D information for clinical use.
