Although uncommon in the general population, cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can pose a significant health risk if a rupture occurs. Advances in noninvasive imaging have led to an increase in the identification of unruptured AVMs, presenting new challenges in management, given their poorly understood natural history. Over the past decade, there have been significant developments in the management and treatment of intracranial AVMs. This article discusses the pathophysiology, natural history, clinical presentations, and current treatment options, including multimodal approaches, for these vascular malformations.
