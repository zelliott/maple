Melorheostosis is a rare non-hereditary bone disease characterized by a radiographic pattern of flowing hyperostosis along the cortex with sclerotomal distribution. We report a case of a patient with severe knee contracture and a restricted range of motion caused by intraarticular bone fragment and hyperostotic bone lesions secondary to melorheostosis. An arthroscopically assisted approach was used successfully in order to remove free bone fragments and to release the hyperostotic lesions in the bone cortex of the distal femur.
