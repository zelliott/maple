Everyday use of the modern imaging techniques such as CT, MRI, isotope, PET/CT decreased the reputation and importance of ultrasound. In some cases, ultrasound is only the first exploratory imaging method. Using the latest multi-slice CT, imaging can be performed in seconds, which led to a dramatic increase in the number of CT exams. However, this also means a significant radiation exposure to children, while US still harmless in this regard. In addition, significant progress has been made in ultrasound technology in recent years, which led an improvement in image quality. Children are ideal subjects for US examination as they usually have smaller weight with less body fat. Thus, ultrasound examination is easy to perform with a high frequency transducer resulting in much more detailed and higher resolution than in adults. With adequate equipment and experienced examiner in pediatric radiology, almost all parts of the body can be examined, making this technique as the first (sometimes together with X-ray) and, in most cases, the ultimate imaging exam for the diagnosis. This article will discuss the possibilities where ultrasound performed with a modern device is sufficient for an accurate diagnosis.
