Morbidity and possible mortality associated with contrast angiography lead to its cautious use. A noninvasive method for screening and further delineating known abnormalities would be welcomed. This article reviews the initial results and application of MR imaging to vascular imaging in the head and neck. By using the three-dimensional phase-sensitive method of Dumoulin, Souza, and collaborators, we acquired MR angiograms in 37 min and portrayed blood flow in all the major arteries and veins. Feeding arteries and draining veins of arteriovenous malformations were well delineated; aneurysms as small as 3-4 mm were shown, and obstructed cerebral vessels and the patency of a highly stenotic internal carotid artery were demonstrated. MR angiography of the head or neck offers great promise as a noninvasive means of studying vascular abnormalities.
