Relapsing Polychondritis (RP) is a rare disorder characterised by episodic inflammation of the cartilaginous structures. Differential diagnosis of this pathology is a challenging enigma since it appears only intermittently and none of the clinical features are pathognomonic, although most of the patients are usually referred to an ENT physician initially. The natural history of the disease is unpredictable. Initiating effective treatment sooner considerably reduces the rate of mortality. Patients with RP should be seen on a regular basis even if the patient is non-symptomatic. This study reports a retrospective analysis of the otolaryngological manifestations of 7 patients with RP as well as their long-term progress and reviews the symptomatology, histopathology, immunology and management.
