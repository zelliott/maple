The aim of this study was to establish the incidence rate, incidence-related characteristics, and epidemiological profile of epilepsy in Eskisehir, Turkey.

Cases were prospectively recorded by utilizing multiple data sources, including case records obtained through the Hospital Information System, files kept by family physicians, and files kept by private neurologists. Patients diagnosed with epilepsy between July 1, 2007, and June 30, 2008, and above the age of 15 years were included in the study.

219 new cases were diagnosed with epilepsy. The adjusted incidence rate was 33.51/100,000 cases in males and 42.22/ 100,000 cases in females, for a total of 37.59/100,000 persons. The incidence rates according to age were found to be highest in the 15-19-year age group and in the â‰¥70-year age group. Partial seizures were observed more than generalized seizures after the age of 40. Unknown etiology accounted for 77.2% of the epilepsies. Stroke was the most common etiological cause of epilepsy among the symptomatic group.

The incidence rate of epilepsy in Eskisehir was comparable with the rates reported for developed countries.
