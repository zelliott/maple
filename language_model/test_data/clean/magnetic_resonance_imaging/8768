The inconsistency of previous reports examining cognitive function in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) suggests its heterogeneity. In this study, we examined the effect of illness duration on cognitive function in OCD.

We examined the cognitive function of 32 OCD patients and 16 healthy volunteers by neuropsychological tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed the Stroop and N-back tasks to assess attention and nonverbal memory. The patients were divided into two groups by illness duration: a short-term group (n=17, 5.5+/-3.1 years) and a long-term group (n=15, 20.3+/-6.1 years). Statistical analysis was performed to determine the differences between these two groups and the normal control group (n=16).

The long-term group showed attention deficit and nonverbal memory dysfunction on the neuropsychological tests. In contrast, on functional magnetic resonance imaging, the short-term group showed weaker activation of the right caudate during the Stroop task and stronger activation of the right dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex during the N-back task than the long-term and normal control groups.

The results suggested that abnormal brain activation occurs in the early phase of OCD and that the long-term persistence of OCD might involve a decline in cognitive function.
