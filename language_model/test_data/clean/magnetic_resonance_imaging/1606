Because dynamic (fast) contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging with its temporal resolution allows evaluation of contrast kinetics of soft tissue sarcomas, its efficacy for defining viable tumor in these neoplasms was studied for three applications: biopsy localization, chemotherapeutic response, and differentiation between recurrence and inflammation after treatment. After conventional T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance sequences to localize the lesion, patients had dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging with fast and ultrafast sequences and postprocessing techniques (subtraction, time-intensity curves, and parametric color-encoding). In 10 of 40 patients, dynamic imaging more precisely defined the most malignant foci of tumor for biopsy than conventional magnetic resonance imaging. After chemotherapy, dynamic imaging distinguished 11 good responders from 21 poor responders. In followup of 196 patients, dynamic imaging detected 42 early enhancing recurrences and excluded recurrent tumor in six late enhancing pseudotumors. Dynamic imaging can differentiate viable tumor from nonviable tumor and inflammation by showing two temporally different phases of contrast enhancement: an early phase correlative with viable tumor at histologic examination, and a late phase when all tissues enhance simultaneously and may be indistinguishable. By showing tumor viability, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging can help define biopsy sites, chemotherapeutic response, and presence or absence of recurrences and therefore affect the initial evaluation, treatment, and followup of patients with soft tissue sarcomas.
