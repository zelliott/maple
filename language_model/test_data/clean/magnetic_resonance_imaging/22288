Some cases of hypereosinophilic syndrome and myeloproliferative disorders exhibit common features and thus pose diagnostic and therapeutic problems. We describe a 68-year-old patient who presented with such features and developed lytic lesion in the tibia. Based on our case and a review of literature we suggest that cases like ours should be classified and treated as chronic eosinophilic leukemia (a myeloproliferative disorder) rather than as a hypereosinophilic syndrome or as an atypical chronic myeloid leukemia.
