We report 3 patients with typical features of livedo-like dermatitis. Emergency vasoactive therapy was administered to 2 of these patients, in whom the lesions healed completely. Although spontaneous resolution cannot be ruled out, we think that early recognition of this entity leading to rapid vasoactive treatment may limit the extent of thrombotic complications and the resulting tissue necrosis.
