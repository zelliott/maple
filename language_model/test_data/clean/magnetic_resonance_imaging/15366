The purpose of this study was to describe the structure and function of the heart in the presence of marked lipomatous infiltration of the right ventricular wall in 13 patients referred for second opinions about fatty infiltration of the right ventricular wall and suspected arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia.

Lipomatous infiltration with right ventricular thickness > or = 6 mm on MRI but without regional or global functional abnormalities of the right ventricle appears to be distinct from fatty right ventricle associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. The finding of right ventricular fat must be interpreted cautiously to avoid the pharmacologic and defibrillator intervention associated with management of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia.
