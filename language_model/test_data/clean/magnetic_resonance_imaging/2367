MR oximetry requires a T2 measurement that is accurate within 5% in vivo. Simple methods are susceptible to signal loss and tend to underestimate T2. Current methods utilize RF pulses or RF cycling patterns that prevent signal loss at each data acquisition. However, using these methods with imperfect pulses, T2 tends to be overestimated due to temporary storage of the magnetization along the longitudinal axis where it decays more slowly with a time constant T1 > T2. To reduce the T1 dependence while preventing signal loss, we utilize simple 90x180y90x composite pulses and good RF cycling patterns. These trains are critical for T2 accuracy over typical ranges of RF and static field inhomogeneities and refocusing intervals. T1 signal decay during each 90x180y90x pulse must be accounted for to yield accuracy within 5% when the pulse-width is 10% or more of the refocusing interval. A simple correction scheme compensates for this T1-related error effectively.
