During an MRI examination of the knee in a 48-year-old patient suffering from degenerative changes of a partly resected medial meniscus and concomitant osteoarthritis of the knee joint, an unusual variant of an accessory muscle in the popliteal fossa was found. To our best knowledge this muscle has never been described before. Because of the close relationship to the popliteal muscle with regard to course and localisation in the deep popliteal fossa ventral to the popliteal artery, the term "accessory popliteal muscle" is proposed.
