An occipital interhemispheric approach for the lesions in the middle part of the medial temporal region has been reported. However, this approach usually requires the excision of the tentorium to provide satisfactory exposure. In this case, we used this approach without the excision of the tentorium to remove the parahippocampal gyrus tumor, which was located superolateral to tentorial edge in the middle part of the medial temporal region.

A 22-year-old man who had seizures for 3 years presented with a tumor in the right parahippocampal gyrus. The tumor was successfully removed by the occipital interhemispheric approach without the excision of the tentorium. The postoperative course was uneventful.

An occipital interhemispheric approach without the excision of tentorium is a feasible and safe approach for parahippocampal tumors superolateral to tentorial edge, even in a case where the tumor is deeply located in the middle part of medial temporal region.
