X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is an inherited disease caused by peroxisomal dysfunction. X-ALD usually involves the cerebral white matter in an approximately symmetric way. We report a 10-year-old boy with the cerebral form of X-ALD who presented with cognitive impairment and left spastic hemiparesis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed asymmetric lesions, and the lesions in the right hemisphere were predominant. In the late stage of the disease, bilateral limbs were involved. The cerebral lesions enlarged and appeared approximately symmetric on MRI. The purpose of our report is to highlight asymmetric demyelination in initial presentation of X-ALD.
