We present a case of a cystic schwannoma of the seminal vesicle that  occurred in a 50-year-old man who presented asymptomatic. Computed tomography  scan and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cystic mass within the left  seminal vesicle. A laparoscopic surgery was performed to remove the mass on  request. Histopathological examination finally confirmed a schwannoma of the  seminal vesicle. The patient was free of disease 3 months postoperatively.
