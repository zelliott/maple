Ossifying fibroma (OF), a rare nonodontogenic tumor, is defined as a bone-related jawbone lesion. The main histopathological feature of OF is the replacement of bone by benign connective tissue. Ossifying fibroma usually occurs in the second to fourth decades of life and shows a predilection for females. Ossifying fibroma most commonly occurs in the mandible, and OF arising from the anterior part of the maxilla is rare. Ossifying fibromas display various radiographic findings, including varying degrees of radiolucency and radiopacity, depending on the proportions of their soft and hard tissue components. Depending on their components, it can be difficult to distinguish OF from other fibroosseous lesions and some odontogenic tumors by using conventional radiographs, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We report a case of OF in the anterior maxilla in a 56-year-old man, together with its histopathological and imaging findings including the dynamic MRI findings.
