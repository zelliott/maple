We present the first reported MR imaging findings of a histologically proven clear cell hidradenoma. A fluid level was noted on all pulse sequences in this lesion, which demonstrated a prominent hemorrhagic component on sectioning. The presence of an enhancing nodule was also noted, differentiating this lesion from a post-traumatic hematoma. Fluid levels in a well-defined subcutaneous soft tissue mass should suggest the possibility of a hidradenoma.
