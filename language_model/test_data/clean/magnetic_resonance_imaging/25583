Dysplastic gangliocytoma (Lhermitte-Duclos disease) is a rare entity. Usually presenting as a posterior fossa mass, dysplastic gangliocytoma is not a true neoplasm but a hard-to-characterize lesion that may represent an abnormality of cell migration or a phacomatosis. Previous reports of CT findings are rare in the radiologic literature, and high-field (1.5 Tesla) MR images have never been described in the pediatric age group. We present a case of dysplastic gangliocytoma in a one-year-old boy with CT and MR findings.
