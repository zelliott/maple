Neurosyphilis is recognized as a potential cause of hypertrophic pachymeningitis, but modern reports are few. A middle-aged man presented to hospital with a 1 month history of lower limb pain and weakness. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed pleocytosis with high protein levels and a positive venereal disease research laboratory result. Cervical spinal cord resonance imaging disclosed a dural contrast enhancement suggestive of pachymeningitis. Biopsy of the dura mater revealed a thick inflammatory process. Despite being treated accordingly, the patient rapidly deteriorated and died. The patient was diagnosed as having subacute hypertrophic cervical pachymeningitis which caused spinal cord compression. Serological evidence of neurosyphilis was present. Physicians should still be aware of this cause of hypertrophic pachymeningitis.
