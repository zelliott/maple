Limited flip angle (LFA), gradient echo imaging was performed in 130 patients for evaluation of cervical radicular complaints. The LFA study was compared with myelography, CT myelography, and surgical results. Image quality was considered good or excellent for 128 patients. The use of a 10 degrees flip angle with a TR of 75 msec and TE of 12.3 msec consistently provided good contrast and signal-to-noise ratio, giving a CT myelographic effect. The use of both axial and sagittal LFA images was important for optimal detection of extradural defects and for distinction of herniated disk versus osteophyte. There was excellent correlation between the MR and surgical findings. Our results suggest that MR imaging is the initial procedure of choice for the evaluation of suspected cervical radiculopathy.
