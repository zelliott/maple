Due to advances in technology, magnetic resonance is an increasingly popular method for evaluating the small bowel and colon because of the lack of radiation, wealth of information provided by the images, and growing demand from gastroenterologists, surgeons, and oncologists. Careful attention to proper technique, however, is necessary to obtain high-quality images. Factors that need to be considered for successful magnetic resonance of the bowel include method for administration of oral or rectal contrast, patient positioning, need for antiperistaltic medication, and imaging sequences and planes.
