The authors describe a case of systemic lupus erythematosus associated with marked intracerebral calcification. The distribution of high signal on T1-weighted MR images was almost identical to the distribution of calcification on CT; however, the bodies of caudate nuclei with little calcification on CT also showed high intensities on T1-weighted images.
