The authors report a case of a posterior translevator gluteal hernia in a woman with recurrent prolapse. This case illustrates the need to be aware of extravaginal perineal hernias. MRI proved useful in diagnosing this case preoperatively. This case highlights the need to exclude any associated pelvic hernias in women with complex prolapse preoperatively.
