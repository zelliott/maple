Intraorbital metastases of solid tumors are a rarely diagnosed clinical condition, even though pathological reports suggest an incidence of up to 30% in cancer patients. We report two cases of intraorbital, extraocular metastases in breast cancer. The first patient was a 45-year-old man who presented with diplopia, upward divergence of the left bulb, and local pain.

In the standard cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) no cerebral or ocular tumor was detectable. A subsequent T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced orbital MRI with fat suppression revealed an infrabulbar mass of 18 x 13 mm in size. The second patient, a 59-year-old woman, complained of slight diplopia when looking to the left. Cerebral MRI with fat suppression showed a retrobulbar mass with 17x13 mm. In both patients metastatic breast cancer was known for several years, and both had been in a stable disease situation. Both patients were treated with stereotactic radiation, applying a cumulative dose of 35 and 45 Gy, respectively, which resulted in marked improvement of local symptoms. Most eye metastases of breast cancer are located in the choroidea, while an extrabulbar localization within the orbit is rare, with only 3-10% of all ocular metastases. Autopsy reports reveal that an estimated 10-30% of breast cancer patients develop this form of metastasis. This is in strong contrast to rare clinical case reports, suggesting frequently absent to mild clinical signs and difficult diagnosis.

If breast cancer patients complain of ophthalmological symptoms such as local pain, impaired vision, or diplopia, it is important to consider ocular or orbital metastatic disease.
