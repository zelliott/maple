To compare the MR signal intensity patterns and enhancement pattern of intracranial tuberculomas with their histopathologic features.

MR images of six patients with surgically proved intracranial tuberculoma were reviewed retrospectively and were compared with histologic findings of the resected specimen. Detailed histologic examination was performed to look for the extent and characteristics of caseation necrosis, fibrosis, and inflammatory cellular infiltrates at each area of different signal intensities and at the enhancing areas on MR. Signal intensities for T1- and T2-weighted images were compared with normal gray matter.

On T1-weighted images, the granulomas showed a slightly hyperintense rim surrounded by a complete or partial rim of slight hypointensity and central isointensity or mixed isointensity and hyperintensity in five patients and homogeneous isointensity in one patient. Histologically, the zone of central isointensity or mixed intensity corresponded to caseation necrosis plus adjacent cellular infiltrates. The hyperintense and hypointense rims corresponded to the layers of collagenous fiber and the layers of the inflammatory cellular infiltrates, respectively. On T2-weighted images, the entire portion of the granuloma showed slightly heterogeneous isointensity or hypointensity with small markedly hypointense foci in five patients, and a hyperintense center surrounded by a hypointense rim in one patient. Histologic layers were not discriminated on T2-weighted images. On postcontrast T1-weighted images, there were single or multiple conglomerate ring enhancements within a tuberculoma in all six patients, corresponding to the layers of both collagenous and inflammatory cells.

Combination of the described signal intensity patterns and conglomerate ringlike enhancing appearance of the lesion is characteristic of tuberculoma, and may play an important role in differentiating intracranial tuberculomas from other ring-enhancing brain lesions.
