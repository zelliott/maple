Research on how alcohol consumption influences the structure and blood supply of the brain has generally focused on two primary areas of interest: the atrophic effect of heavy drinking on brain structure and the effects of moderate and heavy drinking on the risk of stroke. Heavy alcohol consumption results in atrophy of gray and white matter, particularly in the frontal lobes, cerebellum, and limbic structures. Heavy drinking also raises the risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, while light drinking is associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke. Recently, the author and his colleagues studied alcohol consumption and prevalence of subclinical abnormalities detected by magnetic resonance imaging of the brain among 3376 older adults enrolled in the Cardiovascular Health Study. They found that alcohol consumption was positively associated with measures of brain atrophy and inversely associated with subclinical infarcts in a dose-dependent manner. Alcohol consumption and white matter lesions had a U-shaped relationship, with the lowest prevalence among those who consumed 1-6 drinks per week. Further research is needed to determine how these associations interact to influence overall brain function.
