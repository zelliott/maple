Spectroscopic imaging of phosphorus metabolites in the human brain has been carried out with two data acquisition methods: by observation of the free induction decay (FID) signal and by a short spin echo sequence. The resultant spectral images and spatially resolved spectra are compared. Spin echo observation is found to provide spectra of superior quality, and by suitably selecting the sequence timing, no significant increase in T2 losses, as compared with the FID method, is encountered. 31P images with approximately 3.5 cm spatial resolution are obtained within times of 37 min at 2.0 T field strength.
