A case of an extruded cervical intervertebral disc at C7-D1 level with intradiscal hematoma in a 68-year-old male patient is presented. MR imaging showed a posterolateral extradural hemorrhagic lesion at C7-D1 level. It was suggestive of an epidural hematoma or a bleed within a neoplasm. A posterior approach was adopted and an extruded intervertebral disc with intradiscal hematoma was found and completely excised. Extruded cervical disc with intradiscal hematoma in a 68-year-old male has never been hitherto reported in the literature. The uniqueness of the case is the extruded cervical disc with hematoma within it presenting at an advanced age and unusual radiological features on MR imaging. The clinical presentation, radiological features and surgical management of this rare condition are discussed and the relevant literature is briefly reviewed.
