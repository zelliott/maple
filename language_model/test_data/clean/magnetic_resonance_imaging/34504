We evaluated atrophic patterns of the cerebellar vermis in seven patients with Minamata disease (MD) and nine patients with spino-cerebellar degeneration (SCD) on MR images. Twenty-five control subjects were also examined. The cerebellar vermis was divided into superior, middle, and inferior parts by the primary fissure and the prepyramidal fissure on the median sagittal T1-weighted MR image. The length and area of each part were measured. In the patients with SCD, there were no significant differences in the degree of atrophy among the three parts. However, MR images of the patients with MD showed more severe atrophy in the middle and inferior parts than in the superior part. Atrophy of the superior part was less frequently observed in MD patients.
