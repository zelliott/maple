This study evaluates magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the detection of surgically created articular defects in bovine knees. A total of 26 articular defects was created in 2 fresh cadaveric cows' knees. The defects created include chondromalacic grade 2 defects, chondral and osteochondral defects from 3 to 15 mm in diameter. The knee joints were repaired in a normal saline bath to exclude air in the joint prior to MR scanning. T1 weighted spin echo (SE) images and 3D gradient echo (FISP 40 degrees 3D) images were obtained. The T1 weighted SE imaging technique detected 15 defects (57.7%) compared with FISP 3D imaging technique detection of 17 defects (65.4%). The two techniques combined enable 21 of 26 defects (80.8%) to be detected. The imaging techniques used in this study were not able to detect chondromalacic defects less than 10 mm in diameter, nor chondral defects less than 5 mm in diameter. However, small osteochondral defects of 3 mm in diameter are detectable provided the depth of the defect is not less than 10 mm. The FISP 3D imaging technique alone is more sensitive in detecting chondral defects. Both imaging techniques have similarly high sensitivities in detecting osteochondral defects. The imaging time for combined T1 weighted SE and FISP 3D sequence is short (16.5 mm) and this combined technique may be useful for MR scanning of knee joints suspected to have articular defects.
