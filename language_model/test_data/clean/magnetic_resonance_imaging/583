Cerebral white matter hyperintensity (WMH) is a common abnormality in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and is known to be associated with ischaemic stroke. Previous studies revealed that the risk factors for cerebral WMH were age, female gender, hypertension and diabetes. In this study we examined the association between cerebral WMH and metabolic syndrome, a cluster of hypertension, glucose intolerance, abdominal obesity and dyslipidaemia.

We reviewed the results of brain MRI of 5498 subjects who underwent routine check-ups including laboratory tests at the Seoul National University Health Care System. Among the subjects who met the inclusion criteria (n = 5104), 1693 (33.2%) had cerebral WMH. They were characterized by old age, female predominance, higher body mass index (BMI), larger waist circumference, higher blood pressure, higher fasting plasma glucose level, and higher haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). In multivariate analyses, age, female gender and hypertension were the independent risk factors for cerebral WMH. Metabolic syndrome was associated with cerebral WMH after adjusting for age and gender [odds ratio (OR) 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.39, P = 0.014]. Among the components of metabolic syndrome, hypertension was independently associated with cerebral WMH (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05-1.38, P = 0.007).

Age, female gender and hypertension were risk factors for cerebral WMH in the Korean population. Cerebral WMH was also associated with metabolic syndrome; however, metabolic syndrome offered no advantage over hypertension alone in predicting cerebral WMH.
