Multiple images acquired simultaneously from an array of surface coils can be combined to give a composite image with an improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a large field of view. The composite images' SNR can be optimized by taking advantage of noise correlations between coils and phase shifts induced by surface coil reception. Methods are derived for making optimal composite images with uniform noise or with uniform sensitivity. A simplified model is used to provide an intuitive understanding of the interaction of noise correlation and phase shift phenomena.
