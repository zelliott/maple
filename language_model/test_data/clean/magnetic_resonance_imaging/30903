The key to prognosis. Initial staging and early recurrence diagnosis are key parameters in the treatment and outcome of testicular cancer. Initial staging. It is difficult using conventional modalities, which can miss node involvement and are non-specific since enlargement does not rhyme with involvement. 18FDG PET improves the accuracy of initial staging. Residual mass and recurrences. Existence of residual mass or enhancement of its Volume in the presence of an otherwise beneficial chemotherapy is difficult to manage. Several studies have demonstrated the value of 18FDG imaging in such cases. As for follow-up whole body 18FDG can prevent multiple diagnostic imaging and can diagnose recurrences with greater diagnostic accuracy than with other imaging modalities.
