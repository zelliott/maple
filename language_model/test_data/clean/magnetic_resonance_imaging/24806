Decreased volume of gray matter (GM) was observed in olfactory loss in patients with neurodegenerative disorder. However, GM volume has not yet been investigated in isolated congenital anosmia (ICA) people. We herewith investigated the volume change of gray matter of an ICA boy by morphometric analysis of magnetic resonance images (voxel-based morphometry), and compared with that of 20 age-matched healthy controls. ICA boy presented a significant decrease in GM volume in the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, middle cingulate cortex, thalamus, insular cortex, cerebellum, precuneus, gyrus rectus, subcallosal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus and piriform cortex. No significant GM volume increase was detected in other brain areas. The pattern of GM atrophy was similar as previous literature reported. Our results identified similar GM volume alterations regardless of the causes of olfactory impairment. Decreased GM volume was not only shown in olfactory bulbs, olfactory tracts and olfactory sulcus, also in primary olfactory cortex and the secondary cerebral olfactory areas in ICA people. This is the first study to evaluate GM volume alterations in ICA people.
