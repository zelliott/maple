We compared the ability of MRI and CT to detect and characterize abdominal visceral injury. Seven patients with contrast-enhanced abdominal CT interpreted as showing definite (five patients) or possible (two) solid organ injury following blunt abdominal trauma were referred for abdominal MRI with a mean interval of 3 days between modalities. T1-weighted and T2-weighted spin echo sequences were obtained in all patients. Gradient-recalled echo (GRE) sequences (22-25/12-13/60 degrees flip angle) were obtained in five cases. Both CT and MR allowed detection of complex splenic lacerations in two patients and complex hepatic injuries in three other patients. A sixth patient had subtle periportal hypodensity noted on CT which was not detected prospectively on MRI. One patient had a right adrenal hematoma detected on MRI but not on CT. Relative lesion conspicuity and extent were judged equal on CT and T2-weighted imaging. The T1-weighted and GRE imaging were judged inferior to CT. We conclude that MRI offers no significant advantage over CT for the routine evaluation of acute abdominal trauma.
