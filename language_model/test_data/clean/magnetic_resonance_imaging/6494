Primary sternal osteomyelitis is a rare infectious disease in paediatric patients. It has not been previously reported as caused by community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. We describe a 9-year-old boy with a painful erythematous mid-sternal mass diagnosed as primary sternal osteomyelitis. The aetiological agent was community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, carrying a type IV staphylococcal cassette chromosome for mec.

Methicillin resistance should be taken into considered in patient with community-associated staphylococcal infections.
