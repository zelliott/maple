A patient with histologically proven gliomatosis cerebri presented with a normal choline level but a markedly abnormal elevated myo-inositol level on magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy. We describe the case presentation, imaging findings (in particular, the unique MR spectroscopic pattern), and their significance regarding the diagnosis of this relatively rare neoplasm.
