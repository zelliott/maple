Oxidative stress plays a role in atherosclerosis. Human paraoxonase (PON) gene products exhibit antioxidant properties. We studied the significance of the Q192R and M55L polymorphisms of the PON1 gene and the C311S polymorphism of the PON2 gene in different etiologies of ischemic stroke.

One hundred and thirty-six patients with large vessel disease (LVD) stroke, 140 with small vessel disease stroke, 272 with cardioembolic stroke, and their age- and sex-matched controls were included. PON genotypes were evaluated by PCR-RFLP analyses.

The distribution of PON1 polymorphisms was similar in each stroke group and in the respective controls. Genotypes with the C allele of the PON2 gene C311S polymorphism were overrepresented in LVD stroke patients as compared with their controls, both in univariate and multivariate (dominant model: OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.006-2.48) analyses.

The genotype with the C allele of the PON2 gene is a risk factor for LVD stroke in a Polish population.
