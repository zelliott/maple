We report our experience with 38 cases of prolactin secreting pituitary adenomas. The adenomas were divided in three different groups. The adenomas producing only prolactin tend to be microadenoma and they show the typical alterations of this type of tumor. The GH-PRL, GH-alpha subunit, the other combinations, and the pluri hormonal adenomas tend to present with visual symptoms. The treatment of the prolactinomas is initially clinical and the surgical indication for this type of adenomas is related to intolerance to the medication or to visual alterations. Surgical result with total resection of the tumor was possible in 50% of the cases.
