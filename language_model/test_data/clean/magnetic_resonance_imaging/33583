We found magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the fetal brain to be effective in confirming or denying diagnosis of fetal cerebral defects when ultrasonography was inconclusive or incomplete. In this paper we describe 31 cases in which ultrasonographic evidence of fetal brain defects was verified by MRI. MRI was performed after curarization of the fetus. In 21 cases, ultrasonographic evidence was confirmed by histological study of the fetus or postnatal radiological examination. In 10 cases, ultrasonographic diagnosis was denied by MRI and healthy infants were born. In one case of cerebral toxoplasmosis, ultrasonography detected periventricular calcifications but MRI was normal. In 20 cases MRI ascertained or further documented the ultrasonographic findings. However in 4 of these 20 cases autopsy of the fetus was required to determine the exact nature of the lesion.
