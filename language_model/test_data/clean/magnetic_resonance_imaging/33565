We have studied magnetic resonance images of the lumbar spine of 39 subjects to examine the anatomy of the lumbar extradural region. The segmental nature of the posterior extradural region at each lumbar level may explain reports of easier cranial passage of extradural catheters introduced by the paramedian approach. This approach may thus provide a more reliable route for rapid introduction of an extradural catheter during the needle-through-needle, combined spinal-extradural technique.
