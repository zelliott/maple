The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of a patient with congenital blind megaureter and mullerian anomaly are presented. A retroperitoneal pelvic mass appeared as elongated tubular cystic structure spreading from parametrium to the adnexa and reaching the recto-sigma. On MRI, the mass was hyperintense on T1 and T2-weighted images and disappeared in STIR sequences. The mass with pseudo-intestinal structure, the retroperitoneal site, and the MRI sequences make the differential diagnosis.
