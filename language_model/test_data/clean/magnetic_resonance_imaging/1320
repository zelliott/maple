Bilateral enlargement of the parotid glands has been noted in five patients who are seropositive for antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus. A characteristic cystic appearance has been noted in these lesions on clinical and radiographic examination. A benign lymphoepithelial infiltrate with cystic degeneration is found in parotid specimens from these patients. The presence of human immunodeficiency virus ribonucleic acid in inflammatory cells infiltrating the parotid specimen was confirmed by an in situ hybridization technique. The clinical manifestations of sicca syndrome were not present nor were opportunistic infections diagnostic for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
