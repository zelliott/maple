The effect of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on cerebral oedema in rats was examined by magnetic resonance (MR). After occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) to induce cerebral ischaemia, rats received continuous infusion of ANP for 24 h at a total dose of 120 micrograms/kg or 150 micrograms/kg. Proton relaxation times (T1 and T2) of excised oedematous tissue were measured in vitro and the area of the oedematous region was determined in vivo by the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The administration of ANP was found to decrease the lengthening of both T1 and T2 in the oedematous tissues and shown by MRI to decrease the area of the oedematous region, compared with group receiving saline. The topographic observations in vivo suggest that ANP suppress the development of the oedematous region.
