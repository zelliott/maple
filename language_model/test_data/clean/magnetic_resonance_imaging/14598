We report a rare case of bilateral anterior shoulder dislocation associated with coracoid processes fracture after a seizure episode in a 37-year-old woman. This combination of findings is rare, especially by the presence of bilateral coracoid processes fracture. Possible mechanisms related are direct trauma of humeral heads over the coracoid processes or sudden pull of biceps short head attachment site during uncontrolled contractures. Few reports published similar combination of injuries, and to our knowledge, this is the first to demonstrate its acute features by magnetic resonance imaging. A review of the literature is also presented.
