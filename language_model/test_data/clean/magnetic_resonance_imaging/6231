A fast chemical-shift imaging using the gradient-echo technique is proposed for the separation of the water and fat in human in vivo imaging. This technique also incorporates magnetic field inhomogeneity correction in the fast chemical-shift imaging. Experimental results of the proposed imaging technique demonstrate that the method would be useful for quick in vivo water-fat separation imaging with a substantially shorter time than the conventional spin-echo imaging sequence.
