Although 9% of people will experience a seizure during their lifetime, most do not have epilepsy. Following the first seizure, acute systemic or neurologic disease must be excluded, electroencephalography performed, and psychosocial impact (including driving) addressed. A history of focal seizure origin, neurologic deficit on examination, an abnormal electroencephalograph, or a specific cause (such as tumour) predicts an increased risk of seizure recurrence.
