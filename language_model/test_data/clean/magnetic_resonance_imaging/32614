The tumorigenesis of astroblastomas has not yet been elucidated on the basis of histopathological studies, and genetic studies may be useful for obtaining additional information regarding the tumorigenesis of these tumors. Here, we report an astroblastoma case in which a genetic analysis was performed. A 16-year-old female with a progressive headache was found to have a demarcated cystic tumor with a mural nodule in the right parietal lobe. Total removal of the tumor was achieved and a histological examination verified that the tumor was an astroblastoma. A genetic analysis using microsatellite markers revealed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 9p. The postoperative course was uneventful and, to date, she has been followed up for 2 years with no signs of recurrence. This is the first reported case of an astroblastoma in which LOH was detected on 9p. Based on this result, the tumorigenesis of astroblastomas is discussed.
