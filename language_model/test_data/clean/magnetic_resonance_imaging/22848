This study was designed to determine brain activity in the hypothalamus-in particular the thermoregulatory function of the hypothalamic preoptic area (PO). We experimentally changed the body temperature in rats within the physiological range (37-39 degrees C) and monitored changes in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) MR signal. To explore PO activity we had to deal with general signal changes caused by temperature-dependent alterations in the affinity of oxygen for hemoglobin, which contributes to BOLD contrast because it is partly sensitive to the amount of paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin in the voxel. To reduce these overall temperature-induced effects, we corrected the BOLD data using brain-specific correction algorithms. The results showed activity of the PO during body warming from 38 degrees C to 39 degrees C, supported by an increased BOLD signal after correction. This is the first fMRI study on the autonomous nervous system in which hypothalamic activity elicited by changes in the internal environment (body temperature) was monitored. In this study we also demonstrate 1) that any fMRI study of anesthetized small animals should guard against background BOLD signal drift, since animals are vulnerable to body temperature fluctuations; and 2) the existence of a link between PO activity and the sympathetically-mediated opening of the arteriovenous anastomoses in a parallel study on the rat tail, a peripheral thermoregulatory organ.
