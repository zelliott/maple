The purpose of this study was to measure normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pulsations within the intracranial and upper cervical subarachnoid spaces and the ventricular system. Phase contrast cine MR sequences were performed in sagittal and axial planes on 13 volunteers with flow encoding in the craniocaudal direction. CSF pulsations displayed considerable variations in healthy subjects, depending both on measurements localization and subjects, with CSF peak velocities ranging from 0 to 7 cm/s. In the subarachnoid spaces, the highest velocities occurred in the anterior location and increased from the cerebellar pontine angle cisterns towards the lower cervical spaces. In the ventricular system, the highest velocities occurred through the aqueduct of Sylvius. CSF flow within the third ventricle seemed to reflect a circular motion. There was a caudal net CSF flow in the aqueduct whereas in the upper cervical spaces net CSF flow was caudal anteriorly and cranial laterally. Velocity profiles of CSF pulsations demonstrated arterial morphology. After the R wave, caudal systolic motion was first observed in the posterior subarachnoid spaces, soon after in the anterior subarachnoid spaces and later in the ventricular system. Considering the morphology of CSF pathways, three successively initiated phenomena may explain the temporal course of CSF motion: the systolic expansion of the main arteries at the base of the brain, the systolic expansion of the cerebrospinal axis and, finally, the systolic expansion of the choroid plexuses.
