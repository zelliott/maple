We present an unusual case of a young woman who developed multiple cranial masses and unilateral facial palsy 10 years after a successful living-unrelated kidney transplant. She was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell plasmablastic differentiated lymphoma, a rare form of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.  She responded to 5 cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone chemotherapy with resolution of all cranial masses. However, her facial palsy did not resolve, and she died 6 months after diagnosis with pneumonia and sepsis.
