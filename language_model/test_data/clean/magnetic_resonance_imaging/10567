To report the first case of spontaneous intratumoral and brainstem hemorrhage in a patient with a vestibular schwannoma.

Case report and review of the literature.

University-based, tertiary referral center.

A 73-year-old woman with a vestibular schwannoma, anti-vitamin K overdose, and arterial hypertension experienced a rapid onset of headache, facial palsy, diplopia, and hoarseness.

The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and treated with vitamin K and corticoids.

Clinical and radiologic findings.

At admission, the magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic scans showed an intratumoral hemorrhage. The patient entered a coma 24 hours after the onset of the symptoms. At that time, the computed tomographic scan demonstrated a massive intratumoral and brainstem hemorrhage. The patient died 3 days later.

Intratumoral, subarachnoid, and brainstem hemorrhages can occur in patients with vestibular schwannoma. Oral anticoagulant therapy is a risk factor for tumor-related hemorrhage.
