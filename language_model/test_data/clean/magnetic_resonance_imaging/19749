We present a case of a 4-month-old female infant with a maxillary melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy (MNTI) and review the pooled data from previous publications on this entity. The literature to date comprises 378 reported cases from 1918 to the present, from which data on the presence or absence of metastatic disease was available in 311, and on the presence or absence of local recurrence in 165. These pooled data suggest a local recurrence rate of 36% with metastasis occurring in 7% of cases. At present, the optimal management includes complete surgical excision with clear margins, but there are no reliable histopathological or molecular features to predict the biological behavior in individual cases.
