To evaluate the ability of VEMP to disclose spatial dissemination of Multiple Sclerosis.

Forty-six MS patients with auditory and/or vestibular symptoms were studied. Patients were divided in two groups. Group 1 included 24 patients with brainstem MRI findings, and Group 2 included 22 patients without MRI findings. VEMP and BAEP have been recorded and assessed.

Abnormal p13n23 wave was observed in 50%, while unilateral absence or bilateral delay of the n34p44 in 43% of the patients. The overall diagnostic value considering abnormal cases suggested by both first and second VEMP waves was increased to 71%. Statistically significant differences revealed between patients and controls for p13 latency (p=0.018). The p13n23 was abnormal in 7 patients, although MRI scanning did not reveal brainstem lesions. In 9 out of 18 MS patients suffering from unilateral hearing loss, n34p44 was present in the unaffected ears and absent in the affected side, although p13n23 was normal.

Abnormal VEMP imply the presence of lesions undetected by MRI neuroimaging, which verifies the diagnostic value of the method. Unilateral absence of n34p44 complex was related with sensorineural hearing loss, supporting the hypothesis that n34p44 is of cochlear origin.
