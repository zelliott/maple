Renal cancer represents accounts for approximately 3% of all adult malignancies with a rising incidence. Incidental diagnosis is mostly based upon ultrasound (US). US and Computed tomography (CT) are the standard imaging modalities for detecting renal cell cancer (RCC). Differentiation between malignant and benign renal tumors is of utmost importance. Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CUS) seems to be a promising new diagnostic option for diagnosis and preoperative treatment planning for patients with renal cancer. It is an additional examination to baseline ultrasound and CT. We report a case of a 37-year-old woman with a papillary renal cell cancer in which CUS helped to differentiate dignity of the tumor. CUS is an additional examination to baseline ultrasound and CT. It is a less invasive technique than contrast enhanced CT and shows even slight tumor blood flow. In addition it may allow a more rapid diagnosis, because of its bedside availability.
