Solitary fibrous tumors are rare tumors originating from the mesenchymal tissue. In most cases they arise from the subpleural tissue but have also been described in other locations in the body. Most such tumors in the head and neck region occur in the orbit. Although malignant tumors can occur, benign tumors are far more common. The therapy is surgical excision. For a conclusive diagnosis, a typical morphology and immunohistochemistry are required. The tumor is strongly positive for CD34 and vimentin. This report describes the clinical appearance and treatment of a solitary fibrous tumor of the parapharyngeal space in a female patient. The symptoms were similar to those in a peritonsillar abscess, one of the more common ear-nose-throat dysfunctions. Fewer than 10 cases of a solitary fibrous tumor of the parapharyngeal space have been described in the literature.
