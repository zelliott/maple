The RAD50 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for chromosome synapsis and recombination during meiosis and for repair of DNA damage during vegetative growth. The precise role of the RAD50 gene product in these processes is not known. Most rad50 mutant phenotypes can be explained by the proposal that the RAD50 gene product is involved in the search for homology between interacting DNA molecules or chromosomes, but there is no direct evidence for this model. We present here the nucleotide sequence of the RAD50 locus and an analysis of the predicted 153-kD RAD50 protein. The amino terminal region of the predicted protein contains residues suggestive of a purine nucleotide binding domain, most likely for adenine. The remaining 1170 amino acids consist of two 250 amino acid segments of heptad repeat sequence separated by 320 amino acids, plus a short hydrophobic carboxy-terminal tail. Heptad repeats occur in proteins such as myosin and intermediate filaments that form alpha-helical coiled coils. One of the two heptad regions in RAD50 shows similarity to the S-2 domain of rabbit myosin beyond that expected for two random coiled coil proteins.
