The gene coding for the cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; EC 1.2.1.12) was isolated from Plasmodium falciparum. The gene contains 1 intron and the A+T content is characteristic for the codon usage of P. falciparum. The predicted open reading frame codes for 337 amino acids (36651Da) and is 63.5% identical to the human erythrocytic GAPDH. GAPDH sequences from several field isolates of P. falciparum displayed 100% conservation. Phylogenetic analysis supports the hypothesis that dinoflagellates and Plasmodium are closely related. The protein encoded by the pfGAPDH was expressed recombinantly in Escherichia coli and exhibited enzymatic activity with NAD(+) but not with NADP(+) as cofactor. Antiserum raised against the recombinantly expressed enzyme detected specifically all developmental stages of cultured P. falciparum blood-stage parasites.
