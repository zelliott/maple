A toxin which partially inhibited [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding to rat brain muscarinic receptors was purified from the venom of green mamba, Dendroaspis angusticeps. The N-terminal sequence (up to 45 amino acids) was determined by automated Edman degradation of the whole molecule. The complete sequence was elucidated after enzymatic cleavage with endoproteinase Arg-C or endoproteinase Lys-C and peptide fragments purification. The identity of the C-terminal amino acid was confirmed by hydrazinolysis. The new toxin (MT4) had eight half-cystines and 66 amino acids. It differed from muscarinic toxin MT1 by a single substitution in position 57 (arginine in MT1, histidine in MT4), proximal to the sixth half-cystine.
