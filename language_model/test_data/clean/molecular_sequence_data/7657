We have isolated nine yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) containing the gene that encodes the human gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRH-R) gene by screening the YAC library of the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (HÃ´pital Saint-Louis, Paris, France) by the use of the polymerase chain reaction. We defined the location of the GnRH-R gene relative to 4q microsatellite markers D4S392 and D4S409. The genetic positions of these markers on chromosome 4 are 76 and 77 cM, respectively. This location was further established by chromosomal in situ hybridization.
