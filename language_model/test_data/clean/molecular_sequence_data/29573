Polydnaviruses are associated with certain parasitoid wasps and are introduced into the body cavity of the host caterpillar during oviposition. Some of the viral genes are expressed in host tissues and corresponding proteins are secreted into the hemocoel causing suppression of the host immune system. The Cotesia rubecula polydnavirus gene product, CrV1, effectively inactivates hemocytes by mediating cytoskeleton breakdown. A precondition for the CrV1 function is the incorporation of the extracellular protein by hemocytes. Here, we show that a coiled-coil domain containing a putative leucine zipper is required for CrV1 function, since removal of this domain abolishes binding and uptake of the CrV1 protein by hemocytes.
