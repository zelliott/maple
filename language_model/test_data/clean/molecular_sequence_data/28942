Kallmann syndrome is an inherited disorder defined by the association of anosmia and hypogonadism, owing to impaired targeting and migration of olfactory axons and gonadotropin-releasing hormone secreting neurons. The gene responsible for the X-linked form of Kallmann syndrome, KAL-1, encodes a secreted protein of still elusive function. It has been proposed that KAL-1 might be involved in some aspects of olfactory axon guidance. However, the unavailability of a mouse model, and the difficulties in studying cellular and axonal migration in vertebrates have hampered an understanding of its function. We have identified the C. elegans homolog, kal-1, and document its function in vivo. We show that kal-1 is part of a mechanism by which neurons influence migration and adhesion of epidermal cells undergoing morphogenesis during ventral enclosure and male tail formation. We also show that kal-1 affects neurite outgrowth in vivo by modulating branching. Finally, we find that human KAL-1 cDNA can compensate for the loss of worm kal-1 and that overexpression of worm or human KAL-1 cDNAs in the nematode results in the same phenotypes. These data indicate functional conservation between the human and nematode proteins and establish C. elegans as a powerful animal in which to investigate KAL function in vivo. Our findings add a new player to the set of molecules, which appear to underlie both morphogenesis and axonal/neuronal navigation in vertebrates and invertebrates.
