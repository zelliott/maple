Eukaryotic transcription factors can be identified and classified according to conserved DNA-binding motifs and conserved regulatory domains. The functional and structural analysis, and the conservation of these genes among metazoans emphasizes the importance of these DNA-binding proteins in development and differentiation. In order to identify genes with common DNA-binding motifs in the genome of Onchocerca volvulus we have cloned a zinc finger encoding gene of the structure C2-H2. Using the Caenorhabditis elegans sex determining tra-1 gene as a probe we have identified two tra-1 related genes in the genome of O. volvulus. The zinc finger region of one of these genes (OvZf1) was subcloned and sequenced. The predicted protein has at least eight consecutive zinc fingers and each finger possesses the characteristic paired cysteine- and histidine residues and the proper spacing of the amino acids between the conserved residues.
