1. This review covers the pharmacology and physiology of the body wall muscle systems of nematodes and annelids. 2. Both acetylcholine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) play important roles in the control of body wall muscle in both phyla. In annelids and nematodes, acetylcholine is the excitatory neuromuscular transmitter while GABA is the inhibitory neuromuscular transmitter. In addition, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) has a modulatory role at annelid body wall muscle but little if any effect on nematode body wall muscle. 3. The acetylcholine receptor of the body wall muscle can be classified as nicotinic-like in both phyla though the annelid receptor has not been analysed in detail. In nematodes, vertebrate ganglionic nicotinic agonists were the most effective of those so far examined while mecamylamine and benzoquinonium were the most effective antagonists. Both neuronal bungarotoxin and neosurugatoxin were potent antagonists of acetylcholine excitation at the nematode receptor. 4. The GABA receptor of the body wall muscle exhibits similarities with the vertebrate GABA-A receptor in both phyla. Picrotoxin is a very weak or inactive antagonist at leech and nematode GABA receptors, while bicuculline methiodide blocks leech GABA receptors but is inactive on nematode GABA receptors. Picrotoxin does block GABA responses of earthworm body wall muscle. All these GABA responses are chloride mediated. 5. Neuroactive peptides of the RFamide family occur in both phyla and FMRFamide has been identified in leeches. RFamides probably have an important role in heart regulation in leeches and in modulation of their body wall muscles. RFamides also modulate nematode body wall muscle activity with KNEFIRFamide raising muscle tone while SDPNFLRFamide relaxes the muscle. It is likely that this family and other neuroactive peptides play an important role in the physiology of body wall muscle throughout both phyla.
