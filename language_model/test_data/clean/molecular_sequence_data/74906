A plasmid containing the gene coding for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae F0F1 ATPase subunit 4 was isolated from a yeast genomic DNA library using the oligonucleotide probe procedure. The gene and the surrounding regions were cloned into M13 tg 130 and M13 tg 131 phage vectors. A 732-base-pair open reading frame encoding a 244-amino-acid polypeptide is described. The nucleotide sequence predicts that subunit 4 is probably derived from a precursor protein with a hydrophilic and basic 35-amino-acid leader sequence. Mature subunit 4 contains 209 amino acid residues and the predicted molecular mass is 23250 Da. This subunit presents amphiphilic behaviour with two distinct domains. A high alpha-helix content of 77% was predicted from the sequence. Subunit 4 shows homology with the b subunit of Escherichia coli ATP synthase.
