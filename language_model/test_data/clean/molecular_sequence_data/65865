A part of the nucleotide sequence of the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) and E rns region, and the genomic regions encoding for N pro, Core, and E2 of So-like isolates and IS25CP/01 strain which belong to bovine viral diarrhea virus genotype 1 (BVDV-1) were determined and genetic comparisons were made with sequences of other BVDV subgenotypes. Phylogenetic analysis using the 5'UTR and N pro revealed that So-like isolates and IS25CP/01 branched into independent phylogenetic branch. So-like isolates were clustered with Korean BVDV strains taken from DDBL/EMBL/GenBank in the 5'UTR. An additional two amino acid residues were found at the C terminal of the Core region of IS25CP/01. The similarity of amino acid sequence of E2 of So-like isolates and IS25CP/01 to the BVDV-1 reference strain NADL were 78.0-78.5 and 79.0, respectively. Cross-neutralization tests showed significant antigenic differences between So-like isolates and the others (Antigenic similarity (R) value: 2.2-8.8), and IS25CP/01 and the others (R value: 1.6-8.8). So-like viruses and IS25CP/01 differed from the thirteenth subgenotypes (1a-1m) reported by Jackova et al. (2007) and were classified as new genetic subtypes, BVDV-1n (So-like) and 1o (IS25CP/01).
