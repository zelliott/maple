This paper examines the distribution of fibers and cell bodies containing alpha-neo-endorphin in the cat brain stem by using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. A high or moderate density of immunoreactive cell bodies was found in the superior central nucleus, nucleus incertus, dorsal tegmental nucleus, nucleus of the trapezoid body, and in the laminar spinal trigeminal nucleus, whereas a low density of such perikarya was observed in the inferior colliculus, nucleus praepositus hypoglossi, dorsal nucleus of the raphe, nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus, and in the nucleus of the solitary tract. The highest density of immunoreactive fibers was found in the substantia nigra, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, nucleus coeruleus, lateral tegmental field, marginal nucleus of the brachium conjunctivum, and in the inferior and medial vestibular nuclei. These results indicate that alpha-neo-endorphin is widely distributed in the cat brain stem and suggest that the peptide could play an important role in several physiological functions, e.g., those involved in respiratory, cardiovascular, auditory, and motor mechanisms.
