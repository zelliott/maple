The drug resistance problem has been growing with the utilization of current antibiotics in feed and medical industries. LfcinB, a 25-amino acid antibacterial peptide derived from bovine lactoferrin, is one of potential alternatives of antibiotics. According to the bias of codon utilization of Escherichia coli, a fragment encoding LfcinB has been chemically synthesized, inserted into vector pGEX-4T-2 and expressed in E. coli. The antibacterial peptide was fused with GST with a protease cleavage site located between them. Two constructs with different cleavage sites were made. One construct, pGEX-Th-LfcinB, contains a thrombin cleavage site carried by the vector, and the other, pGEX-Th-Xa-LfcinB, contains a Factor Xa cleavage site which was introduced after the thrombin cleavage site. Fusion protein GST-Th-LfcinB protein was efficiently cleaved by thrombin, yielding recombinant LfcinB showing antibacterial activity. However, fusion protein GEX-Th-Xa-Lfcin B containing Factor Xa recognition site could not be cleaved by Factor Xa at the conditions tried in this study. Successful expression of LfcinB in E. coli provides a possible method to produce LfcinB in large amounts.
