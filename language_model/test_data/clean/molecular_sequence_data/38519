The plant pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae is divided into pathovars differing in host specificity, with P. syringae pv. syringae (Psy) and P. syringae pv. tomato (Pto) representing particularly divergent pathovars. P. syringae hrp/hrc genes encode a type III protein secretion system that appears to translocate Avr and Hop effector proteins into plant cells. DNA sequence analysis of the hrp/hrc regions in Psy 61, Psy B728a, and Pto DC3000 has revealed a Hrp pathogenicity island (Pai) with a tripartite mosaic structure. The hrp/hrc gene cluster is conserved in all three strains and is flanked by a unique exchangeable effector locus (EEL) and a conserved effector locus (CEL). The EELs begin 3 nt downstream of the stop codon of hrpK and end, after 2.5-7.3 kb of dissimilar intervening DNA with tRNA(Leu)-queA-tgt sequences that are also found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa but without linkage to any Hrp Pai sequences. The EELs encode diverse putative effectors, including HopPsyA (HrmA) in Psy 61 and proteins similar to AvrPphE and the AvrB/AvrC/AvrPphC and AvrBsT/AvrRxv/YopJ protein families in Psy B728a. The EELs also contain mobile genetic element sequences and have a G + C content significantly lower than the rest of the Hrp Pai or the P. syringae genome. The CEL carries at least seven ORFs that are conserved between Psy B728a and Pto DC3000. Deletion of the Pto DC3000 EEL slightly reduces bacterial growth in tomato, whereas deletion of a large portion of the CEL strongly reduces growth and abolishes pathogenicity in tomato.
