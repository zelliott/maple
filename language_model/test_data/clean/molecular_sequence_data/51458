The title compounds were synthesised, and appropriate derivatives were characterised by GLC, GLC-MS, and NMR spectroscopy. The GLC and GLC-MS data proved 2-O-(6-O-L-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptopyranosyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)- D- glucopyranose to be a constituent of the outer-core region of the lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli K-12, indicating the heptosyl residue to be linked to the terminal glucopyranose residue.
