Substrates are targeted for proteolysis by the ubiquitin pathway by the addition of a polyubiquitin chain before being degraded by the 26 S proteasome. Previously, a subunit of the proteasome, S5a, was identified that was able to bind to polyubiquitin in vitro and thus proposed to act as a substrate recognition component. Deletion of the corresponding Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene, MCB1/RPN10, rendered cells viable indicating that other proteasomal polyubiquitin receptors must exist. In this study, we describe pus1(+), the fission yeast homologue of RPN10. This gene is also not required for cell viability; however, the Deltapus1 mutant is synthetically lethal with mutations in other proteasomal component-encoding genes, namely mts3, pad1, and mts4 (RPN12, RPN11, and RPN1). Overexpression of pus1(+) is able to rescue mts3-1 at 32 degrees C but overexpression of a cDNA encoding a version of Pus1 that does not bind to polyubiquitin cannot and leads to greatly reduced viability when used to rescue the mts3-1Deltapus1 double mutant. The Mts3 protein was unable to bind to polyubiquitin in vitro, but the Pus1 and Mts3 proteins were found to bind to one another in vitro, which taken together with the genetic data suggests that they are also closely associated in vivo.
