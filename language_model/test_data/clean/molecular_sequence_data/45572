E2F transcription factors are important regulators of proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. We have previously shown that E2F2-/- mice develop late-onset autoimmune features, similar to systemic lupus erythematosus. E2F2-deficient T lymphocytes exhibit enhanced T cell receptor (TCR)-stimulated proliferation, which is presumably responsible for causing autoimmunity in E2F2-deficient mice. The comparison of E2F2-/- and wild-type T lymphocyte expression profiles by 2-DE followed by MS identification has revealed a set of deregulated proteins involved in TCR-mediated signaling, cell survival and stress responses. The deregulation of these proteins may account for the hyperproliferative phenotype that characterizes E2F2-/- T cells. Our work shows that proteomic analysis of gene-knockout strains can be a useful methodology to study the functional role of specific genes.
