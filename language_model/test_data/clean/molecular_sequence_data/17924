Two new flavonol glycosides from the seeds of Chenopodium quinoa have been isolated. Their structures were established as kaempferol 3-apiofuranosyl(1"'----2")rhamnopyranosyl(1""----6")galactoside and kaempferol 3-apiofuranosyl(1"'----2")rhamnopyranosyl(1""----6")galactoside. The main flavonoid glycoside was kaempferol 3-(2,6-dirhamnopyranosyl)galactoside.
