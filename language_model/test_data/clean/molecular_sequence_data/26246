The fluorescence labeling method (Takemoto, H. et al. (1985) Anal. Biochem. 145, 245-250) has been shown to have high sensitivity for measuring the sugar composition of glycoproteins. In the present study, its applicability for analysis of the reducing terminal sugars of glycosaminoglycans was investigated. The procedure involved coupling of glycosaminoglycans with 2-aminopyridine, followed by hydrolysis and N-acetylation, and then analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography on a reverse-phase column. The method was found to be useful for simultaneous determination of acidic, neutral and amino sugars at the reducing termini of glycosaminoglycan moieties.
