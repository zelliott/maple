A 4.8-kb plasmid region carrying the four genes mcjABCD necessary for production of and immunity to the cyclic peptide antibiotic microcin J25 (MccJ25) has been sequenced. mcjA encodes the primary structure of MccJ25 as a precursor endowed with an N-terminal extension of 37 amino acids. The products of mcjB and mcjC are thought to be involved in microcin maturation, which implies cleavage of McjA and head-tail linkage of the 21-residue pro-MccJ25. The predicted McjD polypeptide, which is highly similar to several ABC exporters, was found to be required for MccJ25 secretion, thus explaining its ability to confer immunity to MccJ25.
