The Aprt locus of Drosophila encodes the structural gene for the purine salvage enzyme adenine phosphoribosyltransferase. Aprt is autosomal and enzyme activity is gene-dose-dependent in Drosophila melanogaster. However, Aprt is X-linked and dosage compensated in Drosophila pseudoobscura, as shown here. The Aprt genes of both Drosophila species contain a DNA sequence associated with nuclear matrix attachment sites and these Aprt sequences specifically bind to nuclear matrix in vitro. Putative promoter sequences positioned upstream of the predicted transcriptional start site in the two Aprt genes have a similar structure of direct repeats with an overlapping dyad symmetry, but the DNA sequence of these motifs is not conserved between the two species. Biological features in mutants of Aprt as well as natural variants suggest that dosage compensation of this gene in Drosophila pseudoobscura is due to a general control mechanism on X-linked genes rather than a gene-specific mechanism.
