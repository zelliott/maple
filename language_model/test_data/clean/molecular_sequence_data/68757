The RLP7 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was cloned, sequenced and localized to the right arm of chromosome XIV, close to the centromere. It encodes a predicted polypeptide (RLP7p) of 322 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 36 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9.6. Putative open reading frames very similar to RLP7 are present in two other yeasts, Kluyveromyces lactis and Candida utilis. The RLP7p gene product has significant sequence similarity to the S. cerevisiae YL8 polypeptide of the large ribosomal subunit (Mizuta et al., 1992), itself homologous to the L7 subunit of mammalian ribosomes. However, RLP7p and YL8 do not functionally replace each other, since an rlp7-delta::HIS3 strain is completely inviable. Judging from its predicted mass, isoelectric point and amino acid sequence, RLP7p does not correspond to any ribosomal component biochemically identified so far in S. cerevisiae, and also differs from all known ribosomal proteins by the low codon usage bias of its gene.
