Nuclear so-called fertility-restorer genes reverse the pollen sterility of cytoplasmic male-sterile (CMS) plants caused by disturbed mitochondrial-nuclear interactions. We identified a CMS-associated chimeric mitochondrial gene in an alloplasmic CMS line of Brassica oleracea in the 'mur' system. This novel chimeric gene, orf72, was found in the mitochondrial genome of donor cytoplasm. It was located downstream of normal rps7 and contained part of atp9 (atp9-b). It was expressed specifically on the nuclear background of CMS B. oleracea, partially suppressed in the fertility-restored line and entirely suppressed in the cytoplasmic donor.
