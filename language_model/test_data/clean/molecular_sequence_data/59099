C2H2 zinc finger protein genes encode nucleic acid-binding proteins involved in the regulation of gene activity. AtZFP1 (Arabidopsis thaliana zinc finger protein 1) is one member of a small family of C2H2 zinc finger-encoding sequences previously characterized from Arabidopsis. The genomic sequence corresponding to the AtZFP1 cDNA has been determined. Molecular analysis demonstrates that AtZFP1 is a unique, intronless gene which encodes a 1100 nucleotides mRNA highly expressed in roots and stems. A construct in which 2.5 kb of AtZFP1 upstream sequences is linked to the beta-glucuronidase gene was introduced into Arabidopsis by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of roots. Histochemical analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis carrying the AtZFP1 promoter: beta-glucuronidase fusion shows good correlation with RNA blot hybridization analysis. This transgenic line will be a useful tool for analyzing the regulation of AtZFP1 to further our understanding of its function.
