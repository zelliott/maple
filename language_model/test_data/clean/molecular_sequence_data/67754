The dark black chafer, Holotrichia parallela Motschulsky, is an economically important pest worldwide. Odorant-based lures and traps are being developed as a key kind of alternative control measures for this pest, and studies to reveal the mechanisms for chemotaxis in this pest are necessary. Two full-length cDNAs encoding different odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) were cloned. The predicted proteins were found to have the functional domains characteristic of typical OBPs and share a high degree of sequence similarity with OBP1 and OBP2 from other insects and were therefore designated as H. parallela OBP-1 and H. parallela OBP-2 (HparOBP-1 and HparOBP-2, respectively). These two OBPs were specifically expressed in antennae. The binding affinity of two purified proteins indicated that HparOBP-1 and HparOBP-2 could selectively interact with various volatiles emitted from host plants and pheromone components. Among the 10 chemicals tested, HparOBP-1 could bind to six of the tested compounds with a dissociation concentration (Ki) less than 20, and HparOBP-2 could bind to three of the compounds. The two OBPs are probably involved in chemotaxis of the dark black chafer. This discovery should accelerate research on chemical communications of this pest, which could potentially lead to the improvement of control measures based on lures and traps.
