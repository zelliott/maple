The G1 and G9 rotavirus strains MMC71 and MMC38 (subgroup II, NSP4 genogroup B), respectively, isolated from children in Bangladesh, were analyzed genetically. Full-length VP4 genes of these strains had 98.9% identity to each other and showed 83.9-89.4% identity to those of the P[4] and P[8] rotaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of VP4 nucleotide sequences revealed that strains MMC38 and MMC71 were located in a lineage of P[8] strains. However, the cluster was highly divergent from the previously established P[8] strains. The VP8* portions of strains MMC38 and MMC71 showed more than 93.9% nucleotide sequence identity to OP354-like P[8] strains, and these strains were clustered into the same lineage. These findings indicate that the VP4 of these strains should be classified into a subtype of the P[8] genotype (P[8]b) that is distinct from that of common P[8] rotaviruses (P[8]a).
