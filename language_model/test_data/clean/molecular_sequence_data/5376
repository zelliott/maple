The various functions of human (HIV) and simian (SIV) immunodeficiency virus glycoproteins are similar, so it may be assumed that the overall structure of the folded proteins will be maintained. To preserve structure there must be constraints on sequence variation. The majority of mutations tolerated will be involved in immune escape but changes at some positions are known to have direct effects on glycoprotein expression and function. This allows the virus to change its phenotype and escape immune pressure. These properties will influence the fitness of the virus to infect and replicate in potential hosts. A better understanding of the structure-function relationships of HIV/SIV glycoproteins will assist in the development of vaccines and antivirals. Here, we identify similarities and differences between HIV-1 subtypes and HIV/SIV types that may be relevant to the phenotypes of the various groups. The results are discussed in relation to what is known of domain-function associations for HIV/SIV glycoproteins.
