Gram-positive cocci which dominate in the intestinal flora of domestic pigeons were found to constitute a new species of the genus Enterococcus. The strains were most closely related to Enterococcus cecorum, originally described as Streptococcus cecorum, a carboxyphilic species from chicken intestines, and to Enterococcus avium. The pigeon strains resemble E. cecorum and also many E. avium strains in their lack of group D antigen and in being more sensitive to NaCl than other enterococci. The type strain is strain STR 345 (= NCIMB 13013).
