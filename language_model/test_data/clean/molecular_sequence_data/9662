The putative membrane fatty acid transporter (FAT) protein and its mRNA, originally expressed in adipose tissue, were found in the tongue of rats. Northern blot analysis showed a significant expression of FAT mRNA in the epithelial layer of circumvallate papillae. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that immunoreactivity for FAT is specifically localized in the apical part of taste bud cells, possibly gustatory cells, in the circumvallate papillae.
