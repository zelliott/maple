A cDNA library for Trichinella pseudospiralis was constructed to study the expression of specific antigens. Four positive clones were identified using antibodies against the excretory/secretory (ES) products of the nematode as probe. Sequence analysis showed that they contained identical cDNA inserts of 606 bp, including a 5' non-translated region of 96 bp, a core translated segment of 408 bp and a poly(A)+ 3' terminus. It encoded a novel 136-amino-acid polypeptide. Southern blot analysis indicated that the cDNA did not cross-hybridize to the genomic digests of T. spiralis, mouse, or rat. A single copy only of its complementary sequence was found in the genome of T. pseudospiralis. Using the lambda ZAP expression system, the cDNA was induced to express a 23-kDa beta-galactosidase-fusion protein which did not cross-react with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against T. spiralis, heat shock proteins, or four heterologous species of nematodes. The antiserum against the fusion protein recognized a 15-kDa band from the ES products of T. pseudospiralis in immunoblotting. Immunocytolocalization demonstrated that the anti-fusion protein serum only recognized an epitope in the stichosome of T. pseudospiralis and not in T. spiralis. The protein can therefore serve as a specific antigen for the differential diagnosis of trichinellosis.
