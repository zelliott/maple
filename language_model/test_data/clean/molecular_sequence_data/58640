Osteopontin (OPN) is a secreted adhesive glycoprotein with a gly-arg-gly-asp-ser (GRGDS) cell binding domain. Several independent studies have suggested that OPN functions in tumor growth and metastasis, and one likely possibility is that OPN facilitates tumor invasion by promoting tumor cell migration. Consistent with this hypothesis, immobilized OPN promoted concentration-dependent tumor cell migration (i.e., haptotaxis) in modified Boyden chambers. In particular, cleavage of OPN by thrombin, which likely occurs in the tumor microenvironment, resulted in enhancement of OPNs haptotactic activity; and assays performed with purified preparations of the two individual OPN thrombin-cleavage fragments demonstrated that all detectable activity was associated with the GRGDS-containing fragment. In contrast to the activity of both OPN and its GRGDS-containing fragment in promoting haptotaxis, neither of these proteins in solution promoted chemotaxis, indicating that each must be immobilized to promote cell migration. In haptotaxis assays, antibody LM609 to integrin alpha v beta 3 blocked > 80% cell migration towards the GRGDS-containing OPN fragment, implicating alpha v beta 3 as its principal functional receptor. In comparison with equimolar quantities of other adhesive proteins, the GRGDS-containing OPN thrombin-cleavage fragment was not only > 2-fold more effective than intact OPN at promoting haptotaxis, but also > 8-fold and > 6-fold more effective than fibrinogen and vitronectin, respectively, indicating that this OPN fragment is highly active relative to other alpha v beta 3 ligands.
