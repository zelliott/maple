A novel method for the adaptor-mediated PCR amplification of microdissected chromosome arms is described. This simple and versatile protocol eliminates the need for enzymatic micromanipulation in nanoliter volumes and permits the efficient amplification of as little as two wheat chromosome arms in a 'single tube' reaction.
