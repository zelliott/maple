We have determined the nucleotide sequence of gene fosB of plasmid pIP1842, which confers resistant to fosfomycin in Staphylococcus epidermidis BM2641. The resistance gene was identified as a coding sequence of 417 bases pairs corresponding to a protein with a calculated Mw of 16,345 daltons. This value is in good agreement with that of 15,000, estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of a bacterial cell-free coupled transcription-translation system. The fosB gene product exhibits 48% sequence homology with the fosfomycin resistance protein FOSA of Enterobacteriaceae. The substitutions are scattered throughout indicating that the two corresponding genes have diverged from a common ancestor. Downstream from fosB is located an open reading frame that was partially sequenced. The deduced amino-acid sequence was 50% homologous to REP alpha 1, a protein involved in the replication of the Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pAM alpha 1.
