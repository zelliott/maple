Regulation of the GCN4 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the best-documented instances of gene-specific translational control in an eukaryote. Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in GCN4 mRNA modulate the flow of scanning ribosomes to the GCN4 start codon according to the availability of amino acids. Recent results suggest that sequences at the termination codons of the uORFs, a general initiation factor, and a protein kinase all make important contributions to the proper functioning of this interesting translational-control element.
