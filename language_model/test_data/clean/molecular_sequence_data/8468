To address the question of whether the human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) gene is associated with the etiology of Sj√∂gren's syndrome (SS), RNA expression of HTLV-I gag, pol, env, and tax genes in labial salivary glands (LSGs) from SS patients who were seronegative for antibodies to HTLV-I was examined using RT-PCR method. The HTLV-I tax gene, but not the HTLV-I gag, pol, or env genes, was detected in LSG samples from 4 of 14 patients (29%). The nucleotide sequences of the HTLV-I pXIV region in these 4 patients' LSGs showed 100% homology to the HTLV-I pXIV gene from the MT-2 cell line. In conclusion, these findings suggest that products encoding sequences homologous to the HTLV-I pXIV gene in SS patients' LSGs might be candidates for self-antigen and/or lead to activation of autoreactive T lymphocytes through trans-acting transcriptional activation.
