The complete sequences of Fiji disease virus (FDV) genome segments 5 (S5), S6, S8 and S10 were obtained and comprised 3150 nt, 2831 nt, 1959 nt and 1819 nt, respectively. Each segment contained a single ORF which encoded putative proteins of 115 kDa, 97 kDa, 69 kDa and 63.0 kDa, respectively. The putative amino acid sequences encoded by S5 and S6 contained putative leucine zipper motifs while FDV S5 and S8 each contained an ATP-GTP-binding motif. At the amino acid level, FDV S5, S6, S8 and S10 showed most similarity to the corresponding segments of Rice black-streaked dwarf virus. Based on sequence similarities, it is predicted that FDV S8 encodes a minor core protein, while FDV S10 encodes an outer capsid protein. The evolutionary relationships of FDV to other reoviruses are discussed.
