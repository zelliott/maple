An abasic site in DNA creates a strong block to DNA polymerase and is a mutagenic base lesion. In this study, we present structural and dynamic properties of duplex oligodeoxynucleotides containing G, C and T opposite a model abasic site studied by one and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We have demonstrated that A opposite the abasic site was positioned within the helix as if paired with T, and that the A residue melted co-operatively with the surrounding helix. We report here that G opposite the abasic site is also observed to be predominantly intrahelical in a normal anti conformation at low temperature. With increasing temperature, the mobility of the G residue increases rapidly and apparently is in a "melted state" well before denaturation of the helix. At low temperature, two species are found for T opposite the abasic site; one, intrahelical, one extrahelical. These species are in slow exchange with one another on a proton nuclear magnetic resonance time-scale. The two species then move into fast exchange with increasing temperature and the proportion of the extra-helical form increases. When C is positioned opposite the abasic site, both the C residue and the abasic sugar are extrahelical, the helix collapses, and the adjacent G.C base-pairs stack over one another. On the basis of these observations, we propose a model that explains why the abasic site acts to block DNA replication. Further, we suggest an explanation for the observed polymerase preference for base selection at abasic sites.
