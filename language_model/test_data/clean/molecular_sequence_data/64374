A survey of minisatellites (MSs) in 5.3 Mb of randomly selected rice DNA sequences from public databases was carried out to clarify the role of transposable elements (TEs) in the dispersal of MSs in the rice genome. The estimated frequency of MSs in this sample was one per 23.4 kb, and this frequency is approximately equivalent to that of Class I microsatellites in the rice genome. Of the MSs in the 5.3-Mb sequence sample, 82% were found to be present in multiple copies in the rice genome, and all of these were a part of TE sequences. In this study at least 61 TE groups were identified as MS carriers. It was also shown that the GC-rich MS pOs6.2H, which was previously reported to be one of the interspersed MSs in the rice genome, is a component of an En/Spm-like element. These results indicate that the majority of MSs in the rice genome are maintained in TEs, and amplified and dispersed as components of the TEs. The G+C content of the multi-locus MS sequences reflected that of the TE sequences containing those MSs, but no obvious bias towards the high G+C content of DNA was observed. Single locus MSs also did not show any obvious bias towards the high G+C content of DNA in the rice genome. In this respect, the MSs in the rice genome are quite different from those in the human genome: in the latter, the majority of MSs show an obvious bias towards the high G+C content of DNA.
