To analyze CYP17A1 gene mutations in a child patient with 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17, 20-lyase deficiency (17OHD), and to review characteristics of CYP17A1 gene mutations in Chinese patients with 17OHD.

Clinical data were collected. PCR and DNA sequencing were performed to detect mutations in the patient.

The patient has presented classical features of 17OHD including hypertension, hypokalemia, decreased sex hormones and plasma cortisol, and elevated blood adrenocorticotrophic hormone. A compound heterozygous mutation c.987C>A and c.985del was detected in the CYP17A1 gene, which resulted in two premature stop codons at positions 328 and 417.

A compound mutation, c.987C>A and c.985del, has been identified in a patient with 17OHD. Among CYP17A1 gene mutations identified in Chinese patients, missence mutations have been most common, and exons 5 and 8 have been the mutation hotspots.
