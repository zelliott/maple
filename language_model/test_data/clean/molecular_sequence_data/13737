Allele and genotype frequencies at the HLA-DQA1 locus were determined in Basque Country populations using PCR methodology and a dot-blot assay with ASO probes. The results showed no deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. No differences were found between the three Basque Provinces, but gene frequencies were significantly different from those of some other Spanish and world populations.
