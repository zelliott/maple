Most 'ambrosia' fungi are members of a heterogeneous group of ophiostomatoids that includes the anamorph genera Ambrosiella, Raffaelea and Dryadomyces. The taxonomy of these fungi based on morphological features has been complicated by these features being poorly descriptive and having evolved convergently. In this work we report maximum parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of a multigene dataset (nSSU rDNA, nLSU rDNA and beta-tubulin gene) from sixty-seven taxa that include members of genera Ambrosiella, Raffaelea and Dryadomyces and a diverse set of ophiostomatoid relatives. We discuss the phylogenetic status of genus Ambrosiella and its relationships with representatives of Ophiostomatales teleomorph and anamorph genera. Our analysis shows that ten of the thirteen species that had been assigned to the genus Ambrosiella are related to the teleomorph genera Grosmannia or Ophiostoma, within the Ophiostomatales. The multigene analysis and expanded taxon samplings provide a higher resolution for the species phylogeny and clarify detailed relationships between Ambrosiella associates of ambrosia and bark beetles and the closely related species of genera Raffaelea and Dryadomyces. We discuss difficulties in using the morphology of conidiophores and the mode of conidiogenesis to re-define the phylogenetic classification of Ambrosiella species. Finally, we report a correlation between the molecular classification of Ophiostomatales-related species of Ambrosiella and Raffaelea and their ecological niches.
