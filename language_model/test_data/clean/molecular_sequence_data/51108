The 39-43 amino acid beta amyloid protein (A beta) that deposits as amyloid in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is encoded as an internal sequence within a larger membrane-associated protein known as the amyloid protein precursor (APP). In cultured cells, the APP is normally cleaved within the A beta to generate a large secreted derivative and a small membrane-associated fragment. Neither of these derivatives can produce amyloid because neither contains the entire A beta. Our study was designed to determine whether the soluble APP derivatives in human brain end within the A beta as described in cell culture or whether AD brain produces potentially amyloidogenic soluble derivatives that contain the entire A beta. We find that both AD and control brain contain nonamyloidogenic soluble derivatives that end at position 15 of the A beta. We have been unable to detect any soluble derivatives that contain the entire A beta in either the AD or control brain.
