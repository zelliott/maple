Spermatogenesis is a complex process that occurs in successive mitotic, meiotic and post-meiotic phases and involves a highly regulated selective gene-expression pattern. However, this process has not been well characterised at the gene expression level due to the absence of germinal cell lines. We previously demonstrated that the rat skeletal muscle-specific gene for the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase is also specifically expressed in meiotic and haploid male germ cells from testis (12). To analyse the promoter elements that regulate the transcription of the phosphoglycerate mutase m gene (pgam-m)during spermatogenesis, we developed transgenic mice for a construct containing 1.3 kb from the pgam-m promoter linked to the Escherichia coli LacZ gene. RNA analysis by retrotranscription and PCR amplification of transgene expression showed transcriptional activity in the testis with a pattern during testis development that was identical to the endogenous gene. The transgene was also active in skeletal muscle but not in the adult heart in all the transgenic lines analysed. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the 1.3 kb pgam-m promoter contains sufficient sequences to specify temporally regulated testis-specific expression as well as skeletal-muscle expression.
