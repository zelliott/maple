The gene for the human CD30 ligand was molecularly cloned, sequenced and characterised. The gene structure consisted of four exons and three intervening introns spaced over 17.1 kb of genomic DNA. The 5' flanking region of the CD30L gene was sequenced and analysis of the region revealed the presence of several regulatory regions including a poly-dT element directly upstream from the transcription start site and consensus sequences for AP4, IK2, MZF1, E47 and ELK/cETS1. The absence of a canionical TATA motif suggests CD30L gene expression is regulated by a TATA-less promoter.
