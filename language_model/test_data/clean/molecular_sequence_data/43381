A cDNA encoding the complete precursor of a Fasciola hepatica cathepsin L protease was isolated and sequenced. Functionally active enzyme was expressed and secreted by Saccharomyces cerevisiae transformed with a plasmid carrying the complete gene. Experiments with temperature-sensitive yeast mutants showed that the enzyme is trafficked through the yeast secretory pathway. Yeast transformed with a truncated gene, which lacked the pre-peptide-encoding and most of the pro-peptide-encoding sequences, did not express funtionally active enzyme. The yeast-expressed enzyme exhibited physicochemical properties in common with the native enzyme including, pH optimum for activity, stability at 37 degrees C and ability to cleave gelatin and immunoglobulin. Enzyme kinetic data showed that the native and yeast-expressed cathepsin L1 have similar specificities for substrates with hydrophobic residues in the P2 position. This is the first report of the functional expression of a cathepsin L proteinase in S. cerevisiae that did not require the use of yeast secretory signal sequences.
