We have cloned a 420 bp cDNA from a human fetal brain cDNA library in lambda encoding the human homologue of a DSIP-immunoreactive leucine zipper protein (DIP) isolated from porcine brain. The derived human protein (hDIP) shares a significant sequence identity with parts of the murine TSC-22 and Drosophila shs, both proteins which are discussed as functioning as transcriptional regulators. A similar role of hDIP is partially confirmed by the results of an RT-PCR analysis, demonstrating the widespread distribution of the protein among different human tissues.
