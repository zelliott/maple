The polymerase chain reaction with prior reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA was applied to hepatitis C virus RNA detection in human serum samples of different origin. In order to eliminate false negative results, the following steps were optimized: RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and oligonucleotide primer selection. We compared different RNA extraction methods using guanidinium salt/detergent and proteinase K digestion/phenol extraction, and tested virus particle enrichment with polyethylene glycol precipitation and ultracentrifugation. RNA extraction with guanidinium salt/detergent was the most efficient method. Ultracentrifugation of single samples did not improve hepatitis C virus RNA detection. Polyethylene glycol precipitation performed poorly. Recombinant thermostable reverse transcriptase produced cDNA from fewer samples than did Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase. Nested oligonucleotide primers from the 5'-terminal non-coding region of the hepatitis C virus genome amplified cDNA from more samples than did primers from the coding regions. Thirty six anti-hepatitis C virus antibody positive samples were tested; nested primers (nucleotides 6 to 327 and 15 to 288) yielded 21 amplificates, whereas primers from the coding region produced 16 amplificates (nucleotides 4684-5276) and 5 amplificates (nucleotides 5166-5270), respectively. The most efficient combination of steps was RNA extraction with guanidinium salt solution, reverse transcription with Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase and nested polymerase chain reaction primed with primers from the 5'-terminal non-coding region of the hepatitis C virus genome. Other combinations produced more false negative results. Three different groups of anti-hepatitis C virus antibody positive individuals had markedly different viraemia patterns: Hepatitis C virus RNA was detected in the sera of only 10% of anti-hepatitis C virus antibody positive blood donors, but in 90% of anti-hepatitis C virus antibody positive patients with clinically manifest hepatitis C, and 90% of anti-hepatitis C virus antibody positive haemophiliacs who had received plasma products in the past which had not been virus-inactivated. No hepatitis C virus RNA could be detected in the sera of 450 anti-hepatitis C virus antibody negative blood donors with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase catalytic concentrations.
