We report the ability of Taq polymerase to directly transcribe RNA templates in vitro. We have made use of this finding to develop a single-step protocol for amplification of RNA transcripts. The method was shown to require only subnanogram amounts of total cellular RNA as starting material. A microassay was developed in which RNA can be extracted from one drop of blood or 1000 cultured cells, and analyzed for the expression of a specific gene.
