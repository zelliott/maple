Erythropoietin (Epo) synthesis increases in response to hypoxia. The hepatoma cell line Hep 3B produces low basal levels of Epo mRNA which increase markedly with hypoxia. To define the sequences necessary for this response, we linked fragments of the human Epo gene to a luciferase vector, introduced these plasmids into Hep 3B cells and assayed for luciferase activity after growth in 1% or 21% oxygen. A 621-bp Epo promoter fragment resulted in a 2.4-fold increase in luciferase activity with hypoxia. We tested several Epo gene fragments upstream of this Epo promoter fragment and found that a 613-bp Bgl II-Pvu II 3' fragment had a 10-fold increase in activity with hypoxia regardless of orientation. This fragment had a similar level of activity when linked to a simian virus 40 promoter. Portions of this fragment retained activity, including a 38-bp Apa I-Taq I fragment that had a 17-fold increase in activity with hypoxia. Deletion of nt 4-13 or 19-28 from this 38-bp fragment resulted in a loss of activity. The 24-bp upstream portion of the 38-bp fragment showed an 8-fold increase in activity with hypoxia. However, deletion of nt 19-24 or mutagenesis of nt 21 or 22 in this 24-bp fragment resulted in loss of activity. Our studies indicate that the transcriptional response of the human Epo gene to hypoxia is mediated in part by promoter sequences and to a greater degree by an enhancer element located in a 24-bp portion of the 3' flanking sequence of the gene.
