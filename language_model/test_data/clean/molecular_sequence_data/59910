A novel and simple approach for rational design of oligosaccharide mimics has been developed. Mammalian high-mannose triantennary structure Man9GlcNac2 has been subjected to molecular modelling using the NMR data available on structural fragments of the oligosaccharide. The analysis indicated four different low energy conformations, and the spatial arrangement of terminal disaccharides of the oligosaccharide antennae were stimulated with glycopeptides carrying disaccharides by applying weak constraints between the saccharide parts in MD-simulations on a large array of tri- to octaglycopeptides. The five glycopeptides exhibiting the best fit with the four minimum energy confirmations of the oligosaccharide were synthesized by solid phase glycopeptide assembly using glycosylated fluoren-9-ylmethyloxycarbonyl-amino acid-O-pentafluorophenyl esters as building blocks. The glycan was acyl protected alpha-D-Man-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Man and Ser, Thr and Hyp were the glycosylated amino acids. The deprotected and purified glycopeptides were subjected to NMR analysis for characterization, and in order to investigate the cis-trans isomerism of the carbimide bonds to Hyp. The glycopeptides were tested for their ability to inhibit binding of mannan-binding protein to mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They were found to be weak inhibitors showing no indication of multivalent interaction with the mannan-binding protein.
