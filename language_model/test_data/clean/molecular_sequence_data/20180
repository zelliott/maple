Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative oral anaerobe associated with chronic adult periodontitis. Its ecological niche is the gingival crevice, where the organism adapts to the challenges of the infectious process such as host defence and bacterial products. Bacterial responses to environmental changes are partly regulated by two-component signal transduction systems. Several intact systems were annotated in the genome of P. gingivalis, as well as an orphan regulator encoding a homologue of RprY, a response regulator from Bacteroides fragilis. With the goal of defining the environmental cues that activate RprY in P. gingivalis, we used several strategies to identify its regulon. Results from gene expression and DNA-protein binding assays identified target genes that were either involved in transport functions or associated with oxidative stress, and indicated that RprY can act as an activator and a repressor. RprY positively activated the primary sodium pump, NADH : ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NQR), and RprY protein also interacted with the promoter regions of nqrA genes from B. fragilis and Vibrio cholerae. Given that gingival bleeding and infiltration of host defence cells are symptoms of periodontal infection, iron products released from blood and reactive oxygen species from polymorphonuclear leucocytes may be potential inducers of the RprY regulon.
