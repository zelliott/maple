Antagonists, but not agonists, of the 5-HT3 receptor are useful therapeutic agents, and it is possible that partial agonists may also be potentially useful in the clinic. Here we show that 5-fluorotryptamine (5-FT) is a partial agonist at both 5-HT3A and 5-HT3AB receptors with an Rmax (Imax/Imax 5-HT) of 0.64 and 0.45 respectively. It is about 10 fold less potent than 5-HT: EC50=16 and 27 microM, and Ki for displacement of [3H]granisetron binding=0.8 and 1.8 microM for 5-HT3A and 5-HT3AB receptors respectively. We have also explored the potencies and efficacies of tryptamine and a range of 5-substituted tryptamine derivatives. At 5-HT3A receptors tryptamine is a weak (Rmax=0.15), low affinity (EC50=113 microM; Ki=4.8 microM) partial agonist, while 5-chlorotryptamine has a similar affinity to 5-FT (EC50=8.1 microM; Ki=2.7 microM) but is a very weak partial agonist (Rmax=0. 0037). These, and data from 5-methyltryptamine and 5-methoxytryptamine, reveal the importance of size and electronegativity at this location for efficient channel opening.
