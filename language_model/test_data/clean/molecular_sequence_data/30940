Platelet GPIIbIIIa is only synthesized in megakaryocyte or in cell lines with megakaryocytic features. The sequence for GPIIb and GPIIIa have recently been derived from cDNAs obtained from HEL cells. The sequence of these proteins produced by the megakaryocyte, has however, not been determined yet. This study describes full length cDNAs for GPIIb and GPIIIa isolated from megakaryocyte cDNA libraries. The cDNA sequences indicate the presence of nucleotide differences, between the sequence of the GPIIIa cDNAs from HEL cells, endothelial cells and megakaryocytes. One difference was also observed between HEL and megakaryocyte GPIIb at position 633 where a cysteine in the megakaryocyte GPIIb, is replaced by a serine in the HEL sequence. The mRNA species for GPIIb (3.4 kb) and GPIIIa (6.1 kb) were of the same size in HEL cells and human megakaryocytes.
