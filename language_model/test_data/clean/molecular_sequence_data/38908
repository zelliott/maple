We have cloned three novel histone genes using antibodies that recognize only nuclei of the male gametic (generative and sperm) cells of Lilium longiflorum. The deduced amino acid sequence of each clone shows only between 40% and 50% identity with the H2A, H2B and H3 somatic core histones of other plant species. Transcripts of these genes were first detected in bicellular pollen soon after microspore mitosis, and their mRNAs, as revealed by in situ hybridization, were observed only in the cytoplasm of the generative cells. As expression of these three genes was specific to generative cells within the bicellular pollen, we designated the clones gH2A, gH2B and gH3. Immunocytochemistry further revealed that the proteins encoded by these genes accumulated in the elongating and condensing generative nucleus during development of bicellular pollen, and were most abundant in the two sperm nuclei within an elongated pollen tube. We therefore propose that these male gamete-specific core histones contribute to chromatin condensation of male gametes or to chromatin remodeling, and result in the repression of gene expression in male gametes.
