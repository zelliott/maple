The direct interaction of Mekabu fucoidan (meFucoidan) with four functional basic proteins (sPLA2-IIA, bFGF, histone H2B and HBV core protein) and three synthetic FGF-BP peptides (sp5, GE13 and RS6) was characterized in vitro. It was found that (i) meFucoidan inhibited dose-dependently the activity of sPLA2-IIA, but not pPLA2, through its direct binding to the enzyme; (ii) sPLA2-IIA activity was sensitive to meFucoidan rather than heparin, but significantly stimulated by sulfatide; (iii) the A-kinase-mediated phosphorylation of these basic proteins, except sPLA2-IIA, and synthetic peptides, containing potent phosphorylation sites for A-kinase, was inhibited dose-dependently by meFucoidan; and (iv) two consensus meFucoidan-binding motifs (B-B-B-B-X and B-X-B-B-X; B, basic amino acid) in these basic proteins and synthetic peptides could be overlapping to the potent phosphorylation site (B-B-X-S/T) for the kinase in vitro. These results presented here suggest that meFucoidan functions as a selective inhibitor for sPLA2-IIA and the A-kinase-mediated phosphorylation of cellular meFucoidan-binding functional basic proteins in vitro.
