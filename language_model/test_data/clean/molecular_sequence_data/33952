Although IncP-1 plasmids are important for horizontal gene transfer among bacteria, in particular antibiotic resistance spread, so far only three plasmids from the subgroup IncP-1α have been completely sequenced. In this study we doubled this number. The three IncP-1α plasmids pB5, pB11 and pSP21 were isolated from bacteria of two different sewage treatment plants and sequenced by a combination of next-generation and capillary sequencing technologies. A comparative analysis including the previously analysed IncP-1α plasmids RK2, pTB11 and pBS228 revealed a highly conserved plasmid backbone (at least 99.9% DNA sequence identity) comprising 54 core genes. The accessory elements of the plasmid pB5 constitute a class 1 integron interrupting the parC gene and an IS6100 copy inserted into the integron. In addition, the tetracycline resistance genes tetAR and the ISTB11-like element are located between the klc operon and the trfA-ssb operon. Plasmid pB11 is loaded with a Tn5053-like mercury resistance transposon between the parCBA and parDE operons and contains tetAR that are identical to those identified in plasmid pB5 and the insertion sequence ISSP21. Plasmid pSP21 harbours an ISPa7 element in a Tn402 transposon including a class 1 integron between the partitioning genes parCBA and parDE. The IS-element ISSP21 (99.89% DNA sequence identity to ISSP21 from pB11), inserted downstream of the tetR gene and a copy of ISTB11 (identical to ISTB11 on pTB11) inserted between the genes pncA and pinR. On all three plasmids the accessory genes are almost always located between the backbone modules confirming the importance of the backbone functions for plasmid maintenance. The striking backbone conservation among the six completely sequenced IncP-1α plasmids is in contrast to the much higher diversity within the IncP-1β subgroup.
