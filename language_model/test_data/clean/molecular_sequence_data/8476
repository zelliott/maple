To determine if somatic mtDNA mutations might contribute to the neurodegeneration observed in Huntington's disease (HD), we quantitated the amount of the common mitochondrial 4977 nucleotide pair deletion (mtDNA4977) in cortex and putamen of HD patients and age-matched controls by the serial dilution-polymerase chain reaction method. Cortical deletion levels were analyzed in the temporal, frontal, and occipital lobes. HD temporal lobes had an 11-fold greater mean mtDNA4977 deletion level than age-matched controls, and HD frontal lobes had fivefold greater levels. HD occipital lobe and putamen deletion levels were comparable with control levels. These results support the hypothesis that HD is associated with elevated cortical mtDNA damage.
