Mycobacterium triplex, a recently described, potentially pathogenic species, caused disease primarily in immunocompromised patients. We report a case of pulmonary infection due to this mycobacterium in an immunocompetent patient and review the characteristics of two other cases. In our experience, Mycobacterium triplex pulmonary infection is unresponsive to antimycobacterial chemotherapy.
