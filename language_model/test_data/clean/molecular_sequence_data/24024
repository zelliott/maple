Plant growth and productivity are greatly affected by water stress, such as drought and salinity. Here we report on the cloning and expression analysis of a water stress-induced gene from Brassica oleracea (designated as BoWS, GenBank accession number AY571333) by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length cDNA of BoWS consisted of 594 bp and contained a 285 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 95-amino-acid protein. The deduced protein had a calculated molecular mass of 10.53 kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.93. The sequence similarity and comparative analysis showed that BoWS was 84% identical to Arabidopsis thaliana putative water stress-induced protein (GenBank accession number AAM67282). Southern blot analysis indicated that BoWS was a low-copy gene. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of BoWS was upregulated by abscisic acid (ABA), mannitol, NaCl, drought, salicylic acid (SA) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Our results indicate that BoWS is extremely related to the water-deficit stress in B. oleracea.
