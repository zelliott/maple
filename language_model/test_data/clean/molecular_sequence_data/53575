Intact keratan sulfate chains derived from bovine tracheal cartilage have been examined using both one-dimensional methods and the two-dimensional experiments COSY-45 and TOCSY for homonuclear shift correlations and a modified COLOC (correlated spectroscopy for long-range couplings) approach for 13C-1H shift correlations. Partial 1H and 13C NMR signal assignments for residues within the intact polymer chain are reported; data derived from the repeat region signals and from chain cap residues are assigned by comparison with published data derived from oligosaccharides obtained through cleavage of keratan sulfate polymer chains using keratanase and keratanase II and are discussed in detail. The one-dimensional spectra for both 1H and 13C nuclei contain highly crowded signal clusters for which data analysis is not directly possible. COSY-45 analysis allow the correlation and assignment of many proton resonances located within the 3.4-4.8 p.p.m. chemical shift region while from the C/H correlation spectrum data are assignable for some signals within the complex set of carbon resonances which fall in the region between 68 and 86 p.p.m., This work using material from tracheal cartilage has permitted the first detailed combined 1H and 13C NMR examination of the primary keratan sulfate polymer structure; this sequence forms the basis for the more complex members of the keratan sulfate family present in other tissues such as articular cartilage and cornea where further residues such as (alpha1-3)-linked fucose and (alpha2-6)-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid are also present. This nondestructive method of analysis complements the currently available degradative methods for structure determination which may then subsequently be utilized.
