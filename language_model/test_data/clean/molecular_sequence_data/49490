The transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels are thought to be involved in the entry of calcium ion into cells. In this study, we isolated a cDNA clone, HrTRPV, that shows high homology to Caenorhabditis elegans OSM-9, a TRPV subfamily member of the TRP family, from a Halocynthia roretzi fertilized egg cDNA library. We analyzed its properties using HrTRPV-transfected cells. Upon reduction of extracellular osmolarity, the intracellular calcium concentration was found to increase in HrTRPV-transfected cells. This increase in intracellular calcium concentration was dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium ion and was inhibited by treatment with gadolinium ion, a stretch-activated calcium channel blocker. Thus, these results indicate that ascidian egg HrTRPV is an osmotically sensitive TRP channel.
