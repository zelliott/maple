A search for new members of the mammalian interspersed repeat (MIR) family has been done over the coding regions of human genome from GenBank-116. Only 254 nucleotide sequences contained MIRs in coding regions, of which 45 MIR copies were unknown before, including 17 that occurred in translated gene regions. The program developed by the authors has been demonstrated to surpass the CENSOR program in the search power. The evolution of the MIR copies located in translated regions of human genome is discussed.
