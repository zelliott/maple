The present experiments describe the endothelin-1 (ET-1) antagonist activity of BQ123 (cyclic D-Asp-L-Pro-D-Val-L-Leu-D-Trp) in conscious Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, and we also examined the effect blockade of ETA receptors had on blood pressure in four experimental models of hypertension. Rats were anesthetized with methoxyflurane and instrumented with femoral arterial and venous catheters. In SD rats, BQ123 (0.1-10.0 mg/kg i.v.) administered 5 or 60 min prior to ET-1 inhibited both the magnitude and duration of the ET-1 (0.25 nmol/kg i.v.) pressor response. In addition, BQ123 (10.0 mg/kg) inhibited the pressor response evoked by administration of the ET-1 precursor, proendothelin-1 (1.0 nmol/kg). However, BQ123 (10.0 mg/kg) had no effect on the pressor response evoked by ET-3 (0.75 nmol/kg). In Wistar-Kyoto rats, BQ123 (10.0 mg/kg) reversed the hypertension produced by an infusion of ET-1 (0.01 nmol/kg/min). Administration of BQ123 produced a mild antihypertensive effect in normal- to low-renin models of hypertension, but no blood pressure lowering was observed in high-renin models of hypertension. These studies demonstrated the selectivity of the ETA receptor antagonist, BQ123 for ET-1, but not ET-3-induced pressor responses. Furthermore, ET-1 does not appear to be a major contributing factor to the maintenance of elevated levels of blood pressure in four experimental models of hypertension.
