Evidence that membrane-bound and extracellular heat shock proteins (HSPs) with molecular weights of 70 and 90 kDa are potent stimulators of the immune responses has accumulated over the last decade. In this review, we discuss the modulation of Hsp70 expression, a major stress-inducible member of the HSP70 family, in the cytoplasm and on the plasma membrane of tumor cells by clinically applied interventions such as radio- and chemotherapy.
