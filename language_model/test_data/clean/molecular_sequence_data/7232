The Entamoeba histolytica 27-kDa cysteine proteinases exhibit striking binding specificities for immobilized laminin over other components of the extracellular matrix, such as collagen and fibronectin. Inactivation of the proteinase with the active-site inhibitor L-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane abolishes laminin binding by the enzyme, and conversely, laminin inhibits cleavage of a fluorogenic dipeptide substrate of the amebic cysteine proteinase, suggesting that the substrate binding pocket of the enzyme is involved in the binding of laminin. The addition of laminin but not fibronectin or collagen to E. histolytica trophozoites significantly reduces amebic liver abscess formation in severe combined immunodeficient mice, further supporting the hypothesis that E. histolytica cysteine proteinases play an important role in amebic pathogenesis. The specific interaction of amebic proteinases with laminin may be exploited in designing new inhibitors of these enzymes.
