This communication describes DNAView, a graphical tool for the visualization and printing of large nucleic acid sequences. DNAView uses color coding to compactly display genomic segments of up to 100 kb on a single printed page. The specific color schemes integrated into DNAView can highlight 'local aggregate' properties of large segments of DNA. We have also incorporated a confidence expression for the assigned sequence. This is represented by base color intensity that is proportional to the number of times that base was sequenced. Areas of interest, such as exons, introns, repetitive elements and splice sites, can be emphasized using overlays. The colored image can be saved in a standard TIFF image file format that may be imported and annotated by other application software.
