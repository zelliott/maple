TnphoA mutagenesis identified an open reading frame, roa307, immediately upstream of the partition locus qsopAB on the Coxiella burnetii plasmid QpH1. The protein sequence deduced from roa307 displayed homology to Orf290 of Pseudomonas putida, Orf283 and Orf282 (SpoOJ) of Bacillus subtilis-hypothetical products of genes in the chromosomal replication origin region. Expression of roa307 was demonstrated by PhoA activity of an Roa307-PhoA fusion.
