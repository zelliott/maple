The haploid genome of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum contains at least 18 gene copies coding for a tRNAGlu(GAA). Using a combination of parasexual genetic analysis and molecular biology techniques, 14 of the 18 individual members of this gene family could be assigned to particular linkage groups. According ot this analysis four tRNAGlu genes are located on group I (C, H, I, K), two genes on group II (D,J), seven genes on either group III or VI (A, B, E, F, L, M, N), and one gene on group VII (G). Eight of the tRNAGlu(GAA) genes have been cloned and characterized. All genes are identical in that part of the gene which corresponds to the mature tRNA, thus representing true nonallelic members of this gene family. Different members of this gene family can be distinguished from each other because they reside on restriction fragments of different lengths and because each gene contains unique 5'- and 3'-flanking regions. Nevertheless, a certain degree of sequence conservation within these flanking regions is apparent for members of this gene family. According to in vivo expression analyses of individual genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, all isolated tRNAGlu(GAA) copies represent functional transcription units.
