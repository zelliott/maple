Glucokinase is inhibited in the liver by a regulatory protein (GKRP) whose effects are increased by Fru-6-P and suppressed by Fru-1-P. To identify the binding site of these phosphate esters, we took advantage of the homology of GKRP to the isomerase domain of GlmS (glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase) and created 12 different mutants of rat GKRP. Mutations of three residues predicted to bind to Fru-6-P resulted in proteins that were approximately 5-fold (S110A) and 50-fold (S179A and K514A) less potent as inhibitors of glucokinase and had an at least 100-fold reduced affinity for the effectors. Mutation of another residue of the putative binding site (T109A) resulted in a 10-fold decrease in the inhibitory power and an inversion of the effect of sorbitol-6-P, a Fru-6-P analog. The replacement of Gly(107), a residue close to the binding site, by cysteine (as in GlmS and Xenopus GKRP) resulted in a protein that had 20 times more affinity for Fru-6-P and 30 times less affinity for Fru-1-P. These results are consistent with GKRP having one single binding site for phosphate esters. They also show that a missense mutation of GKRP can lead to a gain of function.
