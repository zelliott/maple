In this paper, we characterize the novel human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DPB1*2402 allele that we found in a patient suffering from acne vulgaris. In comparison to the closest related allele DPB1*0401, HLA-DPB1*2402 has a single nucleotide exchange at position 115 (202), T replaces G. In consequence, codon 39 (68) TAC encodes for tyrosine in the novel allele instead of aspartic acid 39 (68) GAC in DPB1*0401.
