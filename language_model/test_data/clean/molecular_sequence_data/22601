Although gammadelta T cells are a common feature of many pathogen-induced immune responses, the factors that influence, promote, or regulate the response of individual gammadelta T-cell subsets to infection is unknown. Here we show that in the absence of Vgamma1+ T cells, novel subsets of gammadelta T cells, expressing T-cell receptor (TCR)-Vgamma chains that normally define TCRgammadelta+ dendritic epidermal T cells (DETCs) (Vgamma5+), intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (iIELs) (Vgamma7+), and lymphocytes associated with the vaginal epithelia (Vgamma6+), are recruited to the spleen in response to bacterial infection in TCR-Vgamma1-/- mice. By comparison of phenotype and structure of TCR-Vgamma chains and/or -Vdelta chains expressed by these novel subsets with those of their epithelium-associated counterparts, the Vgamma6+ T cells elicited in infected Vgamma1-/- mice were shown to be identical to those found in the reproductive tract, from where they are presumably recruited in the absence of Vgamma1+ T cells. By contrast, Vgamma5+ and Vgamma7+ T cells found in infected Vgamma1-/- mice were distinct from Vgamma5+ DETCs and Vgamma7+ iIELs. Functional analyses of the novel gammadelta T-cell subsets identified for infected Vgamma1-/- mice showed that whereas the Vgamma5+ and Vgamma7+ subsets may compensate for the absence of Vgamma1+ T cells by producing similar cytokines, they do not possess cytocidal activity and they cannot replace the macrophage homeostasis function of Vgamma1+ T cells. Collectively, these findings identify novel subsets of gammadelta T cells, the recruitment and activity of which is under the control of Vgamma1+ T cells.
