The Ets1 transcription factor is a member of the Ets protein family, a group of evolutionarily related DNA-binding transcriptional factors. Ets proteins activate or repress the expression of genes that are involved in various biological processes, including cellular proliferation, differentiation, development, transformation and apoptosis. FOXO1 is a member of the forkhead-box proteins (FOX proteins), which comprise a large family of functionally diverse transcription factors involved in cellular proliferation, transformation and differentiation. The FOXO subgroup of FOX proteins regulates the transcription of genes that control metabolism, cell survival, cellular proliferation, DNA damage responses, stress resistance and longevity. The DNA-binding domains (DBDs) of Ets1 and FOXO1 were crystallized in complex with DNA containing a composite sequence for a noncanonical forkhead binding site (AATAACA) and an ETS site (GGAA), FOX:ETS, by the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method. The FOX:ETS motif has been shown to be a conserved cis-acting element in several endothelial cell-specific genes, including Vegfr2, Tie2, Mef2c and ve-cadherin. Crystals were grown at 291 K using 30% polyethylene glycol 400, 50 mM Tris pH 8.5, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2 as the reservoir solution. The crystals belonged to space group C222(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 68.7, b = 104.9, c = 136.3 Å. Diffraction data were collected to a resolution of 2.2 Å.
