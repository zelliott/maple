Ten site-specific mutants of pea apophytochrome A were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and analyzed for chromophore assembly with apoprotein and photoreversible absorbance changes. The mutants constitute two specific changes for each of five conserved amino acid residues located in the microenvironment of the chromophore attachment residue, which is Cys-323 in pea phytochrome A. All mutant apophytochromes were autocatalytically able to covalently attach phycocyanobilin, indicating that there were no major structural perturbations in the apoproteins. However, the rate of chromophore ligation varied significantly among the mutants. Spectrally, the mutant holophytochromes are of three types: mutant phytochromes that are indistinguishable from the wild-type adduct, mutants with blue-shifted Pr and Pfr absorption maxima compared to the wild-type adduct, and mutants that are not photoreversible. From an analysis of the results, we concluded that the residues Asp-309, Arg-318, His-321, and Gln-326 are probably not catalytically involved in the chromophore ligation reaction, but some residues may play significant structural and stereochemical roles. Arg-318 might anchor the chromophore, as has been suggested [Partis, M. D., & Grimm, R. (1990) Z. Naturforsch, 45c, 987-998; Parker, W., et al. (1993) Bioconjugate Chem. (in press)]. The conserved Gln-326, three residues downstream from the chromophore attachment site, is not electrostatically critical for the spectral integrity and photoreversibility of phytochrome, but this residue is sterically important to the lyase activity. It appears that the role of the five amino acid residues in the N- and C-terminal vicinities of the chromophore binding Cys-323 is structural rather than catalytic for the ligation reaction.
