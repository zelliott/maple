Retinoid X Receptor beta (RXRB) is a member of the retinoid X receptor (RXR) family of nuclear receptors which are involved in mediating the effects of retinoic acid (RA). We have confirmed the localization of RXRB to chromosome 6 and we have mapped the gene to chromosome 6p21.3-p21.1 by PCR amplification of 5' untranslated sequence in panels of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids and to 6p21.3 by fluorescent in situ hybridization.
