Positional-scanning combinatorial libraries of fluorescence resonance energy transfer peptides were used for the analyses of the S(3) to S(1)' subsites of the somatic angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). Substrate specificity of ACE catalytic domains (C- and N-domains) was assessed in an effort to design selective substrates for the C-domain. Initially, we defined the S(1) specificity by preparing a library with the general structure Abz-GXXZXK(Dnp)-OH [Abz = o-aminobenzoic acid, K(Dnp) = N(epsilon)-2,4-dinitrophenyllysine, and X is a random residue], where Z was successively occupied with one of the 19 natural amino acids with the exception of Cys. The peptides containing Arg and Leu in the P(1) position had higher C-domain selectivity. In the sublibraries Abz-GXXRZK(Dnp)-OH, Abz-GXZRXK(Dnp)-OH, and Abz-GZXRXK(Dnp)-OH, Arg was fixed at P(1) so we could define the C-domain selectivity of the S(1)', S(2), and S(3) subsites. On the basis of the results from these libraries, we synthesized peptides Abz-GVIRFK(Dnp)-OH and Abz-GVILFK(Dnp)-OH which contain the most favorable residues for C-domain selectivity. Systematic reduction of the length of these two peptides resulted in Abz-LFK(Dnp)-OH, which demonstrated the highest selectivity for the recombinant ACE C-domain (k(cat)/K(m) = 36.7 microM(-1) s(-1)) versus the N-domain (k(cat)/K(m) = 0.51 microM(-1) s(-1)). The substrate binding of Abz-LFK(Dnp)-OH with testis ACE using a combination of conformational analysis and molecular docking was examined, and the results shed new light on the binding characteristics of the enzyme.
