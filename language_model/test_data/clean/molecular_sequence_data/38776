A new satellite DNA family, named pMaE, has been cloned from the genome of the phytoparasitic nematode, Meloidogyne arenaria (Nematoda: Tylenchida). It is represented as tandemly repeated sequences with a monomeric unit of 172 bp. The monomers are present at approximately 15700 copies per haploid genome, and represent about 5.3% of the total genomic DNA. Twenty-seven independent monomers have been cloned and sequenced. The deduced consensus sequence is 70.9% A + T rich, with frequent stretches of A and (or) T. Several direct or inverted sub-repeats are present in the sequence, which may allow the formation of a dyad structure, suggesting some potential role of this repetitive sequence in heterochromatin condensation. The monomers are very homogeneous in sequence, showing on average 1.8% divergence from their consensus sequence. Moreover, Southern blot experiments and sequence analysis of homologous monomers from the genome of geographically distinct M. arenaria populations have shown that this satellite DNA is uniformly distributed and highly conserved within the species. Therefore, it is hypothesized that this unusually low level of variability, either within the genome of a given population or between populations, could be achieved as the result of some highly effective homogenization mechanism acting upon the nematode genome.
