The complete nucleotide sequence of tomato infectious chlorosis virus (TICV) was determined and compared with those of other members of the genus Crinivirus. RNA 1 is 8,271 nucleotides long with three open reading frames and encodes proteins involved in replication. RNA 2 is 7,913 nucleotides long and encodes eight proteins common within the genus Crinivirus that are involved in genome protection, movement and other functions yet to be identified. Similarity between TICV and other criniviruses varies throughout the genome but TICV is related more closely to lettuce infectious yellows virus than to any other crinivirus, thus identifying a third group within the genus.
