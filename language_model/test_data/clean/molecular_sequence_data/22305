Although cellular receptors for immunoglobulins were first identified nearly 40 years ago, their central role in the immune response was discovered only in the last decade. They are key players in both the afferent and efferent phase of an immune response, setting thresholds for B cell activation, regulating the maturation of dendritic cells, and coupling the exquisite specificity of the antibody response to innate effector pathways, such as phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells. Moreover, because of their general presence as receptor pairs consisting of activating and inhibitory molecules on the same cell, they have become a paradigm for studying the balance of positive and negative signals that ultimately determine the outcome of an immune response. This review will summarize recent results in Fc-receptor biology with an emphasis on data obtained in in vivo model systems.
