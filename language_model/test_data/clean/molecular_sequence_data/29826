Five major regions of sequence diversity between strains (V1-V5) have been described in the caprine arthritis-encephalitis lentivirus (CAEV) envelope surface unit glycoprotein (SU). To determine which of these variable regions is important in persistent infection in vivo, we evaluated SU sequence diversity in five neutralization variants from two goats and proviral DNA from five additional goats infected with CAEV-63 for up to 7 years. Overall amino acid sequence divergence in the SU encoded by provirus and neutralization variants compared to parental CAEV-63 ranged from 1.1 to 4%. However, most of the amino acid substitutions and all of the deletions and insertions were present in two discrete regions designated HV1 and HV2. The HV2 region was variable in all neutralization variants and provirus sequences from most animals. This region overlapped the V4 domain of CAEV SU and the neutralization domain of the closely related ovine maedi-visna lentivirus. HV1 was located in a region of SU strictly conserved in all small ruminant lentivirus strains except CAEV-63. This region only varied in a subset of neutralization variants and proviruses, all derived from goats with arthritis. In contrast, sequences in the V1,V2,V3, and V5 regions were stable in neutralization variants and proviruses from infected goats, indicating that sequence diversity between strains in these regions is not due to selection of variants in persistently infected animals. Our results define two discrete regions of CAEV SU that undergo rapid sequence variation in persistently infected goats which may have important roles in virus-host interactions.
