The protease, reverse transcriptase (RT), and envelope (env) genes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) clinical isolates from 13 immigrants (mainly of African origin) living in Spain were examined. Phylogenetic analyses were performed, taking as reference a panel of 25 HIV-1 sequences representing various subtypes. A discrepant topology was recognized in comparing the protease, RT, and/or env phylogenetic trees in 10 isolates, in which sequences clustering in 2 or 3 different HIV-1 subtypes were found. In eight of these strains, the discrepant region was env with respect to concordant pol genes. Five of nine patients harboring subtype G sequences at the protease and RT genes showed discrepant env sequences, being subtype A (three) or B (two). In addition, one recombinant H/A strain, one recombinant H/B isolate, and a triple recombinant, A/D/C, variant were found. This work represents the first phylogenetic characterization of HIV-1 recombinant clinical isolates in Spain.
