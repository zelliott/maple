A defined medium with ethanol as sole carbon source was devised for growth of the colorless, unicellular alga Polytomella spp. Cell density on this carbon source was related to extracellular pH. An acidic pH was required for ethanol utilization; best yields were obtained at pH 3.7. Spectroscopic analysis of the cells showed that the concentration of cytochrome c per cell was 40% higher than at pH 6.0; the concentrations of cytochrome a606 (cytochrome c oxidase) and b566 (cytochrome bc1 complex) were the same. A soluble cytochrome c550 was purified from cells grown at pH 3.7 and characterized by peptide sequencing as the 12-kDa cytochrome c550 of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Immunoblots of total cell proteins showed higher accumulation of cytochrome c550 at pH 3.7 than at pH 6.0. RNA blot analysis gave clear evidence of the abundance of c550 transcript in cells grown at pH 3.7. The amount of mitochondrial proteins obtained from cells grown at pH 3.7 was twofold higher than that of cells grown at pH 6.0. Mitochondria isolated from both cell types readily oxidized succinate, malate or ethanol. The rates of oxygen uptake were 20-25% higher in mitochondria from cells grown at pH 3.7. Cyanide and antimycin A inhibited respiration with succinate up to 95% in both types of mitochondria. The participation of cytochrome c550 in mitochondrial electron transport from succinate to oxygen was shown by spectral measurements.
