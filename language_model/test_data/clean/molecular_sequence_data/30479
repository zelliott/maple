We describe a simple protocol for introducing random point mutations into cloned DNA fragments via forced misincorporation of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) by either of two polymerases which lack proofreading activity, reverse transcriptase or a mutant T7 DNA polymerase. A high ratio of one nucleotide to the other three is used to enhance the error rate. Mutagenesis is initiated from a specific primer and restricted to a relatively short segment by limiting the amounts of the nonmutagenic dNTPs. Our method is highly efficient, resulting in the isolation of greater than 50% mutant plasmids with most polymerase/forcing dNTP combinations. A wide spectrum of mutations can be obtained, in contrast to commonly used methods for random mutagenesis.
