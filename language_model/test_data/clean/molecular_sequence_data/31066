Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) is associated with satellite (sat) RNAs (sat-RNA D, sat-RNA F), defective interfering (DI) RNAs (DI RNA G, DI1 RNA), and one RNA with properties of both sat-RNAs and DI RNAs (sat-RNA C). When plants were inoculated with TCV, sat-RNA D and in vitro sat-RNA C transcripts containing non-viable mutations in the 5' domain, recombinant sat-RNAs were recovered. These recombinants were composed of sat-RNA D at the 5' end and sat-RNA C sequences at the 3' end. Analysis of 20 independent recombination junctions revealed that unequal crossing-over had occurred in planta in a region of sequence similarity between the two sat-RNAs which resulted in the duplication of 3-16 nucleotides. Thirty percent of the sat-RNA recombinants also had one to three additional nucleotides inserted at the crossover junctions which did not correspond to either sat-RNA C or sat-RNA D sequence. The right side of the recombination junctions always began with one of three consecutive nucleotides of sat-RNA C. Based on the similarity between this sequence of sat-RNA C, the right side junction of DI RNA G and the 5' end of TCV, as well as the sequence similarity between right side junctions of DI1 RNA and sat-RNA C and the 5' end of the sat-RNAs, a replicase-driven copy choice mechanism is proposed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
