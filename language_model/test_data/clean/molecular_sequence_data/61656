A novel marker for the early stages of nodulation of Sesbania rostrata was found to encode a putative member of the Kunitz family of protease inhibitors (SrPI1). Its expression was enhanced during nodulation, and was not up-regulated by wounding or upon infection with wide host-range pathogens. In situ expression patterns resembled those previously described for functions that may be implicated in delimiting infected nodule tissues from the rest of the plant. Thus, SrPI1 may be a component of a multi-layered barrier that restrains the invading rhizobia.
