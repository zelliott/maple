Peptides of the FXRFamide family, where X = M, I or L, are broadly distributed among invertebrates. Two such peptides were purified and sequenced from the free-living nematode, Panagrellus redivivus. Immunohistochemical techniques localized FMRFamide-like material in several regions of these organisms, including the nerve cords and, most prominently, in paired groups of cells located caudally to the base of the pharynx. RIA determinations gave an estimate of 2.8 nmol immunoreactive peptide/g of an acetone extract of P. redivivus. Four sequential HPLC purification steps, followed by sequencing by automated Edman degradation and FAB-MS, led to the identification of Ser-Asp-Pro-Asn-Phe-Leu-Arg-Phe-amide (SDPNFLRFamide) and Ser-Ala-Asp-Pro-Asn-Phe-Leu-Arg-Phe-amide (SADPNFLRFamide) as members of the FXRFamide family in this nematode.
