A soluble derivative of the Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 class A PBP1 (*PBP1) was overproduced and purified. It exhibited a glycosyltransferase activity on the Escherichia coli 14C-labeled lipid II precursor. As a DD- peptidase, it could hydrolyze thiolester substrates with efficiencies similar to those of other class A penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and bind beta-lactams, but with k2/K (a parameter accounting for the acylation step efficiency) values characteristic of penicillin-resistant PBPs.
