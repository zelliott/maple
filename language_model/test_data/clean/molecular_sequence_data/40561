Bonamia ostreae is an intrahaemocytic protozoan affecting Ostrea edulis. The parasite multiplies within haemocytes without being degraded and involves changes in cellular activities. Studies aiming at better understanding host response to a pathogen at the transcriptome levels are frequently based on the use of real time PCR assays, which require some reference genes. However, very few sequence data is available for O. edulis in public databases. Subtracted cDNA libraries were constructed from the O. edulis haemocytes in order to identify genes involved in host reactions against the parasite and quantitative real time PCR assays were developed to study expression of these genes. In this context, identification of reference genes and study of their relative expression stability were required for quantitative real time PCR normalization. The expression of 5 potential candidate reference genes from O. edulis (ie elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1-α), 60S ribosomal protein L5 (L5), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH), polyubiquitin (Ubiq) and β-actin (ACT)) was studied using RNAs extracted from pools of haemocytes in contact with the parasite B. ostreae and haemocytes alone. Gene expression was quantified by real time PCR and expression stability was analysed with two analytical approaches GeNorm and NormFinder. GAPDH and EF1-α were identified as the most stable genes with the GeNorm analysis. Whatever were the tested conditions, EF1-α was also found as the most stable gene using Normfinder. The less stable gene was β-actin although this gene is commonly used as housekeeping gene in many studies. Our results suggest using GAPDH and EF1-α combined as reference genes when studying expression levels in haemocytes of O. edulis. In addition, the complete ORF of these two genes was characterized.
