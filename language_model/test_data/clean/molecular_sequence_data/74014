The evolutionary relationships of ribosomal proteins from eubacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, chloroplasts and mitochondria were examined by their degree of conservation, their structural and functional properties and by the occurrence of conserved structural elements. The structural domains formed by the different protein families were studied. The occurrence of monophyletic groups was investigated for each protein family within the archaea. Phylogenetic trees were constructed between these organisms and together with the homologous sequences of the other phylogenetic domains. All organisms belonging to the archaea clearly formed a monophyletic group. The conserved sequence motifs were checked for the potential to form similar secondary structural elements.
