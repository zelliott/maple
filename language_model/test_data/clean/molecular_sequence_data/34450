The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strains closely related to, but excluded from, Haemophilus influenzae was investigated and a conspicuously high number of polymorphic nucleotide positions due to intragenomic 16S rRNA gene heterogeneity was observed. The average frequency of 16S rRNA gene polymorphic nucleotide positions in 31 variant strains was 7.0Ã—10(-3), which is approximately ten times the level observed in validated strains of H. influenzae. Sixty-seven polymorphic nucleotide positions in seven strains most likely originated from the simultaneous presence of two distinct types of helix 18 as a consequence of prior recombinatorial events. The increased level of 16S rRNA gene polymorphism in commensal taxa excluded from the pathogenic species H. influenzae is unexplained. The heterogeneity imposes difficulties on rRNA gene-based classification and systematics.
