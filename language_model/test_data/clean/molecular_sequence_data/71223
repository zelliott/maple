The four Trp dipoles in the gramicidin A (gA) channel modulate channel conductance, and their side chain conformations should therefore be important, but the energies of different conformations are unknown. A conformational search for the right-handed helix based on molecular mechanics in vacuo yielded 46 conformations within 20 kcal/mol of the lowest energy conformation. The two lowest energy conformations correspond to the solid-state and solution-state NMR conformations, suggesting that interactions within the peptide determine the conformation. For representative conformations, the electrostatic potential of the Trp side chains on the channel axis was computed. A novel application of the image-series method of. Biophys. J. 9:1160-1170) was introduced to simulate the polarization of bulk water by the Trp side chains. For the experimentally observed structures, the CHARm toph19 potential energy (PE) of a cation in the channel center is -1.65 kcal/mol without images. With images, the PE is -1.9 kcal/mol, demonstrating that the images further enhance the direct dipole effect. Nonstandard conformations yielded less favorable PEs by 0.4-1.1 kcal/mol.
