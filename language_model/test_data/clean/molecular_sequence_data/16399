A cDNA encoding the first mollusk member of the PAR subfamily of bZIP transcription factors has been characterized in the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. The sequence of the cDNA predicts a protein of 260 amino acids that has 41-50% identity with the PAR domain, 72-79% identity with the basic DNA-binding domain and 34-56% identity with the leucine zipper domain of other members of the PAR subfamily. Polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription indicates that this gene is expressed during developmental stages from an unfertilized egg to a juvenile. It was demonstrated by northern hybridization that the gene is also expressed on several adult tissues. The identification of a novel member of the PAR subfamily bZIP genes in mollusks may help to identify common functions that have been conserved through evolution and to elucidate evolutionary relationships within this subfamily of proteins.
