Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is used worldwide to prevent neutropenia caused by high-dose chemotherapy. It has limited stability, strict formulation and storage requirements, and because of poor oral absorption must be administered by injection (typically daily). Thus, there is significant interest in developing analogs with improved pharmacological properties. We used our ultrahigh throughput computational screening method to improve the physicochemical characteristics of G-CSF. Improving these properties can make a molecule more robust, enhance its shelf life, or make it more amenable to alternate delivery systems and formulations. It can also affect clinically important features such as pharmacokinetics. Residues in the buried core were selected for optimization to minimize changes to the surface, thereby maintaining the active site and limiting the designed protein's potential for antigenicity. Using a structure that was homology modeled from bovine G-CSF, core designs of 25-34 residues were completed, corresponding to 10(21)-10(28) sequences screened. The optimal sequence from each design was selected for biophysical characterization and experimental testing; each had 10-14 mutations. The designed proteins showed enhanced thermal stabilities of up to 13 degrees C, displayed five-to 10-fold improvements in shelf life, and were biologically active in cell proliferation assays and in a neutropenic mouse model. Pharmacokinetic studies in monkeys showed that subcutaneous injection of the designed analogs results in greater systemic exposure, probably attributable to improved absorption from the subcutaneous compartment. These results show that our computational method can be used to develop improved pharmaceuticals and illustrate its utility as a powerful protein design tool.
