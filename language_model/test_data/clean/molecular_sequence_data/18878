Immunotherapies and vaccines based on the induction of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs) have become outstanding strategies against HIV-1. Diverse bNAbs recognizing different regions of the HIV-1 envelope have been identified and extensively studied. However, there is little information about the thermodynamics of binding of these bNAbs and their epitopes. We used isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize thermodynamically the interactions between bNAb2F5 (in both the IgG and Fab forms) and its functional and core epitope peptides. We found that these interactions are enthalpically driven and opposed by a negative entropy change. The highest affinity was found for 2F5 IgG for its functional epitope, indicating that additional interactions involving residues flanking the core epitope contribute strongly to higher affinity. In addition, the strong influence of the Fc region on the binding affinity suggests long-range allosteric effects within IgG. Our results provide useful information for developing new therapeutics against HIV-1 and, in a broader scope, contribute to a better understanding of antigen-antibody recognition.
