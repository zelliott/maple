Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter regulating light-dark adaptation in the retina. The effect of dopamine is widespread and dependent on the localization of its receptors. We performed single cell RT-PCR on A-type horizontal cells visually selected from dissociated rabbit retinal neurons. Dopamine D1-receptor mRNA was positively identified. Subsequent sequencing of the fragment showed 82% homology with rat D1 receptor and 87% homology with human D1 receptor. This study supported previous observations that dopamine regulated A-type horizontal cell coupling via D1 receptors at the level of transcription.
