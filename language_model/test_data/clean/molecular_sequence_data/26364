Protective immunity against malaria is induced by immunization with irradiation-attenuated sporozoites. Here we report the isolation of cytolytic T-cell (CTL) clones from BALB/c (H-2d) mice immunized with either Plasmodium berghei or Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites. The epitopes recognized by these CTL can be mimicked by synthetic peptides corresponding to a homologous region in the CS proteins of both rodent malaria species. Both peptides are recognized by the CTL in the context of the same MHC class I molecule, H-2 Kd. In vivo adoptive transfer of the CTL clones into non-immune syngeneic mice protected them from a lethal challenge of infectious sporozoites.
