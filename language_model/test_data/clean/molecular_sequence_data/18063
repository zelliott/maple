A cDNA library was constructed from mRNA prepared from light-treated seedlings of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and cDNAs for the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein LHC-II were identified using a pea gene as the heterologous probe. Three cDNA clones were sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences of two of the genes corresponded to Type I and one to Type II LHC-II proteins which were ca. 90% homologous to their angiosperm counterparts. The transit peptides of the Scots pine preLHC-II showed features common to angiosperm transit peptides. The three cDNAs had a 70 to 75% preference for G + C in the third base position. CpG and GpC profiles and degenerate codon position bias suggested that two of the corresponding genes lie within CpG islands.
