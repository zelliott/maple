The gene expression patterns of primordial germ cells (PGCs) and embryonic stem cells were analyzed by a modified serial analysis of gene expression. During the process, we cloned a novel gene, PGC7, which was preferentially expressed in PGCs. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that PGC7 was specifically expressed in early pre-implantation embryos, PGCs and oocytes. These results suggest that PGC7 might play an important role in the development of PGCs and oocytes.
