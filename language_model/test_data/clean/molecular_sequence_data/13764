The eukaryotic DnaJ homologs form a family of proteins with diverse functions. One member of the family, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene zuotin, was isolated for its ability to bind Z-DNA. Here, we have isolated a mouse cDNA called ZRF1 (for zuotin-related factor1) with significant homology to zuotin. The DnaJ domain and candidate phosphorylation sites of zuotin and ZRF1 are highly conserved. ZRF1 gene is localized on chromosome 5. The structural similarity of zuotin and ZRF1 suggests conservation of function of this DnaJ subfamily.
