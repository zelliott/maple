Gene expression in trypanosomatid protozoa is largely regulated posttranscriptionally, e.g., 5' splice leader addition and 3' polyadenylation of mRNAs. We examined these events in Leishmania by mapping the splice sites of the transcripts from two different, but closely linked single-copy genes 2.3 kb apart. The coding regions of the approx. 1 kb upstream gene (P36) and the approx. 1.4 kb downstream gene (NAGT) produce approx. 2 and 3 kb mRNAs, respectively. Both genes were overexpressed in cells that were transfected with this bicistronic unit (> or = 7.5 kb), taking advantage of the NAGT as a selectable marker for tunicamycin-resistance. The transcripts from both genes were spliced constitutively at both ends, irrespective of their episomal or chromosomal expression in both leishmanial stages. Primer extension of the 5' UTRs and S1 nuclease protection of the 3' UTRs initially identified the major splice sites, corresponding to the genomic sequence at -205 bp and + approx. 900 bp of P36, and -1012 bp and + approx. 600 bp of NAGT. These splice sites, consistent with the size of the major transcripts, are among those mapped precisely by sequencing RT-PCR amplified 5' and 3' UTRs. The additional sites mapped by the latter are minor alternatives, especially abundant for transcripts of the downstream NAGT. All these minor splice sites are closer than the major splice sites to the coding region, indicating that the most distant splice sites are preferentially used. This preference creates a 387 bp 'gap' with polypyrimidine tracts in the intergenic region consistent with the model coupling splice leader addition with polyadenylation in pre-mRNA processing. The stage-independence of these events suggests that the 7.5 kb dicistronic unit is suitable for constructing Leishmania-specific constitutive expression vectors.
