The Xenopus laevis fli cDNA, belonging to the ets family of transcription factors, was isolated from a library prepared from unfertilized eggs. It encodes a polypeptide with extensive homology to murine and human Fli proteins. The long 3'-untranslated region contains five nuclear polyadenylation signals and three cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements, as well as many A/T rich elements. Two polyadenylated transcripts appear at the early neurula and accumulate up to the tadpole stage. In situ hybridization reveals an expression in territories invaded by neural crest cells. In the head region, fli is expressed in the peri-ocular zone, in the branchial buds and at the level of the brain floor. In the trunk, a metamerized expression is detected in the dorsum. At a lower level, the tailbud and the peri-cardiac region also appear positive.
