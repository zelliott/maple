We cloned and sequenced feline interleukin-6 (IL-6) cDNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to obtain information on regulation of the IL-6 gene. The feline IL-6 cDNA cloned in this study was 752 bp long and included all the amino acid coding region. At the amino acid level, the overall identities of the feline IL-6 to the human and murine counterparts were 58% and 39%, respectively. After transfection with the expression vector containing the cDNA, CRFK cells produced biologically active proteins that showed hybridoma growth promoting activity.
