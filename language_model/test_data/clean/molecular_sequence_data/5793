The Na+-independent dibasic and neutral amino acid transporter NBAT is among the least hydrophobic of mammalian amino acid transporters. The transporter contains one to four transmembrane domains and induces amino acid transport activity via a b0,+-like system when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. However, the physiological role of NBAT remains unclear. Complementary DNA clones encoding mouse NBAT have now been isolated. The expression of mouse NBAT in Xenopus oocytes also induced an obligatory amino acid exchange activity similar to that of the b0,+-like system. The amount of NBAT mRNA in mouse kidney increased during postnatal development, consistent with the increase in renal cystine and dibasic transport activity. Dietary aspartate induced a marked increase in cystine transport via the b0,+ system in mouse ileum. A high-aspartate diet also increased the amount of NBAT mRNA in mouse ileum. In the ileum of mice fed on the aspartate diet, the extent of cystine transport was further increased by preloading brush border membrane vesicles with lysine. Hybrid depletion of NBAT mRNA from ileal polyadenylated RNA revealed that the increase in cystine transport activity induced by the high-aspartate diet, as measured in Xenopus oocytes, was attributable to NBAT. These results demonstrate that mouse NBAT has an important role in cystine transport.
