Sexual reproduction in ascomycete fungi is governed by the mating-type (MAT) locus. The MAT loci of Diaporthe and its Phomopsis anamorphs differ in only one gene: MAT1-1-1 in mating-type MAT1-1 and MAT1-2-1 in mating-type MAT1-2. In order to diagnose mating-types in Diaporthe and Phomopsis and evaluate their usefulness in teleomorph induction in vitro and biological species delimitation, we designed primers that amplify part of the MAT1-1-1 and MAT1-2-1 genes. MAT phylogenies were generated and compared with ITS and EF1-α phylograms. Species recognised in the EF1-α phylogeny corresponded directly with those determined in the MAT phylogenies. ITS was shown to be highly variable resulting in a large number of phylogenetic species that were discordant with MAT and EF1-α species. Mating experiments were conducted to evaluate the existence of reproductive barriers between some isolates, and their anamorphic morphologies were compared. The primers proved to be useful in the mating-type diagnosis of isolates, selection of compatible mating pairs, and in the assessment of biological species boundaries.
