An alpha-glucosidase was purified in an electrophoretically pure state from an extract of koji culture of Aspergillus sp. KT-11. This enzyme was found to have a transferring activity when the reaction was done in a high concentration of leucrose at pH 4.5. Two kinds of transfer products, fractions I and II, were obtained from leucrose by the enzyme and they were identified as [(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->6)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->6)-alpha-D- glucopyranosyl-(1-->5)-D-fructopyranose] and [alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->6)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->5)-D- fructopyranose], respectively. These are considered to be novel oligosaccharides.
