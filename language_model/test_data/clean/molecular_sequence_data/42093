It is suggested to use short retroposons in the study of phylogenetic relationship between different species. It is likely that the presence of the above mentioned retroposon's copies in different genomes testifies to identical origin of these species. The fact that the genomes of different species include not the same but similar retroposons is considered as evidence for identical phylogenetic origin. A new retroposon was found in genomic DNA of Dipodidae (DIP element). This element has homology with the B2 element of mouse, rat (Muridae) and hamster (Cricetidae). The B2-like elements were not detected in Gliridae and Cavia DNAs, hence we suggest the earlier divergence of these animals from the route leading to Muridae and Cricetidae. The structural analysis of the DIP element supported the role of the nucleotide sequence of 4,5 S(1) RNA in the process of appearing the B2 superfamily of retroposons in Rodents.
