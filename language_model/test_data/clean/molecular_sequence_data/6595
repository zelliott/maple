Anti-proteinase 3 (PR3) and anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) autoantibodies are present in many patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) and microscopic polyarteritis. The aim of this study was to determine whether these antibodies bound to linear peptide sequences on their target antigens. If common linear epitopes were demonstrated, then these could be manufactured and used in diagnostic ELISAs for anti-PR3 and anti-MPO antibodies. In addition, any homology between these epitopes and bacterial or viral sequences might implicate those microorganisms in the development of these antibodies and the pathogenesis of the associated diseases. The presence of linear epitopes on PR3 and MPO was suggested by the binding of the corresponding autoantibodies to these proteins after they had been reduced with beta-mercaptoethanol (beta-ME) and denatured with SDS or boiling, and digested with proteases. Four of the 22 sera with anti-PR3 antibodies bound to PR3 in Western blots after treatment with SDS, beta-ME and boiling for 5 min. Thermal denaturation reduced the amount of binding more than other forms of denaturation. One serum with anti-PR3 antibodies bound to Lys-C and Glu-C-digested PR3 in dot blots. Linear epitopes could not be further defined by their binding in an ELISA using overlapping peptides corresponding to the PR3 molecule because of non-specific binding. Three of the five sera with anti-MPO antibodies bound to MPO in Western blots after treatment with SDS, beta-ME and boiling for 5 min. One serum with anti-MPO antibodies bound to Lys-C and Glu-C-digested MPO in dot blots. Again, linear epitopes could not be further defined using an ELISA with overlapping peptides because of non-specific binding. Some anti-PR3 and anti-MPO antibodies are likely to recognize linear epitopes, but these cannot be defined by use of a PIN ELISA system.
