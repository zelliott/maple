A palindromic element (site B) located between bases -328 and -347 (relative to the start site of transcription) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) was shown in a gel mobility shift assay to bind the human retinoic acid receptors (RARs). Greatly enhanced binding to this site was observed in the presence of both RAR and the retinoid X receptor. Retinoic acid responsiveness in F9 cells could be conferred on a thymidine kinase promoter by the presence of single or multiple copies of site B and responsiveness was abolished when this sequence was mutated to a form that could not bind RARs. However, the presence of this sequence did not render the HIV-1 LTR responsive to retinoic acid in F9 cells.
