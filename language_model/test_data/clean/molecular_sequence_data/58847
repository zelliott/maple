Rat beta-casein gene expression is controlled in part by the positively acting factor Stat5 and the negatively acting factor Yy1. Partial cDNAs encoding the SH2 domain of rat Stat5a and Stat5b and the zinc finger domain of rat Yy1 have been cloned by an RT-PCR based approach. The nucleotide sequences encoding the SH2 domain of rat Stat5a and Stat5b are 75% homologous. The rat Yy1 cDNA is 95% homologous to its human and mouse counterparts in the zinc finger domain-encoding region. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we have localized Stat5a to rat chromosome band 10q32.1 and Yy1 to rat chromosome band 6q32.
