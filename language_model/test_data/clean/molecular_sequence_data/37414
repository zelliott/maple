Isomaltulose synthase (PalI) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the alpha-1,2 bond between the glucose and fructose moieties of sucrose and the formation of alpha-1,6 and alpha-1,1 bonds between the two components to produce isomaltulose (alpha-D-glucosylpyranosyl-1,6-D-fructofranose) and trehalulose (alpha-D-glucosylpyranosyl-1,1-D-fructofranose), respectively. The PalI protein has been overexpressed, purified and crystallized at 295 K using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The crystals diffract to 2.2 A resolution using synchrotron radiation and belong to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 59.239, b = 94.153, c = 111.294 A.
