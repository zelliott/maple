Transfer RNAs of Azospirillum lipoferum were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified by aminoacylation. Thirty-six tRNA spots were resolved by this technique and twenty-six tRNA species have been identified. There are five tRNAs for Leu, four for Val, three for Pro, two each for Arg, Ile, Lys and Tyr, and one each for Ala, Asp, His, Phe, Ser and Thr. The tRNA (Asn) (QUU) was purified and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The A. lipoferum tRNA (Asn) (QUU) is 92% similar to B. subtilis tRNA (Asn) gene and two hypermodified nucleosides, queuosine (Q) and N-(9-beta-D Ribofuranosylpurine-6-YL)-carbamoyl)-threonine (t6A) are present in this tRNA.
