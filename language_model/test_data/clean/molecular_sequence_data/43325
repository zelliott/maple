We have reported that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) prevents retrograde degeneration of thalamic neurons after middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. To identify the protective mechanism of bFGF, we examined bFGF mRNA expression in a model of transient focal ischemia with in situ hybridization. Compared to c-fos, c-jun, and hsp 70 mRNA expression, upregulation of the bFGF mRNA expression was delayed until 6 h after reperfusion. By 12 h, bFGF mRNA was markedly induced in the peri-infarcted cortex, cingulate cortex, and peri-infarcted white matter. At 24 h and 2 days the induction of bFGF mRNA in these regions persisted, and disappeared by 5 day. The quantitative assessment of bFGF mRNA expression revealed that optical density ratios of the cingulate gyrus and the caudoputamen were significantly higher at 12 h, 24 h, and 2 d after reperfusion than those in sham controls. Microscopic observation indicated bFGF mRNA signals were present in several types of cortical cells, including neurons and nonneuronal cells. Since intrinsic bFGF, released from the damaged tissue, can influence the healing response through receptors upregulated by injury, it is reasonable that this pattern of bFGF mRNA expression parallels the bFGFR mRNA expression previously reported.
