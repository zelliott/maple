Human CD7 is one of the earliest molecules to appear in T cell development. In this study, putative feline CD7 cDNA was identified based on its similarities with human and mouse CD7 genes. The feline CD7 cDNA contained an open reading frame consisting of 630 nucleotides. The amino acid sequence of feline CD7 had 47.7% identity with that of human CD7, and 52.9% with that of mouse CD7. In addition, the feline CD7 protein fused with histidine tag was expressed in 293T cells. The expression was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assay.
