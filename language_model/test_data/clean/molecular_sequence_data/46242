A dwarf mutant from Brassica napus, namely NDF-1, which was derived from a high doubled haploid (DH) line '3529'(Brassica napus L.) of which seeds were jointly treated with chemical inducers and fast neutron bombardment, was revealed that dwarfism is under the control of a major gene(designated as ndf1) with a mainly additive effect and non-significant dominance effect. The germination and hypocotyls elongation response of dwarf mutants after exogenous GA and uniconazol application showed NDF-1 was a gibberellin insensitive dwarf. We cloned the Brassica napus GID1 gene, named BnGID1, and found it was the ortholog of AtGID1a. The sequence blasting of the BnGID1 genes from NDF-1 and wild type showed there was no mutant in the gene. But the quantitative RT-PCR analysis of GID1 EST pointed out the mutation was caused by the low-level expression of BnGID1 gene. After sequenced the BnGID1 gene's upstream, we found three bases mutated in the pyrimidine box (P-box) of the BnGID1 promoter, which is linkage with the dwarf mutant.
