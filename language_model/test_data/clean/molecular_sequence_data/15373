Under stressed conditions such as prolonged exposure to high pH, the C-terminal disulfide bridge in bovine somatotropin (bST) is susceptible to a base catalyzed beta-elimination reaction. This reaction converts the disulfide bond to a dehydroalanine residue with loss of a sulphur atom. Two altered species were isolated in pure form and determined to be generated from this dehydroalanine intermediate. One is a monomeric lanthionyl bST (L-bST) with a thioether linkage, and the other is an inter-molecular disulfide linked dimer containing a lysinoalanine. These two novel structures were unambiguously determined using various techniques including enzymatic digestion, amino acid sequencing and analysis, and mass spectrometry. The monomeric L-bST was demonstrated to be equipotent to normal bST in a hypox rat assay, thus showing that formation of lanthionine in place of this disulfide bond does not affect it bioactivity.
