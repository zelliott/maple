In this work, we described a kinetically slow (hour-scale) but thermodynamically favored G-quadruplex conversion induced by a pyridyl carboxamide molecule. This slow transition was observed through CD spectra and gels, and its final stable parallel conformation was identified by 2-aminopurine experiments. Kinetic experiments indicated that this slow process was a first-order reaction, implying it was a unimolecular conversion. Quite distinctly from other reported ligand-driven G-quadruplex conformation alteration, this slow conversion reveals a novel insight into G-quadruplex polymorphism, in accordance with the behavior of human telomere G-quadruplex in a molecular crowding environment in K(+) solution, further enriching the known structural polymorphism of human telomere DNA and providing new consideration for drug design based on G-quadruplexes.
