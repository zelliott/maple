This paper describes the preparation of chitosan modified with dialdehydes, glutaraldehyde (CH-Glu) and glyoxal (CH-Gly) and its application in the isolation of the flavonoids swertisin and 2"-O-rhamnosylswertisin from A. mollucana. The additional non-polar alkyl groups increase the hydrophobicity of the sorbent. The results show that the separation was mediated by hydrophobic interaction (CH-Glu), as well as hydrogen bonding, between phenolic OH or rhamnosil residues from the flavonoids, and the free amine groups (CH-Gly).
