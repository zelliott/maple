A concise synthesis of two isomeric pentasaccharides, alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->3)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->3)-[beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->2)]-alpha-L-Rhap (A) and alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->3)-[beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->2)]-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->3)-alpha-L-Rhap (B), the O repeats from the lipopolysaccharides of Pseudonomonas syringae pv. porri NCPPB 3364T and 3365 was achieved via assembly of the building blocks, allyl 3,4-di-O-benzoyl-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (1), 2,3,4-tri-O-benzoyl-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl trichloroacetimidate (2), allyl 4-O-benzoyl-3-O-chloroacetyl-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (6), 3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-2-phthalimido-beta-D-glucopyranosyl trichloroacetimidate (7), and allyl 2,4-di-O-benzoyl-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (10). Coupling of 1 with 2 followed by deallylation and trichloroacetimidate formation gave the disaccharide donor 5, while condensation of 6 with 7, followed by dechloroacetylation, offered the disaccharide acceptor 9. Then, 5 was coupled with 10 to obtain the trisaccharide 11, and subsequent deallylation and trichloroacetimidate formation furnished the trisaccharide donor 13. Coupling of 9 with 13, followed by deprotection, afforded pentasaccharide 19, while condensation of 9 with 5, followed by deallylation and trichloroacetimidate formation, gave the tetrasaccharide donor 16, whose coupling with 10 and subsequent deprotection yielded another pentasaccharide 22.
