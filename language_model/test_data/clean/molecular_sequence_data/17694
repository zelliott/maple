The aggregative properties of GM1 ganglioside containing an acetyl group as acyl moiety [GM1(acetyl)] in aqueous solution have been studied by static and dynamic light scattering measurements and surface tension experiments. GM1 (acetyl) spontaneously aggregates as small micelles showing a hydrodynamic radius and molecular weight of 34 A and 102 kDa, respectively, down to a concentration of 2.0 x 10(-5) M.
