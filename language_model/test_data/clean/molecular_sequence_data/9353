To identify novel as well as conserved miRNAs in citrus, deep sequencing of small RNA library combined with microarray was performed in precocious trifoliate orange (an early flowering mutant of trifoliate orange, Poncirus trifoliata L. Raf.), resulting in the obtainment of a total of 114 conserved miRNAs belonging to 38 families and 155 novel miRNAs. The miRNA star sequences of 39 conserved miRNAs and 27 novel miRNAs were also discovered among newly identified miRNAs, providing additional evidence for the existence of miRNAs. Through degradome sequencing, 172 and 149 genes were identified as targets of conserved miRNAs and novel miRNAs, respectively. GO and KEGG annotation revealed that high ranked miRNA-target genes were those implicated in biological and metabolic processes. To characterize those miRNAs expressed at the juvenile and adult development stages of citrus, further analysis on the expression profiles of these miRNAs through hybridizing the commercial microarray and real-time PCR was performed. The results revealed that some miRNAs were down-regulated at adult stage compared with juvenile stage. Detailed comparison of the expression patterns of some miRNAs and corresponding target genes revealed the negative correlation between them, while few of them are positively correlated.
