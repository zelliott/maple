Antigen-derived HLA class I-restricted peptides can generate specific CD8(+) T-cell responses in vivo and are therefore often used as vaccines for patients with cancer. However, only occasional objective clinical responses have been reported suggesting the necessity of CD4(+) T-cell help and possibly antibodies for the induction of an effective anti-tumor immunity in vivo. The SSX2 gene encodes the cancer testis antigen (CTA) HOM-MEL-40/SSX2, which is frequently expressed in a wide spectrum of cancers. Both humoral and cellular immune responses against SSX2 have been described making SSX2 an attractive candidate for vaccine trials.

SYFPEITHI algorithm was used to predict five pentadecamer peptides with a high binding probability for six selected HLA-DRB1 subtypes (*0101, *0301, *0401, *0701, *1101, *1501) which are prevalent in the Caucasian population.

Using peripheral blood cells of 13 cancer patients and 5 healthy controls, the HOM-MEL-40/SSX2-derived peptide p101-111 was identified as an epitope with dual immunogenicity for both CD4(+) helper and cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells. This epitope also reacted with anti-SSX2 antibodies in the serum of a patient with breast cancer. Most remarkably, SSX2/p101-111 simultaneously induced specific CD8, CD4, and antibody responses in vitro.

p101-111 is the first CTA-derived peptide which induces CD4(+), CD8(+), and B-cell responses in vitro. This triple-immunogenic peptide represents an attractive vaccine candidate for the induction of effective anti-tumor immunity.
