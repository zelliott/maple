Two types of methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) were obtained from a novel marine methylotrophic bacterium, Methylophaga aminisulfidivorans MP(T), grown on methanol. Type I MDH consisted of two identical dimers of α (65.98 kDa) and β (7.58 kDa) subunits organized to form the α(2)β(2) tetramer. Type II MDH contained an additional MxaJ protein (27.86 kDa) and had more specific activity than type I MDH. The K(m) values of type I and II MDH for methanol under cytochrome c(L) reduction assay system were estimated to be 50.3 and 13.0 μM, respectively, and the isoelectric points of type I and II MDH were determined to be 5.4 and 5.8, respectively. The average molar ratios of α:β, α:MxaJ, and β:MxaJ in type II MDH were approximately 1:0.99, 1:0.41 and 1:0.42, respectively. Based on these results, the original conformation of the MDH of M. aminisulfidivorans MP(T) is most likely the α(2)β(2)-MxaJ complex. During purification, the lysozyme and freeze-thawing cell disruption method significantly increased the amount of type II MDH in the soluble fraction compared with strong physical disruption methods such as sonication and French Press.
