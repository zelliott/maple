The highly structured 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus is involved in cap-independent translation of the viral RNA. Previously, we reported that the bicistronic mRNA chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-5' UTR-luciferase (Luc) efficiently expressed Luc both in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate and when transfected into BHK-21 cells. Insertion of 3 nucleotides at position 665 in the 5' UTR of this bicistronic mRNA resulted in greatly reduced Luc expression in BHK-21 cells but had little effect on expression of Luc in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. This mutation was also introduced into a virulent Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus chimera, Chi-VL. The kinetics of viral RNA and protein synthesis and virus production in BHK-21 cells were slower for the mutant chimera [Chi-VL(IN668)] than for Chi-VL; however, the final virus yields were comparable. Intracerebral inoculation of mice with the chimeras revealed that Chi-VL(IN668) was completely attenuated in neurovirulence. The reduced neurovirulence of Chi-VL(IN668) may be ascribed to its reduced growth in the central nervous system, most likely due to an impaired ability to synthesize viral proteins.
