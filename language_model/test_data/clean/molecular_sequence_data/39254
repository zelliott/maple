The taxonomic status of the species Lactobacillus durianis and Lactobacillus vaccinostercus is briefly summarized and experimental evidence concerning their similarity is presented. Highly similar 16S rRNA gene sequences (99.8 % similarity over 1,523 bp), partial recA gene sequences (99.5 % similarity over 600 bp) and partial hsp60 gene sequences (99.1 % similarity over 924 bp) suggest that the two species are closely related. Moreover, a high DNA-DNA binding level (87 %) and similar genomic DNA G+C contents (41-44 mol% for both species) as well as similar biochemical characteristics support the evidence that they constitute a single species. Consequently, according to Rules 38 and 42 of the Bacteriological Code, the name Lactobacillus vaccinostercus, the oldest legitimate name, must be maintained and the name Lactobacillus durianis should be considered a later heterotypic synonym.
