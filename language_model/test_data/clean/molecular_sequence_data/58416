Within the framework of an international project for the sequencing of the entire Bacillus subtilis genome, this paper communicates the sequencing of a chromosome region containing the lic and cel loci (65 kb), which creates a 177 kb contig covering the region from gnt to sacXY. This 65 kb region contains 64 ORFs (62 complete and two partial genes). The 14th, 15th and 17th genes correspond to licT, licS and katE, encoding the antiterminator for licS transcription, beta-glucanase (lichenase) and catalase 2, respectively. The 11th, 30th, 36th, 39th, 41st, 45th-48th, 51st and 58th genes are designated deaD, pepT, galE, aldY, msmX, cydABCD, sigY and katX because their products probably encode ATP-dependent RNA helicase, tripeptidase, UDP-glucose 4-epimerase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, multiple sugar-binding transport ATP-binding protein, the respective components of cytochrome d ubiquinol oxidase and ATP-binding cassette transporter, sigma-factor of RNA polymerase and catalase, respectively. The 60th-64th genes are celRABCD, which are probably involved in cellobiose utilization. Gene organization and gene features in the gnt-sacXY region are discussed.
