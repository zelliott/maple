We describe two cell lines with different deletions of the retinoblastoma gene in a patient with bilateral retinoblastoma. This patient has transmitted the mutation less frequent in his lymphocytes to two affected children. We cloned, mapped, and sequenced the junction fragments of the two deletions and found that they share one breakpoint but extend into opposite directions. An insertion of 4 bp of unknown origin is present between the breakpoints in one of the deletions. The second deletion shows a more complex rearrangement, including an inversion at the 5' end. Short regions of homology were found at the breakpoints and flanking the inversion. These results support the notion that bilateral retinoblastoma may not only be due to a germ-line mutation but also to a postzygotic mutation leading to somatic mosaicism.
