Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major etiologic agent of non-A, non-B hepatitis. One of the difficulties in developing anti-HCV drugs is the lack of an efficient HCV cultivation system. We have generated an artificial surrogate virus suitable for testing the antiviral effects of drugs affecting HCV protease NS3, an enzyme believed to be essential for HCV proliferation. The surrogate virus genome is composed of most of the poliovirus genome and HCV protease NS3 and an NS3-specific cleavage site. The activity of HCV protease NS3 is required for proliferation of this chimeric virus. The antiviral efficacy of HCV protease inhibitors can, therefore, be evaluated by examining the effects of the drugs on the surrogate virus proliferation.
