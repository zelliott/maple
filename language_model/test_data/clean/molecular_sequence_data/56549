Streptokinase (SK), a bacterial product of pathogenic Streptococcus species, is now widely used as an effective therapy for the treatment of heart attacks. Because naturally occurring antibody to SK is ubiquitous, serious allergic reactions to SK therapy are common. To begin to identify regions of the molecule that are important for the antigenicity of SK we performed studies using a panel of 51 hybridomas producing anti-SK antibodies, recombinant SK fragments, and assays of SK activity. Antibodies generated from mice hyperimmunized with wild-type SK were shown to fall into six distinct complementation groups by competitive binding studies. Recombinant SK fragments were used to determine the peptide regions recognized by these complementation groups. Correlation of the effects of the mAb on SK function, with knowledge of their SK fragment-binding pattern, suggested regions of the SK molecule that are important for the construction and the catalytic function of the SK-plasminogen activator complex.
