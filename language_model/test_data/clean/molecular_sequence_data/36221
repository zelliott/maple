By screening patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa for mutations in the rhodopsin gene, two deletions (8 bp and 1 bp) have been identified in exon 5; these deletions cause a shift in the reading frame. The predicted proteins should be radically altered with translation continuing past the normal stop signal and resulting in a rhodopsin molecule that is, respectively, 1 and 10 amino acids longer. The clinical phenotype of the patients is described and is compared with that associated with other mutations in the same region of the gene.
