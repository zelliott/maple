Data from chemotaxonomic and 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analyses of an isolate obtained from the sputum of a kidney transplant patient identified the isolate as a member of the genus Nocardiopsis. DNA-DNA hybridization data, as well as physiological characteristics, indicated that the isolate represents a new species of the genus Nocardiopsis, designated Nocardiopsis synnemataformans; the type strain is strain IMMIB D-1215 (= DSM 44143). In addition, DNA-DNA hybridization data, as well as the results of biochemical tests, indicated that Nocardiopsis alborubida DSM 40465T, Nocardiopsis antarctica DSM 43884T, and Nocardiopsis dassonvillei DSM 43111T represent a single species designated N. dassonvillei. We also found that Nocardiopsis alba subsp. alba DSM 43377T and N. alba subsp. prasina DSM 43845T are genetically different and therefore propose that N. alba subsp. prasina be elevated to species status as Nocardiopsis prasina comb. nov., whose type strain is strain DSM 43845.
