Adult somatic cell cloned calves were produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer prepared by fusion of cultured ear fibroblast from a Holstein cow into enucleated oocytes of Luxi Yellow cow. In order to determinate the source of mitochondrial DNA of cloned calves, we designed the breed-specific PCR primers by aligning the known D-loop sequences of Bos taurus and analyzed the displacement loop sequences of five live cloned calves by breed-specific primers PCR. The results demonstrated that mtDNA originated from Holstein breed and that from Luxi breed co-exist in all five live calves.
