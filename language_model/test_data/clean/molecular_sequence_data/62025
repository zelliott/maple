The lipopolysaccharide of Citrobacter youngae O1, strain PCM 1492 was degraded with acid or alkali under mild conditions, and the resultant polysaccharide was isolated by GPC and studied by sugar and methylation analyses and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies, including 2D COSY, TOCSY, NOESY and 1H, 13C HSQC experiments. The following structure of the branched tetrasaccharide repeating unit of the O-polysaccharide was established: [structure: see text] where substitution with the alpha-D-Ribf group is nonstoichiometric. This group occurs rarely in bacterial polysaccharides and is easily cleaved under mild acidic conditions. Studies with polyclonal rabbit antisera against whole cells of C. youngae PCM 1492 and PCM 1506 showed the serological identity of the lipopolysaccharides of C. youngae PCM 1492, PCM 1493 and PCM 1506, which are classified in serogroup O1.
