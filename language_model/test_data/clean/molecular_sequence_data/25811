A cyclic hexapeptide cyclo(Lys-Gly-Asp-Gln-Leu-Ser-) 10 was synthesized stepwise in solution by acylation of peptide ester trifluoroacetates directly with preactivated Boc-amino acids using the DCC/HOBt method; the final cyclization reaction was performed using the pentafluorophenyl ester method in solution (1-4). This peptide is a cyclic derivative of murine tumor necrosis factor-(127-132) and is designed as a potential antitumor agent. The cyclic peptide 10 displayed weak cytotoxic activity on three of the four human tumor cell lines tested.
