We studied a glucuronyltransferase involved in chondroitin sulfate (CS) biosynthesis in a preparation obtained from fetal bovine serum by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. This enzyme transferred GlcA from UDP-GlcA to the nonreducing GalNAc residues of polymeric chondroitin. It required Mn2+ for maximal activity and showed a sharp pH optimum between pH 5.5 and 6.0. The apparent Km value of the glucuronyltransferase for UDP-GlcA was 51 microM. The specificity was investigated using structurally defined acceptor substrates, which consisted of chemically synthesized tri-, penta-, and heptasaccharide-serines and various odd-numbered oligosaccharides with a GalNAc residue at the nonreducing terminus, prepared from chondroitin and CS by chondroitinase ABC digestion followed by mercuric acetate treatment. The enzyme utilized a heptasaccharide-serine GalNAc beta 1-4GlcA beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4GlcA beta 1-3Gal beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Xyl beta 1-O-Ser and a pentasaccharide-serine GalNAc beta 1-4GlcA beta 1-3Gal beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Xyl beta 1-O-Ser as acceptors. In contrast, neither a trisaccharide-serine Gal beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Xyl beta 1-O-Ser nor an alpha-GalNAc-capped pentasaccharide-serine GalNAc alpha 1-4GlcA beta 1-3Gal beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Xyl beta 1-O-Ser that is a model compound of the reaction product formed by the action of the alpha-GalNAc transferase recently demonstrated in fetal bovine serum (Kitagawa et al., J. Biol. Chem., 270, 22190-22195, 1995) was utilized as an acceptor. Besides, all nonsulfated odd-numbered oligosaccharides except for the trisaccharide GalNAc beta 1-4GlcA beta 1-3GalNAc served as acceptors and the transfer rates roughly increased with increasing chain length. Moreover, 6-O-sulfation of nonreducing terminal GalNAc markedly enhanced GlcA transfer, whereas 4-O-sulfation had little effect on it. These results indicated that at least two glucuronyltransferases are involved in the biosynthesis of CS and that sulfation reactions may play important roles in chain elongation.
