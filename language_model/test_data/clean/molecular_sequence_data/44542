La Crosse (LAC) virus belongs to the California (CAL) serogroup of the genus Bunyavirus, family Bunyaviridae. It is considered one of the most important mosquito-borne pathogens in North America, especially in the upper Mid-West, where it is associated with encephalitis during the time of year when mosquitoes are active. Infections occur most frequently in children and young adults and, while most cases are resolved after a period of intense illness, a small fraction (< 1%) are fatal. At present there have only been three isolates of LAC virus from humans all made from brain tissue postmortem. The cases yielding viruses are separated chronologically by 33 years and geographically from Minnesota/Wisconsin (1960, 1978) to Missouri (1993). The M RNA sequence of the first two isolates was previously reported. The present study extends the observations to the isolate from the 1993 case and includes several mosquito isolates as well. A comparison of the M RNAs of these viruses shows that for the human isolates both nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino-acid sequence of the encoded proteins are highly conserved, showing a maximum variation of only 0.91% and 0.69%, respectively. This high degree of conservation over time and space leads to the hypothesis that human infections with this particular genotype of LAC virus are those most likely to have a fatal outcome. It is also shown that a virus with this genotype could be found circulating in mosquitoes in an area more or less intermediate between the locations of the first and second fatal cases.
