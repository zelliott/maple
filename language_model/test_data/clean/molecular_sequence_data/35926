A clone MA2C2 encoding the murine homologue of adrenoceptor alpha 2C2 was isolated from a mouse genomic library using a subtype specific probe. The nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences derived from an ApaI fragment (2 kb) of the clone reveal a single open reading frame encoding a putative receptor protein of 455 amino acids. The 5' untranslated region (0.5 kb) sequenced is characterized by high GC content and CpG island count.
