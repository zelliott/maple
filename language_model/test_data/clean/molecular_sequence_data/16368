Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase phosphatase (CaMKP) and CaMKP-N dephosphorylate and regulate multifunctional Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. The enzymatic properties of CaMKP-N and CaMKP resemble each other, whereas their localizations are different. CaMKP-N is localized in the nucleus, whereas CaMKP is localized in the cytosol. In the present study, the nuclear localization signals (NLSs) of CaMKP-N were identified and characterized. CaMKP-N contains two NLSs, NLS1 and NLS2, at the C-terminus. A cluster of basic residues in the NLSs is important for their function. NLS1 and NLS2 function independently, but mutagenesis analysis suggests that these NLSs interact with each other.
