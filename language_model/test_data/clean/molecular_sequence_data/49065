The human endogenous retrovirus HERV-H is associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). Previously performed reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) on virion-RNA demonstrated sequence variants of the HERV-H family located in the particulate fraction of MS patient plasma samples and not in controls. In this study a significantly elevated level of antibodies towards peptides derived from HERV-H/RGH-2 DNA sequences in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from MS patients is demonstrated. Further, Wistar rats immunized with purified virions develop a specific serologic response, indicating that some virion proteins are encoded by HERV-H-related sequences. Also shown is that in RNA from blood cells, a HERV-H protease-env splice variant can be found together with an env splice variant in about 40% of MS patients but only in 10% of controls. The results substantiate the association between activated HERV-H and MS, but a causal relationship is yet to be demonstrated. HERV-H could represent a causal factor either by eliciting an autoimmune response or through the pathogenic potential of the retrovirus itself.
