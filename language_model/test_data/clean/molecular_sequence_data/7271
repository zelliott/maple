Expression vectors are described that make use of a plasmid-encoded nisA cassette encoding the peptide component of nisin. Specific mutations can readily be incorporated throughout the coding region of nisA. Using this vector in a nisA mutant host, three variant nisins, with dehydroalanine (Dha) residues changed to Ala residues, were generated.
