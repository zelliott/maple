In this study we report the cloning, sequence, and characterization of Hor v 9 allergen cDNAs from barley (Hordeum vulgare) pollen. Structural homologues of Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) group 9 pollen allergens were identified in a cDNA library of barley pollen expressed mRNAs. The Hor v 9 cDNA clone (hvp9742) contained an open reading frame encoding 313 amino acids which included a putative 27-residue signal peptide and one asparagine sequon for glycosylation. The mRNA corresponding to clone hvp9742 was produced abundantly in pollen during the late stages of anther development. The protein encoded by clone hvp974 was synthesized as a fusion protein in the E. coli expression vector pMAL. Immunoblots using antibodies to this recombinant allergen, rHor v 9, showed that Hor v 9 protein accumulated during pollen development and was produced maximally at pollen maturity. Using these antibodies, we also provide evidence that Hor v 9 protein localized to the extracellular matrix of mature pollen. Southern blots suggested that Hor v 9 allergens exist as multiple isoforms in barley. Sequence comparisons showed that the Hor v 9 cDNA clones were also homologous to group 5 allergens of Timothy grass (Phleum pratense) pollen and canary grass (Phalaris aquatica) pollen, and the group 9 allergen of ryegrass (Lolium perenne) pollen.
