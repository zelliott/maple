The mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes syndrome (MELAS) is a rare congenital disorder of mitochondrial DNA. Five single nucleotide substitutions within the human mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) gene have been reported to be associated with MELAS. Here, we provide in vitro evidence that the aminoacylation capacities of these five hmtRNALeu(UUR) transcripts are reduced to different extents relative to the wild-type hmtRNALeu(UUR) transcript. A thermal denaturation experiment showed that the A3243G and T3291C mutants, which were the least charged by LeuRS, have fragile structures. In addition, the T3291C mutant can inhibit aminoacylation of the wild-type hmtRNALeu(UUR), indicating that it may act as an inhibitor in the mitochondrial heteroplasmic environment.
