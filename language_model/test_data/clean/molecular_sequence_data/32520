A novel splice variant of human AP3B2, named AP3B2_v2, was isolated through the large-scale sequencing analysis of a human fetal brain cDNA library. The AP3B2_v2 cDNA is 1171 bp in length. Sequence analysis revealed AP3B2_v2 missed 22 exons that existed in AP3B2_v1, leading to a different putative protein. The deduced proteins were 145 amino acids (designated as AP3B2_v2) and 1082 amino acids (AP3B2_v1) in length, sharing the C-terminal 145 amino acids. RT-PCR analysis showed that human AP3B2_v2 were expressed in several human adult tissues analyzed. The expression levels of AP3B2_v2 were relatively high in brain and testis. In contrast, low levels of expression were detected in kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, prostate, ovary and small intestine.
