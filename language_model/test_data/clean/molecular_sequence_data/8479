Recently, two genes, AML1 and ETO have been isolated from the chromosomal breakpoint of t(8;21). In this study, we isolated and identified fusion transcripts from a leukemic cell line carrying t(8;21). We demonstrated by PCR analysis that these transcripts are consistently expressed in fresh leukemic cells with t(8;21). On the other hand, the wild type of ETO is expressed in several hematopoietic cells from different lineage, while the expression of AML1 was present in all hematopoietic cells investigated. These widespread expression suggests these molecules play an essential role in hematopoiesis.
