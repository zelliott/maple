Bacteria regulate chromosomal replication from one specific origin. We compare the regulatory requirements, DNA structures, and biochemical properties of the prototypic Escherichia coli origin with those of evolutionarily distant Bacillus subtilis and Caulobacter crescentus origins. The ubiquitous DnaA protein is a major regulator of all three bacterial origins. Unique features of these origins, however, may reflect specific regulatory requirements placed on them.
