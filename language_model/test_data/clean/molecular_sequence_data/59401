Vimelysin is a novel alcohol resistant metalloproteinase from Vibrio sp. T1800. The substrate specificity of vimelysin was studied by using natural and furylacryloyl dipeptide substrates. Vimelysin cleaved mainly Pro7-Phe8 bond and slightly Tyr4-Ile5 bond in human angiotensin I. Vimelysin also cleaved mainly Phe24-Phe25 and Tyr16-Leu17 bonds, and slightly His5-Leu6, His10-Leu11, Ala14-Leu15, and Gly23-Phe24 bonds in oxidized insulin B-chain. The substrate specificity of vimelysin, by using furylacryloyl (Fua) dipeptides were also studied. The ratio of kcat/Km for Fua-Gly-Phe-NH2/Fua-Gly-Leu-NH2, Fua-Phe-Leu-NH2/Fua-Gly-Leu-NH2, and Fua-Phe-Phe-NH2/Fua-Gly-Leu-NH2 were 15.9, 27.8, and 59.0, respectively. These results indicate that vimelysin easily recognizes phenylalanine in P1' positions, which is different from thermolysin.
