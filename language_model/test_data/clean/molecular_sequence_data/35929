Complementary DNA encoding human protein phosphatase X (PPX, also designated PPP4 in the human genome nomenclature) was isolated from a teratocarcinoma library. The deduced amino acid sequence of human PPX differs from that of rabbit PPX in only two in 307 amino acids, demonstrating that the structure of PPX has been highly conserved during the course of mammalian evolution.
