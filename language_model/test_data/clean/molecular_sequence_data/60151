Two new cardenolides, 3beta-hydroxy-5alpha-carda-14(15), 20(22)-dienolide (beta-anhydroepidigitoxigenin) (1) and 3beta-O-(D-digitalosyl)-21-hydroxy-5beta-carda-8,14,16 , 20(22)-tetraenolide (neriumogenin-A-3beta-D-digitaloside) (2), and two known compounds, proceragenin and neridienone A (3), have been isolated from the roots of Nerium oleander. The structures of 1 and 2 were elucidated on the basis of spectral data interpretation.
