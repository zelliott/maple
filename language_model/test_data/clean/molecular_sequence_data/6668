A gene (ertX) encoding a putative ABC transporter was cloned from the erythromycin producer Saccharopolyspora erythraea, using PCR. The primers were based on regions of homology from ABC transporters which confer resistance to macrolide antibiotics. While ertX encodes a protein with a strong degree of similarity to other macrolide ABC transporters from streptomycetes and staphylococci, it did not confer resistance to erythromycin, tylosin, spiramycin, oleandomycin, josamcin, chalcomycin or midecamycin when subcloned into sensitive streptomycete hosts. Southern blot analysis suggested that ertX did not constitute part of the erythromycin gene cluster as identified to date.
