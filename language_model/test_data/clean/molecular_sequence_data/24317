Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a pleiotropic growth factor that acts on various epithelial cells. The objectives of this study were to determine whether HGF altered the proliferation and prostaglandin (PG) secretion of bovine endometrial stromal and epithelial cells in vitro. We also observed HGF and HGF receptor (c-met) mRNA expression in cultured bovine endometrial stromal and epithelial cells by RT-PCR. Stromal and epithelial cells obtained from cows in early stage of the estrous cycle (days 2-5) were cultured in DMEM/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% calf serum. The cells were exposed to HGF (0-10 ng/ml) for 2, 4, or 6 days. HGF significantly increased the total DNA in epithelial (P < 0.05), but not stromal cells. In another experiment, when the cells reached confluence, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium with 0.1% BSA containing HGF 0-100 ng/ml and the cells were cultured for 24 hr. The HGF stimulated PGF2alpha secretion in epithelial, but not stromal cells. RT-PCR revealed that mRNA of HGF is expressed only in stromal cells, and that c-met mRNA is expressed in both stromal and epithelial cells. These results suggest that HGF plays roles in the proliferation and the regulation of secretory function of bovine endometrial epithelial cells in a paracrine fashion.
