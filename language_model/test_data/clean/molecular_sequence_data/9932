SOX family genes share a high sequence similarity with the HMG box region of the human Y chromosomal gene, SRY. We have cloned and sequenced the HMG box motif of a Sox gene of the lizard, Calotes versicolor. A database search for the cloned sequence, CvSox-4, revealed 100% identity with the SOX4 gene of the human and its homologue in a bird. The result strongly suggests that SOX4 evolved prior to the diversification of amniotes and is highly conserved.
