Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is caused by viruses in the Hantavirus genus, family Bunyaviridae. Three serologically distinct hantaviruses, Hantaan, Seoul and Puumala viruses, are known to cause HFRS. We report here, for the first time, gene sequences of two human Puumala virus isolates, P360 and K27, obtained in an HFRS endemic region of the former Soviet Union. We compared the nucleotide sequences and the derived amino acid sequences of their gene products to a Puumala virus isolate from rodents.
