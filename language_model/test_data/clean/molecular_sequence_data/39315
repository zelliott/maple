To study the relationships between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of lumican, decorin, and DSPG3 genes and high myopia.

One hundred and twenty adult patients with high myopia (< -10.0 D) and 137 controls were used to study the relationships between the decorin, lumican, and DSPG genes and high myopia. All subjects were free of ocular diseases, other than myopia, as well as of other systemic genetic diseases. Genotyping was performed by direct sequencing after PCR amplification of chromosomal DNA. Allele frequencies were tested for Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium. The chi(2) or Fisher test was conducted to investigate the genotypic and allelic distribution between the high myopia and control groups.

The genotyping success rate was 100%. Univariate analysis revealed significant differences between patients and control subjects with respect to one of the SNPs (rs3759223, C->T) of the lumican gene, with a p value of 0.000283. There was no significant relationship between other SNPs of lumican, decorin, and DSPG genes and high myopia.

Our results indicate that an SNP (rs3759223), which is located in the promoter region of the lumican gene, may be worth further investigation to determine its association with development of high myopia.
