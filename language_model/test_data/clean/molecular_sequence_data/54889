The large subunit of the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) recognizes the polypyrimidine tract (Py-tract) located adjacent to the 3' splice site to facilitate U2 snRNP recruitment. While U2AF is considered essential for pre-mRNA splicing, its requirement for splicing on a genome-wide level has not been analyzed. Using Solexa sequencing, we performed mRNA profiling for splicing in the Schizosaccharomyces pombe U2AF(59) (prp2.1) temperature-sensitive mutant. Surprisingly, our analysis revealed that introns show a range of splicing defects in the mutant strain. While U2AF(59) inactivation (nonpermissive) conditions inhibit splicing of some introns, others are spliced apparently normally. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that U2AF(59)-insensitive introns have stronger 5' splice sites and higher A/U content. Most importantly, features that contribute to U2AF(59) insensitivity of an intron unexpectedly reside in its 5'-most 30 nucleotides. These include the 5' splice site, a guanosine at position 7, and the 5' splice site-to-branch point sequence context. A differential requirement (similar to U2AF(59)) for introns may also apply to other general splicing factors (e.g., prp10). Our combined results indicate that U2AF insensitivity is a common phenomenon and that varied intron features support the existence of unrecognized aspects of spliceosome assembly.
