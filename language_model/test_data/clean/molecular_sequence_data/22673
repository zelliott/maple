A total of 293 ticks and 111 wild rodents that were collected in Shizuoka and Nagano Prefectures, Japan, were examined for infection of Ehrlichia species and 'Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis.' The 16S rDNA or the omp-1 gene of these bacterial DNAs were detected from the spleens of tick-inoculated mice (5 positive/total 29 mice) or from the spleens of wild rodents (25 positive/total 111 rodents) by PCR amplifi-cation. Sequencing of the 16S rDNA revealed Ehrlichia spp. from the 5 tick-inoculated mice and 8 wild rodents, and 'Candidatus N. mikurensis' from 17 wild rodents. The data suggest the presence of additional genetic variants, and potential vectors and/or reservoirs for these bacteria in central Japan.
