Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules bind peptides that are delivered from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum by the MHC-encoded transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). Peptide capture by immature heterodimers of class I heavy chains and beta 2-microglobulin may be facilitated by their physical association with TAP. A genetic defect in a human mutant cell line causes the complete failure of diverse class I heterodimers to associate with TAP. This deficiency impairs the ability of the class I heterodimers to efficiently capture peptides and results from loss of function of an unidentified gene or genes linked to the MHC.
