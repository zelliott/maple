The interaction of the lambda phage initiator protein, O, with the lambda origin sequence, ori, has been investigated. Binding of O, or its amino-terminal fragment, causes a major structural change within a 60 bp AT-rich region just to the right of the O-binding site. ATP or other molecular energy sources are not required. The modification, as assayed by nuclease sensitivity, is reduced when certain ori mutant sequences, which bind O but fail to replicate, are substituted for the wild-type sequence. The modification of DNA structure caused by the interaction of O is absolutely dependent on the presence of superhelical tension at the lambda origin sequence, and has several properties consistent with a strand separation reaction. We propose that this modification is a fundamental prepriming event that is the first stage in initiation of bidirectional replication in lambda after O binding.
