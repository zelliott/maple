The CD95/Fas/Apo-1 ligand is expressed on activated lymphocytes, NK cells, platelets, certain immune-privileged cells and some tumor cells and induces apoptosis through the death receptor CD95/Fas/Apo-1. In murine T cells, membrane-bound CD95L (Fas ligand) also acts as a costimulatory receptor to coordinate activation and function in vivo. The molecular basis for this reverse signal transduction is yet unknown. In the present report, we identify individual interaction domains of enzymes and adapter molecules that selectively interact with full-length CD95L from transfectants and human T cells. These results may help to explain the costimulatory capacity of CD95L.
