Nucleotide sequences of rice ragged stunt virus (RRSV) genome segment 9 (S9) from a Thai and an Indian isolate were determined. Both sequences are 1132 bp long, contain a single large open reading frame (ORF) spanning nucleotide residues 14 to 1027 and are capable of encoding a protein of 38.5K. The two isolates are 94.6% and 99.4% identical at the nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively. The authenticity of these coding sequences was confirmed by identifying a approximately 38K protein in the RRSV particle with an N-terminal amino acid sequence identical to that inferred from the S9 ORF. Furthermore, cDNA of S9 from each isolate incorporated into the bacterial expression vector pGEX3-X produced a fusion protein that reacted with antibodies raised against purified RRSV particles. Cleaving these fusion proteins with protease factor X liberated a approximately 38K polypeptide.
