Cartilage collagen fibrils, which are characterized by their thin, uniform diameters, are formed of a multicomponent system of three collagen types (II, IX, and XI) and interacting proteoglycans. We have used a genetic approach to test whether the proper assembly of this multiprotein structure was altered by overexpression of one of its normal components. Here we show that in transgenic mice in which the normal mouse alpha 1(II) collagen is overexpressed, thick abnormal collagen fibrils are generated. Mice that showed the highest expression of the transgene also displayed a larger proportion of abnormal fibrils and died at birth. We propose that an imbalance among the constituents of the cartilage collagen fibrils disrupts the mechanism that controls their assembly. The results show the applicability of the transgenic mice system to studies of complex multicomponent protein assemblies in intact animals.
