We have previously identified an estrogen-responsive gene, efp (estrogen-responsive finger protein), by genomic binding-site cloning method. Here, we isolated a rat homologue of efp cDNA that encodes an open reading frame of 644 amino acids sharing high homology with human efp (69% identity at the protein level) and mouse efp (80% identity at the protein level). The efp protein has a RING finger, a variant type of zinc finger motif, B1 box and B2 box, each having a pair of zinc fingers, and coiled-coil domain, belonging to the RING finger-B box-Coiled Coil (RBCC) family. Several members of RBCC family including efp have characteristic C-terminal domain, forming a subfamily. Next, we detected efp mRNA in primary osteoblasts, one of estrogen target cells, derived from the calvariae of rat fetus. An anti-efp antibody revealed the efp protein is expressed and regulated by estrogen in the primary osteoblasts. Interestingly, the efp protein in primary osteoblasts is down-regulated by 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) treatment that promotes the differentiation of the cells, whereas it is up-regulated by TGF-beta1 treatment that inhibits the differentiation of the cells. These findings suggest the possible involvement of the efp in the differentiation of osteoblastic cells.
