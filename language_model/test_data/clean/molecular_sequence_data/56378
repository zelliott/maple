Synthesis of unintegrated retroviral DNA via reverse transcription is thought to involve two separate template switches. Minus-strand strong-stop DNA, a major product of in vitro reactions using detergent-treated virions, is synthesized prior to the first template switch. Plus-strand strong-stop DNA, which is found base-paired to near full-length minus-strand DNA in infected cells, is believed to be synthesized before the second template switch. Using a synchronized, one-step HIV infection model, we report here the detection in acutely infected cells of a novel double-stranded strong-stop HIV DNA with a discrete length of approximately 650 base pairs, commencing at or near the left hand end of the right-hand U3 region of the HIV long terminal repeat. The plus-strand of this double-stranded strong-stop DNA possesses the primer binding site sequence and appears to be synthesized prior to the completion of the synthesis of its complementary minus-strand. In contrast, the minus-strand of the double-stranded strong-stop DNA lacks the primer binding site sequence after RNaseH digestion. We propose that a transient free plus-strand strong-stop DNA is released from its template by displacement synthesis and subsequently used as template for the synthesis of its complementary minus-strand. The proposed transient free plus-strand strong-stop DNA may also mediate the second template switch.
