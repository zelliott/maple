The microstructural requirements for optimal interaction of neocarzinostatin chromophore (NCS-C) with DNA have been investigated using a series of hexadeoxyribonucleotides with modified bases such as O6-methyl G (MeG), I, 5-methyl C (MeC), U, or 5-Bromo U (BrU) at specific sites in its preferred trinucleotide 5'GNaNb3':5'Na,Nb,C3' (Na = A, C, or T). Results show that MeG:C and G:MeC in place of G:C improve direct strand cleavage at the target Nb (Nb = T greater than A much greater than C greater than G), whereas MeC:G and C:MeG in place of Na:Nb, hinder cleavage. The optimal base target at Nb appears to be determined by its ability to form T:A type base pairing instead of C:G type. The observed differences in DNA strand cleavage patterns can be rationalized by induced changes in target site structure and are compatible with a model for NCS-C:DNA interaction in which the naphthoate moiety intercalates between 5'GNa3', and the activated tetrahydro-s-indacene, lying in the minor groove, abstracts a hydrogen atom from C-5' of Nb.
