The phylogenetic relationships among the main evolutionary lines of the arachnid order Opiliones were investigated by means of molecular (complete 18S rDNA and the D3 region of the 28S rDNA genes) and morphological data sets. Equally and differentially weighted parsimony analyses of independent and combined data sets provide evidence for the monophyly of the Opiliones. In all the analyses, the internal relationships of the group coincide in the monophyly of the following main groups: Cyphophthalmi, Eupnoi Palpatores, Dyspnoi Palpatores, and Laniatores. The Cyphophthalmi are monophyletic and sister to a clade that includes all the remaining opilionid taxa (=Phalangida). Within the Phalangida the most supported hypothesis suggests that Palpatores are paraphyletic, as follows: (Eupnoi (Dyspnoi + Laniatores)), but the alternative hypothesis (Laniatores (Eupnoi + Dyspnoi)) is more parsimonious in some molecular data analyses. Relationships within the four main clades are also addressed. Evolution of some morphological characters is discussed, and plesiomorphic states of these characters are evaluated using molecular data outgroup polarization. Finally, Martens' hypothesis of opilionid evolution is assessed in relation to our results.
