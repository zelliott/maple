A diapause associated protein was electrophoretically isolated from the hemolymph of diapausing last instar larvae of the pink bollworm Pectinophora gossypiella. This protein (M(r) approximately 490,000, glycolipoprotein) was given the name Pectinophora diapause protein (PDP). It is composed of one subunit (M(r) 103,000). The concentration of PDP increased dramatically in the hemolymph of diapausing larvae from 17.4% in prediapause (PD) phase to 29.2% in early diapause (ED) phase reaching a level of 38.6% in larval hemolymph of middiapause (MD) phase. The concentrations of total proteins in the hemolymph of active feeding (A), PD, ED, and MD larvae were 69.8, 106,6, 113.3, and 118 mg/ml, respectively, while those in the fat body of the same larvae were 7.1, 7.4, 8.8, and 4.5 mg/g, respectively. In Pectinophora a drop in the concentration of fat body proteins coincided with a corresponding increase in hemolymph proteins, which suggests an active release of protein from the fat body into the hemolymph during the development of diapause. A partial amino acid sequence of pectinophorin showed the first 15 amino acids starting from the amino terminus of the peptide chain: N-ALA-LYS-THR-ILEU-VAL-GLU-ASN-MET-PRO-PRO-THR-PRO-LEU-ASN-ALA-C.
