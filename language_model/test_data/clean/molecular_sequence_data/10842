p53, a tumor suppressor and a transcription factor, has been shown to transcriptionally activate the expression of a number of important genes involved in the regulation of cell growth, DNA damage, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. In a computer search for other potential p53 target genes, we identified a perfect p53 binding site in the promoter of the human type IV collagenase (also called 72-kDa gelatinase or matrix metalloproteinase 2 [MMP-2]) gene. This p53 binding site was found to specifically bind to p53 protein in a gel shift assay. Transcription assays with luciferase reporters driven by the promoter or enhancer of the type IV collagenase gene revealed that (i) activation of the promoter activity is p53 binding site dependent in p53-positive cells but not in p53-negative cells and (ii) wild-type p53, but not p53 mutants commonly found in human cancers, transactivates luciferase expression driven by the type IV collagenase promoter as well as by a p53 site-containing enhancer element in the promoter. Significantly, expression of the endogenous type IV collagenase is also under the control of p53. Treatment of U2-OS cells, a wild-type p53-containing osteogenic sarcoma line, with a common p53 inducer, etoposide, induced p53 DNA binding and transactivation activities in a time-dependent manner. Induction of type IV collagenase expression followed the p53 activation pattern. No induction of type IV collagenase expression can be detected under the same experimental conditions in p53-negative Saos-2 cells. All these in vitro and in vivo assays strongly suggest that the type IV collagenase gene is a p53 target gene and that its expression is subject to p53 regulation. Our finding links p53 to a member of the MMP genes, a family of genes implicated in trophoblast implantation, wound healing, angiogenesis, arthritis, and tumor cell invasion. p53 may regulate these processes by upregulating expression of type IV collagenase.
