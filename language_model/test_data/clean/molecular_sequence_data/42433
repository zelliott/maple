The primary structure of pancreatic ribonuclease of the superspecies Spalax leucodon has been determined. Only one difference with the previously determined sequence of the superspecies Spalax ehrenbergi was detected; the proline residue at position 42 has been replaced by alanine. Proline-42 is a well-conserved residue in mammalian pancreatic ribonucleases; the only other species with alanine at this position is the three-toed sloth. As the Muridae and the Spalacidae diverged 20-40 million years ago and the superspecies S. leucodon and S. ehrenbergi about 1-2 million years ago, and as pancreatic ribonuclease exhibits 24 substitutions in the line from the Muridae/Spalacidae ancestor to Spalax, a difference of one amino residue between the sequences of the two Spalax superspecies is what may be expected.
