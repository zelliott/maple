Argininosuccinate lyase(ASL)/delta-crystallin is a prominent example of an enzyme-crystallin with roles as both a catalyst and a major structural component of the eye lens in birds and reptiles. In chicken it appears that gene duplication and separation of function may have occurred with one gene product acting primarily as a crystallin and one primarily as an enzyme. However, two delta-crystallin-encoding genes are abundantly expressed in the lens of the embryonic duck (Anas platyrhynchos) which has extremely high ASL activity. Here the isolation and sequence analysis of full length cDNA clones for both duck delta-crystallins are described. The two delta-crystallins are highly similar (94% identical in predicted aa sequence), probably as a result of gene conversion. However, the cDNA for duck delta 2-crystallin contains an in-frame insertion of two codons, probably the result of a recent intron boundary slippage. ASL/delta-crystallin belongs to a superfamily of lyases, including fumarases, aspartases and adenylosuccinate lyase which possess some highly conserved blocks of aa sequence. There may be some clues to the tertiary structures of these conserved motifs in otherwise unrelated proteins for which three-dimensional structures are known.
