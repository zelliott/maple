Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan responsible for the American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease), multiplies and differentiates in the gut of triatomine insect vectors. The effects of hemoglobin and synthetic peptides carrying alpha D-globin fragments on both the growth and the transformation of T. cruzi epimastigotes (noninfective) into metacyclic trypmastigotes (infective forms) were studied. This differentiation in the insect's gut is expressed when hemoglobin and synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 30-49 and 35-73 of the alpha D-globin were added to the plasma diet. However, synthetic peptide 41-73 does not induce differentiation of epimastigotes even in the presence of the two former synthetic peptides. Thus, these data delineate an unusual molecular mechanism which modulates the dynamics of transformation of epimastigotes into metacyclic trypomastigotes in the triatomine vector's gut.
