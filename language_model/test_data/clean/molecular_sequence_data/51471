In the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, the growth regulating system consists of (1) about 200 neuroendocrine light green cells, located in four clusters in the cerebral ganglia, and (2) the paired canopy cells, located in the lateral lobes. These cells express genes encoding the molluscan insulin-related peptides (MIPs). Six MIP genes have previously been identified. Four of these (I, II, III and V) are expressed in the light green cells and the canopy cells. The MIP-VI gene is a pseudogene. In the present in situ hybridization study, using oligonucleotide probes specific to the transcripts of MIP-I, -II, -III, -IV and -V, no signal was obtained with the MIP-IV probe, indicating that gene IV is also a pseudogene. With the other four probes, two types of light green cells were distinguished. Type-A cells express all four MIP genes, whereas type-B cells do not (or only faintly) express the MIP-I gene. Gene III is relatively strongly expressed in type-B cells. Genes II and V are moderately expressed in both cell types. Type-A cells are mainly located in the periphery of the clusters, whereas type-B cells are present in the center. The canopy cell resembles type-A light green cells. The expression levels of the MIP-II and MIP-V genes are low in the canopy cell. The expression pattern of the MIP genes correlates with the staining pattern of the anti-MIP-C antibody, which has been raised to a synthetic C-fragment shared by MIP-I, -II and -V. Type-A cells stain more intensely with the antibody than type-B cells.
