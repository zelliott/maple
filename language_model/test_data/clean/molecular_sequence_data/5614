A microsomal GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase activity from human bronchial mucosa, able to transfer a sulfate group from adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate onto methyl-N-acetylglucosaminides or terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues of carbohydrate chains from human respiratory mucins, has been characterized. The reaction products containing a terminal HO3S-6GlcNAc were identified by high performance anion-exchange chromatography. Using methyl-beta-N-acetylglucosaminide as a substrate, the optimal activity was obtained with 0.1% Triton X-100, 30 mM NaF, 20 mM Mn2+, 5 mM AMP in a 30 mM MOPS (3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid) buffer at pH 6.7. The apparent Km values for adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate and methyl-beta-N-acetylglucosaminide were observed at 9.1 x 10(-6) M and 0.54 x 10(-3) M, respectively. The enzyme had more affinity for carbohydrate chains with a terminal GlcNAc residue than for methyl-beta-N-acetylglucosaminide; it was unable to catalyze the transfer of sulfate to position 6 of the GlcNAc residue contained in a terminal Galbeta1-4GlcNAc sequence. However, oligosaccharides with a nonreducing terminal HO3S-6GlcNAc were substrates for a beta1-4 galactosyltransferase from human bronchial mucosa. These data point out that GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase must act before beta1-4 galactosylation in mucin-type oligosaccharide biosynthesis.
