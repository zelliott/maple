Paraffinized tissue from Barbadian women with histologically proven genital carcinoma was subjected to a consensus polymerase chain reaction method. Nineteen patients had cervical and one, vaginal carcinoma. The histological types were 17 squamous cell carcinoma, 2 adenocarcinoma and 1 adenosquamous carcinoma. HPV DNA was detected in 18/20 (90%). HPV DNA type 16 in 13 (65%), type 33 and type 45 in 1 (5%) each and 3 (15%) could not be typed. HPV DNA, type 16, was detected in one (50%) of the two cases of adenocarcinoma and 12/17 (71%) cases of squamous cell carcinoma. DNA HPV, type 33, and type 45 were each detected in 1/17 (6%) cases of squamous cell carcinoma. No HPV DNA, type 18, was detected.
