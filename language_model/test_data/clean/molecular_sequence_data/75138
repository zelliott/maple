We report the isolation of a 1.5 kb cDNA clone for the beta subunit of human pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) from a human liver lambda gt11 cDNA library using anti-E1 serum. We generated a peptide sequence of 24 amino acids starting from the N-terminus of bovine heart mature E1 beta. The identity of the E1 beta cDNA clone was confirmed by the similarity between the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA nucleotide sequence and the known amino acid sequence of bovine heart E1 beta. In Northern analysis of total RNA extracted from human heart, the E1 beta cDNA clone hybridized to a major 1.6 kb and a minor 5.2 kb RNA species.
