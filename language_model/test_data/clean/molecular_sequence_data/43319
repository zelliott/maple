HLA-B22-group alleles in Japanese were identified using PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and sequence analyses. We analyzed genomic DNAs obtained from Japanese individuals positive for HLA-B22 group antigens (HLA-B54, B55, B56) including two locally proposed splits (B55.2, and B22N). In the SSCP analysis of both exons 2 and 3, we discriminated five different B22-group alleles. Each allelic pattern corresponded to each serological split antigen. Direct sequencing analysis of exon 2 and exon 3 showed that alleles encoding B54, B55.1 and B56 antigens in Japanese are encoded by B*5401, B*5502 and B*5601, respectively, and those encoding B55.2 and B22N antigens are previously unidentified alleles, B*5504 and B*5603, respectively. Full-length cDNA sequencing showed that the B*5603 sequence is identical to those of B*5501, B*5502, B*5601, and B*5602 in exons 1 to 2 except for a synonymous substitution at nucleotide position 165 in exon 2. On the other hand, the sequence of exons 3 to 7 was identical to those of some B15 and B46 alleles, suggesting that B*5603 was generated by a recombination event between one of the B55 and B56 alleles and one of the B15 and B46 alleles in intron 2. As for B*5504, the entire exon 1 to 7 sequence is identical to that of B*5502 except that the 5'-half of the exon 3 sequence is identical to those of some B7, B27, B40 and B48 alleles, suggesting that an event such as gene conversion, segmental exchange, or double recombination occurred in this region.
