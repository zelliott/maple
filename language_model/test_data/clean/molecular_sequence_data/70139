We have developed a novel molecular probe that is useful for DNA fingerprint analysis in chickens. The probe is based on the middle-repetitive, chicken endogenous retroviral (EAV) element. It consists of 1503 bp of the 3' portion of the EAV element, extending from the down-stream end of the envelope gene to the beginning of the downstream long terminal repeat (LTR). Unlike other probes that are currently in use for fingerprint analysis with chicken DNA, the EAV-based probe works well at normal levels of stringency, and with standard hybridization buffers. Digestion of chicken genomic DNA with a variety of restriction enzymes routinely yields up to 30 resolvable bands per bird in the 500 bp to 20 kbp range. In order to test the efficacy of the EAV-based fingerprint probe, we have used it to estimate the degree of inbreeding in the inbred WG strain of White Leghorns. We find that the estimates derived with the EAV probe are very similar to those reported previously for the WG strain. These results suggest that molecular probes based on endogenous retroviruses and other middle-repetitive DNA elements should be useful for fingerprint analysis in chickens, and in vertebrates in general.
