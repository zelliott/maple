We compared complete untranslated regions (UTRs) of two subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) measles virus (MV) strains and two wild-type (wt) MV strains, all belonging to the same genotype (D6). In comparison to wt MVs of the same genotype, base changes were identified in the two SSPE measles virus strains at 27 and 33 noncoding positions, respectively. Majority of these residues are unique for each of the SSPE virus sequences in comparison to all other reported measles virus strain sequences. The location of some of these changes indicates that they may modify cis-acting regulatory sequences including gene-end signal of the P gene, H/L gene junction and Kozak consensus element of the L gene. Further, within the long UTR between M and F genes, deletions and insertions were identified. Thus, our study could be significant for additional investigation using reverse genetics and recombinant viruses, of possible influence of mutations in UTRs on establishment and maintenance of chronic progressive CNS disease caused by MV persistence.
