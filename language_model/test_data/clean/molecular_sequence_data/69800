CSF samples taken from three patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia and chronic brain disease were positive for enterovirus RNA by use of a technique based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify viral genomic sequences. Repeated attempts to culture viruses from the CSF from these patients were unsuccessful, possibly because the patients were treated regularly with intravenous immunoglobulin, which may have contained enough specific antibody to partially neutralize the viruses. Our data suggest that enteroviruses are responsible for diverse CNS features in patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia and that for these patients the diagnosis should be pursued using PCR technology.
