A C-type lectin-like protein was cloned and characterized from the Chinese shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis, and named as FcCTL. The results indicated that the full length cDNA of 859 bp had an open reading frame encoded a polypeptide of 220 amino acids with one carbohydrate-recognition domain, six conserved Cys and one key motif EPGD. The theoretical molecular weight and pI of mature protein was 25.3 kDa and 5.4. Sequence comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of FcCTL showed varied identity of 26-34, 34, 31 and 30 % with those of F. chinensis, Portunus trituberculatus, Tetraodon nigroviridis, Penaeus monodon, respectively. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that FcCTL was expressed highest in hepatopancreas of normal shrimp, and it's expression was up-regulated in hepatopancreas and gills post white spot syndrome virus challenge. The purified recombinant FcCTL showed higher antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria than against Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. And the hemagglutinating activity of rFcCTL could be completely inhibited by GlcNAc (5 μg/ml), LPS (2.5 μg/ml), D-galactose (100 mM) and maltose (100 mM). These data suggested that FcCTL might play an important role in shrimp immune and would be helpful to better understand the innate immunity mechanism of shrimp.
