Using thermophilic DNA-polymerase from Thermus thermophilus we have amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specific DNA sequences of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). DNA-polymerase from Thermus thermophilus (molecular mass of 80-86 kDa) differs in its physico-chemical properties from DNA-polymerase from Thermus aquaticus (molecular mass of 62-68 kDa). To amplify the specific EBV DNA sequence, oligonucleotide primers for the virus replicon region (oriP region) were used. As a result of amplification, a specific 405-bp DNA fragment was produced.
