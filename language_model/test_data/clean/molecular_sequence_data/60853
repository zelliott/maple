A mouse monoclonal antibody, anti-HM1.24 (IgG2a/kappa), binds to a surface antigen preferentially overexpressed on multiple myeloma (MM) cells, and exhibits potent antitumor cell activity against MM cells by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). To develop an antibody-based immunotherapy against MM, a humanized anti-HM1.24 antibody, in which all FRs correspond to naturally processed human FRs, has been successfully constructed with the aid of both the hybrid variable region and two-step design methods. This humanized anti-HM1.24 antibody (IgG1/kappa) is able to effectively induce ADCC against human myeloma KPMM2 and ARH77 cells in the presence of human PBMCs as effectively as a chimeric anti-HM1.24 antibody. The humanized anti-HM1.24 antibody, therefore, could be expected as a potent immunotherapeutic agent for MM patients.
