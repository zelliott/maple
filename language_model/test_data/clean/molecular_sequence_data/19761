The TolC mutant Tr63 of Sinorhizobium meliloti was generated by random Tn5 mutagenesis in the effective strain SKhM1-188. The mutant did not produce fluorescent halos in UV light on the LB medium containing calcofluor white, which suggests that modification occurred in the production of exopolysaccharide EPS1. Mutant Tr63 also manifested nonmucoidness both on minimal and low-phosphate MOPS media, and this was most likely connected with the absence of the second exopolysaccharide of S. meliloti (EPS2). The mutant was defective in symbiosis with alfalfa and formed on roots of host plants Medicago sativa and M. truncatula white round Fix- nodules or nodules of irregular shape. These nodules possessed the structure usually described for nodules of EPS1 mutants. According to the data of sequencing a DNA fragment of the mutant adjacent to the transposon, Tr63 contained a Tn5 insertion in gene SMc02082 located on the S. meliloti chromosome. This gene encodes the protein sharing homology with the TolC protein, a component of a type I secretion system responsible for the export of protein toxins and proteases in Gram-negative bacteria. The presence of proteins ExsH (endoglycanase of EPS1) and protein ExpE1 (essential for excretion of EPS2), which are known to be exported by the type I secretion system, was tested in cultural supernatants of mutant Tr63 and the parental strain by polyclonal antiserum analysis. It was ascertained that secretory proteins ExsH and ExpE1 are absent in the culture medium of mutant Tr63. The TolC protein of S. meliloti is assumed to be involved in the excretion of proteins ExsH and ExpE1.
