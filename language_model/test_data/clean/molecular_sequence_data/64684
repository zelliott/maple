We heterologously overproduced a hyperthermostable archaeal low potential (E(m) = -62 mV) Rieske-type ferredoxin (ARF) from Sulfolobus solfataricus strain P-1 and its variants in Escherichia coli to examine the influence of ligand substitutions on the properties of the [2Fe-2S] cluster. While two cysteine ligand residues (Cys(42) and Cys(61)) are essential for the cluster assembly and/or stability, the contributions of the two histidine ligands to the cluster assembly in the archaeal Rieske-type ferredoxin appear to be inequivalent as indicated by much higher stability of the His(64) --> Cys variant (H64C) than the His(44) --> Cys variant (H44C). The x-ray absorption and resonance Raman spectra of the H64C variant firmly established the formation of a novel, oxidized [2Fe-2S] cluster with one histidine and three cysteine ligands in the archaeal Rieske-type protein moiety. Comparative resonance Raman features of the wild-type, natural abundance and uniformly (15)N-labeled ARF and its H64C variant showed significant mixing of the Fe-S and Fe-N stretching characters for an oxidized biological [2Fe-2S] cluster with partial histidine ligation.
