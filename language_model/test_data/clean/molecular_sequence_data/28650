Chlorobium is an autotrophic, green phototrophic bacterium which uses reduced sulfur compounds to fix carbon dioxide in the light. The pathways for the oxidation of sulfide, sulfur, and thiosulfate have not been characterized with certainty for any species of bacteria. However, soluble cytochrome c-551 and flavocytochrome c (FCSD) have previously been implicated in the oxidation of thiosulfate and sulfide on the basis of enzyme assays in Chlorobium. We have now made a number of observations relating to the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds. (1) Western analysis shows that soluble cytochrome c-551 in Chlorobium limicola is regulated by thiosulfate, consistent with a role in the utilization of thiosulfate. (2) A membrane-bound flavocytochrome c-sulfide dehydrogenase (which is normally a soluble protein in other species) is constitutive and not regulated by sulfide as expected for an obligately autotrophic species dependent upon sulfide. (3) We have cloned the cytochrome c-551 gene from C. limicola and have found seven other genes, which are also presumably involved in sulfur metabolism and located near that for cytochrome c-551 (SoxA). These include genes for a flavocytochrome c flavoprotein homologue (SoxF2), a nucleotidase homologue (SoxB), four small proteins (including SoxX, SoxY, and SoxZ), and a thiol-disulfide interchange protein homologue (SoxW). (4) We have established that the constitutively expressed FCSD genes (soxEF1) are located elsewhere in the genome. (5) Through a database search, we have found that the eight thiosulfate utilization genes are clustered in the same order in the Chlorobium tepidum genome (www.tigr.org). Similar thiosulfate utilization gene clusters occur in at least six other bacterial species but may additionally include genes for rhodanese and sulfite dehydrogenase.
