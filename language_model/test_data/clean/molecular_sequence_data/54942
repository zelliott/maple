Aleutian mink disease parvovirus (AMDV) is a non-enveloped virus with a single-stranded DNA genome that causes a fatal, usually persistent immune complex disease in minks. In this study, a total of 18,654 serum samples were collected from minks that were farmed in China from 2009 to 2011. After testing by counter-current immunoelectrophoresis (CIE), the seroprevalence of AMDV was found to be 68.67 %. The results show that there is a serious epidemic among Chinese minks used for breeding. To gain detailed information regarding the molecular epidemiology of AMDV in China, nine strains of AMDV were isolated from mink samples that were collected from four of the primary mink farming areas in China. The full-length capsid protein VP2 gene from each strain was sequenced after PCR amplification, and a phylogenetic analysis was performed on the VP2 gene sequence, including the VP2 genes from the other 10 AMDV strains available in the GenBank database, which were submitted from the 1970s to 2009. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the AMDV isolates were divided into five independent clades. The Chinese AMDV strains were distributed among all five groups and showed a high level of genetic diversity. Over 50 % of the Chinese AMDV strains were classified into two clades that consisted only of isolates from China and that were distinct from AMDV strains found in other countries. This finding indicated that both local and imported ADMV species are prevalent in the Chinese mink farming population.
