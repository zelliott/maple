The glycosylation site and the structure of O-glycosylated oligosaccharide of recombinant human HGF were investigated. N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) in the alpha chain suggested the presence of O-glycosylated oligosaccharide. Sugar analysis and amino acid sequence analysis of peptide fragments produced by limited degradation revealed that O-glycosylated oligosaccharide linked to Thr445 of the alpha chain. The molecular weight of the oligosaccharide was determined with ion spray mass spectrometry. From these studies, the structure of the O-glycosylated oligosaccharide on the alpha chain of HGF was concluded as [formula: see text].
