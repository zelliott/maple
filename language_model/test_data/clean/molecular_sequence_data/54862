The reductive pyrimidine catabolic pathway is absent in Escherichia coli. However, the bacterium contains an enzyme homologous to mammalian dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. Here, we show that E. coli dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase is the first member of a novel NADH-dependent subclass of iron-sulfur flavoenzymes catalyzing the conversion of uracil to 5,6-dihydrouracil in vivo.
