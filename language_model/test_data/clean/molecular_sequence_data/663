To identify the genes involved in sperm motility.

We hybridized asthenospermia and normal motile sperm cDNA samples with the human whole genome Affymetrix chip to screen differentially expressed genes. Then we detected the mRNA expressions of the voltage-dependent anion channel genes (VDACs) in human organs and spermatozoa by RT-PCR and compared their expressions in the poor and normal motility spermatozoa.

Differentially expressed genes VDACs were identified by analysis of the hybridization signals, including the 3 subtypes VDAC1, VDAC2 and VDAC3. The expression of VDAC2 mRNA was significantly decreased in the poor motility sperm (0.568 +/- 0.036), as compared with the healthy men (0.803 +/- 0.043, P < 0.01).

The decreased expression of VDAC2 in the ejaculated spermatozoa is possibly associated with the reduction of sperm motility.
