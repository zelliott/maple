Aminoglycosides are antimicrobial agents used frequently in treatment of human and animal diseases caused by aerobic, gram-negative bacteria. Because of the toxicity of these compounds, considerable effort has been attributed to analysis of aminoglycoside content in drug preparations, in serum and urine specimen in therapeutic drug monitoring, and in edible animal tissues in residue control. The present review emphasizes the analytical problems associated with aminoglycoside analysis. Screening methods based on microbiological and immunological procedures were briefly discussed. Gas chromatography and especially high-performance liquid chromatography appeared the most widely used chemical methods for the analysis of these compounds. Due to lack of volatility, chromophore, and hydrophility of aminoglycosides, most methods applied derivatization for enhancement of their chromatographic characteristics. The applicability and advantages of the various derivatization procedures were discussed in detail. A wide variety of detection methods, including mass spectrometry have been used. Packed column separation was generally used for gas chromatographic separation. In liquid chromatography, reversed phase, ion pair, ion exchange, and normal phase separation has been employed. Mass spectrometry, as a detection method, was discussed in detail. Extraction procedures from body fluids and tissues were emphasized. The performance and the operational conditions of the methods were described and detailed information of the data was provided also in table format.
