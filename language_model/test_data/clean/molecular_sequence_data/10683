A cis -cleaving hammerhead ribozyme (Rz) expression system (3A'-Rz) in Escherichia coli has been constructed that can be used to study the involvement of factors that affect ribozyme cleavage in vivo . The ribozyme sequence is placed in the coding region of 3A' mRNA, which is expressed from a semi-synthetic translation assay gene. The size and the 5'-end sequences of the 3' cleavage fragments were determined and the efficiencies of different Rz variants were measured by quantitative primer extension. It is shown that one of the semi-active constructs (3A'-RzIII) can be used as an indicator for ribosomes that read through or terminate at a stop codon upstream of the Rz hammerhead sequence in the mRNA. Readthrough of the stop codon in an uncleaved mRNA gives a full length 3A' protein. Termination at the stop codon upstream of the ribozyme sequence gives a shortened termination product. However, the mRNA fragment that should arise as a result of the auto-cleavage does not give rise to any detectable corresponding truncated protein. Besides studies on translating ribosomes, the 3A'-Rz system can be used to isolate mutant strains that are changed in ribozyme activity either from internal base alterations, or changed interacting host factors.
