The amino acid sequences of two nuclear-encoded subunits of complex I from bovine heart mitochondria have been determined. Both proteins have an apparent molecular weight of 14.5 kDa and their N-alpha-amino groups are acetylated. They are known as subunits B14.5a and B14.5b. Neither protein is evidently related to any known protein and their functions are obscure. A total of 34 nuclear-encoded subunits of bovine complex I have now been sequenced and it is thought that the primary structure of the complex is now complete, although with such a complicated structure it is difficult to be certain that there are no other subunits remaining to be sequenced. Seven additional hydrophobic subunits of the enzyme are encoded in mitochondrial DNA, and therefore bovine heart complex I is an assembly of about 41 different proteins. If it is assumed that there is one copy of each protein in the assembly, these polypeptides contain 7,955 amino acids in their sequences, more than are found in the Escherichia coli ribosome, which contains 7,336 amino acids in its 32 polypeptides.
