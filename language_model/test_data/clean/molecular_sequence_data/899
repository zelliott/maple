Bone mineral density (BMD) is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. We previously reported the association of the RUNX2 A allele with increased bone mineral density (BMD) and protection against a common form of osteoporotic fracture within a Geelong population. We genotyped 991 women from a Scottish cohort to decipher the role of RUNX2 alleles in regulating BMD. The alleles of RUNX2 within the glutamine-alanine repeat were determined by MspA1I restriction digest. Allele frequencies estimated from Scottish cohort were G allele, 0.87 +/- 0.01; A allele, 0.08 +/- 0.01; and 11Ala alanine deletion allele, 0.05 +/- 0.01. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to adjust for the covariates weight and age for BMD at the femoral neck (FN). The A allele was associated with higher FN BMD (P = 0.035) within a postmenopausal subgroup of the population (n = 312). The effect of RUNX2 A alleles increased with increasing weight; A alleles were associated with FN BMD in those above the median BMI (BMI > 25), while no association was observed in thin/normal (BMI </= 25) postmenopausal women. Glutamine variants and an alanine insertion were identified within the group. These data suggest that the RUNX2 alleles are associated with BMD in a menopause- and weight-dependent manner.
