The gene responsible for Menkes syndrome has been assigned to Xq13 by a combination of comparative mapping and linkage analysis. A previous report has mapped the translocation breakpoint associated with the disease in a female patient to an interval delimited by PGK1 and a group of six more proximal Xq13 markers, including DXS56. We have characterized a number of PGK1- or DXS56-positive YACs, from which we have generated six new markers. One of them identifies a small overlap region between a PGK1-positive YAC and three DXS56-positive YACs, distal to the Menkes breakpoint. A 560-kb region covered by a DXS56-positive YAC has been restriction-mapped and subcloned, disclosing a 187-kb MluI fragment astride the breakpoint. A probe mapping distal to the rearrangement in the same interval reveals altered PGFE fragments in a hybrid constructed from the translocation patient's DNA. We describe the development of a cosmid contig extending 150 kb from a nearby CpG island across the breakpoint. This contig includes four adjacent clones displaying cross-specific hybridization.
