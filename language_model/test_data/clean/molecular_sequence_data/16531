A rare form of human ACAT1 mRNA, containing the optional long 5'-untranslated region, is produced as a 4.3-kelonucleotide chimeric mRNA through a novel interchromosomal trans-splicing of two discontinuous RNAs transcribed from chromosomes 1 and 7. To investigate its function, we express the chimeric ACAT1 mRNA in Chinese hamster ovary cells and show that it can produce a larger ACAT1 protein, with an apparent molecular mass of 56 kDa on SDS-PAGE, in addition to the normal, 50-kDa ACAT1 protein, which is produced from the ACAT1 mRNAs without the optional long 5'-untranslated repeat. To produce the 56-kDa ACAT1, acat1 sequences located at both chromosomes 7 and 1 are required. The 56-kDa ACAT1 can be recognized by specific antibodies prepared against the predicted additional amino acid sequence located upstream of the N-terminal of the ACAT1(ORF). The translation initiation codon for the 56-kDa protein is GGC, which encodes for glycine, as deduced by mutation analysis and mass spectrometry. Similar to the 50-kDa protein, when expressed alone, the 56-kDa ACAT1 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and is enzymatically active. The 56-kDa ACAT1 is present in native human cells, including human monocyte-derived macrophages. Our current results show that the function of the chimeric ACAT1 mRNA is to increase the ACAT enzyme diversity by producing a novel isoenzyme. To our knowledge, our result provides the first mammalian example that a trans-spliced mRNA produces a functional protein.
