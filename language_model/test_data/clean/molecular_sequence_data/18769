Strain DMKU-RK467(T), representing a novel yeast species, was isolated from the external surface of sugar cane leaves collected in Thailand. On the basis of morphological, biochemical, physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, and sequence analysis of the D1/D2 region of the LSU rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, strain DMKU-RK467(T) was assigned to a novel species of the genus Nakazawaea. The novel species was related most closely to the type strain of Candida wickerhamii but they differed by 1.9 % nucleotide substitutions in the D1/D2 region of the LSU rRNA gene and by 5.2 % nucleotide substitutions in the ITS region. The name Nakazawaea siamensis f.a., sp. nov. is proposed (type strain DMKU-RK467(T) = BCC 50734(T) = NBRC 108903(T) = CBS 12569(T)).
