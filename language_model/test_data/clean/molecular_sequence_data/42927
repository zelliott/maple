We examined the expression of GST pi mRNA in the P388/ADR and L1210/DDP resistant lines by using alpha-32p-labeled synthetic 45 bp for an anionic glutathione transferase (GST pi). The dot blot results showed that GST pi mRNA increased significantly (P < 0.01) by 1.28 and 1.57-fold in ADR-resistant cells (ADR resistant 23.6 and 44.4-fold) compared to sensitive cell line, whereas the L1210/DDP increased by 1.17-fold (P < 0.05). Further evidence of the expression of GST pi mRNA provided by Northern blot analysis indicated 1.28 and 1.41-fold increase in ADR resistant lines (resistant 23.6 and 44.4 fold). While Northern blot showed a 0.75 KB GST pi mRNA. Southern blot indicated that GST pi gene was represented by fragments of approximately 6.0 and 5.1 kb after DNA was digested with Hind III. Verapamil increased the expression of GST pi mRNA in P388/ADR adriamycin resistant lines.
