Two cortical rod proteins having molecular weights of 28.6 kDa and 30.5 kDa were isolated from the mature ovary of Marsupenaeus japonicus using gel filtration and reversed-phase HPLC. Analysis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 28.6 kDa molecule revealed that amino acid residues 1-21 corresponded to residues 9-29 of the 30.5 kDa molecule. Examination of homology using BLAST showed that 21 amino acids out of 29 residues of the 28.6 kDa molecule, and 14 out of 29 residues of the 30.5 kDa molecule were identical to that of the ovarian cortical rod proteins of Penaeus semisulcatus. Positive immunohistochemical reaction to antiserum raised against the 28.6 kDa protein was observed on cortical rods forming around the periphery of oocytes at the maturation stages. Western blotting analysis revealed that both the 28.6 kDa and 30.5 kDa molecules stained with the anti-28.6 kDa antiserum. Furthermore, the 28.6 kDa and 30.5 kDa proteins were both glycosylated, as evidenced by positive carbohydrate staining using Concanavalin A and production of positive PAS reaction. These results indicate that the cortical rods are comprised of the 28.6 kDa and 30.5 kDa molecules. We subsequently cloned two full-length cDNAs based on the N-terminal sequences of the 28.6 kDa and 30.5 kDa molecules. The open reading frame of 28.6 kDa and 30.5 kDa encoded 276 amino acid residues. Comparison analysis of the two cDNAs revealed that the location of the processing site and sequence of signal peptides differed, indicating that the two cDNAs are products of two separate genes and encode the 28.6 kDa molecule and 30.5 kDa molecule, respectively. Both proteins possessed one potential N-linked glycosylation site. It is considered that both molecules are components of the cortical rods, forming a jelly layer after fertilization.
