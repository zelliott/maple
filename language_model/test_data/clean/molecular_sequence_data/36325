Affinity chromatography has been extensively refined over the past few years to meet the more stringent criteria being placed on recombinant proteins as therapeutic products. New developments in the design of selective and stable ligands for affinity chromatography are establishing the technique as a routine tool in process-scale protein purification. Exploitation of sophisticated molecular modelling techniques in conjunction with binding and crystallographic studies has permitted the design of new, highly selective 'biomimetic' ligands for the target proteins.
