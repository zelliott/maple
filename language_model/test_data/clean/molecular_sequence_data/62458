Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (Angptl4) is a recently identified circulating protein expressed primarily in adipose tissue and liver. Also known as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma angiopoietin-related, fasting induced adipose factor, and hepatic fibrinogen/angiopoietin-related protein, recombinant Angptl4 causes increase of plasma very low density lipoprotein levels by inhibition of lipoprotein lipase activity. Similar to angiopoietins and other angiopoietin-like proteins, Angptl4 contains an amino-terminal coiled-coil domain and a carboxyl-terminal fibrinogen-like domain. We report here that Angptl4 is evolutionarily conserved among several mammalian species and that full-length Angptl4 protein is an oligomer containing intermolecular disulfide bonds. Oligomerized Angptl4 undergoes proteolytic processing to release its carboxyl fibrinogen-like domain, which circulates as a monomer. Angptl4's N-terminal coiled-coil domain mediates its oligomerization, which by itself is sufficient to form higher order oligomeric structure. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Angptl4 in 293 cells shows that conversion of full-length, oligomerized Angptl4 is mediated by a cell-associated protease activity induced by serum. These findings demonstrate a novel property of angiopoietin-like proteins and suggest that oligomerization and proteolytic processing of Angptl4 may regulate its biological activities in vivo.
