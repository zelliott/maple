Amphipathic helical peptides represent the lipid-binding units of the soluble plasma apolipoproteins. Several synthetic peptide analogues have been designed to mimic such structures and have been used to unravel some of the mechanisms involved in the physiological function of the apolipoproteins, including lipid binding, LCAT activation, and enhancement of cholesterol efflux from lipid-laden cells. A series of novel synthetic peptides, named ID peptides, was modeled on the basis of the structural properties common to the amphipathic helices of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I. In these new peptides, however, the segregation between hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces of the helices is more pronounced than in apoA-I, so that the surface of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces of the amphipathic helices is equal. Moreover, there are fewer negatively charged residues in the center of the hydrophilic face of the helical peptides. Most charged amino acids are located along the edge of the helix and are susceptible to forming salt bridges with residues of an antiparallel helix, such as around a discoidal phospholipid/peptide complex. The physicochemical characteristics of these peptides and their complexes with phospholipids were compared with those of the 18A peptide and its lipid/peptide complex. All ID peptides bind dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles more rapidly than the 18A peptide to yield discoidal peptide/phospholipid complexes of comparable size. The alpha-helical content of the lipid-free ID peptides is close to that of the 18A peptide and increases slightly on lipid binding. The stability of the ID and 18A peptides and of the phospholipid/peptide complexes against guanidinium hydrochloride denaturation is higher than that of lipid-free and lipid-bound apoA-I. LCAT activation by the 18A/phospholipid/cholesterol complexes equals that of apoA-I/ phospholipid/cholesterol complexes, whereas none of the ID peptides tested is able to activate LCAT to a significant extent. Incubation of the peptide/phospholipid complexes with lipid-laden macrophages induces cellular cholesterol efflux and incorporation of cholesterol into the complexes. The cholesterol efflux capacity of the peptide/phospholipid complexes is comparable among the peptides and higher than that of apoprotein/phospholipid complexes. In conclusion, although the amphipathicity of the new peptides is higher than that of the 18A model peptide, the lack of LCAT activation by the ID peptides suggests that an enhanced segregation of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, equal magnitude of hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces of the helix, and the absence of negatively charged residues in the central part of the hydrophilic face might account for the lack of LCAT activity of these peptides. These parameters do not affect the capacity of the peptide/phospholipid complexes to promote cellular cholesterol efflux.
