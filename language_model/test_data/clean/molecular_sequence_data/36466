In the kidney, adenosine plays important regulatory roles, including renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, renin secretion, tubuloglomerular feedback, tubular reabsorption of sodium and water, sympathetic neurotransmitter release, and erythropoietin secretion. These functions are mediated through adenosine 1 (A1)-receptors and adenosine 2 (A2)-receptors. These receptors couple to the inhibition and stimulation of adenylate cyclase, through Gi and Gs proteins, respectively. A variety of other effecter systems have been reported to be coupled to A1 receptors, including phospholipase C, phospholipase A2 and potassium, as well as Ca++ channels. Recently, A1 receptors, A2 receptors and novel A2 receptor have been cloned, sequenced and expressed. In association with the development of selective adenosine analogues, we are now ready to take up problems at the biochemical and molecular biological levels.
