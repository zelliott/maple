Low ratio hybridization subtraction technique was previously used in this laboratory to enrich and isolate a number of low abundance UV-inducible hamster transcripts (Fornace, A. J., Jr., Alamo, I. J., and Hollander, M. C. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 8800-8804) that led to the identification and cloning of five important hamster and human GADD genes (Fornace, A. J., Jr., Nebert, D. W., Hollander, M. C., Luethy, J. D., Papathanasiou, M., Fargnoli, J., and Holbrook, N. J. (1989) Mol. Cell. Biol. 9, 4196-4203). In this study we have characterized the remaining DNA damage-inducible (DDI) transcripts. Of the 24 DDI clones, 3 clones (A13, A20, and A113) representing different regions of the same hamster cDNA exhibited near perfect homology to human p21(WAF1/CIP1) cDNA. The DDI clones A26, A88, and A99 displayed very high sequence homologies with the human proliferating nuclear antigen, rat translation initiation factor-5 (eIF-5), and human thrombomodulin, respectively, whereas clones A29 and A121 matched with express sequence tagged sequences of unknown identity. The DDI clones A18, 106, and A107 were different isolates of the same hamster cDNA (hereafter referred to as A18) and displayed high sequence homology with the members in the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family. Using the hamster A18 partial-length cDNA as a probe, we screened human fibroblast cDNA library and isolated the corresponding full-length human cDNA. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that the putative protein contains all the canonical features of a novel glycine-rich hnRNP. The A18 mRNA levels were specifically increased in response to DNA damage induced by UV irradiation or UV mimetic agents. Thus the putative A18 hnRNP is the first hnRNP whose mRNA is specifically regulated in response to UV-induced DNA damage; accordingly, it may play some role in repair of UV-type DNA damage.
