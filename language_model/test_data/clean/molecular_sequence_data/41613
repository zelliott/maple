Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) is a circular ssDNA virus that causes psittacine beak and feather disease and has almost global presence. Here, we report for the first time the presence of in Nouvelle-Calédonie (New Caledonia). One hundred and sixty-eight exotic and 79 endemic birds were sampled in Nouvelle-Calédonie, 26 were found to be positive for BFDV. We characterized the full genomes of 26 isolates and phylogenetic analysis placed nine of the isolates into the BFDV-J strain, with the remaining 17 isolates from Deplanche's Rainbow Lorikeet (Trichoglossus haematodus deplanchii) forming a novel strain, BFDV-P. Of more concern was the discovery of an infected bird from the vulnerable and endemic New Caledonian Parakeet (Cyanoramphus saisseti). Our results reveal that there have been at least two introductions of BFDV into Nouvelle-Calédonie.
