Nucleotide sequences of the intron regions and UTRs (Untranslated regions) of the hemoglobin beta adult genes, b1 and b2, and of the intergenic spacer region were determined for mouse strains representing the d, p, and w1 hemoglobin haplotypes defined by protein electrophoretic analyses. The hypothesis of recombination of the b1 and b2 genes between the d and w1 haplotypes previously reported in the cDNA nucleotide sequences was confirmed by neighbor-joining analyses of the intron regions and UTRs within the b1 and b2 genes, suggesting that all of the structures of hemoglobin beta adult genes support the hypothesis that the p haplotype was established by hybridization between d and w1 haplotype mice. The resultant recombinant of the p haplotype was found to have a d-like b1 gene and a w1-like b2 gene. In addition to the possible recombination, a break point was suggested around 2-3 kb downstream of the b1 gene within the intergenic spacer region, despite the absence of clear properties that could stimulate the recombination machinery. Some large insertions or deletions (indels) specific to the p or d haplotypes were located within the intergenic spacer region, in which the 1010-bp indel specific to the p haplotype was shared by all examined strains representing the p haplotype.
