Dendrite morphology regulates how a postsynaptic neuron receives information from presynaptic neurons. The specific patterning of dendrite branches is promoted by extrinsic and intrinsic factors that trigger the activation of functional signaling pathways. However, most of the regulating factors and the biochemical mechanisms involved in regulating dendrite branching are unknown. Our laboratory previously reported that cypin (cytosolic PSD-95 interactor) plays an active role in regulating dendrite branching in hippocampal neurons. Cypin-promoted increases in dendrite number are dependent on guanine deaminase activity. In order to identify the specific structural role of zinc-binding in cypin-mediated dendrite branching and guanine deaminase activity, we employed computational homology modeling techniques to construct a three dimensional structural model of cypin. Analysis of the protein-ion sequestration scaffold of this model identified several histidines and aspartic acid residues responsible for zinc binding. Single substitution mutations in these specific sites completely disrupted the guanine deaminase enzymatic activity and rendered cypin unable to promote dendrite branching in rat hippocampal neurons. The specific zinc ion-binding function of each residue in the protein scaffold was also confirmed by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optic Emission Spectrometry. Inspection of our structural model confirmed that His82 and His84 coordinate with the zinc ion, together with His240, His279, and Asp330, residues that until now were unknown to play a role in this regard. Furthermore, promotion of dendrite branching by cypin is zinc-dependent.
