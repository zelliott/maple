The pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus infections is dependent upon expression of various virulence factors, which are under the control of multiple regulatory systems, including two-component regulatory systems and transcriptional regulators such as the SarA family of proteins. As a part of a continuing effort to understand the regulatory mechanisms that involve the SarA protein family, the regulation and physical characterization of rot transcription is described here. The rot gene, a member of the sarA family of genes, was previously characterized and has been shown to regulate a large number of genes. The rot locus is composed of multiple overlapping transcripts as determined by primer extension and was proposed to encode an open reading frame of 133 residues. Transcription of rot was significantly increased in the sarA mutant. Gel shift and transcriptional studies revealed that SarA could bind to the rot promoter region, probably acting as a repressor for rot transcription. The data indicate that the expression of rot transcription is significantly repressed only by SarA among the sarA family of mutants tested at the post-exponential phase of growth.
