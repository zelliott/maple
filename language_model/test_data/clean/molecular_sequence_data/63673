Until recently, it was believed that urodele amphibians are able to synthesize only two immunoglobulin isotypes, IgM and IgY. We reinvestigated this issue in the Iberian ribbed newt Pleurodeles waltl and reported recently that this urodele expresses at least three isotypes: IgM, IgP and IgY. In this study, we demonstrate that another urodele, Ambystoma mexicanum, has also a third isotype whose amino acid sequence presents the highest homology with the amino acid sequence of Xenopus IgX. This isotype has typical Ig H-chain characteristics, could form multimers and is mainly expressed in mucosal tissues thereby indicating that it is likely the physiological counterpart of Xenopus IgX and mammalian IgA. Interestingly, no IgP could be found in A. mexicanum, in contrast to P. waltl, in which IgX was not found in previous investigations. These data indicate, for the first time, that different families of urodeles can express different immunoglobulin isotypes.
