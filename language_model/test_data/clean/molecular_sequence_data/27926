A method of purification of rat liver cystathionase by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) utilizing non-ideal gel filtration method is proposed. Resolution factors-flow rate, pH values, ionic strength of the mobile phase-were optimized. Antibodies to the enzyme were purified using an immunosorbent synthesized on the basis of epoxylated Toyopearl-65. Radioimmunoassay and immunoblotting demonstrated antibody monospecificity towards cystathionase. These monospecific antibodies were utilized for detecting enzyme amounts (up to 30 pg) using the avidin-biotin system. Rat cDNA expression library in phage lambda gt11 was screened. The cystathionase cDNA clone was isolated, and the structure of the insert was determined.
