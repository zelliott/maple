A gene homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae AAC genes coding for mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers has been cloned from the pathogenic yeast Candida parapsilosis. A probe obtained by PCR amplification from C. parapsilosis DNA, using primers derived from the conserved transmembrane region of yeast ADP/ATP carriers, was used for screening of the C. parapsilosis genomic library. The cloned gene was sequenced and found to encode a polypeptide of 303 amino acids that shows homology with other yeast and fungal mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers. The gene was designated CpAAC1 and was able to complement the growth phenotypes of S. cerevisiae double deletion mutant (Deltaaac2; Deltaaac3). The expression of the CpAAC1 gene was reduced under semi-anaerobic conditions and it was affected at normal aerobic conditions by the nature of carbon sources used for growth. Hybridization experiments indicate that C. parapsilosis possesses a single gene encoding a mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier.
