Two rhamnobiose-lipid preparations have been studied by fast atom bombardment (FAB) tandem mass spectrometry. The principal rhamnobiose-lipids contain the beta-hydroxydecanoyl-beta-hydroxydecanoate Rha-Rha-C10-C10 and the beta-hydroxytetradecanoyl-beta-hydroxytetradecanoate Rha-Rha-C14-C14. Both preparations contain minor components which are heterogenous in beta-hydroxy fatty acid composition. FAB ionization of rhamnobiose-lipids in the presence of Na+ shows the formation of both [M + Na]+, [M +2Na-H]+, [M + 3Na-2H]+ and [M - H]- ions. Tandem mass spectrometry of the [M + 2Na-H]+ and [M - H]- ions give information about the sequence of the building blocks. Particularly, heterogeneity in beta-hydroxy fatty acid composition is determined for the principal components and all the minor components present in the preparations.
