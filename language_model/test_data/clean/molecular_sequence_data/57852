Investigation of the roots of Polygonatum prattii afforded three new steroid glycosides, paratiosides A-C, and three new prosapogenins, pratiosides D1, E1 and F1. The latter three, which were obtained from the enzymatic hydrolysis products of a glycoside mixture, are considered to be the corresponding spirostanol glycosides of their proto-type furostanol ones in the plant. The structures of these compounds were established by chemical and spectral methods. It is noted that pratioside C possessing a 3,27-di-O-sugar chain is the first example to be isolated from a natural source.
