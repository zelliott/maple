The HPS-1 gene is the first gene found to be responsible for the autosomal recessive disorder Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS). HPS is characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, a platelet storage pool deficiency, and ceroid lipofuscinosis. The HPS-1 gene has been mapped to chromosome 10q23.1-23.3 and encodes a 79-kDa protein of unknown function with no homology to any known protein. A sequence database search has revealed that a portion of clone HS 1119A7 shows high sequence similarity to HPS-1 cDNA. By performing sequence alignments and PCR amplification of cDNA from several human tissues, we have shown that part of this clone consists of an unprocessed partial HPS-1 pseudogene located on chromosome 22q12.2-12.3. The pseudogene contains several intact HPS-1 exons and shows 95% sequence homology to the HPS-1 cDNA. Exon 6 of the pseudogene has 100% sequence homology to exon 6 of HPS-1 itself. In the pseudogene, this exon is surrounded by portions of both its normal flanking introns. These data provide the first characterization of an HPS-1 pseudogene, called HPS1-psi1. During amplification of exon 6 of the HPS-1 gDNA for mutation identification, the pseudogene might also be amplified, leading to a false positive for mutation. In addition, amplification of specific parts of the HPS-1 cDNA (e.g., exons 2-5) for mutation detection might lead to false positives for mutations, if the cDNA is contaminated with gDNA. This calls for caution when employing these screening approaches.
