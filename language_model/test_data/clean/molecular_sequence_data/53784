This work presents a full tertiary model of the M.BssHII methyltransferase (MTase) complexed with substrate DNA and cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine, built by homology modelling based on previously solved complete structures of DNA MTases M.HaeIII and M. HhaI. M.BssHII and the template proteins show high sequence similarity, which indicates that they are evolutionary related. However, they are topologically different: M.BssHII is a circularly permuted variant of template MTases (Xu et al. Nucleic Acids Res 1997;25:3991). The model developed in this work will be a good starting point and valuable help in designing mutagenesis experiments to better understand the biological function of methyltransferases and the process of domain swapping.
