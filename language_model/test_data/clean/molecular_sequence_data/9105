Petroleum and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) degrading Streptomyces sp. isolate ERI-CPDA-1 was recovered from oil contaminated soil in Chennai, India. The degradation efficiencies were examined by GC-FID and the results showed that the isolate could remove 98.25% diesel oil, 99.14% naphthalene and 17.5% phenanthrene in 7 days at 30Â°C (0.1%). ERI-CPDA-1 was able to degrade naphthalene, phenanthrene and diesel oil and grow on petrol, diesel, kerosene, benzene, pyridine, methanol, ethanol, cyclohexane, tween-80, xylene, DMSO and toluene using them as sole carbon source. Effects of environmental condition on degradation of hydrocarbons (diesel oil, naphthalene and phenanthrene) were also studied at different pH, NaCl, temperature, concentration and incubation time. Degradation pathway for naphthalene has been proposed. Degradation metabolites were identified using GC-MS analysis of ethyl acetate extract of the cell free culture. The degradation products detected were benzaldehyde, catechol, phenylacetic acid and protocatechuic acid.
