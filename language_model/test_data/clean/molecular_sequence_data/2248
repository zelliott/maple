Previous studies from this laboratory (Brooker, R. J., and Slayman, C. W. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 222-226; Davenport, J. W., and Slayman, C. W. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 16007-16013) have used the sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) to define two sites on the Neurospora plasma membrane H+-ATPase: a "fast" site which reacts in several minutes with no loss of enzymatic activity and a "slow" site which reacts in tens of minutes to produce complete inactivation of the enzyme. The slow site is protected when MgATP or MgADP is bound to the catalytic site of the ATPase. The present study demonstrates that the fluorescent reagent 5-[2-iodoacetamido)ethyl)-1-aminonaphthalenesulfonic acid (IAEDANS) can be used to label five of the eight cysteine residues of the Neurospora ATPase (Cys376, Cys409, Cys472, Cys532, Cys545). Tryptic peptides bearing those residues have been purified by high performance liquid chromatography and located within the known primary structure of the ATPase by amino acid analysis and/or sequencing. By pretreating the enzyme with NEM in the presence or absence of MgADP before incubation with IAEDANS, it has been possible to identify the fast NEM site as Cys545 and the slow MgADP-protectable NEM site as Cys532. Both residues lie within the central hydrophilic domain of the protein, close to a highly conserved stretch of amino acids that may be involved in nucleotide binding. However, all five IAEDANS-reactive cysteines can be nearly completely modified by the less bulky sulfhydryl reagent methyl methanethiosulfonate with less than 20% inhibition of enzyme activity; thus, none of the five cysteines can be considered to play a direct role in the reaction cycle of the ATPase.
