We previously developed an efficient route to humanized F(ab')2 fragments by high level secretion of the Fab' arms from Escherichia coli followed by directed chemical coupling in vitro. Here the number and type of interchain linkages in F(ab')2 molecules has been modified to simplify their production and improve their serum stability. All F(ab')2 variants had comparable binding affinity for the p185HER2 Ag and antiproliferative activity against p185HER2-overexpressing tumor cells. This was anticipated since the modifications are distant from the Ag-binding loops. Replacement of a single disulfide bridge between Fab' arms with a more stable thioether bridge increased the serum permanence time in normal mice by threefold to 2.1 h. Removal of the disulfide bond between L and H chains in the thioether-bridged F(ab')2 did not affect the pharmacokinetics, suggesting that the L chain remains associated with the H chain. An additional Fab' variant containing three repeats of the motif, CysProPro, was constructed with the aim of promoting efficient formation of F(ab')2 in E. coli. This Fab' (CPP)3 variant was recovered predominantly (up to 70%) as F(ab')2 directly from fermentation cell pastes, thus circumventing the need for in vitro coupling. The F(ab')2 (CPP)3 variant has a similar serum pharmacokinetics to the thioether-bridged molecules. The improvements described here for deriving F(ab')2 fragments from E. coli should enhance the clinical potential of these molecules.
