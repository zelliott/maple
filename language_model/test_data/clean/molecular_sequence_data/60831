Three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) generated against rainbow trout gonad cells (RTG-2) have been selected for their ability to protect cells from the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infection, a salmonid rhabdovirus. Protection from infection was restricted to the salmonid-derived cell lines indicating species specificity of the blocking MAbs. Surprisingly, the blocking activity of these MAbs was also effective against other nonantigenically related fish rhabdoviruses. Indirect immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy observations demonstrated that the three MAbs were all directed against an abundant cell plasma membrane component, and immunoprecipitation studies indicated that the target consisted of a heterodimeric complex with molecular masses of 200 and 44 kDa. Biochemical data provided the following evidence that fibronectin is part of this complex and that it could represent the main receptor for fish rhabdoviruses. (i) An antiserum generated against the 200-kDa protein reacted against the recombinant rainbow trout fibronectin expressed in Escherichia coli. (ii) The purified rainbow trout fibronectin was able to bind specifically to VHSV. To our knowledge, this is the first identification of a cellular component acting as a primary receptor for a virus replicating in lower vertebrates and, more interestingly, for viruses belonging to the Rhabdoviridae family.
