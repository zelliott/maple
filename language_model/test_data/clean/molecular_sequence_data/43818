The SOX gene family consists of a large number of embryonically expressed genes capable of encoding putative transcription factors and related by a DNA-binding domain, the HMG-box. We cloned and characterized the ovine SOX2 transcript using the screening of a testis (12dpp) cDNA library with a probe containing the SRY-HMG-box and we performed 3'RACE experiments. The ovine SOX2 sequence is strongly conserved in comparison to the human, mouse and chicken homologues and is located on sheep chromosome 1q33. The SOX2 expression pattern in developing gonads is consistent with the hypothesis that this gene plays a role in the germ cell line.
