Genotyping and phylogenetic analysis of parvovirus B19 isolates isolated on the territories of Northwestern Federal District (NWFD) of Russia.

61 blood sera and 30 oropharyngeal lavages obtained from patients with maculopapular rash from various territories of NWFD were studied for the presence of parvovirus B 19 DNA (PVB 19). DNA isolation and amplification was carried out by standard techniques. DNA segment including fragment of non-structural gene NS1 and region of structural gene VPI (NS1-VPlu, 994 nucleotides) was sequenced, original sequences ofoligonucleotide primers were selected for this purpose. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out online on the website http://www.phylogeny.fr. Data for tree construction was obtained from GenBank.

PVB 19 DNAwas detected in 45% ofsamples. PVB19 genome segment was sequenced in 8 samples. All the PVB 19 isolates belong to a single cluster of 1A genotype. Isolate 57.12 from Komi Republic is similar to ISR-G strain isolated from Israel.

Phylogenetic analysis showed a high degree of genetic similarity between PVB 19 isolates circulating on the territories of NWFD, their membership in the most widespread genotype in the world. Local and import cases ofparvovirus infection (PVI) were identified. The authors make a conclusion on the necessity to include PVI into the system of rubella and measles control.
