The surface metalloproteinase, gp63, is highly conserved and immunogenic. A peptide spanning the zinc-binding region of the molecule is immunogenic and can induce protective immunity in mice against Leishmania major infection. We report here that the minimum length of the immunogenic peptide in this region is a heptapeptide, VVTHEMA, corresponding to residues 161-167. Optimal immunogenicity is conferred by a decapeptide, LVTVVTHEMA, corresponding to residues 158 to 167, where H and E are consensus zinc-binding residues. These two residues determine the specificity of the peptide. The next two residues, M and A are necessary for the immunogenicity of the peptide. These results suggest that the zinc-binding residues are recognized by the T-cell receptor complex, while the two adjacent residues are involved in the peptide presentation by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule.
