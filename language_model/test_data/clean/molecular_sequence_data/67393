A case report and review of literature is reported of a rare case of fungal keratitis from eastern India. A 32-year-old woman with a history of vegetative trauma presented with keratitis in left eye. Microbiological examination of corneal scraping showed refractile hyphae with aseptate branching filaments and black pigmented colonies on multiple solid agar medium. Organism was identified from culture using D1/D2 region of LSU (Large Sub Unit: 28S rDNA)-based molecular technique. PCR amplified a band with a sequence that was 100 % homologous with Lasiodiplodia theobromae. The organism was susceptible to amphotericin B and voriconazole and demonstrated resistance to itraconazole and fluconazole. A therapeutic keratoplasty was performed following non-responsiveness to initial topical voriconazole (2 %) therapy. Recurrence in graft was controlled with topical voriconazole and intracameral amphotericin B. However, the graft failed at the end of 3 months. L. theobromae is a rare cause of fungal keratitis. Management of these cases is difficult, often involving surgical procedures.
