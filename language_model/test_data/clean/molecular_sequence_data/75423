The last two steps in the de novo biosynthesis of UMP are catalyzed by orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT; orotidine-5'-phosphate:pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase; EC 2.4.2.10) and orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (orotidine-5'-phosphate carboxy-lyase; EC 4.1.1.23). In mammals these two activities are found in a single, bifunctional protein called UMP synthase. A human T-lymphoblastic cell cDNA library constructed in lambda gt10 was screened with a UMP synthase-specific rat cDNA probe. Human UMP synthase cDNAs were isolated and then used to select UMP synthase gene fragments. The complete coding sequence of the mRNA for UMP synthase was determined by analysis of overlapping cDNA and genomic fragments. One of the cDNAs appears to have been synthesized from an incompletely or alternatively processed form of the UMP synthase mRNA. This cDNA lacks a poly(A) tail and has an extended 3'-nontranslated region that hybridizes with larger forms of the UMP synthase mRNA. The UMP synthase protein is composed of 480 amino acids with a molecular weight of 52,199. The two activities of UMP synthase reside in distinct domains encoded by the 3' and 5' halves of the mRNA. The COOH-terminal 258 amino acids of the human UMP synthase protein contain the orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase catalytic domain. This region is highly homologous to the mouse orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase sequence. The NH2-terminal 214 amino acids contain the OPRT domain. There is amino acid homology between this protein domain and specific regions of the Escherichia coli OPRT. The human OPRT domain also contains the putative catalytic site common to other human phosphoribosyltransferases.
