Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are a group of short, membrane-permeable cationic peptides that represent a nonviral technology for delivering nanomaterials and macromolecules into live cells. In this study, two arginine-rich CPPs, HR9 and IR9, were found to be capable of entering rotifers. CPPs were able to efficiently deliver noncovalently associated with cargoes, including plasmid DNAs, red fluorescent proteins (RFPs), and semiconductor quantum dots, into rotifers. The functional reporter gene assay demonstrated that HR9-delivered plasmid DNAs containing the enhanced green fluorescent protein and RFP coding sequences could be actively expressed in rotifers. The 1-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenylformazan assay further confirmed that CPP-mediated cargo delivery was not toxic to rotifers. Thus, these two CPPs hold a great potential for the delivery of exogenous genes, proteins, and nanoparticles in rotifers.
