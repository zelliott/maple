Two soybean ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit (SSU) genes, SRS1 and SRS4, are highly homologous over a region that includes 4 kb of 5' and 1 kb of 3' flanking sequences. The expression of these genes was compared using synthetic oligonucleotide probes. Analysis of a soybean leaf cDNA library indicates that SRS1 and SRS4 are the most highly expressed members of the soybean SSU gene family. Similar changes were observed in the RNA levels for these genes in response to white light, far-red light and darkness, although SRS1 was expressed at a four-fold higher level in total RNA than SRS4 under all conditions. However, nuclear run-on assays indicate that SRS1 is transcribed at a lower rate than SRS4, which suggests that SRS1 RNA is more stable. S1 nuclease analysis and oligonucleotide directed RNase H cleavage indicate that transcripts from both genes are polyadenylated within two principle regions separated by 35 nt. Sequence analysis of 16 independent cDNA clones identified seven different polyadenylation sites, and six of these sites lie within these two regions. Although SRS1 RNA was poorly recovered during poly(A)+ fractionation, RNase H cleavage experiments showed that transcripts from SRS1 and SRS4 had similar poly (A) tail lengths ranging from 0 to 220 nt. In addition, and despite differences in the untranslated leader sequences, SRS1 and SRS4 RNAs are assembled into polysomes with equal efficiencies. The overall similarity in expression patterns for these two genes further illustrates the coordinate evolution of individual members of a SSU gene family and is consistent with the proposal that gene conversion homogenizes both the coding and regulatory regions of these genes.
