For important food crops such as wheat and rice, grain yield depends on grain number and size. In rice (Oryza sativa), GW2 was isolated from a major quantitative trait locus for yield and encodes an E3 RING ligase that negatively regulates grain size. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) has TaGW2 homologues in the A, B, and D genomes, and polymorphisms in TaGW2-A were associated with grain width. Here, to investigate TaGW2 function, RNA interference (RNAi) was used to down-regulate TaGW2 transcript levels. Transgenic wheat lines showed significantly decreased grain size-related dimensions compared with controls. Furthermore, TaGW2 knockdown also caused a significant reduction in endosperm cell number. These results indicate that TaGW2 regulates grain size in wheat, possibly by controlling endosperm cell number. Wheat and rice GW2 genes thus seem to have divergent functions, with rice GW2 negatively regulating grain size and TaGW2 positively regulating grain size. Analysis of transcription of TaGW2 homoeologues in developing grains suggested that TaGW2-A and -D act in both the division and late grain-filling phases. Furthermore, biochemical and molecular analyses revealed that TaGW2-A is a functional E3 RING ubiquitin ligase with nucleocytoplasmic subcellular partitioning. A functional nuclear export sequence responsible for TaGW2-A export from the nucleus to the cytosol and retention in the nucleolus was identified. Therefore, these results show that TaGW2 acts in the regulation of grain size and may provide an important tool for enhancement of grain yield.
