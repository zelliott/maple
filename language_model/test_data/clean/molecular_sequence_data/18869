The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) serves as a docking factor for some adenovirus (AdV) types and group B coxsackieviruses. Its role in AdV internalization is unclear as studies suggest that its intracellular domain is dispensable for some AdV infection. We previously showed that in motor neurons, AdV induced CAR internalization and co-transport in axons, suggesting that CAR was linked to endocytic and long-range transport machineries. Here, we characterized the mechanisms of CAR endocytosis in neurons and neuronal cells. We found that CAR internalization was lipid microdomain-, actin-, and dynamin-dependent, and subsequently followed by CAR degradation in lysosomes. Moreover, ligands that disrupted the homodimeric CAR interactions in its D1 domains triggered an internalization cascade involving sequences in its intracellular tail.
