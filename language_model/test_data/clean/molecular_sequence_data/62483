Bacteriological investigations of seals of the German North and Baltic seas resulted in the isolation of bacteria of the genus Streptococcus belonging to Lancefield's serological groups C, F, and L. According to biochemical, serological, and 16S ribosomal DNA analysis, the group C and group F streptococci were identified as Streptococcus phocae. The group L streptococci could be classified as Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae.
