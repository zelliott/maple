We have examined the activity of the Xenopus heat-shock transcription factor (HSF) in extracts from stressed and unstressed embryos at various stages of development using DNA mobility shift analysis. A specific interaction between HSF and a synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to the proximal heat-shock element (HSE) of the Xenopus HSP70B gene was greatly enhanced in heat-shocked embryos compared to controls. HSF binding was inducible at all developmental stages examined including pre-midblastula transition (MBT) stages which are incapable of expressing HSP genes. In time-course experiments with both cleavage and neurula stage embryos, the activation of HSF binding was rapid and transient. Removal of cleavage and neurula stage embryos from heat stress resulted in a rapid loss of binding activity. The molecular mass of HSF, as determined by comparative gel electrophoresis of photoaffinity-labeled factor was 88 x 10(3) in both heat-shocked cleavage and neurula stage embryos. These experiments suggest that maternally derived HSF is stored in pre-MBT embryos in a heat-activatable form and may function in the regulation of heat-shock genes immediately after the MBT.
