A systematic analysis reveals that out of 20 protein kinases examined, specific for either Ser/Thr or Tyr, the majority are extremely sensitive to staurosporine, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. A few of them however, notably protein kinases CK1 and CK2, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and protein-tyrosine kinase CSK, are relatively refractory to staurosporine inhibition, exhibiting IC50 values in the micromolar range. With all protein kinases tested, namely PKA, CK1, CK2, MAP kinase (ERK-1), c-Fgr, Lyn, CSK and TPK-IIB/p38Syk, staurosporine inhibition was competitive with respect to ATP, regardless of its inhibitory power. In contrast, either uncompetitive or noncompetitive kinetics of inhibition with respect to the phosphoacceptor substrate were exhibited by Ser/Thr and Tyr-specific protein kinases, respectively, consistent with a different mechanism of catalysis by these two sub-families of kinases. Computer modeling based on PKA crystal structure in conjunction with sequence analysis suggest that the low sensitivity to staurosporine of CK2 may be accounted for by the bulky nature of three residues, Val66, Phe113 and Ile174 which are homologous to PKA Ala70, Met120 and Thr183, respectively. In contrast these PKA residues are either conserved or replaced by smaller ones in protein kinases highly sensitive to staurosporine inhibition. On the other hand, His160 which is homologous to PKA Glu170, appears to be responsible for the unique behaviour of CK2 with respect to a staurosporine derivative (CGP44171A) bearing a negatively charged benzoyl substituent: while CGP44171A is 10- 100-fold less effective than staurosporine against PKA and most of the other protein kinases tested, it is actually more effective than staurosporine for CK2 inhibition, but it looses part of its efficacy if it is tested on a CK2 mutant (H160D) in which His160 has been replaced by Asp. It can be concluded from these data that the catalytic sites of protein kinases are divergent enough as to allow a competitive inhibitor like staurosporine to be fairly selective, a feature that can be enhanced by suitable modifications designed based on the structure of the catalytic site of the kinase.
