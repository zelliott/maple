MRP1 (or ABCC1) is an ABC membrane protein that transports a wide range of natural products as well as glutathione (GSH)-, glucuronate-, and sulfate-conjugated metabolites. In addition, free GSH is required for MRP1 to transport several chemotherapeutic drugs. However, the mechanisms regulating the influence of GSH on MRP1 is poorly understood, and the location of GSH binding site(s) within MRP1 have yet to be determined. To address these issues, we have synthesized a [(125)I] labeled azido-derivative of GSH (IAAGSH) to photoaffinity label MRP1. Our results revealed that IAAGSH labeled MRP1 with high specificity, and binding was inhibited by MRP1 substrates leukotriene C(4) and MK571. Interestingly, verapamil and vincristine enhanced IAAGSH photolabeling of MRP1, in agreement with observations that both drugs enhance GSH transport. We observed GSH to be the best inhibitor of photoaffinity labeling, as compared to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and four different GSH alkyl derivatives. These observations indicate that IAAGSH interacted with MRP1 in a similar manner as unmodified GSH. Moreover, using eight MRP1-HA variants, each containing hemagglutinin A (HA) epitopes inserted at different sites in MRP1, we mapped the GSH binding sites in MRP1. Our GSH analogue photoaffinity labeled four MRP1 polypeptides that were located within two cytoplasmic domains in linker sequences (L0 and L1) as well as transmembrane domains 10-11 and 16-17. The photoaffinity labeling of polypeptides within L0 and L1 domains is further confirmed using two MRP1-specific monoclonal antibodies (MRPr1 and QCRL1) with epitopes within the linker domains. Taken together, this study provides the most precise information to date on the location of GSH binding sites in MRP1.
