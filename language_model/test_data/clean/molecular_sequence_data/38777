We report the organization of a grapevine chimeric gene Adhr-Vine-1, composed by an Adhr gene, into which a retroelement, Vine-1, was inserted. Sequence analysis revealed that Adhr is a member of the Adh multigene family, but does not correspond to any other grapevine Adh described to date. Vine-1, albeit defective, is the most complete LTR (long terminal repeat)-retrotransposon-like element described in Vitis vinifera L. It is 2392 bp long, with two almost identical LTRs (287 bp) in the same orientation, and flanked by direct repeats of a 5 bp host DNA. This element presents other features, characteristic of retroviruses and retrotransposons including inverted repeats, a primer binding site, and a polypurine tract. It has a single open reading frame (ORF) of 581 amino acids, potentially encoding for a gag protein and parts of the protease and integrase proteins. Vine-1 is most likely related to the copia-like type family, but with no significant similarity to any previously described plant retrotransposon or inserted element, nor to any eukaryotic element described to date. Vine-1 element has been found in Adhr at the same location in different V. vinifera cultivars, but not in some other analyzed Vitis species. These data suggest that Vine-1 insertion in Adhr is specific to V. vinifera, and has occurred after the Adh isogene separation, but prior to cultivar development. Sequences related to Vine-1 were revealed in multiple copies in the V. vinifera genome and, to a lesser extent, in other analyzed Vitis species. The polymorphism observed prompts us to question the role played by transposition in the evolution of the Vitis genus.
