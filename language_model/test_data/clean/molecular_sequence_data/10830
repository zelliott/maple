The hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural region 5A (NS5A) protein, without its 146 amino-terminal amino acids and fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4, strongly activates transcription in yeast and human hepatoma cells. Transcriptional activation by the HCV NS5A protein may play a role in viral replication and hepatocarcinogenesis.
