The chromosomes of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) contain a considerable amount of heterochromatin located at the centromeres and/or telomeres of several chromosomes, including a sex-specific block located distally on the X chromosome. In order to investigate further the repetitive DNAs of lake trout, genomic DNA from a female was size fractionated (<600 bp) with the restriction endonuclease AluI and fragments were cloned into the bacteriophage M13. A total of 42 clones were isolated. Relative copy number of individual inserts within the lake trout genome was estimated by Southern analysis. Twelve clones were determined to be highly repetitive and were chosen for further investigation. Inserts of these clones contained sequences similar to the AluI/RsaI, EcoRI/DraI, DraI/BstEII, and MboI/BglII families reported from Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus). The chromosomal location of several of these fragments was determined in lake trout by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Two related AluI/RsaI sequences (Type A, approximately 140 bp, and Type B,approximately 120 bp) showed differential hybridization. Type A hybridized to the centromeres of all metacentric as well as several acrocentric chromosomes. Type B hybridized to the centromeres of most acrocentric chromosomes. A sequence with homology to the EcoRI/DraI family hybridized to the centromeres of several acrocentric chromosomes. Sequences with partial similarity to the DraI/BstEII family hybridized to the major rDNA sites (nucleolar organizer regions, NORs) and several minor telomeric sites. The interstitial and telomeric heterochromatin of lake trout, including that of the X chromosome, appears to comprise sequences belonging to the MboI/BglII family.
