A 591 bp portion of the HindIII H (pZVH14) fragment of human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) strains GS (type A) and R-147 (type B) DNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers. While AluI cleaved the amplified DNA of both types of HHV-6, EcoRV cut the type A but not the type B DNA; vice versa, HaeIII cleaved the type B but not the type A DNA.
