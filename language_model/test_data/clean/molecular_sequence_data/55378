Bacteria capable of degrading the pesticide, cadusafos, were isolated from agricultural soil using an enrichment method. In this way, five distinct cadusafos-degrading strains of Pseudomonas putidia were isolated, and were characterized using morphological and biochemical analysis, as well as 16S rRNA sequencing. Strain PC1 exhibited the greatest cadusafos degradation rate and was consequently selected for further investigation. Degradation of cadusafos by strain PC1 was rapid at 20 and 37Â°C, but was greatly reduced (~1.5-fold) by the presence of carbon sources. Strain PC1 was able to effectively degrade cadusafos in sterilized soil using low inoculum levels. The maximum degradation rate of cadusafos (V ( max )) was calculated as 1.1 mg l(-1 )day(-1), and its saturation constant (K ( s )) was determined as 2.5 mg l(-1). Bacteria such as strain PC1, that use cadusafos as a carbon source, could be employed for the bioremediation of sites contaminated with pesticides.
