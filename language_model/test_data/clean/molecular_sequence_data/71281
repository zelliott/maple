A chromosomal locus encoding biosynthetic genes for a putative peptide synthetase of Pseudomonas fluorescens was identified and cloned. To achieve this, two sets of degenerated oligonucleotide primers KAGGA:SGTTG and TGD:LGG were used in PCR. These primers were selected based on highly conserved units of known peptide synthetases involved in adenylation and thiolation regions of Bacillus subtilis. The discrete amplified bands from PCR ca. 300 bp for KAGGA:SGTTG and ca. 500 bp for TGD:LGG proved to be integral part of the genomic DNA of P. fluorescens were cloned and sequenced. Sequence alignments of both fragments confirmed the putative peptide synthetase genes in P. fluorescens. The present study describes the identification and cloning of peptide synthetase genes of P. fluorescens, which can be used to identify a genetic locus encoding peptide synthetase in other microbial species.
