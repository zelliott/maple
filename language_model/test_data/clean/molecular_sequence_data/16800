We identified four Lhc-like genes (Lhl) encoding proteins that are distant relatives of light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding (LHC) proteins in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Their mRNA levels after transfer from low-intensity light to high-intensity light (HL) were examined and compared with those of Lhc genes encoding LHC proteins of PSII. The transfer caused a decrease in the mRNA level of Lhl3, a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana Lil3, within 2 h, followed by gradual restoration depending on the intensity of HL. The response was similar to that of Lhc genes. In contrast, the mRNA levels of Lhl1, Lhl2 and Lhl4 significantly increased, reached a maximum within 1 h after the transfer and then rapidly returned to a low level. The intensity of HL little influenced the response of these genes. While the Lhl1 and Lhl2 proteins were homologs of early light-inducible protein (ELIP) and high-light-inducible protein (HLIP), respectively, Lhl4 encoded a novel protein. The HL-induced expression of Lhl4 was most prominent among the genes tested. Studies using various inhibitors indicate that the HL response is not mediated by the redox state of plastoquinone pool or reactive oxygen species, but required de novo protein synthesis in the cytosol.
