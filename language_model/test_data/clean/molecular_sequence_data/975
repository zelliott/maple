All fully sequenced baculovirus genomes, with the exception of the dipteran Culex nigripalpus nucleopolyhedrovirus (CuniNPV), have previously been from Lepidoptera. This study reports the sequencing and characterization of a hymenopteran baculovirus, Neodiprion lecontei nucleopolyhedrovirus (NeleNPV), from the redheaded pine sawfly. NeleNPV has the smallest genome so far published (81,755 bp) and has a GC content of only 33.3%. It contains 89 potential open reading frames, 43 with baculovirus homologues, 6 identified by conserved domains, and 1 with homology to a densovirus structural protein. Average amino acid identity of homologues ranged from 19.7% with CuniNPV to 24.9% with Spodoptera exigua nucleopolyhedrovirus. The conserved set of baculovirus genes has dropped to 29, since NeleNPV lacks an F protein homologue (ac23/ld130). NeleNPV contains 12 conserved lepidopteran baculovirus genes, including that for DNA binding protein, late expression factor 11 (lef-11), polyhedrin, occlusion derived virus envelope protein-18 (odv-e18), p40, and p45, but lacks 21 others, including lef-3, me53, immediate early gene-1, lef-6, pp31, odv-e66, few polyhedra 25k, odv-e25, protein kinase-1, fibroblast growth factor, and ubiquitin. The lack of identified baculovirus homologues may be due to difficulties in identification, differences in host-virus interactions, or other genes performing similar functions. Gene parity plots showed limited colinearity of NeleNPV with other baculoviruses, and phylogenetic analysis indicates that NeleNPV may have existed before the lepidopteran nucleopolyhedrovirus and granulovirus divergence. The creation of two new Baculoviridae genera to fit hymenopteran and dipteran baculoviruses may be necessary.
