Glycogenin, the protein primer required for the biogenesis of muscle glycogen, has been isolated from rabbit liver glycogen. The protein comprised 0.0025% of liver glycogen by mass, 200-fold lower than the glycogenin content of muscle glycogen. Structural analyses, including determination of the amino acid sequence surrounding the glucosylated-tyrosine residue, showed identity with muscle glycogenin. Catalytically active liver glycogenin was partially purified and, like the skeletal muscle protein, catalysed an intramolecular, Mn2+- and UDP-Glc-dependent autoglucosylation reaction, forming a primer on which glycogen synthase could act. The results demonstrate that hepatic and muscle glycogenins are almost certainly identical proteins and that liver and skeletal muscle share a common mechanism for the biogenesis of glycogen molecules. The results also indicate that there is about one glycogenin molecule/liver glycogen alpha particle.
