Tir of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) or enterohemorrahgic E. coil (EHEC) is translocated by a type III secretion system to the host cell membranes where it serves as a receptor for the binding of a second bacterial membrane protein. In response to the binding, EPEC Tir is phosphorylated at Tyr474, and this phosphorylation is necessary for the signaling of pedestal formation. Tir of EHEC has no equivalent phosphorylation site but it is similarly needed for cytoskeleton rearrangement. How these two Tir molecules achieve their function by apparently different mechanisms is not completely clear. To examine their intrinsic differences, the two Tirs were expressed in HeLa cells and compared. Actin in complexes could be pelleted down from the lysate of cells expressing EHEC Tir but not EPEC Tir. By immunostaining, neither Tir molecule was found in phosphorylated state. In the cytoplasm, EHEC Tir was frequently found in fibrous structures whereas EPEC Tir was observed completely in a diffusive form. The determinant critical for the EHEC Tir fibrous formation was mapped to the C-terminal region of the molecule that deviates from the EPEC counterpart. This region may play a role in taking an alternative route different from Tyr474 phosphorylation to transduce signals.
