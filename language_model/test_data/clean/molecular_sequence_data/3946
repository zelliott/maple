The human prostacyclin receptor (hIP) is a seven transmembrane-spanning G-protein-coupled receptor that plays an important role in vascular homeostasis. Recent genetic analyses (SNP database, NCBI) have revealed the first two polymorphisms within the coding sequence, V25M and R212H. Here we present structure-function characterizations of these polymorphisms at physiological pH (7.4) and at an acidic pH (6.8) that would be encountered during stress such as renal, respiratory, or heart failure. Through a series of competition binding and G-protein activation assays (measured by cAMP production), we determined that the V25M polymorph exhibited agonist binding and G-protein activation similar to wild-type receptor at normal pH (7.4). However, the R212H variant demonstrated a significant decrease in binding affinity at lower pH (R212H at pH 7.4, K(i) = 2.2 +/- 1.2 nm; pH 6.8 K(i) = 45.6 +/- 12.0 nm). The R212H polymorph also exhibited abnormal activation at both pH 7.4 and pH 6.8 (pH 7.4, R212H EC(50) = 2.8 +/- 0.5 nm versus wild-type hIP EC(50) = 0.5 +/- 0.1 nm; pH 6.8, R212H EC(50) = 3.2 +/- 1.6 nm versus wild-type hIP EC(50) = 0.5 +/- 0.2 nm). Polymorphisms of the human prostacyclin receptor potentially may be important predictors of disease progress during biological stressors such as acidosis in which urgent correction of bodily pH may be required to restore normal hemostasis and vasodilation. This study provides the mechanistic basis for further research into genetic risk factors and pharmacogenetics of cardiovascular disease associated with hIP.
