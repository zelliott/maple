The binding kinetics and pharmacological selectivity of the photoaffinity delta-opioid ligand [125I]azido-DTLET (Tyr-D-Thr-Gly-Phe(pN3)-Leu-Thr) were investigated in serial frozen sections from rat neostriatum prior to ultraviolet irradiation (i.e., in conditions of reversibility). Scatchard analysis of saturation binding experiments indicated that [125I]azido-DTLET binds to both a high (KD = 5.04 nM) and a low (KD = 38 nM) affinity site. Binding to the low-affinity site was no longer detectable in the presence of unlabeled [D-Ala2,N-MePhe4,Gly-Ol5]enkephalin (DAGO), suggesting that this site corresponds to mu-opioid receptors. This interpretation was further supported by the dose-dependent inhibition of the binding of [3H]DAGO by non-radioactive azido-DTLET. Binding to the high-affinity site was totally inhibited, in a dose-dependent fashion, by a variety of opioid drugs among which delta-opioid ligands showed the highest order of potency. It is concluded that, in the nanomolar range, [125I]azido-DTLET constitutes a highly selective tool for covalent labeling of delta-opioid receptors in rat brain sections.
