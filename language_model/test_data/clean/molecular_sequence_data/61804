Mycobacterium ulcerans is an environmental organism which is responsible for the disease Buruli ulcer, a necrotizing skin disease emerging in west Africa. M. ulcerans produces the polyketide-derived macrolide mycolactone, which is required for the immunosuppression and tissue damage which characterizes Buruli ulcer. We have extracted lipids from the cell envelope and culture filtrate from 52 isolates of Mycobacterium species, analyzed them with thin-layer chromatography, and tested them in a murine fibroblast cell line (L929) cytotoxicity assay to investigate whether these mycobacterial species produce mycolactone. For these studies chloroform-methanol (2:1, vol/vol) extracts were prepared from representative fast- and slow-growing mycobacterial species. Isolates tested included 16 uncharacterized, slow-growing, environmental mycobacterial species isolated from areas in which M. ulcerans infection is endemic. Although several strains of mycobacteria studied produced cytopathic lipids, none of these produced a phenotype on cultured cells consistent with that produced by mycolactone. Two mycobacterial species, M. scrofulaceum and M. kansasii, and eight of the environmental mycobacterial isolates contained cell-associated lipids cytopathic to fibroblasts at concentrations of 33 to 1,000 microg/ml. In contrast, mycolactone produces cytotoxicity at less than 2 ng/ml. Analysis of 16S rRNA sequences from the eight environmental isolates suggests that these are novel mycobacterial species. Results from these studies suggest that, although production of cytopathic lipids is relatively common among mycobacterial species, the production of mycolactone as a cell-associated or secreted molecule appears so far to be restricted to M. ulcerans.
