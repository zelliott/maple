Myc is a nuclear phosphoprotein which controls cellular proliferation, most likely by regulating gene activity. The finding that the neuronal model cell line PC12 lacks the Myc DNA binding partner, the Max protein, and the demonstration that Myc is a repressor of gene activity as well as a transactivator, lead to models for Myc action in regulating cell growth.
