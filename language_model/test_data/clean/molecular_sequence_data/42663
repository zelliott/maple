Although the B70 antigen exhibits allele frequencies of 8-23% in African and American black populations, it remains poorly defined. Cloning and sequencing of cDNA encoding B70 antigens from six cell lines has identified a group of three closely related alleles: B*1503, B*1509 and B*1510, that form a subgroup of the B15 family. The sequences of these alleles and, in particular, B*1503, are close to that of the HLA-B consensus consistent with the difficulty in their serological definition. The products of the three alleles correspond to three electrophoretically detected variants of the B70 antigen and some correlation with the B71 and B72 subspecificities of the B70 antigen can be made. A fourth allele, B*7901, previously described by Choo et al. (J. Immunol. 147: 174-180, 1991) that was not serologically typed as B70, differs by a single nucleotide substitution from B*1510. The sensitivity of alloantibodies to single differences in peptide binding residues suggest a role for bound peptides in the HLA-B70 alloantigenic specificities. The heavy chains encoded by the four alleles differ at four peptide binding residues of the antigen recognition site, the evolutionary modification of which can be explained in terms of interallelic recombination events.
