Delta-like 1 (DLK1) belongs to the epidermal growth factor-like transmembrane protein family and is involved in the regulation of adipogenesis. Several splice variants of DLK1 have been identified in various species, of which two have been previously identified in pig. Here, we present two novel porcine DLK1 splice variants DLK1A and DLK1C. The gene expression profile of these variants together with the previously described DLK1B and DLK1C2 variants was studied in adipose tissue depots of pigs and during adipocyte differentiation in vitro. The short DLK1C and DLK1C2 transcripts were most abundantly expressed and their expression was reduced during porcine adipogenesis.
