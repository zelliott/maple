Analogues of human growth hormone-releasing hormone-(1-30)-amide [GH-RH(1-30)-amide] were tested for their ability to stimulate GH release in vivo by injecting the peptides intravenously (iv), subcutaneously (sc), and intramuscularly (im). The analogues involved derivatization with Nle27 and Gaba substituents at the C-terminus with or without D-amino acid(s) in the peptide chain. The potency of the analogues was compared to that of GH-RH(1-29)-amid testing their ability to release GH at 5, 15 and 30 min after the administration. In iv test the potency of the analogues was 1.2-2 times higher than that of the GH-RH(1-29)-amide, and no significant differences were detected between the potencies of the analogues with or without D-amino acid. In the sc test the analogue with D-Ala2, Nle27, and Gaba30 substitutions expressed 8.0-51.7 times higher potency than the GH-RH(1-29)-amide, however, the analogue with similar modifications but with L-Ala2 showed the same low potency (1.2-2.1) as in the iv test. Results from the im experiments were similar to those of SC test. The most potent analogues were those which had D-Ala2, Nle27, and Gaba30 substitutions with Gly15 or Leu15. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the analogues showed that Leu in position 15 increased the stability of the predominant alpha-helix conformation, which improved the absorption of the molecule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
