Catenulifera, typified by C. rhodogena (=Scopulariopsis rhodogena), was established to accommodate the anamorphs of Hyphodiscus (Ascomycota, Helotiales) and to delimit these taxa from members of Phialophora section Catenulatae. Catenulifera rhodogena has been inferred as monophyletic, but its relationship to ascomycetes with poorly differentiated phialidic anamorphs remains enigmatic. To test the hypothesis that C. rhodogena is closely related to morphologically similar species of Phialophora and to further explore the systematics of Catenulifera, we analyzed nuclear rDNA and β-tubulin gene sequences of isolates identified as C. rhodogena, Hyphodiscus hymeniophilus, P. brachyconia, P. brevicollaris and P. hyalina. ITS-LSU and ITS-LSU-β-tubulin phylogenies positioned all isolates except P. hyalina in a single, well-supported clade that consisted of three subclades. Subclade 1 included fungicolous isolates of C. rhodogena and H. hymeniophilus that did not fluoresce when exposed to long-wave UV light. Subclade 2 contained fungicolous and lignicolous strains of C. rhodogena that produced fluorescent colonies and possessed a 366bp indel in the LSU rRNA gene. Neither lineage encompassed the ex-type strains of Cistella rubescens (=H. hymeniophilus) or S. rhodogena, but the former isolate was inferred as sister to Subclade 2. Subclade 3 included all isolates of P. brachyconia, a species recognized here as C. brachyconia comb. nov. A fourth isolate of P. brachyconia that was extralimital to Subclade 3 is described as C. luxurians sp. nov. The positions of C. brevicollaris comb. nov., a species based on P. brevicollaris, and C. luxurians were not resolved in the ITS-LSU phylogeny. P. hyalina is not closely related to Catenulifera.
