The gene encoding thioredoxin (trxA) was isolated from chromosomal DNA of E. coli HB101 strain using the polymerase chain reaction. The cloned structural gene with a synthetic Shine-Dalgarno sequence was placed under the control of either inducible tac-promoter or a tandem of two strong constitutive promoters A2 and A3 from early region of bacteriophage T7. Both constructions were shown to provide high levels of biosynthesis of recombinant thioredoxin.
