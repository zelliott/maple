In Drosophila, the products of the Polycomb group (Pc-G) of genes act as chromatin-associated multimeric protein complexes that repress expression of homeotic genes. Vertebrate Pc-G homologues have been identified, but the nature of the complexes they form and the mechanisms of their action are largely unknown. The Polycomb homologue M33 is implicated in mesoderm patterning in the mouse and here we show that it acts as a transcriptional repressor in transiently transfected cells. Furthermore, we have identified two murine proteins, Ring1A and Ring1B, that interact directly with the repressor domain of M33. Ring1A and Ring1B display blocks of similarity throughout their sequences, including an N-terminal RING finger domain. However, the interaction with M33 occurs through a region at the C-terminus. Ring1A represses transcription through sequences not involved in M33 binding. Ring1A protein co-localizes in nuclear domains with M33 and other Pc-G homologues, such as Bmi1. The expression of Ring1A at early stages of development is restricted to the neural tube, whereas M33 is expressed ubiquitously. Within the neural tube, Ring1A RNA is located at the rhombomere boundaries of the hindbrain. Taken together, these data suggest that Ring1A may contribute to a tissue-specific function of Pc-G-protein complexes during mammalian development.
