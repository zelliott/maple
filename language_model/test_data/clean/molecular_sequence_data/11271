Human antibodies to hepatitis C virus core, NS4A and NS3 were cloned in a prokaryotic vector and expressed as soluble Fab fragments and as phage-displayed Fabs. The recombinant Fabs were shown to be a suitable tool for immunohistochemistry, since they recognize the cognate antigen expressed in mammalian cells. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA for the variable domains of these antibodies was determined and the V-gene usage was derived. On the basis of the deduced amino acid sequence, a structural model of the V domains of the Fabs was constructed.
