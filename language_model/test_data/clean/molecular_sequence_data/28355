A plaque-derived line of measles virus induced the synthesis of 21S subgenomic RNA in addition to 50S genomic RNA. The nucleotide sequence of the former RNA was determined in comparison with that of the latter. The 21S subgenomic RNA was 2646 nucleotides long and had a copyback structure containing a 50S genomic 5'-end. At the site where copying turns back, there was a 15-nucleotide-long sequence resembling the "measles virus consensus sequence" which is present at the beginning of each gene on the measles virus genome and is presumed to serve as a signal for the initiation of transcription. Recognition of the specific sequence may have been involved in the aberrant replication and may represent an additional and novel copy choice mechanism leading to the generation of subgenomic RNAs.
