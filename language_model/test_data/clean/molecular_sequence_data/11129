Phytases (EC 3.1.3.8) belong to the family of histidine acid phosphatases. We have cloned the phytases of the fungi Emericella nidulans and Talaromyces thermophilus. The putative enzyme encoded by the E. nidulans sequence consists of 463 amino acids and has a Mr of 51785. The protein deduced from the T. thermophilus sequence consists of 466 amino acids corresponding to a Mr of 51450. Both predicted amino acid sequences exhibited high identity (48% to 67%) to known phytases. This high level of identity allowed the modelling of all available fungal phytases based on the three-dimensional structure coordinates of the Aspergillus niger phytase. By this approach we identified 21 amino acids which are conserved in fungal phyA phytases and are part of the residues forming the substrate pocket. Furthermore, potential glycosylation sites were identified and compared between the aforementioned phytases and the A. niger phytase.
