Tissue factor (TF) exists in a cryptic form [i.e. without procoagulant activity (PCA)] in peripheral blood monocytes and quiescent tissue macrophages but is expressed constitutively in most human tumor cells. Induction and cell surface expression of TF in these cells in vivo is associated with activation of intravascular and extravascular coagulation in patients with a variety of inflammatory or malignant diseases. The regulation of TF synthesis in cells is complex and new information from transfection studies suggests that changes in cellular glycosylation pathways impair cell surface expression of functional TF. Such dysregulation may also characterize the lineage-unfaithful expression of TF in leukemic cells and perhaps explain some of the thrombohemorrhagic complications in patients with acute progranulocytic leukemia. The importance of carbohydrate modification of TF is reviewed.
