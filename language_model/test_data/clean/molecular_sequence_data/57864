Estimation of FGF-3 oncogene amplification in DNA samples extracted from paraffin embedded sections of 136 ovarian cancer samples was carried out by a quantitative PCR method. The aim of this study was to elucidate a possible association of FGF-3 copy numbers with established prognostic factors such as age, histology, FIGO stage, grading, postoperative residual tumour mass, ascites, hormone receptor content and preoperative CA 125 serum levels. In addition, correlation of FGF-3 amplification with overall survival of the patients was assessed. There was a borderline positive correlation between preoperative CA 125 serum levels and the degree of amplification of the FGF-3 gene (P = 0.06). A statistically significant association of FIGO-stage with FGF-3 copy number could be found (P = 0.008). No correlation between FGF-3 amplification and overall survival was noted. The data combine to suggest that FGF-3 is an indicator of aggressiveness of ovarian cancer.
