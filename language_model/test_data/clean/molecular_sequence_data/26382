Bovine kappa-casein represents a major portion of the total protein present in milk and is required for formation of the caseinate micelles responsible for the transportation of both calcium and phosphorous. Two monoclonal antibodies directed against bovine kappa-casein have been isolated. Both monoclonal antibodies are highly specific for bovine kappa-casein. Western analysis of denatured kappa-casein suggests epitope specificity is, in part, conformationally dependent. Additional epitope mapping with chymosin and neuraminidase also suggest antibody binding is in the region of the amino acid sequence Pro-Thr-Thr at positions 92 to 94 and 134 to 136.
