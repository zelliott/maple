B50 is a murine melanoma-associated antigen found in tight association with B700, a melanoma-specific antigen. B700-like molecules are produced by all melanomas tested to date, including those of murine, human, swine and hamster origin. We have used rabbit antibodies to B50 to determine whether B50 expression is also restricted to melanomas. The results demonstrate that B50 is a commonly occurring protein, or is immunologically cross-reactive to a commonly occurring protein; 29 of 29 cell lines tested bound anti-B50 antibodies. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis indicates that B50 has significant homology to the Ro/SS-A antigen of human systemic lupus erythematosus and to calcium binding proteins; hence B50 is likely to be an RNA and/or calcium-binding protein.
