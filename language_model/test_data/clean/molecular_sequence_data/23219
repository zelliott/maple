The presence of a plasmid, containing gene sequences for DNA immunotherapy that are not expressed in microbial culture, imposed a degradation in bioreactor performance in cultures of the host E. coli strain. Significant decreases in growth rate (24%) and biomass yield (7%) and a corresponding increase in overflow metabolism were observed in a strain containing a therapeutic sequence (a hepatitis B antigen under the control of a CMV promotor). The observed increase in overflow metabolism was incorporated into a Metabolic Flux Analysis (MFA) model (as acetate secretion). Metabolic flux analysis revealed an increase in TCA cycle flux, consistent with an increased respiration rate observed in plasmid-containing cells. These effects are thought to result from increased ATP synthesis requirements (24%) arising from the expression of the Kanr plasmid marker gene whose product accounted for 18% of the cell protein of the plasmid-containing strain. These factors will necessitate significantly higher aeration and agitation rates or lower nutrient feed rates in high-density cultures than would be expected for plasmid-free cultures.
