Analyzing the satellite DNA in the ant species Monomorium subopacum we found two unrelated families of satellite DNA. Because these satellite DNA families were isolated using the two enzymes HaeIII and EcoRI we called the two families HaeIII and EcoRI family, respectively. The HaeIII family proved to be organized in a 135-bp basic unit repeat, the EcoRI family in a 2.5-kb basic unit repeat. The latter represents perhaps the longest satellite DNA isolated up to now in insects. The HaeIII family apparently comprises about 10% of the total genomic DNA whereas the EcoRI family represents only about 1-2%. A comparative analysis of the two satellite DNA sequences showed no homology between the two families although both sequences possessed long A and T stretches. Eight of the 34 chromosomes showed hybridization with the HaeIII family and hybridization signals are visible in six chromosomes with the EcoRI family. Analysis of the electrophoretic mobility of satellite DNA on non-denaturing polyacrylamide showed that the HaeIII family is only slightly curved. However, the unit of the EcoRI satellite DNA family has curvature, especially the first 1000 bp of the monomeric repeat, in which this DNA is AT rich and has numerous A and T stretches. There are also internal inverted subrepeats in each family. The sequences of satellite DNA families found in Monomorium subopacum are different from the sequences of other satellite DNAs cloned in insects, including other species of ants.
