The protein designated as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is a major substrate for the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. Since post-receptor defects in the insulin signalling pathway are a common feature of Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, we have cloned the human IRS-1 gene in order to study the role of genetic variation in this gene in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. As a first step in these studies, we have mapped the IRS-1 gene to chromosome 2, bands q35-q36.1 and identified a simple tandem repeat DNA polymorphism in this gene that will be useful for genetic studies.
