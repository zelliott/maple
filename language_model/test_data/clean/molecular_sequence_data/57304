Interaction of alkylating derivatives of oligonucleotides with nuclear extracts from mammalian cells has been investigated. Three modified 1.5-, 3.0-, and 6.0-kDa proteins were detected in nuclear extracts from human and murine cells. The 1.5-kDa and 3.0-kDa proteins were also detected in insect, plant, yeast, and bacterial cells. The ubiquity of the proteins suggests their important role in cellular metabolism.
