We report on the results of radical surgery performed on a 10-yr-old Chinese female with multiple echinococcosis lesions and the diagnosis of the infection by imaging, histology, serology, and DNA analysis. Molecular genotyping provided unequivocal proof that the patient was infected with Echinococcus granulosus, the cause of cystic echinococcosis.
