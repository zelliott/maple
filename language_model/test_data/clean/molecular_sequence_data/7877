Batten disease (also known as juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a recessively inherited neurodegenerative disorder of childhood characterized by progressive loss of vision, seizures, and psychomotor disturbances. The Batten disease gene, CLN3, maps to chromosome 16p12.1. The so-called 56 chromosome haplotype defined by alleles at the D16S299 and D16S298 loci is shared by 73% of Batten disease chromosomes. Exon amplification of a cosmid containing D16S298 has yielded a candidate gene that is disrupted by a 1 kb genomic deletion in all patients carrying the 56 chromosome. Two separate deletions and a point mutation altering a splice site in three unrelated families have confirmed the candidate as the CLN3 gene. The disease gene encodes a novel 438 amino acid protein of unknown function.
