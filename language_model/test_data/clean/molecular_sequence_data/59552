Promoters normally active in the nuclei of evolutionarily distant from fishes taxa-bacteria, insects, and Protozoa-are shown to be able to regulate heterologous genes during early development of the loach. It is shown that particular DNA sequences can drastically influence the function of eukaryotic promoters, enhancing the expression level.
