We are investigating the expression and linkage of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes in the duck ( Anas platyrhynchos) with a view toward understanding the susceptibility of ducks to two medically important viruses: influenza A and hepatitis B. In mammals, there are multiple MHC class I loci, and alleles at a locus are polymorphic and co-dominantly expressed. In contrast, in lower vertebrates the expression of one locus predominates. Southern-blot analysis and amplification of genomic sequences suggested that ducks have at least four loci encoding MHC class I. To identify expressed MHC genes, we constructed an unamplified cDNA library from the spleen of a single duck and screened for MHC class I. We sequenced 44 positive clones and identified four MHC class I sequences, each sharing approximately 85% nucleotide identity. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to a Northern blot indicated that only two of these sequences were abundantly expressed. In chickens, the dominantly expressed MHC class I gene lies adjacent to the transporter of antigen processing ( TAP2) gene. To investigate whether this organization is also found in ducks, we cloned the gene encoding TAP2 from the cDNA library. PCR amplification from genomic DNA allowed us to determine that the dominantly expressed MHC class I gene was adjacent to TAP2. Furthermore, we amplified two alleles of the TAP2 gene from this duck that have significant and clustered amino acid differences that may influence the peptides transported. This organization has implications for the ability of ducks to eliminate viral pathogens.
