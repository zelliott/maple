Gaucher's disease (GD) is a rare autosomal recessive (AR) disorder characterized by a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase (glucosylceramidase, acid β-glucosidase). This enzyme deficiency results in an accumulation of sphingolipids in the cells of GD patients, which may contribute to the dysregulation of the immune system, B-cell dysfunction and expression of specific cytokines such as interleukin (IL) -1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Accumulated substrate may directly affect the patient's immunity and pose a higher risk for cancer, especially hematologic malignancies. However, recent large-scale studies suggest that the relative risks of GD and hematologic malignancies are not statistically significant and, therefore, their association with each other remains controversial. In this report, we present the first Asian GD case where the patient was simultaneously diagnosed with a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A renal biopsy confirmed that the patient had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A bone marrow study during lymphoma staging revealed Gaucher cells with abundant fibrillary, blue-gray cytoplasm and a wrinkled, tissue paper-like appearance. Subsequently, an acid β-glucosidase (GbA) gene mutation study demonstrating two heterozygote mutations, G202R (c.721G>A; p.G241R), a known pathogenic mutation, and a novel mutation R277C (c.946C>T; p.R316C) prompted the diagnosis of GD. Previous case reports have demonstrated concurrent GD and lymphoma in type 1 GD patients, with 40% of patients diagnosed with GD when a lymphoma is detected during disease evaluation. In Korea, GD cases with the G202R gene mutation have been reported in neuropathic patients with a very low frequency. To our knowledge, this case represents the first observation of the G202R mutation in a type 1 GD patient associated with lymphoma. Furthermore, this report is the first patient with DLBCL with kidney involvement along with GD.
