Repeated application of GnRH agonists causes a reversible suppression of ovarian function. Suppression on estrogen release is the fundamental idea of this hormonal therapy of endometriosis. We treated twelve patients with histologically proved endometriosis with leuprolide acetate depot in a dose of 3.75 mg s.c. every 4 weeks over a period of 6 months. In the first week of therapy the estrogen level decreased to a post-menopausal niveau along with amenorrhoea during the entire period of therapy. Complaints previous to therapy such as dysmenorrhoea, pelvic pain and dyspareunia were relieved or completely disappeared after therapy. The clinical finding on palpation also diminished or disappeared. In addition to this finding pelvis copy showed a shift from severe endometriosis stage III and stage IV to stage I and stage II of the AFS classification 1985. Regular menstruation appeared in 5 to 9 weeks after the last application to all patients. Out of six cases of infertility, four patients became pregnant. Except for one case, typical menopausal symptoms appeared, such as flush, increased perspiration and sleeping disorders. During and after therapy we could not prove any changes in the lipid metabolism under estrogen therapy. Mineralization of the bone decreased under therapy by about 3%. Simultaneously, serum osteocalcin increased. Demineralization occurred with one exception within the normal range for the corresponding age. With identical efficiency but less side effects, we see therapy with GnRH agonists as an alternative to current hormonal therapy of endometriosis.
