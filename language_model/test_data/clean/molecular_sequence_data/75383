Downstream sequence requirements for efficient cleavage and polyadenylation at the adenovirus type 2 L1 poly(A) site were determined in vivo in 293 cells and in vitro by using RNA precursors in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. The two cleavage sites used were found to differ in sensitivity to 3'-end deletion in vivo and in vitro.
