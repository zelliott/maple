The diesel-degrading strains, designated as MJ01 and MJ4, were isolated from oil-contaminated soil in Daejeon (South Korea) and were taxonomically characterized using a polyphasic approach and their diesel oil degradation abilities were analyzed. The isolates MJ01 and MJ4 were identified as Acinetobacter haemolyticus and Acinetobacter johnsonii, respectively, based on their 16S rDNA gene sequences, DNA-DNA relatedness, fatty acid profiles and various physiological characteristics. Strains MJ01 and MJ4 were able to use diesel oil as the sole carbon and energy source. Both strains could degrade over 90% of diesel oil with an initial concentration of 20,000 mg/l after incubation for 7 days, the most significant degradation occurred during the first 3 days. To our knowledge, this is the first report on diesel oil-degrading microorganisms among bacterial strains belonging to A. haemolyticus and A. johnsonii.
