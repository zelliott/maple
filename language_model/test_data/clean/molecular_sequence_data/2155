We have cloned, determined the primary structure of, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli the gene mvaA, which is the 1,287-base structural gene for the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase [EC 1.1.1.88] of Pseudomonas mevalonii. The amino acid composition of HMG-CoA reductase agreed with that predicted from the nucleotide sequence of mvaA, and DNA-derived sequences were identical to all experimentally determined peptide sequences. Overexpression of mvaA in E. coli yielded quantities of HMG-CoA reductase over 1,500-fold higher than those present in control cultures. Comparison of the primary structure of the P. mevalonii enzyme with the DNA-derived primary structure for a mammalian HMG-CoA reductase revealed two regions of similarity suggestive of functional relatedness. An open reading frame, ORF1, lies on the 3' side of mvaA, and a potential ribosome-binding site for ORF1 overlaps the termination codon of mvaA.
