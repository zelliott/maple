We have used serological proteome analysis in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry to identify and sequence a novel protein, Mtb81, which may be useful for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), especially for patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Recombinant Mtb81 was tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies in 25 of 27 TB patients (92%) seropositive for HIV as well as in 38 of 67 individuals (57%) who were TB positive alone. No reactivity was observed in 11 of 11 individuals (100%) who were HIV seropositive alone. In addition, neither sera from purified protein derivative (PPD)-negative (0 of 29) nor sera from healthy (0 of 45) blood donors tested positive with Mtb81. Only 2 of 57 of PPD-positive individuals tested positive with Mtb81. Sera from individuals with smear-positive TB and seropositive for HIV but who had tested negative for TB in the 38-kDa antigen immunodiagnostic assay were also tested for reactivity against Mtb81, as were sera from individuals with lung cancer and pneumonia. Mtb81 reacted with 26 of 37 HIV(+) TB(+) sera (70%) in this group, compared to 2 of 37 (5%) that reacted with the 38-kDa antigen. Together, these results demonstrate that Mtb81 may be a promising complementary antigen for the serodiagnosis of TB.
