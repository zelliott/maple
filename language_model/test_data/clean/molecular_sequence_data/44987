Isoform diversity of tropomyosin is generated from the limited genes by a combination of differential transcription and alternative splicing. In the case of the alpha-tropomyosin (alpha-TM) gene, exon 2a rather than exon 2b is specifically spliced in alpha-TM-SM mRNA, which is one of the major tropomyosin isoforms in smooth muscle cells. Here we demonstrate that expressions of alpha-tropomyosin and caldesmon isoforms are coordinately regulated in association with phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells. Molecular cloning and Western and Northern blottings have revealed that in addition to the down-regulation of beta-TM-SM, alpha-TM-SM converted to alpha-TM-F1 and alpha-TM-F2 by a selectional change from exon 2a to exon 2b during dedifferentiation of smooth muscle cells in culture. Simultaneously, a change of caldesmon isoforms from high Mr type to low Mr type was also observed by alternative selection between exons 3b and 4 in the caldesmon gene during this process. In contrast, cultured smooth muscle cells maintaining a differentiated phenotype continued to express alpha-TM-SM, beta-TM-SM, and high Mr caldesmon. In situ hybridization revealed specific coexpression of alpha-TM-SM and high Mr caldesmon in smooth muscle in developing embryos. These results suggest a common splicing mechanism for phenotype-dependent expression of tropomyosin and caldesmon isoforms in both visceral and vascular smooth muscle cells.
