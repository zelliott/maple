The N-acyl, 5'-O-trityl (MeOTr, (MeO)2Tr, Me3Tr), 2'-O-benzoyl (and anisole) nucleosides were prepared by selective aroylation of N,5'-protected nucleosides. By means of the reverse-phase microcolumn liquid chromatography it was shown that the rate of the aryl 2'----3'-isomerisation is lower in case of 2'-anisoylnucleosides and depends on structure of the 5'-O-protecting group. The prepared synthons were used for the manual H-phosphonate solid-phase synthesis of oligoribonucleotides (6-10-mers).
