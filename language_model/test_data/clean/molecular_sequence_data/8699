The glucosyl transferase gene (gtr) from bacteriophage phage X (SfX) caused partial conversion of serotype Y (group antigen 3, 4) to X (group antigen 7, 8) when introduced into a candidate vaccine strain of Shigella flexneri serotype Y (SFL124). The gtr gene caused conversion of O-antigens but did not eliminate the adsorption of the corresponding phage SfX. The hybrid strain expressing both group antigens 7, 8 and 3, 4 showed 75% protection when immunized guinea pigs were challenged with a wild-type S. flexneri serotype X strain. No protection was observed against serotype Y challenge, although group antigen 3, 4 was detected in the LPS of the hybrid strain. This suggests the importance of O-antigen immunity in the host defense against shigellosis.
