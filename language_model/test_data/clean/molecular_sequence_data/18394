Excess iron results in an increase in the translation of ferritin mRNA and a decrease in the stability of transferrin receptor (TfR) mRNA. These coordinate regulatory events are mediated by similar sequence/structure motifs that exist within the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the ferritin mRNA and the 3'UTR of the TfR mRNA. We have referred to these motifs as iron-responsive elements (IREs). The IREs from both transcripts interact with a cytoplasmic protein that we have called the IRE-binding protein (IRE-BP). The activity but not the amount of the IRE-BP is dependent on the cellular iron status. The biochemical basis for the altered activity of the IRE-BP appears to be the reversible oxidation-reduction of one or more cysteines in the IRE-BP. The IRE-BP is a 90- to 95-kD cytosolic protein that has been purified to homogeneity by RNA affinity chromatography, and the cDNA corresponding to the IRE-BP has been molecularly cloned. Collectively, our data support a model in which the interaction between the IRE-BP and the ferritin IRE results in attenuation of translation, and similar interaction with TfR mRNA can protect the transcript from rapid degradation mediated by a rapid turnover determinant within the 3'UTR.
