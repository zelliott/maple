Dengue (DEN) constitutes a major viral arthropod-borne human illness. South America was last considered free of dengue two decades ago when a dramatic increase in the number of dengue fever and hemorrhagic dengue cases had been reported. Five viruses were isolated in Buenos Aires City from the 1999-2000 Paraguay outbreak. RT-PCRs obtained directly from plasma were cloned into pGemT vectors and sequences of the structural genes and NS1 were analyzed. Three viruses were full-length sequenced from RT-PCR obtained from cell-culture isolates. Excess of synonymous over non-synonymous mutations suggested that the structural proteins were under strong functional constraints while a weak purifying selection was operating in the whole polyprotein. Sequence diversity and selective pressures varied among patients but results were significantly above the procedure threshold. One sample showed small-plaque phenotype and impaired growth coupled to 3'untranslated region mutations. Phylogenetic analysis of full-length sequences split Buenos Aires isolates into two clusters within American DEN-1 genotype V: Clade I was phylogenetically linked to Brazilian samples and Clade II with samples from Paraguay and Northeastern Argentina. In Buenos Aires City, only dengue virus serotype 1 imported from Paraguay has been detected, though without evidence of local transmission.
