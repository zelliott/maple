A series of formylated and acetylated peptides with the amino terminal sequence of the small subunit of human calpains were prepared and their neutrophil activating potency was examined. Formyl peptides showed dose-dependent superoxide generation and elastase/myeloperoxidase releasing activity in addition to chemotactic activity whereas acetyl peptides showed only chemotactic activity and neither superoxide generation nor degranulation activity was detected. These results imply that acetyl peptides from the calpain small subunit might be moderate neutrophil chemotactic factors which do not produce bacteriocidal and cytotoxic effects.
