Genetic linkage studies have provided significant evidence that a major gene defect, AD3, for familial early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) is located at chromosome 14q24.3, between the short tandem repeat (STR) markers D14S52 and D14S53 defining a genetic size of 22.7 cM for the AD3 candidate region. We constructed a physical map of the AD3 region using yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) selected from both the CEPH and megaCEPH YAC libraries using the AD3 linked STR markers as well as new sequence-tagged sites (STSs) designed based on YAC terminal sequences. The YAC map is contiguous in the region between D14S258 and D14S53, a region of 8.2 cM, and has an estimated physical size of 4-8 Mb. The YAC contig map was used as a framework to localize three known genes, a pseudogene and two brain expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Linkage analysis studies in two Belgian chromosome 14 EOAD families AD/A and AD/B, identified obligate recombinants in family AD/A with D14S289 and D14S61 reducing the genetic size of the candidate AD3 region substantially. The minimal AD3 candidate region measured 6.4 cM on the genetic map and is contained within six overlapping megaCEPH YACs that covered a physical distance estimated between 2 and 6 Mb. These YACs as well as other YACs in the YAC contig map are valuable resources in gene cloning efforts or genomic sequencing experiments aiming at isolating the AD3 gene.
