We report the first phase I trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a malaria vaccine candidate, ICC-1132 (Malarivax), composed of a modified hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc) containing minimal epitopes of the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the recombinant ICC-1132 protein forms virus-like particles that were found to be highly immunogenic in preclinical studies of mice and monkeys. Twenty healthy adult volunteers received a 20- or a 50-microg dose of alum-adsorbed ICC-1132 administered intramuscularly at 0, 2, and 6 months. The majority of volunteers in the group receiving the 50-microg dose developed antibodies to CS repeats as well as to HBc. Malaria-specific T cells that secreted gamma interferon were also detected after a single immunization with ICC-1132-alum. These studies support ICC-1132 as a promising malaria vaccine candidate for further clinical testing using more-potent adjuvant formulations and confirm the potential of modified HBc virus-like particles as a delivery platform for vaccines against other human pathogens.
