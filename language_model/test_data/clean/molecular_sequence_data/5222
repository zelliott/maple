The folding and assembly of procollagen occurs within the cell through a series of discrete steps leading to the formation of a stable trimer consisting of three distinct domains: the N-propeptide, the C-propeptide and the collagen triple helix flanked at either end by short telopeptides. We have established a semi-permeabilized cell system which allows us to study the initial stages in the folding and assembly of procollagen as they would occur in the intact cell. By studying the folding and assembly of the C-propeptide domain in isolation, and a procollagen molecule which lacks the C-propeptide, we have shown that this domain directs the initial association event and is required to allow triple helix formation. However, the essential function of this domain does not include triple helix nucleation or alignment, since this can occur when the C-propeptide is substituted with a single transmembrane domain. Also the telopeptide region is not involved in triple helix nucleation; however, a minimum of two hydroxyproline-containing Gly-X-Y triplets at the C-terminal end of the triple helix are required for nucleation to occur. Thus, the C-propeptide is required solely to ensure association of the monomeric chains; once these are brought together, the triple helix is able to nucleate and fold to form a correctly aligned triple helix.
