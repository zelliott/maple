The oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica has an outstanding capacity to produce and store triacylglycerols resembling adipocytes of higher eukaryotes. Here, the identification of two genes YALI0E32769g (DGA1) and YALI0E16797g (LRO1) encoding major triacylglycerol synthases of Yarrowia lipolytica is reported. Heterologous expression of either DGA1 or LRO1 in a mutant of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae defective in triacylglycerol synthesis restores the formation of this neutral lipid. Whereas Dga1p requires acyl-CoA as a substrate for acylation of diacylglycerol, Lro1p is an acyl-CoA independent triacylglycerol synthase using phospholipids as acyl-donor. Growth of Yarrowia lipolytica strains deleted of DGA1 and/or LRO1 on glucose containing medium significantly decreases triacylglycerol accumulation. Most interestingly, when oleic acid serves as the carbon source the ratio of triacylglycerol accumulation in mutants to wild-type is significantly increased in strains defective in DGA1 but not in lro1Î”. In vitro experiments revealed that under these conditions an additional acyl-CoA dependent triacylglycerol synthase contributes to triacylglycerol synthesis in the respective mutants. Taken together, evidence is provided that Yarrowia lipolytica contains at least four triacylglycerol synthases, namely Lro1p, Dga1p and two additional triacylglycerol synthases whereof one is acyl-CoA dependent and specifically induced upon growth on oleic acid.
