A gene encoding the alpha-tubulin of Candida albicans has been cloned and characterized. Nucleotide sequence analysis reveals the presence of an intron within the structural gene and predicts the synthesis of a polypeptide of 448 amino acid residues. Comparison of nucleotide and amino acid sequences with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-tubulin encoding genes shows a 75% homology and about 92% similarity respectively. In contrast to S. cerevisiae, C. albicans appears to possess only one gene for alpha-tubulin which is able to functionally complement a S. cerevisiae cold-sensitive tub1 mutant.
