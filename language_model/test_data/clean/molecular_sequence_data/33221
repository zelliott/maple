After morphological grouping of Acanthamoeba by Pussard and Pons, phylogeny of the genus has been always a big topic to the researchers. Because of the variability of morphological characteristics, unchangeable and stable characters have been investigated for phylogenic criteria. Isoenzyme and mitochondrial DNA RFLP (Mt DNA RFLP) analyses revealed different patterns among strains assigned to a same species. Therefore, these characteristics would be considered as tools for strain discrimination than species identification. The most recently developed and the most promising method is the sequence analysis of 18s ribosomal RNA coding DNA (18s rDNA). The phylogenic tree based on comparison of 18s rDNA sequences distinguished the 3 morphological groups of Acanthamoeba and divided them into 12 unique sequence types (T1-T12 genotypes). Most clinical and environmental isolates belonged to the morphological group II and the genotype T4. In the Republic of Korea, 2 strains of Acanthamoeba, YM-2 and YM-3, were first isolated from the environment in 1974. However, phylogenic identification of Korean Acanthamoeba isolates from human infections or the environment were tried from the late 1990s. By RFLP analysis or total sequence analysis of 18s rDNA revealed that almost all clinical isolates including the one from a suspicious granulomatous amebic encephalitis patient belonged to the genotype T4. A large number of environmental isolates from contact lens storage cases, tapped water, and ocean sediments also belonged to the genotype T4. Almost identical strain characteristics, such as Mt DNA RFLP pattern of environmental isolates, with the clinical isolates could make a simple conclusion that most environmental isolates might be a potential keratopathogen.
