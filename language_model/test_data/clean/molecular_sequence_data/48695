As part of their immune system, plants have pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that can detect a broad range of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). Here, we identified a PRR of Arabidopsis thaliana with specificity for the bacterial MAMP eMax from xanthomonads. Response to eMax seems to be restricted to the Brassicaceae family and also varied among different accessions of Arabidopsis. In crosses between sensitive accessions and the insensitive accession Shakhdara, eMax perception mapped to receptor-like protein1 (RLP1). Functional complementation of rlp1 mutants required gene constructs that code for a longer version of RLP1 that we termed ReMAX (for receptor of eMax). ReMAX/RLP1 is a typical RLP with structural similarity to the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) RLP Eix2, which detects fungal xylanase as a MAMP. Attempts to demonstrate receptor function by interfamily transfer of ReMAX to Nicotiana benthamiana were successful after using hybrid receptors with the C-terminal part of ReMAX replaced by that of Eix2. These results show that ReMAX determines specificity for eMax. They also demonstrate hybrid receptor technology as a promising tool to overcome problems that impede interfamily transfer of PRRs to enhance pathogen detection in crop plants.
