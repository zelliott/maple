The subcellular processes involved in repair of hair cells are not well understood. Sea anemones repair hair bundle mechanoreceptors on their tentacles after severe trauma caused by 1-h exposure to calcium-depleted seawater. Repair is dependent on the synthesis and secretion of large protein complexes named "repair proteins." A cDNA library on traumatized anemone tissue was probed using polyclonal antibodies raised to a specific chromatographic fraction of the repair protein mixture. An ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein, Arl-5b, was identified. The amino acid sequence of the Arl-5b protein in sea anemones is similar to that among several model vertebrates and humans. A polyclonal antibody raised to a peptide of the anemone Arl-5b labels some but not all hair bundles in healthy control animals. The abundance of labeled hair bundles significantly increases above healthy controls after trauma and continuing through the first hour of recovery. Dilute anti-Arl-5b blocks the spontaneous repair of hair bundle mechanoreceptors, suggesting that Arl-5b acts on the extracellular face of the plasma membrane. Immunoelectron microscopy indicates that Arl-5b is located along the length of stereocilia including sites in the vicinity of tip links. We propose that Arl-5b is involved in installing replacement linkages into damaged hair bundle mechanoreceptors.
