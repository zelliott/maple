We have developed a second orthogonal tRNA/synthetase pair for use in yeast based on the Escherichia coli tRNALeu/leucyl tRNA-synthetase pair. Using a novel genetic selection, we have identified a series of synthetase mutants that selectively charge the amber suppresor tRNA with the C8 amino acid, alpha-aminocaprylic acid, and the photocaged amino acid, o-nitrobenzyl cysteine, allowing them to be inserted into proteins in yeast in response to the amber nonsense codon, TAG.
