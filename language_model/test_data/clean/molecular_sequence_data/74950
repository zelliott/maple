Administration of poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase inhibitors such as nicotinamide to 90% depancreatized rats induces regeneration of pancreatic islets, thereby ameliorating the surgical diabetes (Yonemura, Y., Takashima, T., Miwa, K., Miyazaki, I., Yamamoto, H., and Okamoto, H. (1984) Diabetes 33, 401-404). In screening the regenerating islet-derived cDNA library, we came across a novel gene encoding a 165-amino acid protein. The gene was expressed in regenerating islets but not in normal pancreatic islets, insulinomas, or regenerating liver. In 90% depancreatized and nicotinamide-injected rats, the expression of the gene was increased 1 month after the partial pancreatectomy and reached a peak 3 months after the operation. The increase in expression of the gene was temporally correlated with the increase in size of regenerating islets and the decrease in urinary glucose level. The gene was also found to be activated in hyperplastic islets of aurothioglucose-treated mice. Thus, the expression of the gene in both regenerating and hyperplastic islets suggests possible roles for this gene in replication, growth, and maturation of islet beta-cells. We also found that a human pancreas-derived cDNA library contained a homologue to the gene.
