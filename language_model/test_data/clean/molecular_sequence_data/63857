Six new acylated oleanane-type triterpene oligoglycosides, perennisaponins A (1), B (2), C (3), D (4), E (5), and F (6), were isolated from the flowers of Bellis perennis (Daisy flower) together with 14 saponins, nine flavonoids, and two glycosides. The structures of 1-6 were elucidated on the basis of chemical and physicochemical evidence.
