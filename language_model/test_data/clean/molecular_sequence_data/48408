Two complete nucleotide sequences of an alphasatellite isolated from a cassava plant with mosaic disease symptoms in Madagascar are described and analyzed. While the helper begomovirus was identified as an isolate of East African cassava mosaic Kenya virus (EACMKV), its associated alphasatellite was most closely related (80 % nucleotide sequence identity) to cotton leaf curl Gezira alphasatellite. These satellite molecules have typical features of alphasatellites, with a single gene in the virion sense, an A-rich region and a stem-loop structure. According to the proposed species demarcation threshold of alphasatellites (83 % nucleotide identity), they are isolates of a new species for which we propose the name "Cassava mosaic alphasatellite".
