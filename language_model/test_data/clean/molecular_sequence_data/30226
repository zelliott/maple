A 60 base-pair region of a simian virus 40 DNA fragment was mutagenized to determine base-pairs that are critical for the fragment to bend. The site-directed mutagenesis saturated this region with all possible single base-pair substitutions. The mobility of each mutated fragment was measured by polyacrylamide electrophoresis at 4 degrees C and at 65 degrees C to assess the degree of bend. Four conclusions can be drawn. First, interruptions within the A tracts and changes in the phasing of the A tracts alter the degree of bend. Second, G tracts phased at a half-helical turn from an A tract are additive to the bend. Third, guanine residues in a nearest-neighbor contact with the A tracts modify the bend. Fourth, some mutations that do not obviously relate to the A tracts also alter the DNA bend and suggest clearly that base steps other than ApA are involved in sequence-directed DNA bends.
