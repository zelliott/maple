The Brassica oleracea S-locus-related gene 1 (SLR1) is expressed in the papillar cells of Brassica stigmas from a few days before anthesis. We have previously shown that a 1500-bp fragment of the SLR1 gene promoter is sufficient to direct high-level, temporally regulated expression of the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene in the pistils of transgenic tobacco. We have carried out a deletion analysis of the SLR1 promoter and found that elements required for pistil expression are located between -258 and -327 bp (relative to the translation start site). Furthermore, specific binding of pistil nuclear factors to sequences within this region was demonstrated by gel retardation analysis. Sequences between -1350 and -1500 were found to be required for high-level expression.
