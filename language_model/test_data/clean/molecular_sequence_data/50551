Migration of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils on vitronectin is dependent on repeated transient increases in the concentration of intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i). A specific peptide inhibitor of the Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin was introduced into the cytoplasm of neutrophils. The peptide inhibited neutrophil migration on vitronectin by interfering with the release of the cells from sites of attachment. A similar reduction in motility on vitronectin occurred when cells were treated with the immunosuppressant FK506, which also inhibits calcineurin when bound to its binding protein, FKBP. These results indicate that a rise in [Ca2+]i reduces integrin-mediated adhesion to vitronectin by a mechanism that requires calcineurin activity.
