We report the cloning, expression, and characterization of a novel member of the mammalian UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (ppGaNTase) family that transfers GalNAc to a GalNAc-containing glycopeptide. Northern blot analysis revealed that the gene encoding this enzyme, termed ppGaNTase-T6, is expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner. Significant levels of transcript were found in rat and mouse sublingual gland, stomach, small intestine, and colon; trace amounts were seen in the ovary, cervix, and uterus. Recombinant constructs were expressed transiently in COS7 cells but demonstrated no transferase activity in vitro against a panel of unmodified peptides, including GTTPSPVPTTSTTSAP (MUC5AC). However, when incubated with the total glycosylated products obtained by action of ppGaNTase-T1 on MUC5AC (mainly GTT(GalNAc)PSPVPTTSTT(GalNAc)SAP), additional incorporation of GalNAc was achieved, resulting in new hydroxyamino acids being modified. The MUC5AC glycopeptide failed to serve as a substrate for ppGaNTase-T6 after modification of the GalNAc residues by periodate oxidation and sodium borohydride reduction, indicating a requirement for the presence of intact GalNAc. This suggests that O-glycosylation of multisite substrates may proceed in a specific hierarchical manner and underscores the potential complexity of the processes that regulate O-glycosylation.
