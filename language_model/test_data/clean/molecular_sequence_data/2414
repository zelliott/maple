A protein sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide catalyses the fusion of transport vesicles with Golgi cisternae in a mammalian cell-free system. By cloning and sequencing its gene from Chinese hamster ovary cells and by use of in vitro assays, we show that this fusion protein is equivalent to the SEC18 gene product of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, known to be essential for vesicle-mediated transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. The mechanism of vesicular fusion is thus highly conserved, both between species and at different stages of transport.
