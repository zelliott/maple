COS-7 cells were transfected with DNAs containing mutations in the NCp7 sequences of human immunodeficiency virus. Selective incorporation into the virus of tRNA(Lys) was measured by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Pr160(gag-pol) incorporation into the virus was detected in Western blots of viral protein. Mutations tested included cysteine and histidine mutations in either of the Cys-His boxes, as well as mutations in the N- and C-terminal flanking regions and in the linker region between the two Cys-His boxes. Of 10 mutations tested, only 2 inhibited tRNA(Lys) incorporation: a P31L mutation in the linker region and a deletion which removed both Cys-His boxes and the linker region (deltaK14-T50). The P31L mutation prevents the incorporation of Pr160(gag-pol) into the virus. Cotransfection of COS cells with both P31L DNA and a plasmid coding only for unprocessed Pr160(gag-pol) resulted in the viral incorporation of Pr160(gag-pol) and the rescue of selective packaging of tRNA(Lys) into the virion. In the deltaK14-T50 mutant, Pr160(gag-pol) is incorporated into the virus. Selective tRNA(Lys) packaging is not rescued by cotransfection with a plasmid coding for Pr160(gag-pol) but is rescued by cotransfection with DNA coding for wild-type Pr55(gag). Since Pr55(gag) does not by itself selectively package tRNA(Lys), the deltaK14-T50 mutation may be affecting tRNA(Lys) binding to a cytoplasmic Pr55(gag)/Pr160(gag-pol) complex.
