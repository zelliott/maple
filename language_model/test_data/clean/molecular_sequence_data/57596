To determine whether messenger RNA coding for fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, interleukin-1 receptor, and glucocorticoid receptor messenger RNA are produced in human lacrimal tissue.

Total cellular RNA was isolated from three specimens of normal human lacrimal tissue and complementary DNA was synthesized. The polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific primers were used to amplify the sequences of interest from the complementary DNA. Hot blotting and sequence-specific probes were used to demonstrate that the expected amplification products were specific.

Data demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, interleukin-1 receptor, and glucocorticoid receptor messenger RNA are produced in human lacrimal tissue.

These results and the previous identification of basic fibroblast growth factor in the lacrimal gland suggest that basic fibroblast growth factor has autocrine or paracrine functions in lacrimal tissue. More study is needed to determine whether the corresponding proteins are produced and, if so, what functions are regulated by fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, interleukin-1 receptor, and glucocorticoid receptor in the lacrimal gland.
