The exopolysaccharide from the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain KL37C isolated from human intestinal flora was prepared by sonication of bacterial cell mass suspended in water followed by centrifugation and cold ethanol precipitation of the supernatant. The polysaccharide material was purified by gel permeation chromatography on an TSK HW-50 column and characterised using chemical and enzymatic methods. On the basis of sugar and methylation analysis and 1H, 13C, 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy the exopolysaccharide was shown to be composed of the following pentasaccharide repeating unit:-->3)-alpha-D-Glcp-(1-->2)-beta-D-Galf-(1-->6)-alpha-D-Galp-(1-->6)-alpha-D-Glcp-(1-->3)-beta-D-Galf-(1-->
