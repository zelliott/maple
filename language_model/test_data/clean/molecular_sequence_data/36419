Intracerebroventricularly applied pilocarpine (2.4 mg/2 microliters) immediately produced symptoms of epilepsy, ranging from akinesia to motor seizures, in rats. Whereas ACTH-(1-39), ACTH-(1-24), ACTH-(1-18), ACTH-(1-16) and ACTH-(18-39) were not active, subcutaneous pretreatment with smaller ACTH-like fragments, such as ACTH-(4-9), ACTH-(4-10), ACTH-(4-10)(7D-Phe), ACTH-(7-16), and Org2766, reduced the severity of the epilepsy. Moreover, fewer rats developed motor seizures. Thus, ACTH fragments devoid of peripheral endocrine activity reduce pilocarpine-induced epileptiform activity in rats. A narrow bell-shaped dose-response relationship was found. Except for ACTH-(7-16), which was active in a dose of 1 and 10 micrograms/rat s.c., the other fragments were only active at one dose (10 micrograms/rat). The anti-epileptic properties appeared to reside in the sequence 1-16, and more specifically in the sequences 4-7 and 7-16, of the ACTH molecule.
