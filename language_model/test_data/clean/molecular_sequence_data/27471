Recently, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses have been suggested to play important roles in maintaining various cellular functions and to underlie many tissue dysfunctions. In this study, we first identified cysteine-rich with EGF-like domains 2 (CRELD2) as an ER stress-inducible gene by analyzing a microarray analysis of thapsigargin (Tg)-inducible genes in Neuro2a cells. CRELD2 mRNA is also shown to be immediately induced by treatment with the ER stress-inducing reagents tunicamycin and brefeldin A. In the genomic sequence of the mouse CRELD2 promoter, we found a typical ER stress responsible element (ERSE), which is well conserved among various species. Using a luciferase reporter analyses, we demonstrated that the ERSE in mouse CRELD2 is functional and responds to Tg and ATF6-overexpression. Each mutation of ATF6- or NF-Y-binding sites in the ERSE of the mouse CRELD2 promoter dramatically decreased both the basal activity and responsiveness toward the ER stress stimuli. Our study suggests that CRELD2 could be a novel mediator in regulating the onset and progression of various ER stress-associated diseases.
