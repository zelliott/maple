Chaperonin GroEL from Escherichia coli binds to the non-native states of many unrelated proteins, and GroEL-recognizable structural features have been argued. As model substrate proteins of GroEL, we used seven artificial proteins (138 approximately 141 residues), each of which has a unique but randomly chosen amino acid sequence and no propensity to fold into a certain structure. Two of them were water-soluble, and the rest were soluble in 3 m urea. The soluble ones interacted with GroEL in a manner similar to that of a natural substrate; they stimulated the ATPase cycle of GroEL and GroEL/GroES and inhibited GroEL-assisted folding of other protein. All seven artificial proteins were able to bind to GroEL. The results suggest that the secondary structure as well as the specific sequence motif of the substrate proteins are not necessary to be recognized by GroEL.
