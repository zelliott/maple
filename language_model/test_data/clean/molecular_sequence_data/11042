The cDNA sequences for Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase from two Cervus elaphus subspecies, North American wapiti and European red deer, were determined. The derived amino acid sequences showed two differences: residue 8 was Leu in wapiti and Met in red deer and residue 25 was His in wapiti and Asn in red deer. The extra positive charge at position 25 in the wapiti isoform accounted for its greater mobility towards the cathode during non-denaturing electrophoresis, a procedure widely used in the genetic analysis of deer. There was no difference in specific activity between the two Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase isoforms, but the wapiti isoform was slightly more susceptible to heat denaturation.
