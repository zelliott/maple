We have characterized a cytokine produced by Th2 cells, designated as IL-25. Infusion of mice with IL-25 induced IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 gene expression. The induction of these cytokines resulted in Th2-like responses marked by increased serum IgE, IgG(1), and IgA levels, blood eosinophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs and digestive tract that included eosinophilic infiltrates, increased mucus production, and epithelial cell hyperplasia/hypertrophy. In addition, our studies show that IL-25 induces Th2-type cytokine production by accessory cells that are MHC class II(high), CD11c(dull), and lineage(-). These results suggest that IL-25, derived from Th2 T cells, is capable of amplifying allergic type inflammatory responses by its actions on other cell types.
