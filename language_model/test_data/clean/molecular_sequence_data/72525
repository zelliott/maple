The Nef protein of human and primate lentiviruses is a key factor in HIV/SIV pathogenesis. Here we report that Nef associates with two different kinases, forming a multiprotein complex at the far N-terminus of the viral protein. One of the kinases was identified as Lck, whereas the second protein was found to be a serine kinase that phosphorylated Nef and Lck in vitro and could be discriminated from the serine kinase identified previously. The Nef-associated kinase complex (NAKC) was demonstrated in COS cells, in HIV-infected cells, and in vitro using recombinant Lck and Nef proteins. Deletion of a short amphipathic alpha-helix in the N-terminus, which was found to be conserved in all Nef proteins, inhibited association of the NAKC and significantly reduced virion infectivity.
