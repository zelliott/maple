Four novel oligosaccharide units were isolated from the acetolysis products of the acidic polysaccharide chain derived from the glycoproteins of Fusarium sp. M7-1. Their chemical structures were resolved mainly by 1H-NMR spectrometry in combination with methylation analysis and mass spectrometry. The results indicate that these oligosaccharide units originated from the side chains, GlcNAc alpha 1-->4GlcA alpha 1-->2(GlcNac alpha 1-->4)GlcA alpha 1-->2Gal, GlcNAc alpha 1-->4GlcA alpha 1-->2(GlcNAc alpha 1-->4)GlcA alpha 1-->2(GlcNac alpha 1-->4)GlcA alpha 1-->2Gal, ChN<--P--> 6Man beta 1-->4GlcA alpha 1-->2Gal, and Man beta 1-->2(ChN<--P-->6)Man beta 1-->4GlcA alpha 1-->2Gal linked together with the other units reported previously [Jikibara et al. (1992) J. Biochem. 111, 236-243] through beta 1-->6galactofuranoside linkages in the acidic polysaccharide chain.
