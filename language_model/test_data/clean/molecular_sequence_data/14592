Peroxisomes are functionally diverse organelles that are wholly dependent on import of nuclear-encoded proteins. The signals that direct proteins into these organelles are either found at the C-terminus (type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal; PTS1) or N-terminus (type 2 peroxisomal targeting signal; PTS2) of the protein. Based on a limited number of tests in heterologous systems, PTS1 signals appear to be conserved across species. To further test the generality of this conclusion and to establish the extent to which the PTS1 signals can be relied on for biotechnological purposes across species, we tested two PTS1 signals for their ability to target fluorescent proteins in diverse plant species. Transient assays following microprojectile bombardment showed that the six amino acid PTS1 sequence (RAVARL) from spinach glycolate oxidase effectively targets green fluorescent fusion protein to the leaf peroxisomes in all 20 crops tested, including four monocots (sugarcane, wheat, corn and onion) and 16 dicots (carrot, cucumber, broccoli, tomato, lettuce, turnip, radish, cauliflower, cabbage, capsicum, celery, tobacco, petunia, beetroot, eggplant and coriander). Similarly, results indicated that the 10 amino acid PTS1 sequence (IHHPRELSRL) from pumpkin malate synthase effectively targets red fluorescent fusion protein to the leaf peroxisomes in all four crops tested including monocot (sugarcane) and dicot (cabbage, celery and pumpkin) species. These signal sequences should be useful metabolic engineering tools to direct recombinant proteins to the leaf peroxisomes in diverse plant species of biotechnological interest.
