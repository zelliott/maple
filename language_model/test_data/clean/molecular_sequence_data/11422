A method for the simultaneous determination of the ratios of the three aromatic amino-acid residues in peptides was set up in acidic conditions. Binary and ternary mixtures of these amino acids were prepared, and first- and second-derivative spectra then calculated from their 0.1 nm resolution spectra between 240 and 320 nm. Certain spectral bands were chosen to differentiate tyrosine from tryptophan on the first-derivative spectra, and phenylalanine from tyrosine and tryptophan on the second-derivative spectra. Variation of the amplitude of the chosen bands was shown to be a linear function of the ratio of the aromatic amino acids in the mixture. This technique was validated with peptides whose sequence was known. The difference between theoretical and experimentally determined ratios was lower than 10%. Since the results are obtained as ratios, neither the concentration nor the nature of the peptide has to be known. The feasibility of application using a photodiode array detector with high resolution in reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography is discussed.
