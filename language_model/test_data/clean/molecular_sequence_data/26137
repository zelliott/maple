Three West Nile (WN) virus strains isolated in Bangui, Central African Republic (CAR), from patients with hepatitis were analysed comparatively with the prototype WN virus strain and 7 WN strains previously isolated from birds (2 strains), mosquitoes (3 strains) and ticks (2 strains) in CAR. The comparison was based on two techniques: an epitopic analysis by indirect immunofluorescence assay using a panel of 9 monoclonal antibodies to WN virus, and an analysis of HaeIII and TaqI restriction digest profiles of cDNA to infected cell RNA. Similar results were obtained with both techniques: the 3 human strains were found to be identical to each other and identical or very close to mosquito and tick strains, whereas prototype WN virus and bird strains were significantly different from the human strains. As "classical" infections due to WN virus without hepatic involvement were also reported during the period of isolation of the arthropod strains, we concluded that the same virus subtype may have been the cause of different infection patterns. A new definition of the disease spectrum of WN virus, including the possibility of liver involvement, should be established. Clearly, the Egyptian prototype WN virus represents a different topotype. Bird strains also appear to be different from human and arthropod strains, raising the question of their transmissibility and pathogenicity for man, and of the role of birds in the natural cycle of WN virus.
