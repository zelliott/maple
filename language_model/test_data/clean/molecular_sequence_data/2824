Several strains of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) have been classified, and nucleic acid hybridization data indicate that these strains differ widely in nucleotide sequence. We have constructed cDNA clones of the coat protein coding regions of CMV strains C and WL, and have compared the nucleotide sequences of the RNA 3 intergenic region, coat protein gene, and 3' untranslated region with published CMV sequences from the same regions of the Q, D and Y strains. These comparisons show that the C and WL strains belong to different CMV subgroups, and that the subgroups are more closely related in sequence than suggested by previous nucleic acid hybridization studies.
