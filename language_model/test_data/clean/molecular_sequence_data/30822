Nucleotide sequence of the 1276 bp fragment of Serratia marcescens DNA coding for the recASM gene has been determined. This structure was shown to contain an ORF corresponding to a protein with molecular weight of 37766 D. Comparative analysis of the regulatory part of recASM and recAEC (Escherichia coli) demonstrated identity of "-35" and "-10" boxes for these genes and similarity of the SOS box and the enhancer sequences. A comparison of the amino acids sequences of RecASM, RecAEC and RecAPA (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) proteins revealed a great conservatism in the N-terminus and in some structural patches (alpha-helices and beta-sheets) of the RecA proteins predicted by the model of Blanar et al. In contrast, a strong variability of the C-terminus (for the last 25 amino acids, in particular) was revealed. A necessity for definite amino acids composition of the carboxy-terminal end is discussed.
