Type III secretion systems (T3SSs) of Gram-negative bacteria mediate direct interactions with eukaryotic cells. Pseudomonas spp. harboring T3SS genes (T3SS+) were previously shown to be more abundant in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil. To discriminate the contribution of roots and associated arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on the enrichment of T3SS+ fluorescent pseudomonads in the rhizosphere of Medicago truncatula, their frequency was assessed among pseudomonads isolated from mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal roots and from bulk soil. T3SS genes were identified by PCR targeting a conserved hrcRST DNA fragment. Polymorphism of hrcRST in T3SS+ isolates was assessed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing. Genotypic diversity of all pseudomonads isolated, whether or not harboring T3SS, was described by BOX-PCR. T3SS+ pseudomonads were significantly more abundant in mycorrhizal than in nonmycorrhizal roots and in bulk soil, and all were shown to belong to the phylogenetic group of Pseudomonas fluorescens on the basis of 16S rRNA gene identity. Four hrcRST genotypes were described; two only included isolates from mycorrhizal roots. T3SS+ and T3SS- pseudomonads showed different genetic backgrounds as indicated by their different BOX-PCR types. Taken together, these data suggest that T3SSs are implicated in interactions between fluorescent pseudomonads and AM in medic rhizosphere.
