The type II restriction endonuclease SsoII shows sequence similarity with 10 other restriction endonucleases, among them the type IIE restriction endonuclease EcoRII, which requires binding to an effector site for efficient DNA cleavage, and the type IIF restriction endonuclease NgoMIV, which is active as a homotetramer and cleaves DNA with two recognition sites in a concerted reaction. We show here that SsoII is an orthodox type II enzyme, which is active as a homodimer and does not require activation by binding to an effector site. Nevertheless, it shares with EcoRII and NgoMIV a very similar DNA-binding site and catalytic center as shown here by a mutational analysis, indicative of an evolutionary relationship between these three enzymes. We suggest that a similar relationship exists between other orthodox type II, type IIE, and type IIF restriction endonucleases. This may explain why similarities may be more pronounced between members of different subtypes of restriction enzymes than among the members of a given subtype.
