A case of obsolete intramuscular cysticercosis diagnosed definitively by mitochondrial DNA analysis of extremely calcified cysts was reported. X-ray and computed tomography findings highly suggested cysticercosis due to Taenia solium; however, no direct evidence of cysticercosis was obtained through serological or histopathological examinations. Mitochondrial DNA analysis of a histopathological specimen confirmed the causative agent to be the Asian genotype of T. solium.
