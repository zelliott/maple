An expressed nuclear gene (ATPA) that encodes the alpha-subunit of the human mitochondrial F0F1 ATP synthase complex was isolated from a human genomic library. The nucleotide sequence of the 5'-flanking region of this gene was determined. No typical TATA or CCAAT boxes were found in this region. The 5'-flanking region of this gene contains several sequences that are found in a number of nuclear genes that encode proteins of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system and which might play a role in regulating their expression. The nucleotide sequence of the 5'-flanking region of the human ATPA gene is highly homologous (overall homology approx. 70%) to the corresponding region of the bovine ATPA1 gene.
