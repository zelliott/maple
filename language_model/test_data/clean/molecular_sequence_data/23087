The MHC-DRB1 gene is known to display the most extensive allelic polymorphisms among MHC class II genes. We attempted the selective identification of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) DRB1 (Patr-DRB1) alleles using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique in three steps: first, we performed Patr-DRB1*02 lineage-specific 8-kb PCR for *02 lineage detection in each chimpanzee; second, we performed 620-bp PCR for amplification of full-length exon 2; and finally, we carried out an insert check using the pattern of microsatellite repeat length variability. In the genomic DNA of 23 chimpanzees, nine Patr-DRB1 alleles containing two new alleles were detected. Our approach provides a relatively effective method of identifying Patr-DRB1 alleles in individual chimpanzees and should also contribute to our understanding of the features of MHC molecules in non-human primates.
