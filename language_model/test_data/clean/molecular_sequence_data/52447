In vivo priming of CTL requires the association with MHC class I molecules of peptides derived from the processing of endogenously produced proteins. Immunization with exogenous proteins or peptides rarely induces MHC class I-restricted CTL unless they are associated with lipidic compounds. The capacity to induce CTL was compared in synthetic peptides and simple lipopeptides containing the Immunodominant MHC class I H-2Dd-restricted T-cell epitope of HIV-1 gp160. In contrast with free peptides in saline, lipopeptides induced strong primary CTL responses in vivo. These CTL were able to lyse cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the HIV-1 env gene. Priming of CTL was also successful when using 16-amino acid lipopeptides as 34-amino acid lipopeptides, suggesting that several epitopes might be included in a single construct. In vivo priming of CTL also requires CD4+ T cell help. We therefore searched for Th cell activation after priming with lipopeptides. Our results show that, as with CTL induction, Th cell activation with lipopeptides did not require mixing with adjuvant. In addition, lipopeptides were also efficient at stimulating antibody-mediated responses. Our results show that a single lipopeptidic construct can induce a total immune response, which is of importance in vaccine development.
