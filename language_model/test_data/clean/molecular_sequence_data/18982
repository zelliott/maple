Prototype foamy virus encodes a transactivator called Bel1 that enhances viral gene transcription and is essential for PFV replication. Nuclear localization of Bel1 has been reported to rely on two proximal basic motifs R(199)H(200) and R(221)R(222)R(223) that likely function together as a bipartite nuclear localization signal. In this study, we report that mutating R(221)R(222)R(223), but not R(199)H(200), relocates Bel1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, suggesting an essential role for R(221)R(222)R(223) in the nuclear localization of Bel1. Although not affecting the nuclear localization of Bel1, mutating R(199)H(200) disables Bel1 from transactivating PFV promoters. Results of EMSA reveal that the R(199)H(200) residues are vital for the binding of Bel1 to viral promoter DNA. Moreover, mutating R(199)H(200) in Bel1 impairs PFV replication to a much greater extent than mutating R(221)R(222)R(223). Collectively, our findings suggest that R(199)H(200) directly participate in Bel1 binding to viral promoter DNA and are indispensible for Bel1 transactivation activity.
