The EMB-1 mRNA of carrot (Daucus carota) was isolated as an embryo abundant cDNA clone (T.H. Ulrich, E.S. Wurtele, B.J. Nikolau [1990] Nucleic Acids Res 18: 2826). Northern analyses of RNA isolated from embryos, cultured cells, and a variety of vegetative organs indicate that the EMB-1 mRNA specifically accumulates in embryos, beginning at the early stages of embryo development. In situ hybridization with both zygotic and somatic embryos show that the EMB-1 mRNA begins to accumulate at low levels throughout globular embryos. Accumulation of EMB-1 mRNA increases and becomes more localized as embryos mature; in torpedo embryos, EMB-1 mRNA preferentially accumulates in the meristematic regions, particularly the procambium. The similarity in distribution of EMB-1 mRNA in both zygotic and somatic embryos indicates that much of the spatial pattern of expression of the emb-1 gene is dependent on the developmental program of the carrot embryo and does not require maternal or endosperm factors. The EMB-1 protein (relative molecular weight 9910) is a very hydrophilic protein that is a member of a class of highly conserved proteins (typified also by the Em protein of wheat and the Lea D19 protein of cotton) that may be ubiquitous among angiosperm embryos but whose functions are as yet unknown. The carrot genome appears to contain one or two copies of the emb-1 gene. A 1313-base pair DNA fragment of the carrot genome containing the emb-1 gene was isolated and sequenced. The gene is interrupted by a single intron of 99 base pairs. Primer extension experiments identify two EMB-1 mRNAs, differing by 6 bases at their 5' ends that are transcribed from this gene.
