A Gram-staining-negative, aerobic and rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated HMC4223(T), was isolated from a tidal flat in Taean, Republic of Korea. A phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain HMC4223(T) formed a lineage within the genus Algoriphagus and exhibited highest sequence similarity to Algoriphagus hitonicola 7-UAH(T) (96.3 %). The major fatty acids of strain HMC4223(T) were iso-C15 : 0 and summed feature 3 (comprising C16 : 1ω6c and/or C16 : 1ω7c). The major respiratory quinone was MK-7. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine and five unidentified polar lipids. The DNA G+C content of strain HMC4223(T) was 48.4 mol%. On the basis of the evidence presented in this study, strain HMC4223(T) represents a novel species of the genus Algoriphagus, for which the name Algoriphagus taeanensis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain HMC4223(T) ( = KCTC 22709(T) = NBRC 105728(T)). An emended description of Algoriphagus hitonicola is also presented.
