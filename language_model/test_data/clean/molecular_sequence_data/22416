Increasing evidence suggests that some cannabinoids mediate their effects independently of the known cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors. Two recently published patents indicate that several cannabinoid receptor ligands also bind to the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor GPR55. This receptor is reported to be expressed in several tissues and might function in lipid or vascular biology. Thus, GPR55 might represent a new cannabinoid receptor.
