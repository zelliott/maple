We report the identification of a gene, named SLC-1(1), encoding a novel G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). A customized search procedure of a database of expressed sequence tags (dbEST) retrieved a human cDNA sequence that partially encoded a GPCR. A genomic DNA fragment identical to the cDNA was obtained and used to screen a library to isolate the full-length coding region of the gene. This gene was intronless in its open reading frame, and encoded a receptor of 402 amino acids, and shared -40% amino acid identity in the transmembrane (TM) regions to the five known human somatostatin receptors. Northern blot analysis revealed that SLC-1 is expressed in human brain regions, including the forebrain and hypothalamus. Expression in the rat was highest in brain, followed by heart, kidney, and ovary. Expression of SLC-1 in COS-7 cells failed to show specific binding to radiolabelled Tyr1-somatostatin-14, naloxone, bremazocine, 1,3-di(2-tolyl)-guanidine (DTG), or haloperidol. A repeat polymorphism of the form (CA)n was discovered in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of the gene and SLC-1 was mapped to chromosome 22, q13.3.
