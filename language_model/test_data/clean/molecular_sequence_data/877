Two new HLA-DRB1 alleles were identified by sequencing-based typing in the oral submucous fibrosis and buccal cancer patients of Taiwan. They have been officially named HLA-DRB1*0903 and DRB1*1145 by the World Health Organization Nomenclature Committee. The complete exon 2 sequence of DRB1*0903 was identical to that of the DRB1*090102 but differed by nucleotides of position 207-210 and 216 (AGAC, C replacing GCGG, and G). The DRB1*1145 was identical to the DRB1*110101 except for three nucleotide substitutions at codon 199, 220, and 221 (A, CT replacing T, and GC). Two complete exon 2 sequences of those new alleles had been deposited in the EMBL Sequence Database under accession number AY465114 and AY465115, respectively.
