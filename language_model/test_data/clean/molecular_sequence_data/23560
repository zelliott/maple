P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), a sialomucin expressed on leukocytes, is a major ligand for P-selectin and mediates leukocyte rolling on the endothelium. Here we show that human PSGL-1 interacts with CCL27 (CTACK/ILC/ESkine), a skin-associated chemokine that attracts skin-homing T lymphocytes. A recombinant soluble form of PSGL-1 (rPSGL-Ig) preferentially bound CCL27 among several chemokines tested. This interaction was abrogated by arylsulfatase treatment of rPSGL-Ig, suggesting that sulfated tyrosines play a critical role. In contrast, removal of either N-glycans or O-glycans by glycosidase treatment of rPSGL-Ig did not affect the interaction. The binding of CCL27 to a recombinant PSGL-1 synthesized in the presence of a sulfation inhibitor was lower than that produced in normal medium. Moreover, mutation of the tyrosines at the amino terminus of PSGL-1 to phenylalanine abolished the binding, further supporting the role of sulfated tyrosines in the CCL27-PSGL-1 interaction. Functionally, rPSGL-Ig reduced the chemotaxis of L1.2 cells expressing CCR10, the receptor for CCL27. In addition, the expression of human PSGL-1 on CCR10-expressing L1.2 cells resulted in reduced chemotaxis to CCL27. These findings suggest a role for PSGL-1 in regulating chemokine-mediated responses, in addition to its role as a selectin ligand.
