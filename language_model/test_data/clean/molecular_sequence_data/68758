The nucleotide sequence was determined of a 2.1 kb DNA fragment located at approximately 35 kb to the right of the centromere of chromosome VI from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Analysis revealed the presence of a tRNA(GLy) gene, part of a delta element and a remarkable palindromic sequence. The longest open reading frame found encodes a putative protein of 195 amino acids. Although the fragment was isolated by hybridization to a human diacylglycerol kinase cDNA, no evidence was obtained for the presence of a gene encoding diacylglycerol kinase.
