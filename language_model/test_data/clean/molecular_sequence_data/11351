The orf31-petG gene cluster is located approximately 1.2 kb away from the psbEFLJ operon in the chloroplast genome of Populus deltoides. The orf31 (ycf7) encodes an unidentified polypeptide while the petG gene encodes subunit V of an important component, cytochrome b6/f complex, involved in photosynthetic electron transport. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the orf31-petG gene cluster from the plastid genome of a tree, Populus deltoides. Our sequence analysis suggests that these genes possess high homology with the published sequences of these genes from other plants. Northern analysis suggests development dependent transcription of the orf31-petG cluster in leaves.
