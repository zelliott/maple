The native structures of the Asn-linked oligosaccharides and the O-glycans at Ser126 of human erythropoietin expressed from recombinant BHK cells have been elucidated. Enzymatically released N-glycans were studied by methylation analyses, fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry as well as one- and two-dimensional 1H-NMR spectrometry at 600 MHz. Many (82.7%) were found to be tetraantennary N-acetyllactosamine-type (22.8% with one, 3.6% with two and 0.4% with three N-acetyllactosamine repeats) being tetrasialylated (41%), trisialylated (29.6%) and disialylated (12.2%). A few (9.7%; 4.1% 2,4-branched, 5.6%, 2,6-branched) of the chains were triantennary (5.4% trisialyl, 4.3% disialyl) and 4.6% were of the disialyl diantennary type. Almost all of the innermost GlcNAc residues were alpha 1-6 fucosylated and NeuAc was exclusively alpha 2-3 linked to Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc-R; 60% of the protein was found to be O-glycosylated at Ser126; structures were monosialylated (70%) or disialylated (30%) forms of the Gal beta 1-3GalNAc core type. Glycosylation patterns at individual Asn-Xaa-Thr/Ser sites were determined by analytical high-pH anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection. Only tetraantennary chains with 0-3 N-acetyllactosamine repeats were detected at Asn38 and Asn83, while almost all of the di- and triantennary oligosaccharides were attached to Asn24. Batch analysis of different preparations of recombinant erythropoietin revealed the high reproducibility of the production procedure. Structures containing terminal GalNAc-GlcNAc were detected in small amounts in a few batches.
