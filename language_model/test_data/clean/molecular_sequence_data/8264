Parathyroid cells recognize and respond to (i.e., "sense") minute perturbations in the extracellular ionized calcium concentration (Ca2+o), but the mechanisms underlying this process have remained obscure. Recently, we employed expression cloning in Xenopus laevis oocytes to isolate a cDNA coding for a Ca2+o-sensing receptor from bovine parathyroid. Like the native receptor, the cloned Ca2+o-sensing receptor stimulates phospholipase C (PLC) in a G-protein-dependent manner with a nearly identical pharmacological profile. Its deduced amino acid sequence confirms that it is a member of the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPR). Transcripts for the receptor are expressed in parathyroid and other tissues that sense Ca2+o (viz., kidney and thyroidal C-cells) as well as those that have no known role in extracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, such as the brain. The availability of the cDNA clone for the Ca2+o-sensing receptor made it possible to test the hypothesis that mutations in the gene encoding the human homolog of the receptor cause inherited disorders of mineral ion metabolism. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT) are, in fact, caused by mutations that reduce the activity of the receptor when they are present in the heterozygous and homozygous states, respectively. In contrast, we have subsequently discovered a family in which a form of autosomal dominant hypocalcemia results from an activating mutation in the receptor gene. The Ca2+-sensing receptor, therefore, permits Ca2+o to play a "hormonelike" role as an extracellular first messenger in addition to its well described role as an important intracellular second messenger.
