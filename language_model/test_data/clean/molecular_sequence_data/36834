Hybridization experiments with RNA of 143 tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus strains isolated in different parts of the distribution area were used to study the reactivity of kDNA- and a set of 10 synthetic deoxyoligonucleotide probes. The kDNA probe under certain conditions was shown to hybridize with RNA of all the strains under study, and under other (strict) hybridization conditions did so selectively with a small number of strains. The capacity of oligonucleotide probes for hybridization with RNA of TBE virus strains varied from 12% to 100%. The differences in the hybridization activity of kDNA- and oligonucleotide probes complementary to the genomes of the Sophyin strain (Far-Eastern subtype) and Neudorffle strain (Western subtype) with TBE virus strains were used for differentiation of the strains into six genetic variants. Comparison of the reactivity of molecular probes in experiments with RNA of TBE virus strains and viruses of the TBE complex showed that the differences of the strains belonging to different genetic variants from the prototype Sophyin strain were comparable to those of some members of the TBE complex, with the exception of Powassan virus. These data attest to the necessity of further studies dealing with specification of the taxonomy of TBE complex viruses.
