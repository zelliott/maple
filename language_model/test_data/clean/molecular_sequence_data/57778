Repeating glycosidic linkages of oligosaccharides can be synthesized by solid-phase methods. Glycals were attached to a polystyrene copolymer with a silyl ether bond and were activated to function as glycosyl donors with 3,3-dimethyldioxirane. Glycosidation was performed by reactions with a solution-based acceptor (itself a glycal). Excess acceptor and promoter were removed by rinsing after each coupling, and the desired oligosaccharides were then easily obtained from the polymer by the addition of tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride. By this method, glycosidations are stereospecific and interior deletions are avoided.
