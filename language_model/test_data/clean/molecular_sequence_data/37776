Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activator inhibitor type 1 (HAI-1) and type 2 (HAI-2) are new Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors that were recently purified and cloned from the human stomach cancer cell line MKN45 as specific inhibitors against HGF activator. Both proteins contain two Kunitz inhibitor domains and are expressed abundantly throughout the gastrointestinal tract, in addition to the placenta, pancreas, and kidney. In this study, to assess the possible roles of HAI-1 and HAI-2 in the intestinal mucosa, we examined the expression of HAI-1 and HAI-2 during regeneration of the intestinal mucosa. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that HAI-1 but not HAI-2 was detected more strongly in regenerative epithelium than in normal epithelium, although both proteins were detected throughout the human gastrointestinal tract. During the course of acetic acid-induced experimental colitis in an in vivo mouse model, HAI-1 but not HAI-2 was upregulated in the recovery phase, suggesting that HAI-1 but not HAI-2 is associated with the regeneration of damaged colonic mucosa. Upregulation of HAI-1 may serve to downregulate the proliferative response after initial activation of MET receptor by HGF/scatter factor after an injury.
