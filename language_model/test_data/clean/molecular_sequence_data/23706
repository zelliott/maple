OsEBP-89 gene was an EREBP (ethylene responsive elements binding protein) transcription factor from rice (Oryza sativa). Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of OsEBP-89 gene can be induced by ACC, 2,4-D, ABA, BR, JA, GA, 6-BA and salt. We found an ethylene responsive element-like ERE (ethylene responsive element), named IVC box, in the promoter region (-552 to -510) of OsEBP-89 gene. EMSA results showed the IVC box could specifically bind with nuclear proteins extracted from immature rice seeds. When the rice suspension cell harboring IVC/35S mini-promoter (-46)/GUS chimeric construct (pIVC/GUS) was treated by ACC, GUS activity could be induced. However, two plasmids with OsEBP-89 promoter/GUS (pPSG) and IVC box-deleted OsEBP-89 promoter/GUS (pSphSG) were transformed to rice, when both transgenic suspension cell treated with ACC the GUS expression was also inducible. This result indicated that there are more than one ethylene-responsive elements located in the promoter region of the OsEBP-89 gene.
