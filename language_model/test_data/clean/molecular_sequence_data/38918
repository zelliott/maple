The psae1-1 mutant of Arabidopsis was identified on the basis of a decrease in the effective quantum yield of photosystem II, among a collection of plants subjected to transposon tagging with the Enhancer element. The steady-state redox level and the rate of re-oxidation of P700 are significantly altered in psae1-1 mutants. The responsible mutation was localised to psaE1, one of two Arabidopsis genes that encode subunit E of photosystem I. An additional mutant allele, psae1-2, was identified by reverse genetics. In wild-type plants, the psaE1 transcript is expressed at a higher level than psaE2 mRNA. In the mutants, however, the E1 transcript was barely detectable, and was expressed only in small groups of wild-type cells resulting from somatic reversions. As a consequence, the amount of PsaE protein present in the mutant is significantly reduced. Concomitantly, the levels of other stromal photosystem I subunits (PsaC and PsaD) are also affected. Mutant plants showed a marked increase in light sensitivity and photoinhibition. Additional effects of the psae1 mutation include light green pigmentation, an increase in chlorophyll fluorescence and a decrease of approximately 50% in growth rate under greenhouse conditions.
