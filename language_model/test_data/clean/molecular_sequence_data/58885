The nov gene encodes a cysteine-rich protein that is overexpressed in avian nephroblastomas. It is a member of the CCN family of proteins, all of which are involved in cell growth. Genomic and cDNA clones encompassing the mouse nov gene have been isolated and characterized. The mouse nov gene is highly conserved with the human and chick nov genes at the level of nucleotide sequence and genomic organization. The exon structure reflects the modular organization of the NOV protein in a number of structural domains. These are highly conserved with other members of the CCN family, as is the distribution of 38 of its 40 cysteine residues. The nov gene maps to chromosome 15, between D15 Mit 153 and D15 Mit 183, in a region of conserved synteny with human chromosome 8.
