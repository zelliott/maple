Experience gained through investigations on coeliac disease makes it possible to propose a screening method based on agglutination of isolated K562(S) cells to evaluate the occurrence in food protein of amino acid sequences that are able to adversely affect coeliac and related gluten-sensitive patients. The method consists of in vitro sequential peptic and tryptic digestion of food protein fractions under optimal pH, temperature and time conditions and in vitro incubation of the digest with K562(S) cells; the toxic potential is detected as an agglutination of K 562 (S) cells after a short incubation. Other in vitro test systems, including atrophic coeliac intestinal mucosa and rat fetal intestine, can be used to confirm the results obtained with the isolated cells. A fractionation step of the proteolytic digest on a sepharose-mannan column before exposure of the in vitro systems to the separated peptide fractions adds to the sensitivity of the method. This screening method is not only very useful to investigate action mechanisms in coeliac disease, but also to assess the safety of genetically-modified plant foods and novel foods for gluten-sensitive patients.
