A nuclear factor (SBF-1) has previously been identified in Phaseolus vulgaris L. (bean) suspension cell nuclear extracts that binds in vitro to three DNase I-footprinted elements (SBF-1 boxes I, II, and III, 5' to 3') in the 5' region of the bean CHS15 (chalcone synthase) gene promoter. To define the functional role of the three SBF-1 boxes in development, we examined transgenic tobacco plants carrying a series of nested CHS15 promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) fusions for GUS activity by histochemical staining. We show that the CHS15 promoter deleted to position -173 and lacking all three SBF-1 boxes directs the same qualitative pattern of expression in initiating lateral roots and in developing seeds as the full length promoter (-326). Thus, activation of expression in these organs is mediated by sequence elements located downstream of the three SBF-1 boxes. However, specific deletions within the -326 to -173 region modulate expression. Thus, deletion of box II abolishes GUS activity in initiating lateral roots. Further deletion of box III fails to restore expression but subsequent deletion of an additional 43 bp to position -173 re-establishes expression. We show that sequence-specific DNA-binding activities consistent with these results are present in nuclear extracts of bean roots and seeds. These studies reveal cis elements within the CHS15 promoter, and potential trans factors, that permit organ- and tissue-specific developmental patterns of regulation to be combined with a flexible response to environmental cues.
