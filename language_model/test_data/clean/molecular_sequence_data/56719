PTP1C, a protein-tyrosine-phosphatase (protein-tyrosine-phosphate phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.48) containing two src homology 2 domains, is poorly active when assayed with various protein substrates in vitro. Its activity is stimulated > 1000-fold by anionic phospholipids when myelin basic protein or mitogen-activated protein kinase is used as substrate but reduced in the presence of several other substrates. Data are presented to indicate a direct interaction of the enzyme with phospholipids. Enzyme stimulation directed only toward certain specific substrates is interpreted by assuming that these compounds also bind to the phospholipid vesicles where they will be subjected to rapid enzymatic attack. A possible regulation of PTP1C by its translocation to the cell membrane is hypothesized.
