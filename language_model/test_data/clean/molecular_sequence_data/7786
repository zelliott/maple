Monoclonal antibody 5E5 recognized an intranuclear antigen of neurons in the rat. We isolated 5E5cDNA and determined its nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences. The 5E5cDNA had an open reading frame of 825 amino acids and its amino acid sequence showed no significant homology to any protein or to any DNA binding motif so far known. 5E5 protein had an abundance of basic amino acids, especially arginine, and included a glycine-rich region and a proline cluster. Monoclonal antibody 12H raised against 5E5cDNA fusion protein recognized an intranuclear substance in rat brain sections and a single protein band of about 98 kDa in the brain nuclear extract fraction on immunoblotting. DNA-cellulose column chromatography indicated that 5E5 protein might have DNA-binding ability. Transfection studies indicated that 5E5 protein expressed in COS-1 is localized in cell nuclei. These results suggest that 5E5 protein is a possible DNA-binding protein which is expressed especially in neurons.
