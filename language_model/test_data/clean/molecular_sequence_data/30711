VIP, PHI and secretin were purified from rabbit small intestine throughout a maximum of 6 chromatographic steps. After elution on a reverse phase C18 column, the 3 peptides were separated on a Fractogel column using specific radioimmunoassays for detection. After cation exchange chromatography on Mono S, the final steps were performed using a reverse phase RP8-e column. For these steps, radioreceptor assays were utilized to detect VIP and PHI. We confirmed that the VIP sequence of rabbit was identical to that of porcine VIP. The PHI sequence was also found identical to that of porcine PHI. By contrast, rabbit secretin was highly original, differing from porcine secretin in having Leu, Arg and Leu-NH2 residues instead of Phe, Ser and Val-NH2 in, respectively, position 6, 16 and 27.
