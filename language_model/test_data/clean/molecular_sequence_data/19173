Bungowannah virus is the most divergent atypical pestivirus that had been detected up to now, and does not fit into any of the four approved species: Bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 (BVDV-1) and type 2 (BVDV-2), Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and Border disease virus (BDV). However, the presence of N(pro) and E(rns) coding regions, which are unique to pestiviruses, provides clear evidence of a pestivirus. Nevertheless, the amino acid identity of Bungowannah virus N(pro) and BVDV-1 N(pro) (strain CP7) is only 51.5%. By using a BVDV-1 backbone, a novel chimeric construct was generated, in which the genomic region encoding the non-structural protein N(pro) was replaced by that of Bungowannah virus (CP7_N(pro)-Bungo). In vitro studies of CP7_N(pro)-Bungo revealed autonomous replication with the same efficacy as the BVDV backbone CP7 and infectious high-titer virus could be collected. In order to compare the ability of interferon (IFN) suppression, two reporter gene assays, specific for type-I IFN, were carried out. In virus-infected cells, no significant difference in blocking of IFN expression between the parental virus CP7, Bungowannah virus and the chimeric construct CP7_N(pro)-Bungo could be detected. In contrast, an N(pro) deletion mutant showed an impaired replication in bovine cells and a marked type-I IFN response. Taken together, our findings reveal the compatibility of non-structural protein N(pro) of atypical Bungowannah virus with a BVDV type 1 backbone and its characteristic feature as an inhibitor of type-I IFN induction with an inhibitor-activity comparable to other pestiviruses.
