There exist about 1000-1500 internal telomeric sequences per haploid genome in the polytene chromosomes of the hypotrichous ciliate Stylonychia lemnae. All these telomeric repeats are contained in a very conserved element. This element consists of two 2 kb direct repeats flanking a 2.6 kb sequence. Immediately adjacent to one of the repeats a 18mer C4A4C4A4C2 telomeric sequence is localized. Sequences homologous to macronuclear DNA follow 180 bp downstream of the C4A4-bloc. These macronuclear homologous sequences are flanked by the second direct repeat. The possible origin and function of these telomere containing elements is discussed.
