A solid phase synthesis of the polypeptide corresponding to the 1-42 sequence of beta-amyloid protein that accumulated in brain cells during Alzheimer's disease was performed using Fmoc strategy. Two alternative approaches to the synthesis, stepwise elongation of the peptide chain and fragment coupling, were compared, and the advantage of the latter approach was shown. Effects of various factors (solvents, reagents for deprotection of alpha-amino functions, and substitution level of polymer carrier) on the synthesis was studied. The appropriate conditions of HPLC for an analysis of the homogeneity of the beta A4(1-42) peptide, as well as the conditions of its gel chromatography on Sephadex G-50 providing the preparation of the end product of 90-95% purity according to HPLC were found.
