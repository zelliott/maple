By differentially screening an adult Brugia malayi cDNA library with sera from microfilaremic and amicrofilaremic donors infected with Wuchereria bancrofti, we have identified a novel parasite antigen denoted SXP-1. Recombinant SXP-1 filarial antigen is preferentially recognized by sera from microfilaremic persons with bancroftian filariasis and from skin snip-positive patients with onchocerciasis. Antibodies to SXP-1 are restricted to the IgG4 subclass and gradually decline after treatment with diethylcarbamazine. These findings indicate that it may be possible to replace microscopic examination of night blood films with a serological test designed to detect antibodies to a mix of SXP-1 and other suitable antigens for the diagnosis of microfilaremia due to bancroftian filariasis.
