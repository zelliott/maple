Suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2) is a negative regulator of growth hormone signaling. The deletion of SOCS2 in mice results in a 30-50% increase in post-natal growth. In an effort to identify polymorphisms in the SOCS2 gene that may be associated with body size in dogs, we characterized the canine SOCS2 gene and analyzed its genetic diversity among small and large dog breeds. The study was carried out on a total of 520 dogs from 66 different breeds. Dogs were classified as large or small based on height and weight as determined by their respective American Kennel Club breed standards. The SH2 and SOCS domains of the canine SOCS2 gene were sequenced in 32 dogs from different breeds. Only one non-synonymous sequence variant (DQ415457:g.326G>T) was detected which corresponds to an amino acid change (Asp127Tyr). All samples were genotyped by PCR/RFLP and the allele frequencies were determined for each dog breed. The T allele was distributed primarily among European large dog breeds with a gene frequency ranging from 0.72 to 0.04. The nature of the nucleotide change and the effect on the protein together with the finding of a QTL related to body size in the same CFA15 region by other researchers suggest canine SOCS2 as a potential candidate gene for body size in dogs. Future studies will be needed to clarify the role of the 326G>T polymorphism and its interaction with genes like growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1.
