IL-17-producing CD4(+) T cells, so called T(h)17 cells, constitute a newly identified inflammatogenic cell population, which is critically involved in some inflammatory diseases. To explore the role of T(h)17 cells in murine experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU), a model of human autoimmune uveitis where T(h)1 responses predominantly participate in the pathogenesis, IL-17(-/-) mice were immunized with interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein peptide 1-20 for disease induction. Funduscopic examination revealed that EAU was induced in IL-17(-/-) mice just like in wild-type (WT) mice at early phases of the disease. However, at later/maintenance phases, the severity was significantly reduced in IL-17(-/-) mice. Expression of IFN-gamma and MCP-1 was comparable between WT and IL-17(-/-) mice during the time course. In vivo blockade of IFN-gamma and IL-4 resulted in exacerbation of EAU at later phases with augmented IL-17 production. Taken together, our data demonstrated that IL-17/T(h)17 participates in the late phases of EAU and also that T(h)1 and T(h)17 responses are differentially required for EAU.
