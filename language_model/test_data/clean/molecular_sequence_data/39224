The sequence of the genome of a Rupestris stem pitting-associated virus (RSPaV) isolated from a declining Syrah grapevine in California, designated the Syrah strain (RSPaV-SY) was determined. The genome of this strain had an overall nucleotide identity of 77% in comparison with RSPaV sequences in GenBank; the coat protein was the most conserved gene among RSPaV sequences and the replicase was the least conserved gene. Phylogenetic analysis of partial coat protein and replicase gene sequences showed RSPaV-SY clustered independently from the majority of RSPaV isolates.
