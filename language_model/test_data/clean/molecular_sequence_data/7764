Several overlapping cDNA clones corresponding to the entire coding sequence of the mouse alpha 1(XI) collagen gene (Col11 a1) were isolated. The conceptual amino acid translation indicated a high degree of sequence identity (93%) with the human alpha 1(XI) chain. The cloning experiments also revealed alternative splicing of the sequence coding for 85 residues located within the acidic region of the amino-globular domain of alpha 1(XI). Analysis of RNA samples from different embryonic tissues suggested that alternative splicing might be confined to tissue destined to become bone.
