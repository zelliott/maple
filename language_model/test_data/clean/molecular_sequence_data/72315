Two cDNAs encoding inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors were amplified from rat olfactory tissue, and both exhibited 100% sequence identity to the short (Segment II - ) variant of type I IP3 receptor. Type III IP3 receptor was also expressed in olfactory tissue. The distribution of IP3 receptors included the olfactory epithelium, lamina propria, and glandular tissue. These results demonstrate the co-expression of multiple IP3 receptor subtypes in olfactory cells, and suggest multiple functions for IP3 receptors in this tissue.
