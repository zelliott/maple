Bacteria localize to specific target organs during infection by recognizing eukaryotic cell surface addresses. This address system exists to facilitate normal trafficking of host cells such as leukocytes. The mechanisms by which bacteria subvert host targeting codes provide a unique link between microbial pathogenesis and eukaryotic cell trafficking, and can point to a new array of antibodies and peptides of potential therapeutic value.
