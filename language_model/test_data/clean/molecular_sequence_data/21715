Hemoglobins (Hb) are the major protein components of erythrocytes circulating in the red blood, but can serve additional functions besides the transport of oxygen. Here, the cDNA of the bloody clam (Tegillarca granosa) Hb dimer (designated Tg-HbI) was cloned and was found to be 748 bp in length, consisting of an open reading frame of 441 bp encoding a polypeptide of 147 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of Tg-HbI shared 81.6% similarity with HbI from two species of the genus Scapharca and 46-51% similarity with the Hb proteins from other mollusks. The 3D structure of bloody clam Tg-HbI was predicted by the SWISS-MODEL Protein Modelling Server and compared with that of Scapharca kagoshimensis. The mRNA transcript of Tg-HbI was detected in all of the clam cells/tissues examined, including haemocytes, the adductor muscle, foot, hepatopancreas, gill and mantle. The mRNA expression of Tg-HbI was significantly up-regulated after Vibrio parahaemolyticus, lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan challenge, indicating that Tg-HbI was involved in the immune defence responses against bacterial infection and exposure to bacterial pathogenic factors. As the first functional research on the Hb protein in bloody clam, our findings provide new insight into the innate immune defence mechanisms of T. granosa and other mollusks.
