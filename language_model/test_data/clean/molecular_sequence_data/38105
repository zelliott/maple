The Matrix Polymer Hydrolysis Model for regulation of growth in plants is based on the simultaneous hydrolysis and incorporation of new glucans into the cell wall observed in growing plant tissues. The inhibition of growth in rice coleoptile tissues treated with glucanase antibodies confirms similar results observed previously in maize coleoptiles and provides direct evidence for a role of glucanase in control of plant growth. Analysis of two-maize coleoptile endo-glucanase ESTs shows that these sequences are not related to any other previously known family of glycosyl hydrolase. Thus, the coleoptile endo-glucanase enzyme should be classified as a new enzyme group (E.C. 3.2.1.xx). These discoveries enable new initiatives for further investigation of the glucanase role in control of plant growth.
