To evaluate expression patterns of protein product of putative tumor suppressor gene TSC-22 in human astrocytic tumors by immunohistochemical approach.

Plasmid pET-23d-TSC22 was constructed for the expression of human TSC-22 protein in bacterial system, and polyclonal rabbit antibodies against recombinant TSC-22 were produced. Immunohistochemical analysis of TSC-22 and GFAP expression with the use of anti-human-TSC-22- and anti-human-GFAP-antibodies was performed on histological slides of astrocytic tumors.

Immunohistochemical analysis has shown that the number of cells expressing TSC-22 was significantly lower in glioblastoma tissues than that in diffuse astrocytoma. Double immunohistochemical staining of astrocytic tumors using anti-human-TSC-2- and anti-human-GFAP-antibodies showed that both TSC-22 and GFAP expression is co-localized in astrocytes.

TSC-22 protein is expressed in astrocytes, but not in macrophage/microglial cells. In more aggressive forms of astrocytic tumors decreased expression of TSC-22 mRNA correlates with its lowered expression on protein level.
