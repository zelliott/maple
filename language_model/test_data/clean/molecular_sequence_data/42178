The frequency of RAS and p53 mutations was investigated in 30 acute promyelocytic leukemias by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of genomic DNA. Only two cases bore N-RAS codon 12 mutations and none had p53 mutations responsible for aminoacid substitutions. It would, therefore, seem that neither RAS nor p53 are involved in acute promyelocytic leukemogenesis.
