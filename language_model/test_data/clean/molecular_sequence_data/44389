A 3,167-bp PstI fragment of genomic DNA from Pseudomonas sp. strain B13 was cloned and sequenced. The gene clcE consists of 1,059 nucleotides encoding a protein of 352 amino acids with a calculated mass of 37,769 Da which showed maleylacetate reductase activity. The protein had significant sequence similarities with the polypeptides encoded by tcbF of pP51 (59.4% identical positions), tfdF of pJP4 (55.1%), and tftE of Burkholderia cepacia AC1100 (53.1%). The function of TcbF as maleylacetate reductase was established by an enzyme assay.
