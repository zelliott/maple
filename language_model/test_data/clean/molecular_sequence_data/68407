Polymerase chain reaction amplification of several polymorphic genes has been used to study the population biology of Plasmodium falciparum. S antigen is particularly suitable for such studies, but difficulties in the amplification of this gene have precluded its use. Here we describe a simple method for the amplification of S antigen and show why previous attempts may have been unsuccessful. Data are presented from both laboratory and field isolates.
