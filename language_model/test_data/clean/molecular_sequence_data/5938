Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin and Escherichia coli alpha-hemolysin are RTX toxins that kill human immune cells. We have obtained a monoclonal antibody (295) to a cell surface molecule present on toxin-sensitive HL60 cells that can inhibit cytolysis by both RTX toxins. Utilization of this monoclonal antibody for immunoaffinity purification of detergent-solubilized target cell membranes yielded two polypeptide chains of approximate molecular masses of 100 and 170 kDa. Microsequencing of tryptic peptides from the two proteins showed complete homology with CD11a and CD18, the two subunits of the beta2 integrin, lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1). Anti-CD11a and CD18 monoclonal antibodies also inhibited RTX toxin-mediated cytolysis. Direct binding experiments demonstrated the ability of an immobilized RTX to bind LFA-1 heterodimers present in a detergent lysate of human HL60 target cells. Transfection of CD11a and CD18 integrin genes into a cell line (K562) that is not sensitive to either RTX toxin resulted in LFA-1 expressing cells, KL/4, that were sensitive to both toxins. These experiments identify LFA-1 as a cell surface receptor that mediates toxicity of members of this family of pore-forming toxins.
