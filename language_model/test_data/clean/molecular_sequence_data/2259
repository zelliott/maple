This report describes initial efforts to map the ankyrin-binding site of the cytoplasmic domain of the human erythrocyte anion exchanger. The conclusions are that this site is likely to involve a fairly extended sequence in the midregion of the cytoplasmic domain and requires interactions that are not provided by isolated peptides. The region of the sequence involving residues 174-186 is likely to participate in the ankyrin-binding site based on several experiments. Limited tryptic cleavage in the midregion of the cytoplasmic domain (residues 174 and/or 181) nearly abolished the ability of the cytoplasmic domain to inhibit binding of ankyrin to the anion exchanger. Ankyrin protected the cytoplasmic domain from tryptic digestion. Finally, peptide-specific antibodies against the sequence encompassing the site(s) of tryptic cleavage (residues 174-186) blocked binding of ankyrin to the anion exchanger. However, the sequence comprising the tryptic site is not sufficient for high affinity binding of ankyrin. A 39-amino acid peptide (residues 161-200) that includes the tryptic cleavage site(s) was inactive in inhibiting binding of ankyrin to the anion exchanger. Further evidence for a complex ankyrin-binding site is that peptide-specific antibodies against two different, noncontiguous regions (residues 118-162 and 174-186) both inhibited binding of ankyrin to the anion exchanger and were only 10-20% as effective as antibody against the entire cytoplasmic domain. Finally, the ankyrin-binding site of the anion exchanger did not renature following sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose paper even though spectrin did recover ability to bind ankyrin under the same conditions. Thus, the ankyrin-binding site is not defined by a short continuous sequence. A simple consensus sequence for ankyrin-binding regions in other proteins is not likely.
