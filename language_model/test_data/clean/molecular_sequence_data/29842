A pair of primers was designed according to the sequence of mammal fatty acid binding protein (FABP) gene, then PCR amplified to chicken genome. After the product of PCR was cloned and sequenced, homologous comparison was done among porcine heart fatty acid binding protein gene and porcine adipocyte fatty acid binding protein gene. The result showed that the sequence of chicken FABP gene had 68% and 75% homology with porcine H-FABP and A-FABP gene respectively, and had 75% homology with porcine AFABP on amino acid level. The result of Northern showed that the gene only expressed in fat tissues.
