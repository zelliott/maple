We assessed the fibrillogenic properties of synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 13-26 of beta/A4 amyloid, containing either the normal sequence (beta 13 26) or the mutations Glu22 to Gln (beta 13-26Q22) and Ala21 to Gly (beta 13-26G21). The kinetics of aggregation were monitored at 37 degrees C and pH 7.4 by measuring the amount of peptide remaining in solution, using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Negative stain electron microscopy revealed that all of the peptides formed fibrils. However, beta 13-26Q22 showed greatly accelerated fibril formation compared to the other two. The results suggest that the Q22 mutation confers increased amyloidogenic properties on the beta/A4 peptide, whereas the G21 mutation acts by a different pathogenic mechanism.
