The Gbetagamma complex of heterotrimeric G proteins is the most outstanding example for the divergent regulation of mammalian adenylyl cyclases. The heterodimeric Gbetagamma complex inhibits some isoforms, e.g. ACI, and stimulates the isoforms ACII, -IV, and -VII. Although former studies identified the QEHA region located in the C2 domain of ACII as an important interaction site for Gbetagamma, the determinant of the stimulatory effect of Gbetagamma has not been detected. Here, we identified the C1b domain as the stimulatory region using full-length adenylyl cyclase. The relevant Gbetagamma signal transfer motif in IIC1b was determined as MTRYLESWGAAKPFAHL (amino acids 493-509). Amino acids of this PFAHL motif were absolutely necessary for ACII to be stimulated by Gbetagamma, whereas they were dispensable for Galpha(s) or forskolin stimulation. The PFAHL motif is present in all three adenylyl cyclase isoforms that are activated by Gbetagamma but is absent in other adenylyl cyclase isoforms as well as other known effectors of Gbetagamma. The emerging concept of two contact sites on different molecule halves for effective regulation of adenylyl cyclase is discussed.
