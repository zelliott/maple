The NHase encoding gene of mutant 4D was isolated by PCR amplification. The NHase gene of mutant 4D was successfully cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli by using Ek/LIC Duet cloning kits (Novagen). For the active expression of the NHase gene, the co-expression of small cobalt transporter gene (P-protein gene) has also been co-expressed with NHase gene E. coli. The nucleotide sequence of this NHase gene revealed high homology with the H-NHase of Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1. The recombinant E. coli cells showed higher NHase activity (5.9 U/mg dcw) as compared to the wild (4.1 U/mg dcw) whereas it is less than the mutant strain (8.4 U/mg dcw). Addition of cobalt ion in Luria-Bertani medium is needed up to a very small concentration (0.4 mM) for NHase activity. The recombinant E. coli exhibited maximum NHase activity at 6 h of incubation and was purified with a yield of 56 % with specific activity of 37.1 U/mg protein.
