Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) and vaccinia virus (VV) are serologically unrelated poxviruses with a disparate genome composition (MCV, 66% G+C; VV, 33% G+C). Molecular studies of MCV have been hindered by the inability to propagate the virus in cells cultured in vitro. We sequenced 7765 bp of MCV DNA cloned from four widely spaced regions throughout the MCV genome and identified a total of 11 potential open reading frames (ORF), designated CX1-11. These include MCV homologues of the VV genes encoding protein kinase 2, structural protein VP8, RNA polymerase 35 kDa subunit and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. The position and orientation of the MCV ORFs was collinear to the VV genome, with the exception of the region around ORF CX11 which is inverted in the MCV genome.
