We report here the identification of a bacterial protein capable of interacting with mammalian death receptors in vitro and in vivo. The protein is encoded in the genome of Chlamydia trachomatis and has homologues in other Chlamydia species. This protein, which we refer to as "Chlamydia protein associating with death domains" (CADD), induces apoptosis in a variety of mammalian cell lines when expressed by transient gene transfection. Apoptosis induction can be blocked by Caspase inhibitors, indicating that CADD triggers cell death by engaging the host apoptotic machinery. CADD interacts with death domains of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family receptors TNFR1, Fas, DR4, and DR5 but not with the respective downstream adaptors. In infected epithelial cells, CADD is expressed late in the infectious cycle of C. trachomatis and co-localizes with Fas in the proximity of the inclusion body. The results suggest a role for CADD modulating the apoptosis pathways of cells infected, revealing a new mechanism of host-pathogen interaction.
