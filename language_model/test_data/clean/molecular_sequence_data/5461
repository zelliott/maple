The Brevibacterium lactofermentum EF-P gene, encoding the elongation factor protein P, was cloned and sequenced. According to DNA sequence analysis of this gene, the B. lactofermentum EF-P protein consists of 187 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 20,584. Southern hybridization of an internal fragment of the EF-P gene from B. lactofermentum with chromosomal DNAs from different microorganisms reveals that it is a unique gene product in B. lactofermentum and Corynebacterium glutamicum. The EF-P gene was expressed in E. coli using the T7 expression system and the calculated molecular weight of the expressed protein was 23,000. Disruption experiments using an internal fragment of the EF-P gene or a disrupted EF-P gene in suicide plasmids always failed, suggesting that the gene is needed for cell viability.
