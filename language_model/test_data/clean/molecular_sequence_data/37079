Tubulin is one of the most widespread classes of multiprotein families and is well known to construct microtubules with two different subunits, alpha- and beta-tubulin. In the course of genome analysis of Bombyx mori, we have constructed an EST database by large-scale sequencing of clones that were randomly selected from cDNA libraries of various tissues and organs belonging to different developmental stages. Using this EST database, we have identified four types of beta-tubulin gene and three types of alpha-tubulin gene. Based on the analysis of deduced amino acid sequences, we have determined the phylogenetic relationships of tubulins between Bombyx and Drosophila melanogaster as well as two other moth species, suggesting that each tubulin is classified into at least three distinct subfamilies: a ubiquitously expressed one, a developmentally regulated one and a testis specific one.
