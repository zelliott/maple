The Fas-FasL system plays a crucial role in the maintenance of homeostasis in the immune system. To characterize the Fas/FasL system in macaque monkeys that are commonly used as experimental primates, we cloned and sequenced Fas cDNA derived from the cynomolgus monkey. The predicted amino acid sequence consists of 331 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 35,800. The extracellular cysteine-rich motif of cynomolgus Fas is highly homologous to that of humans (96%), whereas the intracellular death domain has a relatively low similarity to that of humans (86%). An agonistic Fas antibody (CH11) or cynomolgus FasL induced apoptosis in human Fas-transfected K562 cells in the presence of CHX but not in the cynomolgus Fas transfectant. CH11 and FasL failed to trigger apoptosis in the transfectant expressing human-cynomolgus chimera Fas consisting mostly of human-derived extracellular region and cynomolgus-derived intracellular portion. On the other hand, the transfectant expressing cynomolgus-human chimera Fas with human-derived intracellular region underwent apoptosis upon exposure to FasL. In addition, the virus-transformed, Fas-positive cynomolgus monkey cell line was highly sensitive to FasL. These findings suggest that the lack of apoptotic activity in the cynomolgus Fas transfectant in the human cell line might be related to the species-specific structure of Fas, especially of the death domain.
