Accumulation of either native membrane-bound or soluble variants of PBP5 over-expressed in the cytoplasm was investigated by electron microscopy of ultra-thin sections. One of the soluble forms of PBP5 (PBP5s353) formed well-ordered crystals inside the cells. Cells sectioned perpendicular to their long axis showed a diamond-shaped crystal whereas cells cut parallel to their long axis contained a long, narrow crystal. In both sectioning directions an ordered ultrastructure was visible as shown by optical diffraction. Computer processing was used to enhance the crystal images. From this the unit cell parameters were calculated as a = 7.6 nm, b = 4 nm, c = 4.2 nm, gamma = 75 degrees. The calculated unit-cell volume of 120 nm3 is large enough to contain one protein molecule.
