A 32-kDa protein was purified from acrosomal extracts of ejaculated boar spermatozoa as a complex with 55- and 53-kDa proacrosins. In the presence of the 32-kDa protein, these proacrosins were sequentially converted by autoactivation to a 49-kDa intermediate, a 43-kDa intermediate, and then a 35-kDa mature acrosin. This activation process was consistent with that in the absence of the 32-kDa protein, but differed in producing the 49-kDa form as the predominant acrosin intermediate. Thus, the 32-kDa protein may be a regulatory protein for proacrosin activation. The 49-kDa intermediate was a two-chain polypeptide with the amino-terminal sequences corresponding to those of the light and heavy chains of mature acrosin, whereas the carboxyl-terminal sequence of its heavy chain was identical with that of the 53-kDa proacrosin. These results suggest that the 49-kDa intermediate is produced from 53-kDa proacrosin during proacrosin activation by the cleavage of the peptide bond between Arg-23 and Val-24, which results in the formation of the light and heavy chains.
