A new triterpenoid saponin, macrophyllicin has been isolated from the methanolic extract of the whole plant of Primula macrophylla. On the basis of chemical and spectral evidence, the structure of macrophyllicin was determined as 3-O-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl- (1-->2)-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-->2)-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl] -6 beta,16 alpha,28-trihydroxy-olean-12-ene. The 2D NMR experiments were useful in providing complete information on the structure of macrophyllogenin, a new sapogenin.
