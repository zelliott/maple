Pharmacological characteristics of [D-Pro9,[spiro-gamma-lactam]Leu10,Trp11]physalaemin-(1-11) (GR82334), a tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist, and its effects on slow depolarizing responses of lumbar ventral roots evoked by primary afferent stimulation were examined in isolated spinal cord preparations of neonatal rats. GR82334 (1-3 microM) caused dose-dependent rightward shifts of the concentration-response curves for substance P, substance P methyl ester, delta-aminovaleryl [Pro9,N-Me-Leu10]substance P-(7-11) (GR73632) and neurokinin A in normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid and those for substance P methyl ester, GR73632 and neurokinin A in the presence of tetrodotoxin. GR82334 (10 microM) did not evoke gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release from spinal cords of neonatal rats, whereas [D-Pro9,[spiro-gamma-lactam] Leu10,Trp11]substance P (GR71251), another tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist, induced a significant increase in GABA release. GR82334 (1-3 microM) markedly depressed the slow depolarizing response of ventral roots, referred to as slow ventral root potential, evoked by the stimulation of the contralateral dorsal root or the ipsilateral saphenous nerve. In contrast, cyclo[Gln,Trp,Phe,Gly,Leu,Met] (L-659,877, 1 microM), a selective tachykinin NK2 receptor antagonist, did not depress the saphenous nerve-evoked slow ventral root potential and did not antagonize the action of neurokinin A to induce ventral root depolarization. The present results provide further evidence for the involvement of substance P, neurokinin A and tachykinin NK1 receptors in the primary afferent-evoked slow ventral root potentials.
