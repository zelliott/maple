The bacterial tmRNA acts with dual tRNA-like and mRNA-like character to tag incomplete translation products for degradation. Comparative analysis of 17 tmRNA genes (including eight new sequences) has allowed us to deduce conserved features of the tmRNA secondary structure. Except in a segment that includes the first codon of the tag reading frame, tmRNA is highly structured, with four pseudoknots and a total of 11 conserved base pairing regions. The previously identified tRNA minihelix structure is connected by a long base paired region to a large structured domain composed of a pseudoknot, followed by the tag reading frame and a string of three rather similar pseudoknots. The conservation of numerous structural elements among diverse eubacterial species indicates that these elements have important function beyond simply forming an endonuclease-resistant link between the reading frame and the tRNA-like domain.
