The DNA repeat region of fcrA76, the gene encoding a group A streptococcal Fc-binding protein, was subcloned in-frame into an Escherichia coli plasmid expression vector. The expressed protein product displayed the same Fc-binding properties as the full-length Fc-binding protein expressed from fcrA76. The affinity-purified, full-length Fc-binding protein was found to compete with staphylococcal protein A or streptococcal protein G for binding to beads coated with human IgG. These results are consistent with earlier studies suggesting that the binding sites on human IgG for protein A, protein G and the type II Fc-binding protein from group A streptococci are located at the interface of the CH2 and CH3 domains of the Fc region.
