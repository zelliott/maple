The human topoisomerase IIbeta binding protein 1 (TopBP1) has been reported to be involved in DNA replication, in DNA damage checkpoints and in apoptosis. Detailed analysis of the TopBP1 promoter revealed that the early growth response protein-1 (Egr-1) induces this promoter. Binding of Egr-1 to the TopBP1 promoter was determined to region -50 to -18 using EMSA and ChIP technology. Furthermore, deletion of the E2F transcription factor binding sites or mutation of the Egr-1 transcription factor binding sites lead to reduced stimulation of the TopBP1 promoter by Egr-1. These data indicate a cooperative regulation of the TopBP1 promoter by Egr-1 and E2F.
