Several distinctive features of anti-DNA autoantibodies have been identified by a detailed analysis of the available heavy and light chain sequences. They include unique VH gene segments that are not normally expressed in antibodies to external antigens, somatic mutations which may serve to change the antigenic specificity as well as to increase affinity, a less stringent choice of light chains, and a unique basic peptide in the heavy chain CDR3. It is proposed that in the majority of cases, the regulatory mechanism of self-tolerance in the healthy animal operates via VH gene expression to prevent the synthesis of potentially high affinity anti-DNA autoantibodies.
