The Bacillus subtilis homolog of the Escherichia coli morphogene orfE (of the mre operon) has been identified. The determinant is located on the chromosome immediately upstream of the mreBCD-minCD (divIVB) operon. The Maf protein shares substantial amino acid sequence identity with the E. coli OrfE protein. Introduction of the B. subtilis maf determinant on a multicopy plasmid into B. subtilis cells results in an inhibition of septation, which leads to extensive filamentation and loss of viability in the transformed cell population. Insertional inactivation of maf indicated that this gene is not essential for cell division.
