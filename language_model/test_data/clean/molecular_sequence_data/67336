Citreicella aestuarii 357 is a member of the Roseobacter clade that was isolated without xenobiotic pressure from an oil-polluted sand sample from the Galician coast (Spain). Its genome sequence suggests an organoheterotrophic metabolism, including a wide catabolic potential for aromatic hydrocarbons.
