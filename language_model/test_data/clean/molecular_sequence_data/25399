Coexistence of two different HNF1-like factors (AlF-A1 and AlF-A2) in rat liver is described. The two factors had similar molecular weight and the same sequence-specificity in DNA-binding. One of these factors AlF-A1 was retained on wheat germ agglutinin-sepharose column and eluted from it with N-acetylglucosamine, while AlF-A2 was not, suggesting that AlF-A1 is glycosylated. Using rat brain nuclear extract, both factors stimulated transcription in vitro, but their stimulatory effects differed from each other.
