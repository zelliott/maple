Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an important cause of hepatitis among young Egyptian adults with high seroprevalence rates seen in both rural areas of the Nile Delta and in suburban Cairo. Because natural antibodies to HEV have been detected in animals and zoonotic transmission is postulated, we surveyed work horses in Cairo for evidence of HEV exposure and viremia. Sera from 200 Cairo work horses were tested by ELISA for the presence of IgG anti-HEV antibody revealed a seropositivity of 13%. Among 100 samples processed for detection of viral genome by means of nested polymerase chain reaction (N-PCR), 4% were positive and indicative of viremia. Viremic animals were less than 1 year old. Relative to PCR-negative horses, PCR-positive animals demonstrated significant elevation of AST (p=0.03). Phylogenetic analysis of a 253-bp fragment, in the ORF-1,2,3 overlap region of the HEV genome from the viremic animals showed that three of these viral strains to be identical, and closely related (97-100% nucleotide identity) to two human isolates from Egypt, and distant (78-96%) from 16 other HEV isolates from human and animals and shared 99.6% NI with the fourth strain. The consensus sequence of the four strains was origin obtained elsewhere. These data indicated that horses acquire HEV infection and suggest that cross-species transmission may occur. Whether horses play a role in the transmission of HEV needs further investigation.
