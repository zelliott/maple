Human immunodeficiency virus effectively evades CD8(+) T-cell responses through the development of CD8 escape mutations. Recent reports documenting reversion of transmitted mutations and the impact of specific escape mutations upon viral replication suggest that complex forces limit the accumulation of CD8 escape mutations at the population level. However, the presence of compensatory mutations capable of alleviating the impact of CD8 escape mutations on replication capacity may enable their persistence in an HLA-mismatched host. Herein, we illustrate the long-term stability of stereotypic escape mutations in the immunodominant HLA-B27-restricted epitope KK10 in p24/Gag following transmission when accompanied by a specific compensatory mutation.
