Sequence analysis of a new lignin peroxidase (LIP) gene, GLG6, from P. chrysosporium showed that it encodes a mature LIP protein with a predicted Mr of 36,454. A 28 aa signal peptide precedes the mature protein. The coding region of GLG6 is interrupted by nine introns ranging in size from 50-57 bp. GLG6 encoded-LIP has 72%, 88% and 82% homology, respectively, to the LIP isozymes H2, H3, and H10. Comparison of the N-terminal sequence of GLG6-encoded LIP to that of the LIP proteins H2, H8, H10 also showed that the former is relatively less related to the H2 protein than it is to the H8 and H10 proteins. Expression of GLG6, similar to the other LIP genes, occurs only during secondary metabolism.
