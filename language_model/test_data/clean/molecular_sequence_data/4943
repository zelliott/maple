Gene amplification, which is generally considered to occur late in tumor development, is a common feature of high grade glioma. Up until now, there have been no reports on amplification in astrocytoma grade I. In this study, we report cloning and sequencing of a cDNA termed glioma-amplified sequence (GAS41) which was identified recently in a glioblastoma cell line by microdissection-mediated cDNA capture. This technique is tailored to isolate amplified genes from human tumors. An increased copy number of GAS41 was found in glioblastoma multiforme and astrocytoma III, and at a high frequency in astrocytoma grades I and II. Sequence comparison indicates a high homology between the GAS41 protein, the yeast and human AF-9 and the human ENL proteins. Both AF-9 and ENL belong to a new class of transcription factors, indicating that GAS41 might also represent a transcription factor. With GAS41 being the first gene found with increased copy number in low grade glioma, this study provides the first evidence that gene amplification can occur in early tumor development.
