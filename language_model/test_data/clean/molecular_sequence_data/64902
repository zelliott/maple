The reproductive boundaries among species in the large-spored Metschnikowia clade were studied by prototrophic recombinant selection, electrophoretic karyotyping, mitochondrial DNA restriction analysis, and DNA sequence analysis. Inviable ascospores arose from crosses between the two varieties of Metschnikowia continentalis, indicating that they should be recognized as separate species. Prototrophic recombinants were recovered from crosses between auxotrophic mutants of Metschnikowia borealis, M. continentalis, Metschnikowia lochheadii, Metschnikowia sp. UWO(PS)00-154.1, and Candida ipomoeae, showing that some genetic exchange is possible in spite of the sterility of the asci formed in interspecific crosses. Metschnikowia hawaiiensis, although capable of ascus formation when its h(-) mating type is crossed with the h(+) mating type of the other species, did not give rise to recombinants. In the other species, some recombinants acquired the ability to form asci directly from single cells. These often contained the chromosomes of both parents, suggesting formation of allodiploid hybrids. Other recombinants behaved as haploids and were similar to one parent except for having inherited the selectable wild-type allele from the other parent. In most, but not all cases, inheritance of the mitochondrial genome was uniparental and correlated with the inheritance of the nuclear chromosome complement. In some cases, what appeared to be a recombinant mitochondrial genome was observed. Phylogenies derived from the sequences of various DNA regions were not congruent, indicating that hybridization may have taken place in nature as the large-spored species diverged from their common ancestor. Further evidence that C. ipomoeae arose from a natural recombination event was obtained, but a pair of Metschnikowia species that might represent derived forms of the parents could not be identified conclusively. C. ipomoeae and most of its closely related Metschnikowia species contained a group-II intron in the mitochondrial small-subunit ribosomal gene. The intron was absent in M. borealis, M. hawaiiensis, and other species in the genus Metschnikowia.
