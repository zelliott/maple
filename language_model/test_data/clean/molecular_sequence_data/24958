We analyzed a 402-bp sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of 34 strains of Exophiala jeanselmei and 16 strains representing 12 related species. The strains of E. jeanselmei were classified into 20 DNA types and 17 amino acid types. The differences between these strains were found in 1 to 60 nucleotides and 1 to 17 amino acids. On the basis of the identities and similarities of nucleotide and amino acid sequences, some strains were reidentified: i.e., two strains of E. jeanselmei var. hetermorpha and one strain of E. castellanii as E. dermatitidis (including the type strain), three strains of E. jeanselmei as E. jeanselmei var. lecanii-corni (including the type strain), three strains of E. jeanselmei as E. bergeri (including the type strain), seven strains of E. jeanselmei as E. pisciphila (including the type strain), seven strains of E. jeanselmei as E. jeanselmei var. jeanselmei (including the type strain), one strain of E. jeanselmei as Fonsecaea pedrosoi (including the type strain), and one strain of E. jeanselmei as E. spinifera (including the type strain). Some E. jeanselmei strains showed distinct nucleotide and amino acid sequences. The amino-acid-based UPGMA (unweighted pair group method with the arithmetic mean) tree exhibited nearly the same topology as those of the DNA-based trees obtained by neighbor joining, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods.
