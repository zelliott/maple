Integrin-associated protein (IAP) is a widely expressed membrane protein with multiple functions in immunological and neuronal processes. Having physically mapped the IAP gene into a BAC/PAC contig covering approximately 1 Mb on human chromosome 3ql3.1-q13.2, we determined the genomic organization of the gene, established its expression in skeletal muscle, and identified a novel splice variant. Our expression studies demonstrate expression of integrin-associated protein in the t-tubular system and the euchromatin of skeletal muscle cells where its function thus far is not known.
