The trypanosomatid parasite Leishmania major is one of the principal causal agents of human cutaneous leishmaniasis. Promastigotes grown in vitro undergo growth cycle-dependent differentiation, associated with morphological and biochemical changes, to produce forms which are infective to the mammalian host. By differentially screening a cDNA library constructed from stage-specific mRNA, we have isolated 4 clones encoding mRNAs which show unique or elevated expression in the infective promastigotes of Leishmania major. One of these clones is homologous to a heat-shock protein 70-related gene, that is non-heat-inducible but shows up-regulation during promastigote differentiation. Each of the other cDNAs isolated also recognises multiple transcripts, which show differential regulation between parasite stages and are encoded by repeated, linked nuclear genes. In trypanosomatids, this genomic organisation is indicative of polycistronic transcription.
