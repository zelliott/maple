The key response-regulator gene of sporulation, spo0A, has been cloned from Bacillus stearothermophilus and the encoded protein purified. The DNA-binding and phospho-acceptor domains of Spo0A have been prepared by tryptic digestion of the intact protein and subsequently crystallized in forms suitable for X-ray crystallographic studies. The DNA-binding domain has been crystallized in two forms, one of which diffracts X-rays to beyond 2. 5 A spacing. The crystals of the phospho-acceptor domain diffract X-rays beyond 2.0 A spacing using synchrotron radiation.
