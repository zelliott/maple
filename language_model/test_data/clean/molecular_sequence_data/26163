We have isolated and expressed a cDNA encoding human NK cell Fc gamma RIII. The NK cell cDNA differs from the neutrophil Fc gamma RIII cDNA by a number of point mutations and encodes an additional 21 amino acids at its C-terminus. When transiently expressed neutrophil and NK cell Fc gamma RIII were digested with N-glycanase, deglycosylated neutrophil Fc gamma RIII had a more rapid electrophoretic mobility than NK cell Fc gamma RIII, as is observed for the human Fc gamma RIII isoforms on normal cells. The neutrophil and NK cell Fc gamma RIII isoforms apparently result from cell-type specific expression of different forms of Fc gamma RIII mRNA. A TaqI RFLP was also found for human Fc gamma RIII. Monoclonal antibodies which have been used to distinguish the neutrophil and NK cell Fc gamma RIII isoforms and the NA1 and NA2 alleles of human neutrophil Fc gamma RIII were employed to study the expression of two Fc gamma RIII cDNA clones derived from neutrophils and NK cells. Fc gamma RIII encoded by the neutrophil-derived cDNA reacts with the monoclonal antibody CLBgran11, while the NK-cell Fc gamma RIII cDNA expresses the Fc receptor which carries an antigenic determinant recognized by the antibody GRM1. Characterization of hybrid Fc gamma RIII constructed by interchange of restriction fragments between the neutrophil and NK cell cDNAs allowed localization of antigenic determinants recognized by the monoclonal antibodies.
