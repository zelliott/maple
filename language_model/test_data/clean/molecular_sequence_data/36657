A number of different matrices have been tested and compared for ultraviolet and infrared (UV and IR) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) of oligodeoxyribonucleotides and mixtures thereof, as well as ribonucleic acids (tRNA from yeast and rRNA from E. coli). A new technique for removing alkali cations from nucleic acid samples during sample preparation on the sample support is demonstrated. The amount of oligonucleotide sample consumed during a typical measurement in IR-MALDI-MS was determined.
