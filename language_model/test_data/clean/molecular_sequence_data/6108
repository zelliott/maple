HMEC-1 is a SV-40T transfected human microvascular endothelial cell line that constitutively expresses RNA transcripts for plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), protein S (PS), von Willebrand factor (vWF), and thrombomodulin. Tissue factor (TF) can be induced in response to stimulation with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1alpha) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Proteins corresponding to PAI-1, t-PA, protein S and vWF genes were constitutively released in the culture supernatant. This cell line is a model that will be useful to investigate coagulation/fibrinolytic properties of microvascular endothelium.
