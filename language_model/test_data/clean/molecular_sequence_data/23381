RNA editing in higher plant chloroplasts involves C-to-U conversion at specific sites in the transcripts. To examine whether pea shares editing sites with other angiosperms, a systematic search for editing sites in pea chloroplast transcripts was performed. Based on amino acid sequence alignment, 451 RNA editing sites were predicted from 60 transcripts. Sequence analysis of amplified cDNAs for these potential editing sites revealed 19 true editing sites from 13 transcripts. Together with those reported previously, the total number of editing sites is 27 from 16 transcripts in pea chloroplasts. Twenty-two sites are conserved among other plant species, whereas five sites are unique to pea. Among the 27 editing sites, seven are partially edited. The most interesting is the ndhG site 1, which has led to the diversification of the evolutionarily conserved amino acid sequence. This observation suggests that some of the editing events cause the diversity of amino acid sequences, and hence, that prediction of editing sites based on amino acid sequence alignment has its own limitations.
