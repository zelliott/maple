The highly variable second exons of the red deer (Cervus elaphus) major histocompatibility complex (MHC) DQB genes were cloned and sequenced. Eight different expressed DQB sequences were isolated from four unrelated red deer. Either two or three different DQB sequences were isolated from each individual, demonstrating that more than one DQB gene is expressed in red deer. This is consistent with other ruminant, which also have multiple expressed copies of the DQB gene. The sequences ranged in similarity from 81.3% to 97.6% with an average similarity of 90.2%; this indicates that at least one of the DQB genes is highly polymorphic.
