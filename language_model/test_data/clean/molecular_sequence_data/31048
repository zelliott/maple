A D-glucuronic acid rich, copolymeric chondroitin sulfate (CS)-dermatan sulfate (DS) proteoglycan (PG) from post-burn hypertrophic scar tissue (HSc) was obtained by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and differential ethanol fractionation, and further purified on a Sepharose CL-6B column. CS-DS-PG protein content was 14% (w/w). The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the first ten residues was as follows: NH2-Asp-Glu-Ala-B-Gly-Ile-Gly-Pro-Glu-Val. This sequence is identical to that of human embryonic fibroblast cell (IMR-90) CS-DS-PG, as well as to human HSc-DS-PG. After chondroitinase ABC treatment, two peptides (Mr 22,000 and 16,000 daltons) were detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-(polyacryl)amide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). ELISA analysis using rabbit antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide that contained 15 amino acids in the same sequence as the amino terminus of human fetal membrane PG showed significant reactivity with HSc CS-DS-PG. HSc CS-DS-PG had an apparent Mr of approximately 78,000 daltons, as determined by Sepharose CL-6B chromatography and SDS-PAGE. Alkaline borohydride treatment of CS-DS-PG liberated CS-DS glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains having an Mr of 29,000 daltons. The conversion of xylose to xylitol indicated that the GAG chains are attached to the PG protein core at O-3 through a xylosyl-seryl linkage. CS-DS-PG also contained both N and O-linked oligosaccharides and did not aggregate with hyaluronic acid. These results, together with those reported previously, showed that HSc CS-DS-PG and DS-PG have the same A1-A15 amino acid sequence at the amino terminus but different protein cores. HSc CS-DS-PG was completely digested with chondroitinase AC and is, therefore, distinctly different from HSc DS-PG.
