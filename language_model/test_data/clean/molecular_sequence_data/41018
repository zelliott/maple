We have determined the nucleotide sequence of aroG, the gene coding for 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate synthetase(phe), one of three isoenzymes that catalyse the first step of the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids and vitamins in Escherichia coli K12. The DNA sequence agrees with previously published data on the N-terminal sequence, amino acid composition, and subunit molecular weight of 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate synthetase(pne). There is significant identity in the nucleotide sequences of aroG and aroH (the gene for 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate synthetase (trp), indicating that these two genes have evolved from a common ancestral gene. There is no attenuator structure in the leader region of aroG.
