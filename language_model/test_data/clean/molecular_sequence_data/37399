Nasal immunization of normal mice with HIVgp160-encapsulated hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-liposome induced high titers of gp160-specific neutralizing IgG in serum and IgA in nasal wash, saliva, fecal extract, and vaginal wash, along with both Th1- and Th2-type responses. HIVgp160-specific IgG- and IgA-producing cells were also detected in mononuclear cells isolated from spleen, nasal cavity, salivary gland, intestinal lamina propria, and vaginal tissue of nasally immunized mice. In addition, CD8(+) CTLs were induced in mice nasally immunized with gp160-HVJ-liposome. These findings suggest that two layers of effective HIV-specific humoral and cellular immunity, in mucosal and systemic sites, were induced by this nasal vaccine. In immunodeficient mice, nasal immunization with gp160-HVJ-liposome induced Ag-specific immune responses for the systemic and mucosal compartments of both Th1 (IFN-gamma(-/-)) and Th2 (IL-4(-/-)). In vitro Ag-specific serum IgG Ab and vaginal wash samples possessing IgA and IgG Abs that had been induced by nasal immunization with gp160-HVJ-liposome were able to neutralize a clinically isolated strain of HIV-MN strain isolated from Japanese hemophiliac patients. Taken together, these results suggest that, for the prevention and control of AIDS, nasally administered gp160-HVJ-liposome is a powerful immunization tool that induces necessary Ag-specific immune responses at different stages of HIV infection.
