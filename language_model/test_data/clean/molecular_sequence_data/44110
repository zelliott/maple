The nucleotide sequence has been determined for zooA, a gene encoding the bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance zoocin A in Streptococcus zooepidemicus strain 4881. The zooA gene product corresponds to the 285-amino acid (aa) zoocin A pre-peptide from which a leader sequence is cleaved to form the 262-aa biologically active molecule of estimated molecular mass 27,877 Da. Expression of zooA in a Gram-negative host was shown by the extracellular release from Escherichia coli, containing cloned zooA, of a biologically active peptide having an identical range of anti-bacterial activity to that of zoocin A, purified from S. zooepidemicus strain 4881. Data base searches revealed sequences having homologies with known muralytic proteins produced by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and indicate a 'mix and match' blending of domain-type structures, the C-terminal putative receptor-recognition region of the molecule being joined by a threonine-proline-rich linker to an N-terminal putative catalytic region having homology with several known endopeptidases, including lysostaphin.
