Gene ACIAD1637 from Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 encodes a 182 amino acid putative antibiotic resistance protein. The structure of this protein (termed acepita) has been solved in space group P(2) to 2.35 A resolution. Acepita belongs to the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) family, and contains the four sequence motifs conserved among family members. The structure of acepita is compared with that of pita, its homologue from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Acepita has a similar substrate profile to pita and performs a similar function.
