Sulfolobus solfataricus contains a membrane-associated protein kinase activity that displays a strong preference for threonine as the phospho-acceptor amino acid residue. When a partially purified detergent extract of the membrane fraction from the archaeon S. solfataricus that had been enriched for this activity was incubated with [gamma-(32)P]ATP, radiolabeled phosphate was incorporated into roughly a dozen polypeptides, several of which contained phosphothreonine. One of the phosphothreonine-containing proteins was identified by mass peptide profiling as the product of open reading frame [ORF] sso0469. Inspection of the DNA-derived amino acid sequence of the predicted protein product of ORF sso0469 revealed the presence of sequence characteristics faintly reminiscent of the "eukaryotic" protein kinase superfamily. ORF sso0469 therefore was cloned, and its polypeptide product was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein formed insoluble aggregates that could be dispersed using urea or detergents. The solubilized polypeptide phosphorylated several exogenous proteins in vitro, including casein, myelin basic protein, and bovine serum albumin. Mutagenic alteration of amino acids predicted to be essential for catalytic activity abolished or severely reduced catalytic activity. Phosphorylation of exogenous substrates took place on serine and, occasionally, threonine. This new archaeal protein kinase displayed no catalytic activity when GTP was substituted for ATP as the phospho-donor substrate, while Mn(2+) was the preferred cofactor.
