The gpd1+ gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, encoding an isozyme of NADH-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, is responsible for an osmoinducible glycerol production in response to external high osmotic stimuli, and its expression is osmoregulated at the level of transcription. In this study, the structure of the osmoinducible promoter of gpd1+ is described. Not only the core promoter elements including the putative TATA-box and transcription start site, but also a short upstream activation sequence (UAS) was identified, which are involved in the osmotic induction of the gpd1+ gene through the Wis1 MAP (mitogen activated protein) kinase pathway.
