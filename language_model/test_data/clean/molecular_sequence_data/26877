Chromatin-modifying factors have essential roles in DNA processing pathways that dictate cellular functions. The ability of chromatin modifiers, including the INO80 and SWR1 chromatin-remodelling complexes, to regulate transcriptional processes is well established. However, recent studies reveal that the INO80 and SWR1 complexes have crucial functions in many other essential processes, including DNA repair, checkpoint regulation, DNA replication, telomere maintenance and chromosome segregation. During these diverse nuclear processes, the INO80 and SWR1 complexes function cooperatively with their histone substrates, gamma-H2AX and H2AZ. This research reveals that INO80 and SWR1 ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling is an integral component of pathways that maintain genomic integrity.
