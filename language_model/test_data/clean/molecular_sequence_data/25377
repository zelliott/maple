The cistron encoding the B subunit of Escherichia coli Shiga-like toxin I (SLT-I) was cloned under control of the tac promoter in the expression vector pKK223-3 and the SLT-I B subunit was expressed constitutively in a wild-type background and inducibly in a lacIq background. The B subunit was located in the periplasmic space, and less than 10% was found in the culture medium after 24 h incubation. Polymyxin B extracts contained as much as 160 micrograms of B subunit/ml of culture. B subunit was purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography followed by chromatofocusing. Cross-linking analysis of purified native B subunit showed that it exists as a pentamer. In gels containing 0.1% SDS the native protein dissociated into monomers. B subunit was found to have the same glycolipid-receptor-specificity as SLT-I holotoxin. Competitive binding studies showed that B subunit and holotoxin had the same affinity for the globotriosylceramide receptor. We conclude that this recombinant plasmid is a convenient source of large amounts of purified SLT-I B subunit, which could be used for biophysical and structural studies or as a natural toxoid.
