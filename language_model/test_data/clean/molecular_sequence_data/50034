Single injection of kainate into the dorsal hippocampus of adult mice induced long-lasting hypertrophy and dispersion of dentate granule cells with dendritic hypertrophy and mossy fiber sprouting that resembled human hippocampal sclerosis. Our previous study indicated that brain derived neurotrophic factor was related to the initiation of these morphological changes. In this study, gene expression of the enlarged hippocampus was examined by differential display to find the gene relating to the progression of the pathological changes. Several genes were identified that were overexpressed in the enlarged dentate gyrus. One of them was highly homologous with mouse Flamingo1/Celsr2, suggesting that mouse Flamingo1/Celsr2 is related to the development of hippocampal sclerosis.
