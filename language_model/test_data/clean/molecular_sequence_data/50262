DNA polymerase epsilon stimulatory factor I (SFI) has been shown to contain three peptides, p66, p37 and p13. Two of these components have been identified. The p66 gene was cloned by using a p66 antibody to screen a lambda gt11 library. A portion of the gene was sequenced and confirmed to encode p66 by the presence of protein sequence corresponding to that of p66 tryptic peptides. The gene was identified as HSP60 by a homology search of GenBank. Tryptic peptides of p37 were sequenced and identified as belonging to yeast translation initiation factor 4A by a homology search of PIR. The HSP60 gene maps to chromosome XII.
