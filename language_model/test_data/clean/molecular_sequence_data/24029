To obtain related genes of Cysticercus cellulosae from spliced leader (SL) cDNA library.

Spliced leader library of Cysticercus cellulosae was constructed using SL specific primer and oligo (dT) 15 with M13M4 primer, and positive clones were then screened randomly, identified with enzyme restriction, followed by sequencing and homologous analysis.

The amino acid sequence, encoded by the positive clone with a poly (A)22 tail and a complete open reading frame (ORF), was with homology of RNA polymerase subunit genes of human, B. napus, fission yeast, A. thaliana, C. elegans and fruit fly up to 71.6%.

The protein, RNA polymerase subunit encoded putatively by the clone, is high conservative in different species.
