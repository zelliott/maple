In order to understand the significance of presence of HIV-1 in saliva, we searched for by PCR HIV-1 proviral sequences in the saliva cells of 49 HIV-1 infected patients. Seven out 49 specimens resulted positive, 4 of which were from patients with PGL, 1 with ARC and 2 with AIDS. Four patients had a CD4+ lymphocyte counts < 200/cmm and in 3 patients the CD4+ lymphocyte count ranged from 200 to 400/cmm. Two patients were treated with AZT, 1 with DDI and 4 had no antiretroviral treatment. In conclusion, although HIV-1 proviral sequences have been found in saliva of HIV-1 infected patients, a larger group of patients should be investigated to define more precisely the role of HIV-1 in saliva.
