Four overlapping cDNA clones encoding contrapsin were isolated from a mouse liver cDNA library constructed in the expression vector, lambda gt11. M13 vector sequence analysis revealed that contrapsin cDNA contained an open reading frame of 1,254 bases encoding 418 amino acids. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the isolated contrapsin matched residues 30 to 48 of the sequence deduced on nucleotide analysis. One clone, which had the longest 3' untranslated region, contained two sets of tandem polyadenylation signals, AATACA and AATAAA, which were located 497 bases apart, while the remaining three clones terminated at the first signal. The entire reading frame sequence of contrapsin cDNA showed 64% homology with that of human alpha-1-antichymotrypsin.
