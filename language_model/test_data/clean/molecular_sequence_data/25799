Based on amino acid sequence similarities between the methylated elongation factor EF-Tu from Escherichia coli and the EF-Tu from Euglena gracilis chloroplast, we predicted that the latter could also be methylated in the presence of an appropriate methyltransferase. We found that, as reported for the eubacterial homologous protein, the organellar factor could be methylated in vivo and in vitro to yield monomethyllysine.
