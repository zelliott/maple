Three novel Gram-negative, non-fermenting aerobic bacilli were isolated from human clinical samples. They shared more than 99.8 % of the 16S rRNA gene nucleotide positions. The strains were related to Ochrobactrum intermedium with about 97.48 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. In 16S rRNA gene-, dnaK- and rpoB-based phylogenies, the strains were grouped in a lineage that was distinct from other Ochrobactrum species in the family Brucellaceae. Fatty acid composition, polar lipids, quinone system, DNA-DNA relatedness, genome organization, and physiological and biochemical data differentiated these isolates from recognized species of the genus Ochrobactrum. The three clinical strains therefore represent a novel species within the genus Ochrobactrum, for which the name Ochrobactrum pseudintermedium sp. nov., is proposed. The type strain is ADV31(T) (=CIP 109116(T)=DSM 17490(T)). The DNA G+C content of strain ADV31(T) was 54.5 mol%.
