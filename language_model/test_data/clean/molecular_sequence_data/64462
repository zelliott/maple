Lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS), an N-glycosylated dual functional monomeric protein, acts as a PGD2-producing enzyme and also as a lipophilic ligand-binding protein. L-PGDS is localized in the central nervous system, male genital organs of various mammals and in the human and monkey heart, and secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid, seminal plasma and blood plasma. The L-PGDS concentrations in these body fluids are useful for the diagnosis of several neurological disorders, dysfunction of sperm formation, cardiovascular and renal diseases.
