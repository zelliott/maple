Previous studies of the TCR alpha chain gene have located promoter elements 5' to the start of the various V alpha genes. The only fully characterized enhancer for the entire alpha chain gene (V, J and C genes) has been located approximately 3 kb from the 3' end of C alpha. We now report the existence of additional regulatory elements located in the introns of several murine V alpha genes (V alpha 1, V alpha 3 and V alpha B6.2.16). In the case of V alpha 1, this element appears to be a promoter with bidirectional activity that is not T cell specific. Interestingly, upstream of the promoter in the antisense strand, an open reading frame has been found that codes for a small molecular weight protein (approximately 60 amino acids) that contains a proline-rich region and a tyrosine-isoleucine motif that has homology to Ig beta (the B29 gene product). A rabbit antiserum made against this sequence has confirmed its existence by Western blot and immunoprecipitation. Thus this V alpha 1 intronic promoter has the potential not only to induce the formation of a truncated V alpha 1 gene product, but also regulates the expression of a small molecular weight protein that may be involved in lymphocyte antigen receptor signaling. The activity of this promoter is regulated by changes in intracellular calcium. In the presence of ionomycin the promoter is down-regulated in the sense direction and its activity is enhanced in the antisense direction. This result suggests that this promoter can act differentially to produce two very different gene products. The bidirectional V alpha 1 promoter appears to be the first in the Ig superfamily to induce potentially functional proteins in both directions.
