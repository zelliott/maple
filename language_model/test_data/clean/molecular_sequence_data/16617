From the shark Scyliorhinus stellaris we cloned and sequenced a cDNA encoding a novel type I keratin, termed SstK10. By MALDI-MS peptide mass fingerprinting of cytoskeletal proteins separated on polyacrylamide gels, we assigned SstK10 to a 46-kDa protein which is the major epidermal type I ("IE") keratin in this fish and is specifically expressed in stratified epithelia. In a phylogenetic tree based on type I keratin sequences and with lamprey keratins applied as outgroup, SstK10 branches off in a rather basal position. This tree strongly supports the concept that teleost keratins and tetrapod keratins resulted from two independent gene radiation processes. The only exception is human K18 because its orthologs have been found in all jawed vertebrates (Gnathostomata) studied; in the tree, they form a common, most early branch, with the shark version, SstK18, in the most basal position. Thus, the sequences of SstK10 and SstK18 also favor the classical view of vertebrate evolution that considers the cartilaginous fishes as the most ancient living Gnathostomata. To determine the overall expression patterns of epidermal ("E") and simple epithelial ("S") keratins in this shark, we furthermore tested a panel of monoclonal anti-keratin antibodies by immunofluorescence microscopy of frozen tissue sections, and in immunoblots of cytoskeletal preparations, demonstrating that immunodetection of specific keratins is a convenient method to characterize epithelial tissues in shark.
