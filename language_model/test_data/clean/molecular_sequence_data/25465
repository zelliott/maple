The gene encoding the citric acid cycle enzyme, citrate synthase, has been cloned from the thermoacidophilic archaebacterium, Thermoplasma acidophilum. We report the sequencing of this gene and its flanking regions, and the derived amino acid sequence of the enzyme is compared by multiple-sequence alignment analysis with those of citrate synthases from eubacterial and eukaryotic organisms. The similarity is less than 30% between the archaebacterial and non-archaebacterial sequences, although the majority of residues implicated in the catalytic action of the enzyme have been conserved across all three kingdoms. The cloned archaebacterial gene has been expressed in Escherichia coli to produce catalytically active citrate synthase. This is the first reported sequence of citrate synthase from the archaebacteria.
