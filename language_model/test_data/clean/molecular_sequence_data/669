Human Hsp60 is expressed in the joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and can elicit a regulatory T cell response in the peripheral blood and synovial fluid. However, Hsp60 can also trigger strong proinflammatory pathways. Thus, to understand the nature of these Hsp60-directed responses in RA, it is necessary to study such responses at the molecular, epitope-specific level. This study was undertaken to characterize the disease specificity and function of pan-DR-binding Hsp60-derived epitopes as possible modulators of autoimmune inflammation in RA.

Lymphocyte proliferation assays (using (3)H-thymidine incorporation and carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester [CFSE] staining) and measurement of cytokine production (using multiplex immunoassay and intracellular staining) were performed after in vitro activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with RA, compared with healthy controls.

A disease (RA)-specific immune recognition, characterized by T cell proliferation as well as increased production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and IL-10, was found for 3 of the 8 selected peptides in patients with RA as compared with healthy controls (P < 0.05). Intracellular cytokine staining and CFSE labeling showed that CD4+ T cells were the subset primarily responsible for both the T cell proliferation and the cytokine production in RA. Interestingly, the human peptides had a remarkably different phenotype, with a 5-10-fold higher IL-10:TNFalpha ratio, compared with that of the microbial peptides.

These results suggest a disease-specific immune-modulatory role of epitope-specific T cells in the inflammatory processes of RA. Therefore, these pan-DR-binding epitopes could be used as a tool to study the autoreactive T cell response in RA and might be suitable candidates for use in immunotherapy.
