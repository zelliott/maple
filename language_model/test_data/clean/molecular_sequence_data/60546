Increased expression of gelatinase A is associated with both angiogenesis and alterations in blood vessel structure. Heart-derived endothelial cells derived from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were found to express significantly more gelatinase A in culture, both at the protein and mRNA level, than endothelial cells from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Other matrix metalloproteinases, as well as their tissue inhibitors, were not differentially regulated. A 1683 bp gelatinase A promoter fragment linked to a luciferase reporter demonstrated up to 40-fold more activity when transfected into SHR-derived cells versus WKY-derived cells. The promoter region between -1324 and -1272, previously termed RE1, contributed up to a five-fold increase in basal promoter activity in both cells, but contributed only 12% of the promoter activity in SHR-derived cells compared to 85% in WKY-derived cells. In SHR-derived cells, but not in WKY-derived cells, a second region between -1435 and -1375, termed RE2, contributed 60% of the total activity of the 1683 bp promoter fragment. Both electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Southwestern blots demonstrated differences in RE2-specific binding factors in nuclear extracts derived from the two cell types. SHR-derived endothelial cells thus represent a new model system to study the regulation of gelatinase A expression, which itself may contribute to the abnormal vascular structure seen in the SHR.
