The cDNA of murine alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase was placed under the control of the beta-actin promoter and cytomegalovirus enhancer, then introduced into male pronuclei of fertilized mouse eggs. The three transgenic mouse lines obtained were analysed for the expression of the transferase by staining with Griffonia simplicifolia agglutinin I-B4 (GSI-B4), which is alpha-galactosyl specific. Compared with wild-type mice, all lines of transgenic mice expressed GSI-B4 binding sites more intensely in the renal tubular brush border and lung alveolar epithelium, and newly expressed them in the photoreceptor outer segments, goblet cells of the small intestine and around spermatogonia. GSI-B4 binding sites were also detected in the liver of some transgenic mice. Even though the introduced enzyme gene was expressed in embryos, it did not severely hinder embryogenesis. The transgenic mice tended to secrete more proteins in the urine than the wild type. Furthermore, low body weights, partial damage to hair growth and early death occurred more frequently in the transgenic mice.
