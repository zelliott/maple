3'-Mercapto-2',3'-dideoxy-NTP were synthesized and tested as DNA chain terminating nucleotides. It is shown that the analogues selectively and irreversibly terminate DNA chain elongation by AMV and HIV reverse transcriptases and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, whereas calf thymus alpha DNA polymerase, E. coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) and MLV reverse transcriptase do not use the nucleotide analogues as chain terminator substrates.
