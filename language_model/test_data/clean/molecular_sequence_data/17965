Microdissection of the lampbrush loops "threads" and "pseudonucleolus" of Y chromosomes from primary spermatocytes of Drosophila hydei and subsequent microcloning of the DNA yielded several recombinant DNA clones which cross-hybridized in screening the different clone banks. By DNA sequencing we found that the inserts of these cross-hybridizing clones contain blocks of poly[d(C-A].poly[d(G-T)]. Testis RNA contains a large fraction of transcripts with this simple repeated nucleotide sequence. With the aid of transcript in situ hybridization we discovered that the "cones" and "pseudonucleolus" lampbrush loops are the primary sites of transcription of poly[d(C-A)].poly[d(G-T)] in spermatocytes. In addition, we found a strand-specific transcription of (CA/GT)n. In both the "cones" and "pseudonucleolus" the (CA)n strand is transcribed, while in the "pseudonucleolus" (GT)n is also transcribed. Labelled (CA)n probes also react with the protein bodies in spermatid nuclei. These observations are discussed in the context of possible functions of (CA/GT)n transcripts in spermatogenesis.
