The epidemiology of canine parvovirus (CPV) infections in dogs in India was examined using 27 isolates collected during a two-year period. The VP2 genes of 22 isolates were sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequences were compared. The results indicated that the isolates belonged to CPV type 2a except four, which belonged to CPV type 2b. Comparison of the VP2 gene sequences revealed that the Indian isolates formed separate lineages distinct from the South East Asian isolates. The canine parvovirus isolates in India appear to evolve independently, and distinct geographical patterns of evolution could not be discerned in the isolates examined.
