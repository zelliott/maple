Under the influence of progesterone, the porcine uterus synthesizes plasmin/trypsin inhibitor (PTI), a low molecular weight protein (M(r) approximately 14,000) belonging to the Kunitz family of proteinase inhibitors. Here it is demonstrated that mRNA for the same protein is produced by the developing trophoblast during early pregnancy and by the placenta throughout gestation. The transcript for PTI was represented in approximately 0.1% of total phage plaques of a day 13-17 porcine conceptus cDNA library. It shared 99% nucleotide sequence identity with the cDNA isolated from the uterine library and encoded a 112-amino-acid protein identical to the uterine-produced PTI, which has a well-defined Kunitz domain comprised of 64 residues at its amino terminus. Northern analysis and in situ hybridization studies confirmed that expression of PTI by the conceptus begins as early as day 10 of pregnancy and is continued in placental tissues until at least day 90 of gestation. Expression was trophoblast specific at day 20 of gestation, as in situ hybridization detected no mRNA in the embryo. The pattern of PTI expression during pregnancy is consistent with a role either in controlling trophoblast invasiveness or in inhibiting proteinases with trypsin-like specificity released by immune or inflammatory cells.
