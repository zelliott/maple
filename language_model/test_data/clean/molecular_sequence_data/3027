We discovered a 3,373-bp plasmid (pRT1) in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus sp. strain JT1. Two major open reading frames were identified, and analysis of the sequence revealed some resemblance to motifs typically found in plasmids that replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism. The presence of single-stranded DNA replication intermediates of pRT1 was detected, confirming this mode of replication.
