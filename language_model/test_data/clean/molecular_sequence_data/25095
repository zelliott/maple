The expression of resveratrol synthase (RS) genes is induced by biotic and abiotic factors in peanut cell cultures. However, little is known about the regulation of the RS gene expression in peanut plants. The expression of RS genes was investigated in peanut plants with a peanut RS clone, pPRS3C, which encodes two polypeptides that show about a 96% amino acid sequence identity to peanut RS2 and RS3, respectively. A low level of RS mRNA was detected in the roots of peanut plants grown aseptically in vitro. In mature peanut plants that were grown in the field, however, RS mRNAs were present at relatively high levels in both the roots and pods, but at below the detection limit in leaves. RS mRNAs were abundant in young pods and decreased dramatically in mature pods. The RS mRNA expression was induced by yeast extract and UV in leaves and roots, and also by wounding in leaves. Stress hormones, such as ethylene, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid, induced RS mRNA accumulation in leaves. These results indicate that the RS gene expression is induced by biotic and abiotic stresses through the stress hormones in peanut plants. The induction of the RS gene expression by biotic and abiotic stresses could provide peanut plants with protection from microbial infections through resveratrol synthesis. The RS gene expression in developing pods has significant implications in terms of the role of resveratrol as a phytochemical for human health.
