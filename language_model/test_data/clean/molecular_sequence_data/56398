Microgram quantities of rRNA were recovered from natural microbial communities in sediment, soil, and water with a lysozyme-hot phenol direct extraction method. Gel filtration with Sephadex G-75 spun columns readily removed humic-like contaminants without any measurable loss of rRNA and rendered RNA extracts of sufficient quality for molecular procedures.
