Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and mutation of the gap junction Î²-2 (GJB2) gene are important causes of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). This study aims to determine if congenital CMV infection leads to deafness by inducing GJB2 mutation.

GJB2 gene sequencing and auditory brainstem response testing were performed in 159 neonates (63 with and 96 without CMV infection) from August 2008 to August 2011. For neonates with GJB2 mutation, their parents were further screened for GJB2 sequence.

The incidence of SNHL was 12.7% in CMV-infected but 0% in uninfected children aged 1-1.5 y (P = 0.000). Similar mutation rates of the GJB2 gene were observed in neonates with or without CMV infection (34.9 vs. 32.3%, respectively, P = 0.734). No significant difference in the mutation rate of GJB2 was found among neonates with CMV infection and SNHL, those with CMV infection and normal hearing, and uninfected newborns with normal hearing (P = 0.438). Mutations 79G>A, 109G>A, 341A>G, and 608T>C were found in neonates with and without CMV infection. All of the above mutations were also found in both or one of the corresponding parents.

Congenital CMV infections may cause deafness in neonates, but this might be independent of GJB2 gene mutation.
