Diphtheria toxin (DT) forms transmembrane, voltage-dependent channels in a planar lipid bilayer. Channels with similar characteristics were obtained with CB1, a cyanogen bromide peptide of diphtheria toxin B fragment (DTB) (res 340-459). Tryptophan 398 is in interaction with the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. Using the Eisenberg method in association with the Shiffer-Edmunson wheel representation, we have identified two amphipathic alpha-helices within CB1 (res 346-364 and 389-406) that could be involved in the interaction with lipids. Bearing this information in mind, we are providing a model for the structure of the CB1 channel.
