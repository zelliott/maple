The orphan nuclear receptor DAX1 (dosage-sensitive sex reversal-AHC critical region on the X chromosome gene 1), encoded by the NR0B1 gene, plays important roles in the development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal/gonadal (HPAG) axis as well as in sex determination. Mutations in NR0B1 cause the X-linked cytomegalic form of adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC), and associated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). Over-expression of NR0B1 results in sex reversal in mice and duplication of the 160kb DSS locus in human patients results in a sex-reversed phenotype (XY females). The purpose of these investigations was to determine if alternatively spliced forms of NR0B1 existed. Analysis of expressed sequence tag data predicted a truncated isoform of DAX1. We confirmed the presence of an alternatively spliced form of NR0B1, which we will refer to as NR0B1A, by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and will refer to the deduced protein isoform as DAX1A. Sequencing of the NR0B1A cDNA revealed slight differences from the recently described splice form, DAX1alpha. NR0B1A is encoded by NR0B1 exon 1 and exon 2A located within the 3385 nt intron between NR0B1 exons 1 and 2. Exon 2A includes 35 nt of coding sequence. NR0B1A encodes a deduced protein sequence, DAX1A, of 400 amino acids compared with 470 amino acids for DAX1. RT-PCR detected expression of NR0B1A in adrenal gland, testis, ovary, and pancreas. The identification of NR0B1A and the deduced DAX1A requires reinterpretation of many previous experiments involving expression and knockout of NR0B1 and DAX1.
