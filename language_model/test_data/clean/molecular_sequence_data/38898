LIM proteins are important eucaryotic developmental regulators characterized by the presence of one or several double zinc finger motifs, the LIM domains, which are protein-interacting domains. Using the cDNA of the previously described pollen LIM protein PLIM1 from sunflower as a hybridization probe we have isolated the coding sequence for a related protein from cDNA libraries from various sunflower organs. This protein, WLIM1, is 188 amino acids long and, like the pollen protein PLIM1, contains two LIM domains, separated by a 48 residue spacer region. The two sunflower proteins are structurally related to the animal LIM proteins CRP and MLP. A WLIM1 gene transcript was detected by RT-PCR in all vegetative and reproductive plant organs tested. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the bacterially expressed and affinity-purified protein recognize a polypeptide of ca. 50 kDa in these organs. Immunocytochemical studies detect the protein in many cell types in each of these organs where it is localized either to the cytoplasm, the nucleus, or both. The protein is often associated with plastids and smaller cellular structures or organelles. In late anaphase and early telophase of dividing cells from ovaries, stems and roots it accumulates in the phragmoplast, and may therefore also play a role in cytokinesis.
