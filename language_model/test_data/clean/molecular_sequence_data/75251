During bacterial chemotaxis, the binding of stimulatory ligands to chemoreceptors at the cell periphery leads to a response at the flagellar motor. Three proteins appear to be required for receptor-mediated control of swimming behavior, the products of the cheA, cheW, and cheY genes. Here we present the complete nucleotide sequence of the Salmonella typhimurium cheA gene together with the purification and characterization of its protein product. The protein is a 73,000 Mr cytoplasmic constituent. Amino acid-sequence comparisons indicate that it belongs to a family of bacterial regulatory proteins including the products of the cpxA, dctB, envZ, ntrB, phoR, phoM, and virA genes. Each member of this family has a conserved domain of approximately equal to 200 residues within its C terminus. We have previously shown that another chemotaxis protein, CheY, represents a domain of protein structure that has been conserved within a second large family of bacterial regulatory proteins. Each protein of the CheA family seems to function as a regulator of a different CheY homologue. Although each pair of proteins appears to produce a specialized response to a distinct type of stimulus, the relationships in primary structure suggest that a similar molecular mechanism may be involved.
