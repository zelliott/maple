A 456 basepair HindIII fragment that encoded a portion of the type A botulinum neurotoxin gene was cloned into Escherichia coli using a plasmid vector. DNA sequence analysis revealed that this botulinum DNA insert encoded an open reading frame of 35 amino acid residues of which 34 corresponded to the N-terminal residues of botulinum neurotoxin type A.
