With efficient homologous recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a rapid in vivo cloning technique has been available. Here we demonstrated that 30 bp of a homologous sequence at each end of a DNA fragment is sufficient to integrate the fragment into a linearized plasmid in yeast. To obtain a high yield of recombination transformants, however, more than 60 bp are desirable. Interestingly, we observed that 20 bp of homology at one end of a DNA fragment is sufficient for efficient recombination provided that the other end contains 80 bp of homologous sequence. Some applications, including high-throughput transferring of EST inserts to the yeast expression systems for the Human Genome Project, are discussed.
