The model of protective immunity induced by immunization with irradiated plasmodia sporozoites (SPZ) has become the prototype for a promising vaccine strategy based on Ab and CTL responses directed against pre-erythrocytic stage Ags, in particular the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and sporozoite surface protein 2 (SSP2). However, results from recently conducted vaccine studies suggest that T cell responses directed against additional specificities might also be required for protection. We have tested this hypothesis by examining human T lymphocytes from irradiated Plasmodium falciparum SPZ-immune volunteers for proliferative reactivities to parasitized red blood cells (pRBC) and recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides representing certain liver and blood stage Ags. In this work, we report that although SPZ-induced protective immunity is stage-specific, SPZ-immune lymphocytes recognized determinants associated with erythrocytic and liver stage parasites. Thus, protective immunity induced by irradiated SPZ may depend upon responses against pre-erythrocytic Ags in addition to CSP and SSP2.
