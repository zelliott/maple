Borrelia binds host's complement regulatory factor H (fH) to evade complement attack. However, binding affinities between fH-binding-proteins (FHBPs) of Borrelia and fH from various hosts are disparate. Experiments performed to unfold the underlying molecular basis of this disparity revealed that recombinant BbCRASP-1 (major FHBP of Borrelia burgdorferi) neither interacted with sushi 6-7, nor with sushi 19-20 domains of fH in cattle and pig, however, showed binding affinity to both sushi domains of human fH, sushi 6-7 of mouse and sushi 19-20 of sheep. Further, peptide-spot assay revealed three major binding sites (sushi 6:(335-346), sushi 7:(399-410) and sushi 20:(1205-1227)) in human fH that can form BbCRASP-1:fH interface, while (337)HENMR(341) residues in sushi 6 are crucial for rigid BbCRASP-1:fH complex formation. Amino acid stretches DTIEFTCRYGYRPRTALHTFRTT in ovine sushi 19-20 and SAYWEKVYVQGQ in mouse sushi 7 were important sites for fH:BbCRASP-1 interaction. Comparative analysis of the amino acid sequences of sushi 6 of cattle, pig and human revealed that bovine and porcine fH lack methionine and arginine in HENMR pocket, that may impede formation of fH:BbCRASP-1 interface. Increasing numbers of FHBPs from animal and human pathogens are being discovered, thus results presented here can be important benchmark for study of other FHBPs:FH interactions.
