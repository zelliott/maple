Analysis of the connexin32 gene in patients with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease shows mutations distributed throughout the molecule, with all domains affected except the fourth transmembrane domain and the distal carboxy terminus. Sequence analysis of DNA from 19 unrelated patients detected six novel mutations and three previously reported mutations. Identification of additional mutations extends the distribution of connexin32 mutations in X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and shows that specific mutations recur in additional families.
