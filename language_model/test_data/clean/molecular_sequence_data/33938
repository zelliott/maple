Propionibacterium acnes is an anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium that forms part of the normal human cutaneous microbiota and is thought to play a central role in acne vulgaris, a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit (I. Kurokawa et al., Exp. Dermatol. 18:821-832, 2009). Here we present the whole genome sequence of P. acnes type IB strain 6609, which was recovered from a skin sample from a woman with no recorded acne history and is thus considered a nonpathogenic strain (I. Nagy, Microbes Infect. 8:2195-2205, 2006).
