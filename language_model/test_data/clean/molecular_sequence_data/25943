We have synthesized an insulin-like compound, consisting of the B-chain of bovine insulin and an A-chain corresponding to the A-domain of human insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), in which the isoleucine residue normally present in position 2 of the A-domain of IGF-I has been replaced with glycine. Biological evaluation of the compound indicated that its insulin-like activity (insulin receptor-binding and stimulation of lipogenesis) was 0.2%, and its growth-factor activity (stimulation of thymidine incorporation) was less than 1%, both relative to natural insulin. We conclude that interactions between IleA2 and TyrA19, which are crucial to high biological activity in insulin, are also present in IGF-I, and are equally critical for its biological activity.
