Innate antifungal defense in Drosophila melanogaster relies on the activation of the Toll molecule and the release of drosomycin, a defensin-like molecule with antifungal properties. Ten human homologues of Toll have been described, with central roles in activation of the innate host defense. In the present study, we report a putative human homologue of the Drosophila-derived drosomycin, designated drosomycin-like defensin (DLD). Synthetic DLD displays a broad spectrum of activity against Aspergillus spp. and other clinically relevant filamentous fungi. These effects are specific for filamentous fungi; no activity has been found against yeasts or gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria. Synthetic DLD also displays immunomodulatory effects on Aspergillus-stimulated cytokine production. In addition, we show the expression of DLD mRNA in several human tissues, particularly in the skin, consistent with its putative role as a defensin against invading microorganisms. This is the first indication of an endogenous human peptide with specific antifungal activity, which is probably central in the defense against infections with molds.
