Prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) is one of key players in regulation of insect growth, molting, metamorphosis, diapause, and is expressed specifically in the two pairs of lateral PTTH-producing neurosecretory cells in the brain. Analysis of cis-regulatory elements of the PTTH promoter might elucidate the regulatory mechanism controlling PTTH expression. In this study, the PTTH gene promoter of Bombyx mori (Bom-PTTH) was cloned and sequenced. The cis-regulatory elements in Bom-PTTH gene promoter were predicted using Matinspector software, including myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2, pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1, TATA box, etc. Transient transfection assays using a series of fragments linked to the luciferase reporter gene indicated that the fragment spanning -110 to +33 bp of the Bom-PTTH promoter showed high ability to support reporter gene expression, but the region of +34 to +192 bp and -512 to -111 bp repressed the promoter activity in the BmN and Bm5 cell lines. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that the nuclear protein could specifically bind to the region spanning -124 to -6 bp of the Bom-PTTH promoter. Furthermore, we observed that the nuclear protein could specifically bind to the -59 to -30 bp region of the Bom-PTTH promoter. A classical TATA box, TATATAA, localized at positions -47 to -41 bp, which is a potential site for interaction with TATA box binding protein (TBP). Mutation of this TATA box resulted in no distinct binding band. Taken together, TATA box was involved in regulation of PTTH gene expression in B. mori.
