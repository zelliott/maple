Human neuroblastoma GOTO and IMR32 cells differentiate into neural cells on treatment with 5-BrdU. Here we report that in association with differentiation induced by 5-BrdU, the transcription of HIV-1 was activated in both neuroblastoma cell lines. An NF-kappa B-like factor was also found to be produced in association with the neural cell differentiation of these cells. These results suggest that, during differentiation of neural cells, an NF-kappa B-like factor was produced, and that when the neural cells are infected with HIV-1 the production of NF-kappa B results in activation of transcription of HIV-1. Thus this NF-kappa B-like factor may be involved in the mechanism causing AIDS dementia.
