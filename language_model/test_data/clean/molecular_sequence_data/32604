The flaviviral tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a human pathogen having significant impact on public health. The geographical distribution of TBEV and TBEV-like viruses is increasing, which makes it important to characterise the natural virus populations. Here we present four RT-PCR strategies designed for detection of broad types of tick-borne flaviviruses. Sequence information on more than 32% of a TBEV genome was generated from a small pool of ticks collected in the Stockholm archipelago on the island of Tor√∂. The sequences were characterised and compared with those of other tick-borne flaviviruses, which classified the virus as Western European TBEV.
