Environmental stresses limit plant growth and crop production worldwide. We attempted to isolate rice genes involved in conferring tolerance to environmental stresses by using a transgenic Arabidopsis population expressing full-length cDNAs of rice. Among these lines, a thermotolerant line, R08946, was detected. The rice cDNA inserted in R08946 encoded a NAC transcription factor, ONAC063. This protein was localized in the nucleus and showed transactivation activity at the C-terminus. ONAC063 expression was not induced by high-temperature but highly induced by high-salinity in rice roots. High-osmotic pressure and reactive oxygen species levels also induced ONAC063 expression. The seeds of ONAC063-expressing transgenic Arabidopsis showed enhanced tolerance to high-salinity and osmotic pressure. Microarray and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses showed upregulated expression of some salinity-inducible genes, including the amylase gene AMY1, in ONAC063-expressing transgenic Arabidopsis. Thus, ONAC063 may play an important role in eliciting responses to high-salinity stress.
