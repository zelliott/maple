Oligonucleotide primers derived from the cDNA encoding a full-length bovine UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide, N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAc-transferase) [Homa, F. L., Hollander, T., Lehman, D. J., Thomsen, D. R., and Elhammer, A. P. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 12609-12616], were used for PCR to isolate sequences encoding a homologous enzyme from human salivary gland cDNA. Comparison of the human and bovine nucleotide sequences reveals 94.8% sequence identity in their coding regions and 87% identity in their 3-untranslated regions. The translation of the human GalNAc-transferase coding region predicts an amino acid sequence which is nearly identical (99.6%) to that of the bovine counterpart; there are five conservative and one non-conservative amino acid substitutions between the two enzymes. Expression of the bovine and human cDNAs in the insect cell line, Sf9, resulted in the synthesis of proteins which appeared identical on SDS-PAGE and which had similar enzymatic properties. Screening of a somatic cell human/rodent hybrid panel with a probe derived from the human GaLNAc-transferase cDNA sequence indicated that the human GalNAc-transferase gene is localized to chromosome 18.
