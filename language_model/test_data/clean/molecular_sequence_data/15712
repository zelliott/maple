The Mycobacterium tuberculosis cmk gene, predicted to encode a CMP kinase (CMK), was cloned and expressed, and its product was purified to homogeneity. Steady-state kinetics confirmed that M. tuberculosis CMK is a monomer that preferentially phosphorylates CMP and dCMP by a sequential mechanism. A plausible role for CMK is discussed.
