Differential screening of an Arabidopsis cDNA library constructed from the plant tissues harvested 1 h after wounding resulted in the isolation of wound-inducible cDNA clones (Kim et al., 1994). The cDNA clones could be broadly classified into two groups according to the expression time of their transcripts. Nine clones from the 10 different wound-inducible cDNAs were rapidly induced, reaching a maximum level in approximately 1-1.5 h and then were progressively reduced after wounding. The cDNA clone AWI 31 showed steady accumulation of the transcripts and reached the maximum value at a later time point of 2.5 h and then started to decline. The corresponding gene of the AWI 31 in which the coding region was interrupted by an intron, had an open reading frame that predicted a protein of 386 amino acids. However, the gene product did not show any significant homology to other known proteins in the database. Northern hybridization study using the cDNA probe revealed that the gene was not regulated by other environmental stresses such as drought, high salt, low temperature, or a DPE herbicide treatment, indicating that the cDNA clone AWI 31 was specifically induced by wounding.
