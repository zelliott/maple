The formation and hydrolysis of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) conjugates represent a potentially important means for plants to regulate IAA levels and thereby auxin responses. The identification and characterization of mutants defective in these processes is advancing the understanding of auxin regulation and response. Here we report the isolation and characterization of the Arabidopsis iar4 mutant, which has reduced sensitivity to several IAA-amino acid conjugates. iar4 is less sensitive to a synthetic auxin and low concentrations of an ethylene precursor but responds to free IAA and other hormones tested similarly to wild type. The gene defective in iar4 encodes a homolog of the E1alpha-subunit of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase, which converts pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A. We did not detect glycolysis or Krebs-cycle-related defects in the iar4 mutant, and a T-DNA insertion in the IAR4 coding sequence conferred similar phenotypes as the originally identified missense allele. In contrast, we found that disruption of the previously described mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase E1alpha-subunit does not alter IAA-Ala responsiveness or confer any obvious phenotypes. It is possible that IAR4 acts in the conversion of indole-3-pyruvate to indole-3-acetyl-coenzyme A, which is a potential precursor of IAA and IAA conjugates.
