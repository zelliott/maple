For preparing a DNA fragment with unique protruding ends, plasmid vectors pMB123 and pMB124 were constructed by inserting a synthetic polylinker into plasmid pUR222 at the EcoRI-PstI sites. The polylinker contains two FokI and HgaI sites at its ends in opposite orientation flanking a combination of SalGI, AccI, HindII, HindIII (the latter site is absent from pMB124) and BamHI sites. DNA fragment cloned at the SalGI and BamHI sites can be regenerated by either FokI or HgaI treatment, the SalGI and BamHI sites being deleted from the cloned sequence. Fragments coding for parts of human interleukin-2 were cloned in these vectors.
