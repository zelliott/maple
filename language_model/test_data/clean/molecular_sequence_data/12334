The purpose of this study was to determine the anticoagulant and antithrombotic potential of hirudin during hemodialysis by comparing the efficacy of dialysis with heparin to that of dialysis with recombinant hirudin (r-hirudin). Eleven patients with chronic renal failure and on maintenance hemodialysis were included in this open cross-over study. Conventional doses of heparin were administered during the first dialysis of the study. Two days later r-hirudin, at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg, was given as a bolus at the start of the second dialysis. The mean decreases in plasma levels of urea, uric acid and creatinine were approximately 50% after dialysis with both anticoagulants. Dialysis was therefore equally effective. However, effective dialysis with r-hirudin was achieved with a shorter activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT; range 65 to 103 seconds) compared to that with heparin (> 120 seconds), thereby decreasing the risk of bleeding. Markedly less 111In-labeled platelets accumulated at the inlet of the artificial kidney when r-hirudin was used, suggesting a smaller loss of hollow fiber volume. The results indicate that hirudin may be a suitable alternative anticoagulant for use during hemodialysis and it thus warrants further investigation.
