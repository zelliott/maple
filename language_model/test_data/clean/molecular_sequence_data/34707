Mosquitoes were collected in Heilongjiang province in 2002, four virus strains were isolated by inoculation of homogenates onto BHK cell lines. The viruses were identified. Multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis were carried out by Clustal X (1.8) program.Amino acid (AA) analysis was carried out by GENEDOS (3.2).

Biological characters of four newly isolated strains were examined and it was found that all of them could produce cytopathogenic effect (CPE) in BHK cells, killing sucking mice. Serological tests showed that all of these stains reacted positively to JEV antibodies. PrM and E gene regions were amplified and sequenced. Phylogenic analysis showed that all the newly isolated JEV strains belong to genotype III. Using the vaccine strains (SA14-14-2) as control, analysis of the E gene of the new strains and two JEV strains (47, Ha-3) isolated previously from Heilongjiang province showed that these new strains' nucleotide sequence had a homology of up to 99.9% and the amino acid sequence homology up to 99.8%, respectively. Compared with the standard JE vaccine strain SA-14-14-2 and the four new strains, the nucleotide sequence homology was 97.3% and amino acid sequence homology was between 96.8% and 97.0%, respectively. Compared with vaccine strain, there were seven common variations in all the four newly isolated strains.

Four JE virus strains were isolated in Heilongjiang province. As compared to the vaccine strain, six variations were found in the newly isolated strains at the eight sites relevant to the virulence of the virus.
