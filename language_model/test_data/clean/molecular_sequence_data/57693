The biochemistry, the molecular biology and the biological activity of the eosinophil granule proteins, major basic protein (MBP), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) are reviewed. MBP is present in the core of the eosinophil granule and is toxic to parasite and host cells. ECP and EDN are proteins in the matrix of the granule and share sequence similarity and ribonuclease activity. These two proteins can provoke the Gordon phenomenon in rabbits and are toxic to parasites. EPO consists of two polypeptide and is a toxin for parasite and host cells with or without H2O2. The common characteristics of these proteins are their high isoelectric points and cytotoxic activities.
