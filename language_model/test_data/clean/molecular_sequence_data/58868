Monitoring of loss of heterozygosity in human tumors has suggested that the 22q12 region may contain another tumor suppressor gene(s) in addition to the NF2 gene. The genomic sequencing of a 40-kb region bounded by the EWS and BAM22 genes and containing a CpG-rich region has identified two new genes in the q12 region of chromosome 22. One of them, GAR22, is closely related to mouse Gas2, a gene isolated as being negatively regulated by serum and growth factors and exhibiting a high expression in growth arrested mouse fibroblasts. The other, RRP22, belongs to the Ras superfamily, in which it defines a new subgroup. Its expression appears to be strictly limited to the central nervous system. Growth-arrest-specific and Ras-related genes are likely candidates to be involved in tumorigenic processes. Although no mutation was observed in a small set of meningiomas and schwannomas, alteration of these new genes should now be searched in other tumors with frequent allelic losses on chromosome 22 not associated with NF2 mutation.
