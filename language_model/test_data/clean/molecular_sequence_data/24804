Cloning and sequencing of a 7.1 kb DNA fragment from Agrobacterium sp IP I-671 revealed seven open reading frames (ORFs) encoding D-hydantoinase, D-carbamoylase and putative hydantoin racemase, D-amino acid oxidase and NAD(P)H-flavin oxidoreductase. Two incomplete ORFs flanking the hydantoin utilization genes showed similarities to genes involved in transposition. Expression of the D-hydantoinase and D-carbamoylase gene in Escherichia coli gave mainly inactive protein concentrated in inclusion bodies, whereas homologous expression on an RSF1010 derivative increased hydantoinase and D-carbamoylase activity 2.5-fold and 10-fold, respectively, in this strain. Inactivation of the D-carbamoylase gene in Agrobacterium sp IP I-671 led to a complete loss of detectable carbamoylase activity whereas the low hydantoinase activity remaining after inactivation of the D-hydantoinase gene indicated the presence of a second hydantoinase-encoding gene. Two plasmids of 80 kb and 190 kb in size were identified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and the cloned hydantoin utilization genes were found to be localized on the 190 kb plasmid.
