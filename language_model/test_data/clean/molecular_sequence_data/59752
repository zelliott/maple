A complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) clone encoding an alpha thyroid hormone receptor (TR alpha) from muscovy duckling liver was isolated and sequenced. Comparison with the chicken TR alpha sequence showed a high degree of homology. Despite 45 nucleotide substitutions, the deduced peptide sequence was similar. This cDNA was used as a probe to characterize the TR alpha mRNA transcripts expressed in muscovy duckling liver and skeletal muscle.
