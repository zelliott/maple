The availability of potent and stable bradykinin antagonists has had a tremendous impact on kinin research. This article reviews the current status of research on kinin antagonists, describes their chemical properties, and delineates recent advances that have occurred with the advent of the second generation of kinin antagonists. The data collected with these antagonists support the assumption that kinins are implicated in inflammation and tissue injury as endogenous agents. Their importance, however, is not limited to the role as mediators of tissue injury and inflammation, as kinin antagonists have enabled the identification kinins as potential endogenous cardioprotective substances, also contributing to the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Clinical studies are currently being performed in asthma, postoperative pain, anaphlyactoid reactions during low density lipoprotein apheresis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and suspected sepsis, head injury, and hantavirus infections to investigate the utility of kinin antagonists as therapeutic agents.
