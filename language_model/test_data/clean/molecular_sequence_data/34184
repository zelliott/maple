Shewanella xiamenensis, a newly established species originally from sea sediments, was repeatedly recovered from peripancreatic drainages in a patient and was the probable pathogen of hospital-acquired peripancreatic infection. A commercially available system misidentified it as Shewanella putrefaciens, suggesting that some previous reported cases with S. putrefaciens infection might have been caused by other Shewanella species. Precise species identification of Shewanella species usually requires gyrB sequencing.
