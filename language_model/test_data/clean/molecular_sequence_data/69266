Nine KOX zinc finger genes were localized on four human chromosomes by in situ hybridization of cDNA probes to metaphase chromosomes. KOX1 (ZNF10), KOX11 (ZNF18), and KOX12 (ZNF19) were mapped to chromosome bands 12q24.33, 17p13-p12, and 16q22-q23, respectively. Six other KOX genes were localized on chromosome 19: KOX6 (ZNF14) and KOX13 (ZNF20) to 19p13.3-p13.2, KOX5 (ZNF13) and KOX22 (ZNF27) to 19q13.2-qter, and KOX24 (ZNF28) and KOX28 (ZNF30) to 19q13.4. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis experiments showed that the pairs of KOX genes found on the chromosome bands 12q24.33, 16q22-q23, 19p13.3-p13.2, or 19q13.3-qter lie within 200-300 kb DNA fragments. This suggests the existence of KOX gene clusters on these chromosomal bands.
