A barley salt-soluble protein of 14.5 kDa, which inhibits the alpha-amylase from the insect Tenebrio molitor, has been identified as a major IgE-binding component of sera from baker's asthma patients. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this protein indicates that it is a member of a previously described family of alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitors.
