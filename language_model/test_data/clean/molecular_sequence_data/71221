The structure of a 36-amino-acid-long amino-terminal fragment of phospholamban (phospholamban[1-36]) in aqueous solution containing 30% trifluoroethanol was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance. The peptide, which comprises the cytoplasmic domain and six residues of the transmembrane domain of phospholamban, assumes a conformation characterized by two alpha-helices connected by a turn. The residues of the turn are Ile18, Glu19, Met20, and Pro21, which are adjacent to the two phosphorylation sites Ser16 and Thr17. The proline is in a trans conformation. The helix comprising amino acids 22-36 is well determined (the root mean square deviation for the backbone atoms, calculated for a family of 18 nuclear magnetic resonance structures is 0.57 A). Recently, two molecular models of the transmembrane domain of phospholamban were proposed in which a symmetric homopentamer is composed of a left-handed coiled coil of alpha-helices. The two models differ by the relative orientation of the helices. The model proposed by,Simmerman et al. (H.K. Simmerman, Y.M. Kobayashi, J.M. Autry, and L.R. Jones, 1996, J. Biol. Chem. 271:5941-5946), in which the coiled coil is stabilized by a leucine-isoleucine zipper, is similar to the transmembrane pentamer structure of the cartilage oligomeric membrane protein determined recently by x-ray (V. Malashkevich, R. Kammerer, V Efimov, T. Schulthess, and J. Engel, 1996, Science 274:761-765). In the model proposed by Adams et al. (P.D. Adams, I.T. Arkin, D.M. Engelman, and A.T. Brunger, 1995, Nature Struct. Biol. 2:154-162), the helices in the coiled coil have a different relative orientation, i.e., are rotated clockwise by approximately 50 degrees. It was possible to overlap and connect the structure of phospholamban[1-36] derived in the present study to the two transmembrane pentamer models proposed. In this way two models of the whole phospholamban in its pentameric form were generated. When our structure was connected to the leucine-isoleucine zipper model, the inner side of the cytoplasmic domain of the pentamer (where the helices face one another) was lined by polar residues (Gln23, Gln26, and Asn30), whereas the five Arg25 side chains were on the outer side. On the contrary, when our structure was connected to the other transmembrane model, in the inner side of the cytoplasmic domain of the pentamer, the five Arg25 residues formed a highly charged cluster.
