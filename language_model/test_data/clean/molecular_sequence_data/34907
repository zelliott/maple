The putative metal-dependent hydrolase gene TTE1006 from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis strain MB4T (T = type strain; Genbank accession No. AE008691) was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The 205-amino-acid gene product was purified and crystallized. The crystal used for data collection belongs to space group P2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 85.2, b = 62.1, c = 172.4 A, beta = 104.2 degrees. Using a synchrotron-radiation source, the resolution limit of the data reached 1.87 A. Eight molecules were estimated to be present in the asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of 48%. Structure determination is ongoing using the multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method and also the molecular-replacement (MR) method.
