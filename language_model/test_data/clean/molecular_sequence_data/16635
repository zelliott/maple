The squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 (SCCA1) and SCCA2 are unique serpins that can inhibit cysteine proteinases. SQN-5, their mouse ortholog, has already been identified, and its inhibitory property has been characterized; however, its biological role has remained undefined. Furthermore, no other mouse homolog of SQN-5 has been known. We characterize three mouse members of SCCA-related molecules including SQN-5 in this article. Serpinb3a (SQN-5) and Serpinb3b, but not Serpinb3c, were functional, inhibiting both serine and cysteine proteinases with different inhibitory profiles due to the difference of two amino acids in their reactive site loops. Serpinb3a was ubiquitously expressed in most tissues, whereas expression of Serpinb3b was limited to keratinocytes. Keratinocytes secreted both SCCA-related proteins, Serpinb3a and Serpinb3b. These results indicate that Serpinb3a and Serpinb3b may play different roles by inhibiting intrinsic or extrinsic proteinases with different expression distributions and different inhibitory profiles.
