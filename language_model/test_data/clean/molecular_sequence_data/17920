The ether-soluble resin glycoside ('jalapin') fraction obtained from scammony roots, on alkaline hydrolysis, gave a glycosidic acid, scammonic acid A, together with isobutyric, 2S-methylbutyric and tiglic acids. In addition, two kinds of resin glycosides, named scammonin I and II, were isolated and characterized, respectively, as (11S)-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid, 11-[( O-6-deoxy-4-O-(2(E)-methyl-1-oxo-2- butenyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1----4)-O-6-deoxy-2-O-(2-methyl-1-oxobut yl)- alpha-L-mannopyranosyl-(1----2)-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1----2)-6-deoxy -beta- D-glucopyranosyl]oxy)-, intramol. 1,3"'-ester and (11S)-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid, 11-[( O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1----4)-O-6-deoxy-2-O-(2-methyl-1-oxobutyl)- alpha-L-mannopyranosyl-(1----2)-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1----2)-6-deoxy -beta-D - glucopyranosyl]oxy)-, intramol. 1,3"'-ester.
