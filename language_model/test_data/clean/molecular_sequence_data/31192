The fructose bisphosphate aldolase genes of Trypanosoma brucei are interspersed with unrelated genes whose transcript levels show no developmental modulation. Transcription appears approximately constant across the entire locus, suggesting that aldolase mRNA abundance is regulated post-transcriptionally.
