A pure culture of an obligately anaerobic marine bacterium was obtained from an anaerobic enrichment culture in which taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonate) was the sole source of carbon, energy, and nitrogen. Taurine fermentation resulted in acetate, ammonia, and sulfide as end products. Other sulfonates, including 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate (isethionate) and cysteate (alanine-3-sulfonate), were not fermented. When malate was the sole source of carbon and energy, the bacterium reduced sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, or nitrate (reduced to ammonia) but did not use fumarate or dimethyl sulfoxide as a terminal electron acceptor for growth. Taurine-grown cells had significantly lower adenylylphosphosulfate reductase activities than sulfate-grown cells had, which was consistent with the notion that sulfate was not released as a result of oxidative C-S bond cleavage and then assimilated. The name Desulforhopalus singaporensis is proposed for this sulfate-reducing bacterium, which is morphologically unusual compared to the previously described sulfate-reducing bacteria by virtue of the spinae present on the rod-shaped, gram-negative, nonmotile cells; endospore formation was not discerned, nor was desulfoviridin detected. Granules of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate were abundant in taurine-grown cells. This organism shares with the other member of the genus Desulforhopalus which has been described a unique 13-base deletion in the 16S ribosomal DNA. It differs in several ways from a recently described endospore-forming anaerobe (K. Denger, H. Laue, and A. M. Cook, Arch. Microbiol. 168:297-301, 1997) that reportedly produces thiosulfate but not sulfide from taurine fermentation. D. singaporensis thus appears to be the first example of an organism which exhibits sulfidogenesis during taurine fermentation. Implications for sulfonate sulfur in the sulfur cycle are discussed.
