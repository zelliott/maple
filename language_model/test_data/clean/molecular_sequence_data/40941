Four different bacterial strains were isolated from pulp and paper mill sludge in which one alkalotolerant isolate (LP1) having higher capability to remove color and lignin, was identified as Bacillus sp. by 16S RNA sequencing. Optimization of process parameters for decolorization was initially performed to select growth factors which were further substantiated by Taguchi approach in which seven factors, % carbon, % black liquor, duration, pH, temperature, stirring and inoculum size, at two levels, applying L-8 orthogonal array were taken. Maximum color was removed at pH 8, temperature 35°C, stirring 200 rpm, sucrose (2.5%), 48 h, 5% (w/v) inoculum size and 10% black liquor. After optimization 2-fold increase in color and lignin removal from 25-69% and 28-53%, respectively, indicated significance of Taguchi approach in decolorization and delignification of lignin in pulp and paper mill effluent. Enzymes involved in the process of decolorization of effluent were found to be xylanase (54 U/ml) and manganese peroxidase (28 U/ml). Treated effluent was also evaluated for toxicity by Comet assay using Saccharomyces cerevisiae MTCC 36 as model organism, which indicated 58% reduction after treatment by bacterium.
