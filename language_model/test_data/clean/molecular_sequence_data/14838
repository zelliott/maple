Chemokines are small cytokines that, based on their structural differences, are classified into four groups, one of which is called CXC chemokines. In this study, we identified a CXC chemokine, CsCXCe1, from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) and analyzed its function. The deduced amino acid sequence of CsCXCe1 contains 115 residues and is phylogenetically distinct from known CXC chemokines. CsCXCe1 possesses the conserved RCXC motif in the form of RCWC but lacks the ELR sequence that is found in some CXC chemokines. Expression of CsCXCe1 as determined by quantitative real time RT-PCR occurred abundantly in immune organs and was upregulated by bacterial and viral infection in time dependent manners. Purified recombinant CsCXCe1 (rCsCXCe1) exhibited comparable chemotactic activities against tongue sole and turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL). Microscopic analysis identified lymphocytes as the major cellular population in PBL that responds to rCsCXCe1. Mutational study showed that when the two cysteine residues in the RCWC motif of CsCXCe1 were substituted by serine, the chemoattractive activity of CsCXCe1 was completely lost. Further study showed that treatment of PBL with rCsCXCe1 (i) stimulated cellular proliferation and respiratory burst activity, (ii) upregulated the expression of a wide spectrum of immune relevant genes, and (iii) enhanced cellular resistance against bacterial infection. Taken together, these results indicate that CsCXCe1 is likely a new type of CXC chemokine that exerts chemotactic and immunostimulatory effects on PBL.
