We investigated the expression of the drug resistance-related genes, multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1), multidrug resistance associated protein gene (MRP), and the DNA topoisomerase IIalpha, DNA topoisomerase IIbeta, and glutathione-S-transferase pi gene (GST-pi) in three human hepatoma cell lines (HepG 2, HuH 7, SK-Hep-1) with or without drug treatment with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and cisplatin (CDDP), by a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method and a competitive PCR method. The signals of the MDR1, MRP, topoisomerase IIalpha, and topoisomerase IIbeta genes in HepG2 were weakened when IFN-alpha was added to CDDP. In SK-Hep-1, the administration of CDDP alone increased the signals of MDR1 while the addition of IFN-alpha decreased the signals, and the signals of GST-pi were decreased by IFN-alpha plus CDDP. In summary, our results concerning the expression of drug resistance-related genes in three human hepatoma cell lines demonstrate that IFN-alpha may modulate the mechanism of resistance to CDDP in liver cancer.
