When D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase/D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase bifunctional protein was purified from human liver, two preparations were obtained. One contained a 77-kDa polypeptides as the main and minor smaller polypeptides including a 46-kDa polypeptide, and this preparation showed both the dehydratase and dehydrogenase activities. The other preparation was a homodimer of the 46-kDa polypeptide and showed only the dehydratase activity. Further analysis indicated that the native enzyme is a homodimer of 77-kDa polypeptide, which was proteolytically modified during purification. The cDNA for the human 77-kDa polypeptide was cloned. The amino acid sequences of the peptides derived from the components of the enzyme preparations were located in the deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA. The preparation containing the 77-kDa polypeptide was treated with a protease, and two monofunctional fragments were separated. The dehydrogenase and dehydratase fragments were located on the amino- and carboxyl-terminal sides, respectively, of the deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA. The protein expressed by the cDNA with the entire coding region exhibited both the dehydratase and dehydrogenase activities, and that expressed by a truncated version covering the carboxyl-terminal side exhibited only the dehydratase activity. The cloned cDNA was identical to the human 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase IV cDNA.
