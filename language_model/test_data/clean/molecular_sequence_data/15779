Ankylosing spondylitis and Reiter's syndrome are the two major spondyloarthropathies highly associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B27. Although the development of spondylitis is unclear, it has been hypothesized that HLA-B27 may predispose to spondyloarthropathies via the phenomenon of molecular mimicry. A computer search for homologies between HLA-B27 and microbes revealed a sequence of six consecutive amino acids (glutamine-threonine-aspartic acid-arginine-glutamic acid-aspartic acid) shared by HLA-B27.1 (residues 72 to 77), and Klebsiella pneumoniae nitrogenase (residues 188 to 193). Antibodies raised against a peptide derived from HLA-B27 containing this six-amino-acid sequence cross-reacted with the peptide derived from Klebsiella that contained these six amino acids, and vice-versa. These antibodies also reacted with articular tissues from HLA-B27-positive patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Sera from 53 percent of Reiter's patients and 27 percent of patients with ankylosing spondylitis showed binding to these same peptides. These results suggest that molecular mimicry may have a role in disease development.
