Four major proteins are induced in Staphylococcus aureus in response to hyperosmotic shock caused by the presence of two different osmolytes, sucrose and NaCl. The gene encoding one of these proteins was isolated using a novel PCR procedure. The derived protein sequence shows extensive similarity to a subunit of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC) from both Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Exposure of S. aureus to varying concentrations of H202 did not result in the detectable induction of AhpC.
