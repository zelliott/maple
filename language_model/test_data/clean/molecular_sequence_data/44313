The genome of the Balaton 1 severe cherry isolate of apple chlorotic leaf spot trichovirus (ACLSV-Bal1) has been cloned and sequenced. The genomic RNA is 7549 nucleotide long, excluding the poly A tail. The genomic organization, with three overlapping open reading frames (ORF), is similar to that of the other sequenced ACLSV isolates. Sequence comparisons indicate a high variability between ACLSV isolates, with overall nucleotide sequence homology levels between 76 and 82%. The coat protein, encoded internally inside a larger ORF, is the most conserved protein (identity levels between 87 and 93%) while the central ORF, encoding the putative movement protein, is the most divergent (77 to 85% identity).
