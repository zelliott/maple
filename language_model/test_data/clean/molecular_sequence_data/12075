The isolation and detailed characterization of a three-beta-globin gene (GloB) haplotype in the Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rat is described. An enriched library, lambda SDHelib, was screened with a human GloB probe, humbg44, and from which a beta minor gene, Rathbbz, was isolated, sequenced and characterized. A S-D rat GloB-specific probe, Ratbgze12, derived from the Rathbbz gene, was then used to screen a S-D rat genomic library, lambda SDglib. The clone T1510 was isolated and identified to include the entire Rathbbz gene and part of another GloB gene, Rathbby, which was 5' upstream from Rathbbz. Chromosomal walking upstream using the riboprobe, rnaT71, led to the isolation of an overlapping clone, Ta49, which was shown to include two full-length GloB genes; the most 5' was Rathbbx followed by Rathbby. Sequence data suggests that Rathbbx is a beta major gene, whereas Rathbby is a hybrid gene of Rathbbx and Rathbbz. Genomic hybridization confirmed this particular three-gene haplotype in the S-D rat. This haplotype, a1, may be the prototype of the GloB cluster in rat.
