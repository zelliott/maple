Recent studies have shown that the Porifera, with the examples of the demosponges Suberites domuncula and Geodia cydonium, comprise a series of pathways found also in the immune system of Deuterostomia, such as vertebrates, but are absent in Protostomia, with insects or nematodes as examples. One pathway is the (2'-5')oligoadenylate synthetase [(2-5)A synthetase] system. In the present study we show that crude extracts from tissue of S. domuncula collected from the sea display a considerable amount of (2-5)A synthetase activity; 16% of the ATP substrate is converted to the (2-5)A product, while tissue from specimens which were kept for 6 months in an aquarium shows only 1% of conversion. As aquarium animals show a lower bacterial load, those specimens were treated for the experiments with the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS); they responded to LPS with a stimulation of the (2-5)A synthetase activity. To monitor if this effect can be obtained also on the in vitro level, primmorphs which comprise proliferating and differentiating cells, were incubated with LPS. Extracts obtained from LPS-treated primmorphs also convert ATP to the (2-5)A products mediated by the synthetase. In parallel to this effect on protein level, LPS causes after an incubation period of 12 h also an increase in the steady-state level of the transcripts encoding the putative (2-5)A synthetase. It is postulated that in sponges the (2-5)A synthetase is involved in antimicrobial defense of the animals.
