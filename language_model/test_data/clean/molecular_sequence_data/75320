The partial amino acid sequence of the light-chain (Lc) component of Clostridium botulinum type C1 toxin was determined. The sequence was quite similar to those of the other types of botulinum and tetanus toxins. Nine monoclonal antibodies against botulinum type E toxin were established by immunizing BALB/c mice with type E toxoid or its Lc component. Six antibodies reacted with the heavy-chain component and three reacted with the Lc component of the toxin. One of the latter three antibodies reacted with botulinum type B, C1, and D toxins and tetanus toxin, as well as botulinum type E toxin. This antibody recognized the Lc components of these toxins, indicating that there exists one common antigenic determinant on the Lc regions of these toxins.
