NK cells and some T cells express members of a multigenic family of killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs) including p70 KIR (KIR3DL) and p58 KIR (KIR2DL) family that recognize polymorphic class I MHC molecules on target cells and transmit an inhibitory signal to prevent killer cell-mediated cytoxicity. The cDNA sequences of p70 KIR family members reported so far suggest that the p70 KIR gene consists of a multigene complex and that each gene may exhibit certain degrees of polymorphism. However, it is not clear how diverse the repertoire of the p70 KIR family is, particularly in a single individual. To address this question in more detail and to determine some indication as to the origin of the diversity, we cloned p70 KIR cDNAs from a single individual. We identified nine new KIRs that are different from the previously reported ones. A comparison of the amino acid sequences with published sequences of p70 KIRs showed that two clones belonged to the KIR3DL1 family, five clones belonged to the KIR3DL2 family, one clone belonged to the KIR2DL4 family, and one clone appeared to be an alternatively spliced form of p70 KIR. These results suggested that the repertoire of p70 KIR family members in a single individual is highly diverse. It is not clear how the diverse receptors are generated in a single individual, but a comparison of amino acid sequences of p70 KIR family members suggested that some of them may be encoded by distinct genes or their alleles, while others may be generated by a recombination mechanism and/or an alternative splicing mechanism at the maturation of the mRNA transcripts.
