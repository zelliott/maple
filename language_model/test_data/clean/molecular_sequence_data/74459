The prevalence and potential zoonotic transmission of group C rotavirus (RVC) were examined by testing fecal samples collected from children during a longitudinal study that was carried out in the outskirts of Belém, Brazil, from December 1982 to March 1986. The study involved a group of 30 children who were followed from birth to 3 years. Of the 77 samples tested from 29 children, 5 (6.5%) were positive for human and 3 (4%) for porcine RVC by using nested PCR assay with primers specific for VP6 gene of human or porcine RVC and by Southern hybridization using a probe specific for VP6 gene of both human and porcine RVC. In addition, a total of 59 fecal specimens from the 30th child were tested, 1 (1.7%) and 14 (23.7%) were positive for human and porcine RVC, respectively. Partial nucleotide sequences of VP6 gene demonstrated that the six human strains detected in Brazil were homologous with other human RVC, and 14 of the 17 porcine RVC strains examined showed a complete homology among themselves but differed slightly from the porcine Cowden strain, suggesting that a single porcine RVC strain was circulating in Belém. This study is the first to provide evidence for transmission of RVC from swine to human. They also indicate that both human and porcine RVC were endemic in Belém.
