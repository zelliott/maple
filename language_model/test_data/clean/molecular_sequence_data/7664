We examined three tissue samples from each of four cows with non-lesional skin, tissue samples from a cow with multiple cutaneous mast cell tumors, and samples from another cow in which mast cells were infiltrating multiple lymphosarcomas of the skin, for the presence of tryptase and chymase by enzyme cytochemical and immunohistological methods. The enzyme activities of tryptase and chymase were tested using N-carbobenzoxy-glycilglycil-L-arginine-2-naphthylamide (Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-NA) and naphthol-AS-D-chloroacetate (N-AS-D-CA) as substrates, respectively. Tryptase reactivity could be demonstrated in frozen and Carnoy-fixed paraffin sections. Chymase reactivity was seen in neither frozen nor paraffin sections of formalin- or Carnoy-fixed skin tissues. Antibody linkage with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human skin tryptase antibody was highly specific in bovine normal cutaneous, infiltrating, and tumor mast cells. More than 90% of the tumor mast cells were distinctly tryptase-positive. With alcian blue, only slightly more than 10% of the mast cells stained clearly positive and with methylene blue hardly any staining of mast cell granules could be demonstrated. No antibody labeling of mast cell granules in any of the tissue sections was detected by the use of rabbit anti-dog chymase antiserum. These results indicate that there is a striking antigenic similarity of bovine tryptase to its canine and human equivalents. The demonstration of tryptase is an important tool in confirming the diagnosis of undifferentiated mast cell tumors. In contrast to other species, chymase appears to be completely absent in bovine skin mast cells.
