Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is an autosomal recessive condition caused by a deficiency of aldolase B. We have recently shown that three point mutations in this gene account for approximately 85% of HFI alleles in Europe and the United States and are thus of diagnostic importance. In this paper we define three new lesions in the aldolase B gene: two are large deletions, one of 1.65 kb and one of 1.4 kb; the third is a small deletion of 4 bp. We have determined the breakpoints of these deletions and have demonstrated that the presence of such lesions may complicate the genotyping of individuals for diagnosis of HFI.
