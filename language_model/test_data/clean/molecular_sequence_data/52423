Functional studies indicate that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a member of the natriuretic peptide family, has direct effects on cardiac muscle cells. However, conventional ligand-binding studies designed to establish the presence of natriuretic peptide-binding sites in the heart have yielded conflicting results. There are discrepancies also between the latter and the receptor distribution predicted from the pattern of the mRNA transcripts localized by in situ hybridization. Here we have employed the technique of cDNA amplification with the polymerase chain reaction to confirm the presence of natriuretic peptide A, B, and C receptor mRNAs in rat and human cardiac tissue. In the rat heart, the distribution of the A and B receptor transcripts appears to be relatively homogeneous; in contrast, the C type mRNA is concentrated principally in the atria, with no difference between the left and right sides of the heart. A and B receptor DNA products were obtained after amplification of left, but not right, ventricular cDNA from the heart of a 16-yr-old male with cystic fibrosis; the yield of C receptor DNA was similar for both ventricles. If these mRNA transcripts are translated into functional receptors in the rat and human heart, ANP and the other natriuretic peptides may have direct effects on cardiac function, including regulation of natriuretic peptide release via a short feedback loop, modulation of contractility of the heart, or activation of cardiac reflexes.
