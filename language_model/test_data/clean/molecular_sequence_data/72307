The cDNA coding for GT3-synthase has been cloned from a rat fetal brain cDNA library. The complete nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of the rat GT3-synthase cDNA were highly homologous to those of the mouse GT3-synthase. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that, as a key enzyme for the synthesis of 'c'-series gangliosides, the expression of GT3-synthase was developmentally regulated in embryonic rat brains.
