When synthesized in polarized epithelial cells, the envelope glycoproteins hemagglutinin of influenza and G of vesicular stomatitis virus are targeted to the apical and basolateral plasma membranes, respectively. To determine which portions of these transmembrane proteins contain information necessary for their sorting, the behavior of two different G-hemagglutinin chimeric polypeptides, consisting of all or nearly all the luminal portion of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein linked to C-terminal segments of influenza hemagglutinin that included its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, was studied in MDCK cells transformed with the corresponding cDNAs. Both chimeras were transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and from there to the cell surface with the same rapid kinetics as the intact G protein. By using a cell surface immunoprecipitation assay with monolayers cultured on permeable filters that allows the recovery of labeled protein molecules present in each cell surface domain, it was found that both chimeric proteins as well as the intact G protein were delivered almost exclusively to the basolateral surface. This polarized distribution of the polypeptides did not change during a subsequent 90-min chase period, although during this time a large fraction of the glycoprotein molecules underwent degradation. In addition, a small fraction of the cell surface-associated glycoprotein molecules shed their ectoplasmic segments into the basolateral compartment, apparently as a result of a proteolytic cleavage. Immunofluorescence on transverse frozen sections and immunoelectron microscopy revealed a prominent accumulation of the chimeric polypeptides in the lateral cell membranes, with lesser amounts on the basal and apical surfaces. These results indicate that information specifying the basolateral transport of the G glycoprotein is located within the first 426 N-terminal amino acids of its ectoplasmic portion.
