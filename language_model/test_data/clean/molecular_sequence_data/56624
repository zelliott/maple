An analogue of netropsin has been synthesized consisting of two N-propylpyrrolcarboxamide units linked covalently to a copper-chelating tripeptide Gly-Gly-L-His by means of two and three glycine residues. Binding to DNA and synthetic polynucleotides of netropsin analogue containing three glycine residues between Gly-Gly-L-His tripeptide and the N-end of netropsin analogue (His-Nt) has been studied. It is shown that this netropsin analogue chelates a copper ion with 1:1 stoichiometry, similar to a free Gly-Gly-L-His peptide. It is found that this netropsin analogue occupies 3 to 4 base pairs upon binding to poly(dA).poly(dT) and poly[d(AT)].poly[d(AT)] polymers, irrespective of whether it binds in Cu(2+)-ligated or unligated forms. Binding constants and binding site sizes have been calculated for netropsin analogue complexes with DNA, poly(dA).poly(dT) and poly[d(AT)].poly[d(AT)] polymers at the [Cu2+]/[His-Nt] ratio equal to 0 and 1.0. In the three-component system including His-Nt and Cu(2+)-His-Nt, cooperative effects are recognized which can be explained by heterodimer generation on interaction of His-Nt and Cu(2+)-His-Nt at adjacent binding sites.
