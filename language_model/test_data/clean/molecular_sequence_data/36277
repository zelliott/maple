An exhaustive computer-assisted analysis of the Moloney murine leukemia virus nucleotide sequence shows numerous deviations in the oligomeric distribution, suggesting three overlapping levels of a stepwise duplicative evolution. (1) The sequence fits the universal rule of TG/CT excess which has been proposed as the construction principle of all sequences, and maintains some degree of symmetry between the two complementary strands. (2) Oligomeric repeating units share a core consensus regularly scattered throughout the sequence. This consensus is not merely predictable from the doublet frequencies and codon usage, but could correspond to an intermediary stage in a so-called periodic-to-chaotic transition. (3) Probable stepwise local duplications could be accounted for by slippagelike mechanisms. Comparison with the human spumaretrovirus (HSRV) shows similar segments in the overrepresented oligomers of the two sequences. The intermediary stage of transition oligomeric repeating units is not so clearly suggested in HSRV, perhaps because of numerous stepwise local duplications. In any case, a common evolutionary origin for the two viruses is not ruled out.
