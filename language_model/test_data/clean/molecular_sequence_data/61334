The 5-methyl group of thymidine residues protrudes into the major groove of double helical DNA. The structural influence of this exocyclic substituent has been examined using a PCR-made 160 bp fragment in which thymidine residues were replaced with uridine residues. We show that the dT-->dU substitution and the consequent deletion of the methyl group affects the cleavage of DNA by deoxyribonuclease I and micrococcal nuclease. Analysis of the DNase I cleavage sites, in terms of di and trinucleotides, indicates that homopolymeric tracts of d(AT) become significantly more susceptible to DNase I cleavage when uridine is substituted for thymidine residues. The results indicate that removal of the thymidine methyl groups from the major groove at AT tracts induces structural perturbations that transmit into the opposite minor groove, where they can be detected by endonuclease probing. In contrast, DNase I footprinting experiments with different mono and bis-intercalating drugs reveal that dT-->dU substitution does not markedly affect sequence-specific drug-DNA recognition in the minor or major groove of the double helix. The consequences of demethylation of thymidine residues are discussed in terms of changes in the minor groove width connected to variations in the flexibility of DNA and the intrinsic curvature associated with AT tracts. The study identifies the methyl group of thymine as an important molecular determinant controlling the width of the minor groove and/or the flexibility of the DNA.
