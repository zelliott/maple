The production of neutralizing antibodies against the central portion of HIV-1 gp120 requires cooperation between T cell and B cell epitopes of this region. We found a motif common to the carboxyterminus of the second conserved region of HIV-1 gp120 and sequences of some human proteins, most of which participate in immune response. The sequence of gp120 of HTLV-IIIB with the highest T-cell reactivity incorporates this motif. It is suggested that the existence of this sequence motif in the central region of the HIV-1 gp120 molecule prevents the production of neutralizing antibodies against the virus in humans.
