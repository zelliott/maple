The mechanism of inheritance of the Golgi complex is an important problem in cell biology. In this study, we examine the localization and function of a Golgi protein encoded by centrosomin's beautiful sister (cbs) during cleavage in Drosophila melanogaster. Cbs contains a GRIP domain that is 57% identical to vertebrate Golgin-97. Cbs undergoes a dramatic relocalization during mitosis from the cytoplasm to an association with chromosomes from late prometaphase to early telophase, by a transport mechanism that requires the GRIP domain and Arl1, the product of the Arf72A locus. Additionally, Cbs remains independent of the endoplasmic reticulum throughout cleavage. The use of RNAi, Arf72A mutant analysis and ectopic expression of the GRIP domain, shows that cycling of Cbs during mitosis is required for the centrosome cycle. The effects on the centrosome cycle depend on Cbs concentration and Cbs transport from the cytoplasm to DNA. When Cbs levels are reduced centrosomes fail to mature, and when Cbs transport is impeded by ectopic expression of the GRIP domain, centrosomes undergo hypertrophy. We propose that, Cbs is a trans-Golgi protein that links Golgi inheritance to the cell cycle and the Drosophila Golgi is more vertebrate-like than previously recognized.
