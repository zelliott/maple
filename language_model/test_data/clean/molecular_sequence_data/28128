In our previous study (K. Taniguchi, Y. Morita, T. Urasawa, and S. Urasawa, J. Virol. 62:2421-2426, 1987) in which the cross-reactive neutralization epitopes on VP4 of human rotaviruses were analyzed, one strain, K8, was found to bear unique VP4 neutralization epitopes. This strain, which belongs to subgroup II and serotype 1, was not neutralized by any of six anti-VP4 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies which reacted with human rotavirus strains of serotypes 1, 3, and 4 or serotypes 1 through 4. We determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding VP4 of strain K8 by primer extension. The VP4 gene is 2,359 base pairs in length, with 5' and 3' noncoding regions of 9 and 25 nucleotides, respectively. The gene contains a long open reading frame of 2,325 bases capable of coding for a protein of 775 amino acids. When compared with those of other human rotaviruses, VP4 of strain K8 had an insertion of one amino acid after residue 135, as found in simian rotavirus strains, and in addition, it had a deletion of one amino acid (residue 575). The amino acid homology of VP4 of strain K8 and those of other virulent human rotaviruses was only 60 to 70%. This was unusual, since over 90% VP4 homology has been found among the other virulent human rotavirus strains. In contrast, the VP7 amino acid sequence of the K8 strain was quite similar (over 98% homology) to those of other serotype 1 human rotaviruses. Thus, the K8 strain appears to have a unique VP4 gene previously not described.
