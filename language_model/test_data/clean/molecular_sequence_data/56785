The conditioned medium from gamma-interferon-stimulated macrophages elevated the choline acetyltransferase activity in mouse septal neurons as well as in cholinergic hybrid cell lines SN6.10.2.2 in vitro. After purification and sequencing, the active fraction was identical to thioredoxin (TRX), and the neurotrophic activity of recombinant TRX was confirmed.
