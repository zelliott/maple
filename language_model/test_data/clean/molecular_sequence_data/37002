The gene encoding mouse peripherin, a neuronal intermediate filament protein, has been cloned. Its sequence, through 1021 nucleotides composing the 5'-flanking region, nine exons, eight introns and 547 nucleotides of the 3'-flanking region, as well as its transcription initiation site have been determined. The amino acid coding sequence differs from that of the rat peripherin gene. The mouse gene has an additional histidine near the N-terminal end, and shows three conservative and two non-conservative changes. The promoter sequence, containing the binding sites for transcription factors as well as other sequences is homologous to promoter regions of other type III intermediate filament protein genes and other neuronal-specific genes.
