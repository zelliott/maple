The ATP-sensitive, inwardly rectifying K+ channel, ROMK, has been suggested to be the low-conductance ATP-sensitive K+ channel identified in apical membranes of mammalian renal thick ascending limb (TAL) and cortical collecting duct (CCD). Mutations in the human ROMK gene (KIR 1.2) have been identified in kindreds with neonatal Bartter's syndrome. In the present study, we generated polyclonal antibodies raised against both a COOH-terminal (amino acids 252-391) ROMK-maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion protein and an NH2-terminal (amino acids 34-49) ROMK peptide. Affinity-purified anti-ROMK COOH-terminal antibody detected the 45-kDa ROMK protein in kidney tissues and HEK-293 cells transfected with ROMK1 cDNA. The antibody also recognized 85- to 90-kDa proteins in kidney tissue; these higher molecular weight proteins were abolished by immunoabsorption with ROMK-MBP fusion protein and were also detected on Western blots using anti-ROMK NH2-terminal antibody. Immunofluoresence studies using anti-ROMK COOH-terminal antibody showed intense apical staining along the loop of Henle and distal nephron; staining with preimmune and immunoabsorbed serum was negative. When colocalized with distal nephron markers [the thiazide-sensitive cotransporter (rTSC1), the bumetanide-sensitive cotransporter (rBSC1), the vacuolar type H(+)-ATPase, and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS I)], the ROMK protein was found primarily at the apical border of cells in the TAL, macula densa, distal convoluted tubule, and connecting tubule. Within the CCD, the ROMK protein was expressed in principal cells and was absent from intercalated cells. The tubule localization and polarity of ROMK staining are consistent with the distribution of ROMK mRNA and provide more support for ROMK being the low-conductance K+ secretory channel in the rat distal nephron.
