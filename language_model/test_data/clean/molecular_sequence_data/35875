The identity of ectosymbiotic bacteria of some marine, free-living anaerobic ciliates (Metopus contortus, Caenomorpha levanderi and Parablepharisma sp.) was studied using fluorescent-dye-conjugated oligonucleotides complementary to short sequence elements of 16S ribosomal RNA. The ectosymbiotic bacteria of all species hybridized with a eubacterial probe and those of the two former mentioned species hybridized with a general probe for sulphate-reducing bacteria, but not to a probe specific for Desulfobacter. The results support indirect evidence suggesting that ectosymbiotic bacteria of anaerobic ciliates are sulphate-reducers which depend on host metabolites for substrates.
