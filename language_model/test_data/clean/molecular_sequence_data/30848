A gene encoding a carrier protein for glutamate and aspartate was cloned into Escherichia coli K-12 strain BK9MDG by using the high-copy-number plasmid pBR322. The gene (designated gltP) is probably identical to a gene recently cloned from E. coli B (Y. Deguchi, I. Yamato, and Y. Anraku, J. Bacteriol. 171:1314-1319). A 1.6-kilobase DNA fragment containing gltP was subcloned into the expression plasmids pT7-5 and pT7-6, and its product was identified by a phage T7 RNA polymerase-T7 promoter coupled system (S. Tabor and C. C. Richardson, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:1074-1078) as a polypeptide with an apparent mass of 38 kilodaltons. A portion of the gltP polypeptide was associated with the cytoplasmic membrane. The nucleotide sequence of the 1.6-kilobase fragment was determined. It contained an open reading frame capable of encoding a highly hydrophobic polypeptide of 395 amino acids, containing four possible transmembrane segments. Uptake of glutamate and aspartate was increased 5.5- and 4.5-fold, respectively, in strains containing gltP plasmids. Glutamate uptake was insensitive to the concentration of Na+ and was inhibited by L-cysteate and beta-hydroxyaspartate. These results suggest that gltP is a structural gene for a carrier protein of the Na(+)-independent, binding-protein-independent glutamate-aspartate transport system.
