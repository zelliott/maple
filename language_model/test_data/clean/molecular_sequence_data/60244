The relaxin-like factor (RLF) is a circulating hormone that binds to specific membrane-bound uterine receptors in the mouse. Mono-iodinated RLF tracers were produced and characterized specifically to study the properties of the RLF receptor. The tracers bound to the RLF receptor in uterine crude membrane preparations with high affinity (73 nM for (125)I-Tyr(A9) RLF and 90 nM for (125)I-Tyr(A26) RLF) as determined by Scatchard analysis. The specificity of binding was confirmed by chemical cross-linking experiments. Binding of (125)I-Tyr(A9) RLF to the putative receptor was inhibited in the presence of a 640-fold excess of unlabeled human RLF but not by the same excess of human relaxin. SDS-gel electrophoresis of the RLF-receptor complex revealed a molecular mass of >200 kDa, which remained unchanged upon reduction. The size and the lack of subunit structure of the receptor is similar to the features reported for the relaxin receptor. In this regard both, the RLF and the relaxin receptor are different from the insulin- and the insulin-like growth factor-type 1 receptors. This observation supports the relaxin-likeness of this new factor not only toward potential target tissues but also as regards receptor features.
