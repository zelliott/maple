A cDNA for the Arabidopsis STP4 gene (for sugar transport protein 4) was isolated, and the properties of the encoded protein were studied in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The STP4 monosaccharide H+ symporter is composed of 514 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 57.1 kD. RNA gel blot analyses revealed that STP4 is expressed primarily in roots and flowers of Arabidopsis. This was shown in more detail with STP4 promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) plants yielding strong STP4-driven GUS activity in root tips and anthers. Wounding of plants transformed with STP4-GUS constructs resulted in a rapid increase in GUS activity in cells directly adjacent to the lesion. This was confirmed by RNase protection analyses in Arabidopsis wild-type plants showing a strong, wound-induced increase in STP4 mRNA levels. STP4 expression was induced rapidly in suspension-cultured Arabidopsis cells that were treated with the Pseudomonas syringae elicitor or with chitin or in Arabidopsis plants that were exposed to fungal attacks. Our data suggest that the role of STP4 is to catalyze monosaccharide import into classic sinks, such as root tips and anthers, and, most importantly, to meet the increased carbohydrate demand of cells responding to environmental stress.
