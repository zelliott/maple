Ultraviolet radiation can induce the transcription and release of cytokines from keratinocytes (KC's). These cytokines have the potential to modulate local and systemic immunologic responses. In this paper we report that northern blotting showed that human KC and KC lines expressed a 1.2-1.4 kb transcript for the chemokine and melanoma growth-stimulatory protein, GRO-alpha and that ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) could upregulate the expression of GRO-alpha mRNA and protein in the KC line A431. The GRO-alpha gene response to UVB was maximal at 48h post-irradiation with 70 J/m2. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed a 4.5-fold increase in GRO-alpha mRNA over basal levels (p < 0.001). GRO-alpha protein was measured in the culture media by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Media from unirradiated cultures contained 1166 +/- 83 pg/ml GRO-alpha protein. After UVB, a time-dependent increase in GRO-alpha protein was seen in the culture media from 6-48h. At 48h post-irradiation the GRO-alpha protein content was 27583 +/- 678 pg/ml, or 23 times the basal level. This protein release could be inhibited by 70% when the cells were pre-incubated with 10 micrograms/ml interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). We also show that another potent leukocyte chemoattractant, Interleukin-8 (IL-8), was induced in A431 cells by UVB. This induction of IL-8 mRNA began as early as 3h post-irradiation, when it reached twice basal levels (p < 0.05) and reached 4.5-fold basal levels at 48h post-irradiation (p < 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
