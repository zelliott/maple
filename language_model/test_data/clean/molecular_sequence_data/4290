A fragment of DNA was cloned which complemented a polar flagellum-defective (pof) mutation of Vibrio alginolyticus. The fragment contained two complete and two partial open reading frames (ORFs) (ORF2 and -3 and ORF1 and -4, respectively). The presumed product of ORF2 has an amino acid sequence with a high degree of similarity to that of RpoN, which is an alternative sigma factor (sigma54) for other microorganisms. The other ORFs are also homologous to the genes adjacent to other rpoN genes. Deletion analysis suggests that ORF2 complements the pof mutation. These results demonstrate that RpoN is involved in the expression of polar flagellar genes.
