A functional DNA replication terminator of Bacillus subtilis contains two overlapping binding sites, A and B, for the replication terminator protein (RTP). A degenerate 17-mer oligonucleotide corresponding to the consensus B site has been used to detect four new terminators in the B. subtilis chromosome, in addition to the previously identified and closely spaced IRI and IRII. All the new terminators lie in the terminus region of the chromosome, on both sides of IRI and IRII, with their positions spanning < 10% of its length. Their DNA sequences are characterized by clearly identifiable A- and B-binding sites. They bind RTP in a manner indistinguishable from IRI, although precise affinities have not been compared. Each new terminator is functional in causing fork arrest when present in a plasmid replicating in B. subtilis. Three of the four were tested for polarity in fork-arrest activity and exhibited the polarity expected. The total of six terminators now identified in B. subtilis have been named TerI-TerVI. TerI and TerII correspond to the previously identified IRI and IRII, respectively. The chromosomal orientations of all but one of the terminators (TerIV) have been established and they conform to an arrangement similar to that in Escherichia coli in which two opposed groups of polar terminators provide a replication-fork trap ensuring that the approaching forks meet within a restricted region of the chromosome. The development of a strikingly similar arrangement of terminators in the two organisms, despite the lack of any detectable similarity in their respective DNA terminators and terminator proteins, emphasizes the importance of the replication-fork trap in each case.
