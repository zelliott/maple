Cuminum cyminum, an aromatic plant from the family Umbelliferae, is used as a flavoring and seasoning agent in foods. This communication reports the characterization of a nonspecific lipid transfer protein nsLTP1 from its seeds. Plant nsLTPs are small basic proteins involved in transport of lipids between membranes. These proteins are known to participate in plant defense; however, the exact mechanism of their antimicrobial action against fungi or bacteria is still unclear. The cumin nsLTP1 has been purified using a combination of chromatographic procedures and further characterized using mass spectrometry, circular dichroism spectroscopy and Edman degradation. Amino acid sequence has been used to predict homology model of cumin nsLTP1 in complex with myristic acid, and lyso-myristoyl phosphatidyl choline (LMPC). Cumin nsLTP1 is a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of 9.7 kDa as estimated by SDS-PAGE and ESIMS. The protein shows an isoelectric point of 7.8 on 6% PAGE. The primary structure consists of 92 amino acids with eight conserved cysteine residues. The global fold of cumin nsLTP1 includes four alpha-helices stabilized by four disulfide bonds and a C-terminal tail. The role of internal hydrophobic cavity of the protein in lipid transfer is discussed.
