Previous reports have demonstrated that the phospholemman (PLM), a 72-residue plasma-membrane protein enriched in skeletal muscle and heart, is a major substrate phosphorylated in response to insulin and adrenergic stimulation. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of human and rat PLM cDNA from the heart. Both PLM proteins share significant nucleotide and amino acid sequence and structural similarities with the previously published canine PLM and, to a lesser degree, with Na+/K(+)-ATPase gamma subunit, Mat-8 protein, and CHIF protein. Despite the functional diversity, all these proteins are quite small and possess a single transmembrane domain. Human PLM appears to be a unique gene localized on chromosome 19q13.1. The PLM mRNA is widely distributed in human tissues, with the highest expression in skeletal muscle and heart, suggesting a functional role in muscle contraction. Like canine PLM, both human and rat PLM induce a hyperpolarization-activated chloride current when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The high degree of sequence and functional conservation among the mammalian PLM proteins indicates that this gene is conserved throughout evolution.
