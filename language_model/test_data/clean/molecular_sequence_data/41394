To explore the locations of pseudo-phosphorylated mutant (Plk1(S330/597D);) and non-phosphorylatable mutant (Plk1(S330/597A);) of Plk1 (residues 330 and 597 serine) in HeLa cells and the effect on mitosis.

We transfected wide-type Plk1-GFP,  Plk1(S330/597D);-GFP and Plk1(S330/597A);-GFP into HeLa cells,  respectively,  and detected the locations of wide type and mutants in HeLa cells using immunofluorescence staining and the protein expressions of Plk1(S330/597D);-GFP and Plk1(S330/597A);-GFP with immunoblotting. HeLa cells transfected with Plk1 mutants were observed and analyzed in mitotic phase for cell count and cell cycle by flow cytometry.

The protein expressions of Plk1 mutants were verified. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that mutagenesis of these phosphorylation sites did not affect targeting of Plk1 to kinetochore and midbody during mitosis. However,  after transfection of Plk1(S330/597A);-GFP,  mitosis was inhibited and arrested at cytokinesis compared to control cells. Flow cytometry showed that Plk1(S330/597A);-GFP expression led to an increased G2/M arrest (P<0.01).

Non-phosphorylatable mutant of Plk1 (Plk1(S330/597A);) induces cytokinesis failure and causes the cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase.
