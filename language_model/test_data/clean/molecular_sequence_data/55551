Rickettsia honei strain RB(T) was isolated from a febrile patient on Flinders Island, Australia, in 1991 and has been demonstrated to be the agent of Flinders Island spotted fever, a disease transmitted to humans by ticks. The comparison of this 1.27-Mb genome with other Rickettsia genomes provides additional insight into the mechanisms of evolution in Rickettsia species.
