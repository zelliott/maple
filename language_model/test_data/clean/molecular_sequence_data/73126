To determine the influence of DNA repair by Ogt alkyltransferase on the distribution of alkylnitrosourea-induced mutations, we have analysed in Ogt-proficient and Ogt-deficient bacterial strains the DNA sequence changes of a total of 357 independent mutations occurring within the initial part of the lacl gene of Escherichia coli. The majority (>80%) of mutations induced by either N-ethyl-N nitrosourea (ENU) or N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) in the two genetic backgrounds were G:C --> A:T transitions, consistent with the predominant role of the O6-alkylguanine miscoding lesion in mutagenesis by alkylating agents. The analysis of the distribution of G:C --> A:T transitions induced by ENU in Ogt+ and Ogt bacteria reveals an influence of the 5'-flanking base at the level of repair by Ogt alkyltransferase. The Ogt protein appears more efficient at repairing O6-ethylguanine lesions, which are flanked 5' by a G or C, in agreement with previously reported data from our group for ethylmethane sulfonate. In contrast, no preference could be inferred for the repair of O6-methylguanine lesions by Ogt protein. These results seem to indicate that the preference of the Ogt alkyltransferase to repair certain DNA sequences might be a function of the size of the alkyl group. The importance of the alkyl group length has been described also at the level of the (A)BC excinuclease machinery that seems to have a DNA sequence specificity opposite to that of Ogt alkyltransferose.
