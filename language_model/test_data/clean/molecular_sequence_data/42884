We have previously reported an observation that the regulatory sequence of the human papillomavirus (HPV) type 18 genome elicits only basal and unregulated transcriptional activities in transgenic mice [Choo et al., Virology (1992) 188:378-383]. We have now extended the study to other transgenic mice carrying an entire or a subgenomic fragment of HPV-16 and -18. Extremely low levels of HPV transcripts were detected in various organs of the mice only by reverse transcriptase-based polymerase chain reaction. On analysis of the methylation status of the HPV transgenome sequences, hypermethylation was clearly observed, therefore suggesting a possible explanation for low level HPV transgenome transcriptional activity in HPV transgenic mice.
