Microsatellite polymorphisms of 75 unrelated Taiwanese males were analyzed for (GATA) repeats in DYS19 on chromosome Y and tetranucleotide simple repeats in D12S67 on chromosome 12. A simple nonisotopic technique based on polymerase chain reaction electrophoresis on native polyacrylamide gels followed by silver staining was used. In the 75 unrelated males, four alleles on DYS19 and five alleles on D12S67 were detected. Different allele frequencies, heterozygosity rates and information on the nature of the repeat loci were determined in these unrelated individuals. The resulting polymorphisms are of great assistance in ethnologic studies, forensic investigation and deficiency cases in paternity testing.
