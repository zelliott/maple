Dinucleotide frequency (DiF) and codon usage (cu) were analysed in gene sequences from four parasitic protozoa, Babesia bovis, Theileria parva, Toxoplasma gondii and Eimeria tenella, of the phylum Apicomplexa. In keeping with the 'genome hypothesis', cu was found to be non-random and species specific in these organisms, although cu among members of the same subclass was found to be very similar. Several low-usage (lu) codons were identified, and the usage of lu codons appears to be related to the taxonomic position of the organisms under study. A comparison of the observed/expected DiF ratios obtained from gene coding regions revealed a low frequency of the TA and CG dinucleotides in all organisms studied. A comparison of these DiF ratios with those found in rRNA-encoding genes and in introns, showed that in the parasites, B. bovis and Th. parva (representing the piroplasms), the low frequency of dinucleotides appeared to be the result of coding pressure alone. In T. gondii and E. tenella (representing the coccidia), however, coding pressure could not completely explain differences in DiF.
