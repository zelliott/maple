Cloning, sequencing and characterization of nearly full-length 23S rRNA genes in 12 urease-positive thermophilic Campylobacter (UPTC) isolates were carried out using two novel PCR primer pairs. Nucleotide sequences of the 23S rRNA genes from the 12 isolates were first shown not to carry any intervening sequences (IVSs) in both the 25 and 45 helix regions. Then, two PCR primer sets were designed in silico for amplification of the helix 25 and 45 regions within 23S rRNA gene sequences from Campylobacter lari. No IVSs were identified within the 23S rRNA genes among a total of 53 isolates of C. lari, following PCR amplification, TA cloning and sequencing procedures. Intact 23S rRNA was identified in all 65 C. lari isolates, resulting in no production of the fragmented 23S rRNA. These data suggest that C. lari may not have any opportunity to interact with any other source of IVSs until now, or has been unable to integrate IVSs into their own genomes.
