An aerobic, nocardioform actinomycete, named LM 161T, was isolated from a soil sample obtained from a gold mine in Kongiu, Republic of Korea. This organism formed well-differentiated aerial and substrate mycelia and produced branched hyphae that fragmented into short or elongated rods. The cell wall contains major amounts of LL-diaminopimelic acid, alanine, glycine, glutamic acid, mannose, glucose, galactose, ribose and acetyl muramic acid. The major phospholipids of this isolate are phosphatidylcholine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol, and the major isoprenologue is a tetrahydrogenated menaquinone with nine isoprene units. The whole-cell hydrolysate of strain LM 161T contains 12-methyltetradecanoic and 14-methylpentadecanoic acids as the predominant fatty acids, but does not contain mycolic acids. The G+C content of the DNA is 71.3 mol%. The phylogenetic position of the test strain was investigated using an almost complete 16S rDNA sequence. The isolate formed the deepest branch in the clade encompassing the members of the suborder Propionibacterineae Rainey et al. 1997. On the basis of chemical, phenotypic and genealogical data, it is proposed that this isolate be classified within a new genus as Hongia koreensis gen. nov., sp. nov. in the order Actinomycetales. The type strain is LM 161T (= IMSNU 50530T).
