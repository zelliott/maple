cDNA of mouse reticulon 3 (mRTN3) was cloned. The cloned cDNA is 1745 bp long and contains an open reading frame of 237 amino acids for a 30 kDa protein. The gene was mapped at band B of chromosome 19 by FISH. Two altematively spliced transcripts, 3.4 and 2.3 kb, of mRTN3 were found by Northem blot analysis. Both transcripts were expressed in many tissues and embryos and the highest expression of the 3.4 kb-transcript was observed in the brain, especially in neurons. The expression of 30 kDa-mRTN3 protein was also greatest in the brain. Both N and C-termini of mRTN3 faced the cytosol, indicating that they may recruit other proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum.
