The recA gene of a thermophilic eubacterial strain, Thermus thermophilus (T.th.) HB8, was cloned from a genomic DNA library by Southern hybridization using a gene-internal fragment amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method as the probe. The gene encoded a 36 kDa polypeptide whose amino acid sequence showed 61% identity with that of the Escherichia coli RecA protein. Characteristic amino acid changes between the two RecA proteins were found. In the amino acid composition of the T.th. RecA protein, the number of Pro residues was increased, the number of Cys residues was decreased, and Lys residues were replaced by Arg, Asp by Glu, Thr by Val, and Ile by Val or Leu. These changes are supposed to stabilize the native protein conformation against heat denaturation. The amino acid residues in the nucleotide binding site of the protein and in the protein-protein interaction site responsible for the oligomer formation were well conserved. The T.th. recA gene has the ability to complement the ultraviolet light (UV) sensitivity of a E. coli recA deletion mutant. Thus, the thermophilic bacterium has a RecA protein whose function will be common to the E. coli RecA protein.
