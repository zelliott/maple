We constructed six new models to analyze the DNA sequences. First, we regarded a DNA primary sequence as a random process in t and gave three ways to define nucleotides' random distribution functions. We extracted some parameters from the linear model and analyzed the changes of the nucleotides' distributions. In order to facilitate the comparison of DNA sequences, we proposed two ways to measure their similarities. Finally, we compared the six models by analyzing the similarities of the DNA primary sequences presented in Table 1 and selected the optimal one.
