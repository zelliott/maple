An element within the Preprotachykinin A (PPT) promoter is highly homologous to an element from the rat type II Na channel promoter. This Na Channel element has been previously proposed to be common to a number of neuronal genes. We demonstrate that the PPT element binds a sequence specific DNA binding protein. The protein binds to only one strand of the PPT element and has little or no specificity for the double stranded DNA species. Gel retardation analysis indicates that the protein is found in both rat neuronal tissue and adult dorsal root ganglia neurons in culture but not in established tissue culture cell lines. Using the PPT element linked to magnetic beads we have been able to demonstrate the enrichment of a protein with a molecular weight of 40k with that of the binding activity. A mechanism for protein binding to the DNA is proposed based on the fact that the region binding the protein is the loop of a larger stem-loop structure in the DNA.
