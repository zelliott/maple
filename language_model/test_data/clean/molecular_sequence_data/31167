Genomic and cDNA actin clones were isolated from Taenia solium gene libraries. The actin genes are interrupted by intervening sequences. Protein coding regions of both genes predict the same amino acid sequence. cDNA sequence data indicate that at least one gene is expressed at the larval stage. Results from Northern and Western blots showed that T. solium expresses an actin transcript of about 1,400 bases and a protein of 45,000 Da.
