We have isolated bovine lens intrinsic membrane proteins (MP) having molecular masses of 19, 21 and 23 kDa. Limited amino acid sequence analysis of the amino-terminal portion of each of these polypeptides revealed a 100% homology in sequence for the number of residues determined (20 amino acids). Northern blot analysis of bovine lens mRNA using a labeled antisense oligonucleotide probe common to the amino acid sequence of these three peptides revealed a single band having an apparent molecular size of 0.8 kb. Taken together, these findings suggest a genetic commonality between these polypeptides.
