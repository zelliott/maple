Sebacinoid fungi show a broad mycorrhizal capacity; therefore, they play a very important role in natural systems. Worldwide, fungi of Sebacinales are present under different environmental conditions and associate with diverse plant hosts, however, are hitherto poorly studied in China. Two sebacinoid ectomycorrhizae (ECM), Pinirhiza multifurcata and Pinirhiza nondextrinoidea, are described in detail morphologically and anatomically in the present study. They share a plectenchymatous outer mantle with multiply ramified hyphae in a gelatinous matrix, clampless, thin, thick-walled emanating hyphae with mostly Y-shaped ramifications and triangular inflations at the point of ramification. P. multifurcata and P. nondextrinoidea can be distinguished by thick cells in mantle layers, the ramification of emanating hyphae, the presence or absence of rhizomorphs, as well as the differing color reaction in Melzer's reagent. The putative molecular phylogenetic relationships of P. multifurcata and P. nondextrinoidea were inferred by analyses of the partial large subunit nuclear rDNA (nLSU); however, an affiliation to fungal species was not possible. This is the first report of sebacinoid ECM on Chinese pine.
