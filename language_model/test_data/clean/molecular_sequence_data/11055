We have identified a novel human gene with strong homology to the mouse Pa2g4 cell cycle gene. This novel gene (called PA2G4) belongs to a gene family with members in several chromosome regions: 3q24-q25, 6q22, 9q21, 12q13, 18q12, 20p12 and Xq25. A composite cDNA of 1697 nucleotides was isolated. The sequence of this cDNA predicts a protein of 394 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of this human protein shows very strong homology to the mouse protein p38-2G4. The cDNA analyzed probably corresponds to a functional copy found at 12q13.
