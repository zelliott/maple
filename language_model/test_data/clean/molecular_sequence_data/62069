Pig apolipoprotein (apo) A-IV cDNA was cloned, characterized and compared to the human ortholog. Mature porcine apo A-IV consists of 362 amino acids and displays a 75.6% sequence identity with human protein. Pig apo A-IV is the smallest reported mammalian apo A-IV because it lacks the repeated motifs of glutamine and glutamic acid at the carboxyl terminus. A phylogenic tree of apo A-IV mammalian proteins reveals that porcine apo A-IV is more closely related to humans and primates than to rodents. This protein is highly hydrophobic and is mainly associated with lipoproteins.
