Thirty six Gram-positive, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, non-motile bacterial strains were isolated from the non-salted pickle solution used in producing sunki products, a traditional Japanese pickle. The novel strains were discriminated and separated into four groups by amplified fragment length polymorphism profiling, and by analysis based on recA gene sequences. The strains were classified into four species groups belonging to the Lactobacillus buchneri species group, which consists of L. buchneri, Lactobacillus diolivorans, Lactobacillus hilgardii, Lactobacillus kefiri, Lactobacillus parabuchneri and Lactobacillus parakefiri. The phenotypic and genotypic features of the four groups demonstrated that they represented four novel species, for which the names Lactobacillus kisonensis sp. nov. (type strain YIT 11168(T)=NRIC 0741(T)=JCM 15041(T)=DSM 19906(T)), Lactobacillus otakiensis sp. nov. (type strain YIT 11163(T)=NRIC 0742(T)=JCM 15040(T)=DSM 19908(T)), Lactobacillus rapi sp. nov. (type strain YIT 11204(T)=NRIC 0743(T)=JCM 15042(T)=DSM 19907(T)) and Lactobacillus sunkii sp. nov. (type strain YIT 11161(T)=NRIC 0744(T)=JCM 15039(T)=DSM 19904(T)) are proposed.
