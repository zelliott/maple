A second member of the parvulin family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases was identified in a human lung cDNA library. The gene encoded a protein named hPar14 that has 131 amino acid residues and a molecular mass of 13676 Da. Sequence comparison showed 34.5% identity to E. coli Par10 and 34% identity to human Pin1 (hPar18) within a C-terminal region of 87 or 120 amino acid residues, respectively. In comparison to the E. coli Par10, hPar14 possesses a N-terminal extension of 41 amino acid residues. This extension does not contain a polyproline II helix-binding motif typical of the known eukaryotic parvulins. The hPar14 does not accelerate the cis to trans interconversion of oligopeptides with side chain-phosphorylated Ser(Thr)-Pro moieties as hPin1 did. In contrast, it showed preference of an arginine residue adjacent N-terminal to proline. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of the gene within various human tissues like heart, placenta, liver, kidney and pancreas.
