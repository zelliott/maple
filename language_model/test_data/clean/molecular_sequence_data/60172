An actin gene was isolated from the cellulolytic fungus Humicola grisea. The gene structure, which has 5 introns in the coding region, is similar to those of the so far cloned fungal actin genes. But there are some differences in intron sizes and codon usage. Transcription levels of actin and cellulase genes were also investigated.
