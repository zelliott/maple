SoxB is an essential component of the bacterial Sox sulfur oxidation pathway. SoxB contains a di-manganese(II) site and is proposed to catalyze the release of sulfate from a protein-bound cysteine S-thiosulfonate. A direct assay for SoxB activity is described. The structure of recombinant Thermus thermophilus SoxB was determined by x-ray crystallography to a resolution of 1.5 A. Structures were also determined for SoxB in complex with the substrate analogue thiosulfate and in complex with the product sulfate. A mechanistic model for SoxB is proposed based on these structures.
