Full-length soluble HIV-1 Tat protein has been shown to bind the CXCR4 receptor. Occupancy of CXCR4 by Tat inhibits infection of cells by T-tropic HIV-1. To understand if fragments of the Tat protein may have similar anti-HIV activity, we synthesized Tat peptides and tested their activity in tissue culture. Here, we report a sequence-specific contribution of Tat residues 31-35 to anti-HIV-1 activity.
