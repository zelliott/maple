Here, we present the genome of a strain of Erwinia amylovora, the fire blight pathogen, with pathogenicity restricted to Rubus spp. Comparative genomics of ATCC BAA-2158 with E. amylovora strains from non-Rubus hosts identified significant genetic differences but support the inclusion of this strain within the species E. amylovora.
