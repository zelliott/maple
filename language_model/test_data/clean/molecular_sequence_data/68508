A rat brain opioid receptor protein was isolated by binding [epsilon-biotinyl-Lys32] beta-endorphin to membranes, solubilizing the receptor-ligand (R.L) complex with deoxycholate-lysophosphatidylcholine and purifying on immobilized streptavidin and wheat germ agglutinin. The purified glycoprotein had a molecular mass of 60-70 kDa. Recovery of this protein was blocked by the nonselective opioid antagonist naloxone and the highly mu-selective agonist [D-Ala2,N-methyl-Phe4,Glyol5]-enkephalin but not by the highly delta-selective agonist [D-Pen2,4'-Cl-Phe4,D-Pen5]enkephalin when these compounds were added as competitors at the binding step. The 60-70-kDa receptor protein co-purified through the streptavidin column with 40-kDa protein recognized by anti-Gi alpha antibodies. GTP and Na+ influenced dissociation of the solubilized R.125I-L complex and elution of the receptor and G protein from streptavidin in fashions consistent with the pharmacology of mu-opioid receptors. A 23-amino acid residue sequence from the purified receptor differs at 4 positions from a similar sequence in the murine delta-opioid receptor and is encoded within a novel rat brain cDNA isolated by polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide primers related to the murine delta-opioid receptor gene.
