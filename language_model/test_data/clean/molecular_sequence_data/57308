Subgroup C avian sarcoma viruses efficiently infect and transform but poorly replicate in duck cells. Nucleotide sequence analysis of Prague strain of Rous sarcoma virus adapted by numerous passages on duck embryonic fibroblasts (daPr-RSV-C) showed that adaptation of originally chicken virus to duck cells correlated with changes in viral genome, first of all in gp85-coding domain of env-gene. Besides, changes in LTR and src-gene sequences could play a role in widening of host range for this virus. The major changes of daPr-RSV-C in comparison with original Pr-RSV-C appeared to be the result of homologous recombinations with corresponding regions of chicken endogenous retroviruses.
