The present report describes an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for bovine apolipoprotein (apo) A-IV. This assay was applied to the determination of its concentration and distribution in sera from cattle. The distribution of apoA-IV in lipoprotein fractions separated by ultracentrifugation was mostly recovered in the non-lipoprotein fractions (d>1.21 g/ml, 90%), but, in the case of gel filtration chromatography, apoA-IV was mainly eluted in HDL and non-lipoprotein fractions. The apoA-IV concentrations during early, mid- and late lactating stages in cows were significantly higher than during the nonlactating stage (p<0.05). From early to late lactating stages, the concentration of apoA-IV was unaltered. After 4 days of fasting, the concentration of plasma apoA-IV had decreased significantly (p<0.05) at days 3 and 4, and was returned to the basal level by 3 days of refeeding. These results suggested that the concentration of apoA-IV is modified by nutritional conditions.
