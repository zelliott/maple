Proteins and peptides separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis either in acetic acid-urea or in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-containing gels were electroblotted onto carboxymethylcellulose membrane and eluted from the membrane by dilute acid. Polypeptides thus recovered with a high yield can be used to get structural or biological data.
