An analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence of the composite tetracycline-resistance transposon Tn10 (9147 bp) from the Salmonella typhi conjugative plasmid R27 is presented. A comparison of the protein sequences from IS10-right and IS10-left transposases has identified four amino acid differences. These residues appear to play an important role in normal transposase function and may account for the differences in exhibited transposition activities. The tetracycline determinants encoded by this version of Tn10 share >99% identity with those of Tn10(R100), demonstrating the conservation that exists between these transposons. A previously uncharacterized approximately 3000-bp region of Tn10 contains four putative open reading frames. One of these open reading frames shares 55% identity with the glutamate permease protein sequence from Haemophilus influenzae although it was unable to complement an Escherichia coli glutamate permease mutant, with which it shares 51% identity. The three remaining putative open reading frames are arranged as a discrete genetic unit adjacent to the glutamate permease homolog and are transcribed in the opposite direction. Two of these open reading frames are homologous with Bacillus subtilis proteins of unknown functions while the other has no homologs in the database. The presence of an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase class II motif in one of these open reading frames in combination with the glutamate permease homolog allows us to postulate that this region of Tn10 could once have played a role in amino acid metabolism.
