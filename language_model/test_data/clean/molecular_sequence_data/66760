Peritoneal B cells and their omental precursors play an important role in the immune response of the peritoneal cavity and mucosal surfaces in mice. We have previously shown that peritoneal and mucosal B lineage cells are unlikely to be significantly linked in humans. However, the status of the omentum remains unknown. Here, using immunohistochemistry, we observed that sparse, quiescent B cells and occasional clusters of B cells were present in the omentum and that plasma cells, predominantly with cytoplasmic immunoglobulin G (IgG), were present. We analysed sequences of immunoglobulin genes amplified using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the normal human greater omentum, and describe the characteristics of variable region genes used by IgG, IgA and IgM. We focused on the properties of IgVH4 and IgVH5 families to allow comparisons of like with like between different Ig isotypes and cells from different immune compartments. We observed that the IgM genes were derived from a mixed population with mutated and unmutated immunoglobulin sequences. All IgVH4 and IgVH5 genes used by IgA and IgG from omental cells showed evidence of somatic hypermutation but the load of mutations was not significantly different to that seen in either the systemic or the mucosal compartments. The trends observed, including the dominance of IgG plasma cells, the IgA1/IgA2 ratio being biased towards IgA1, JH1 usage, and a moderate level of somatic mutations, link omental B lineage cells with the systemic compartment. These observations reinforce previous studies highlighting the difference between human and murine B-cell compartments and their relationship to the mucosal immune system.
