We looked for abnormalities of the retinoblastoma (RB-1) gene and of RB protein expression in 35 patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Mutations in exons 20 to 24 of the RB-1 gene (exons where mutations predominate in retinoblastoma and other solid tumors) were analyzed by single stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP). RB-1 protein was studied in bone marrow plasma cells by immunocytochemistry (ABC peroxidase technique) with a specific monoclonal antibody. Southern blot analysis of RB-1 gene was also performed in 20 of the patients. Twenty two patients analyzed had advanced disease (stage III or, in one case, plasma cell leukemia) and cytogenetic analysis (performed in 31 cases) found monosomy 13 in 9 patients. No rearrangement of the RB-1 gene was found by Southern analysis. Absent or greatly reduced RB-1 protein level was found in plasma cells in 4 of the patients (11%), whereas normal levels were seen in the remaining cases. No point mutation in exons 20 to 24 and their flanking introns were found in any of the 35 patients. Three of the 4 patients with absent or reduced RB-1 protein expression had advanced MM (stage III: 2 cases; plasma cell leukemia: 1 case); all 4 patients were resistant to treatment (as compared to 7 of the 31 patients with normal RB-1 protein levels); only one of them was subsequently found to have monosomy 13 (as compared to 9 of the 28 other karyotyped patients). Our findings suggest that abnormalities of the RB-1 gene and its expression are rare in MM. Absent or reduced expression of RB-1 protein was not significantly correlated to monosomy 13 and was not associated with gross rearrangements of the RB-1 gene by Southern analysis or point mutations in exons 20 to 24 of the gene. Reduced expression of RB-1 protein may be associated with advanced disease and poor response to treatment, although larger numbers of patients will be required for more adequate conclusions.
