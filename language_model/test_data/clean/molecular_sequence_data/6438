Tear-specific prealbumin is a group of proteins recently renamed as the tear lipocalins. These proteins were initially described as unique to lacrimal fluid. The tissue distribution and localization have never been thoroughly studied.

The distribution of purified tear lipocalins was studied in many human secretions and tissues by western blots, immunohistochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy.

Tear lipocalin species of the same molecular weights were observed in western blot lanes loaded with tears, saliva, and protein extracts from the lacrimal and lingual von Ebner's glands. Lacrimal and von Ebner's glands contained tear lipocalins; other human tissues and secretions, including other salivary glands and taste buds, did not. Tear lipocalins colocalized with lysozyme in serous acinar cells of lacrimal and von Ebner's glands. Ultrastructurally, tear lipocalins were present on polyribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi areas. Lipocalins were concentrated in lacrimal secretory granules in amounts commensurate with a regulated pathway.

Tear lipocalins are expressed and truncated similarly in lingual von Ebner's and lacrimal glands, but not at all in other human tissues. Lipocalins are expressed and secreted with lysozyme. Lipocalins are concentrated in secretory granules in an amount consistent with a regulated secretory pathway.
