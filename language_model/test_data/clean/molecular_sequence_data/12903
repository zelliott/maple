Prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) is a brain neurosecretory protein that controls insect development. PTTH of the silkmoth Bombyx mori is a homodimeric protein, the subunit of which consists of 109 amino acids. Clear-cut sequence similarity to any other proteins has not been observed. By disulfide-bond pattern analysis and modeling of the PTTH structure based on the known three-dimensional (3D) structures of growth factor family with cystine-knot motif, we propose that the PTTH protomer adopts the fold unique to the structural superfamily of the growth factors, beta-nerve growth factor (beta-NGF), transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-beta 2), and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB). The insect neurohormone PTTH appears to be a member of the growth factor superfamily, sharing a common ancestral gene with the three vertebrate growth factors, beta-NGF, TGF-beta 2 and PDGF-BB.
