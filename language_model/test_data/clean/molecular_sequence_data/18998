Persistence of giardiasis after some of the recommended drugs is occurring with increasing frequency. We describe the follow-up of four members of a family with giardiasis through microscopic observation, immunochromatography and PCRs of tpi and β-giardin genes. Three patients did not respond to tinidazole but they were cured after quinacrine. However, PCR became negative at 2 months after negativization of stools in two patients and after 1 year in one patient. In all cases Giardia assemblage B was characterized with high homology between all isolates. Further studies are needed to determine the value of PCR in the diagnosis of Giardia infections.
