Herpesvirus saimiri induces acute lymphomas and leukemias in New World primates and rabbits. Previous work revealed that a highly oncogenic group C strain 484-77 encodes and expresses a bicistronic mRNA in tumor-derived T cells and the first open reading frame (orf1) is highly homologous to collagen. With the aid of an antibody against a synthetic orf1 peptide, we now report that the orf1 collagen-like protein is expressed in rabbit tumor derived cell lines and in vitro transformed human and monkey T cells. The orf1 protein is expressed in vivo, as indicated by specific antibodies detected in the serum from a tumor-bearing rabbit.
