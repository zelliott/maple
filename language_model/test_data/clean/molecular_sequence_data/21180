A 4-day-old boy presented with tight, translucent skin, prominent vessels, skin erosions, and dysmorphic findings, including hypertelorism, antimongoloid axis, sparse eyelashes and eyebrows, pinched nose, natal teeth, microretrognathia, and an "o-shaped" mouth. Multiple joint contractures, dysplastic clavicles, and thin ribs were also observed. He died at 2 weeks of age of respiratory distress. The patient was diagnosed as being affected with restrictive dermopathy, which is a rare, lethal genodermatosis caused by recessive mutations of the zinc metalloproteinase ZMPSTE24 gene or less frequently, by dominant lamin A/C gene mutations. Direct sequencing of the ZMPSTE24 gene was performed, and the most common, homozygous, inactivating mutation in exon 9 was identified in the patient (c.1085_1086insT; p.Leu362PhefsX19). Autosomal recessive transmission was confirmed by parental DNA analysis. After genetic counseling, a prenatal diagnosis could be performed during the subsequent pregnancy. ZMPSTE24 screening was performed by direct sequencing and fluorescent fragment analysis on DNA derived from a chorionic villus sample after exclusion of maternal contamination. The fetus had inherited both normal parental alleles, avoiding the recurrence of the disease.
