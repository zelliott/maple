Uteroglobin is expressed in various tissues of the rabbit under complex hormonal control. In the endometrium the uteroglobin gene is transcribed only in epithelial cells after administration of ovarian hormones. In this paper we demonstrate that within the promoter region of the rabbit uteroglobin gene, there is a functional estrogen-responsive element (ERE) located between -265 and -252. Hybrid constructions containing sequences of the uteroglobin promoter up to -299, linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene of E. coli respond to estrogens in gene transfer experiments, whereas a deletion that removes half of the ERE does not. A synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to the putative ERE is able to confer estrogen inducibility to an otherwise unresponsive promoter. Binding experiments with purified estrogen receptor from calf uterus reveal a DNase-I footprint over the ERE. Within this protected region six guanine residues that have been shown to be contacted by the receptor in other EREs are protected against methylation by dimethylsulfate in the presence of the estrogen receptor. We compare this ERE with the vitellogenin A2 ERE from Xenopus and find that the relative affinity of the uteroglobin ERE is slightly lower than that of the vitellogenin ERE. Thus, this uteroglobin ERE could be involved in physiological regulation of uteroglobin expression in the genital tract.
