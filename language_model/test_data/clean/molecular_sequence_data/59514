A pair of oligonucleotide primers were designed from the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SrRNA) of the oral protozoan parasite Entamoeba gingivalis. The primers amplified a 1.4-kb DNA fragment by polymerase chain reaction and were specific for Entamoeba gingivalis but not for other protozoa, oral protists and bacteria, or human leukocytes. With this method, the DNA from as few as 30 cells of Entamoeba gingivalis could be detected. These results suggest that this approach is applicable to the detection and identification of Entamoeba gingivalis in the human oral cavity.
