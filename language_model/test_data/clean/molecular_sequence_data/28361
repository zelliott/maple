The small (S) RNA segment of the Maguari bunyavirus genome has been cloned as cDNA and its nucleotide sequence determined. The nucleocapsid protein, N, (Mr 26K) and a nonstructural protein, NSs, (Mr 11K), are encoded in overlapping reading frames, similar to other bunyavirus S RNA segments. In addition, a third AUG-initiated open reading frame encoding a 9.3K protein was observed. All three polypeptides were translated in cell free systems programmed with RNA transcribed in vitro from the cDNA subcloned downstream of a bacteriophage T7 promoter. The effects on expression of subcloning parts of the cDNA and by site-specific mutagenesis are discussed in relation to the scanning model of initiation of translation. A recombinant baculovirus has been constructed to express the Maguari virus S segment gene products. The N protein was efficiently expressed in infected cells, and a significant amount was in a soluble form. We could not detect the synthesis of NSs nor the 9.3K protein, and the reasons for this are discussed. The 9.3K protein has not been found in Maguari virus-infected cells and so the question of its functional significance remains open.
