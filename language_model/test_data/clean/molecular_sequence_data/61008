N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) is a hexameric ATPase essential for eukaryotic vesicle fusion. Along with SNAP proteins, it disassembles cis-SNARE complexes upon ATP hydrolysis, preparing SNAREs for trans complex formation. We have determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of NSF (N) to 1.9 A resolution. N contains two subdomains which form a groove that is a likely SNAP interaction site. Unexpectedly, both N subdomains are structurally similar to domains in EF-Tu. Based on this similarity, we propose a model for a large conformational change in NSF that drives SNARE complex disassembly.
