We determined the complete nucleotide (nt) sequence (16,614 nt) of a large double-stranded (ds) RNA (referred to as L1 dsRNA), previously identified as the hypovirulence factor from strain V670 of the violet root rot fungus, Helicobasidium mompa. The positive-strand of L1 dsRNA contained a long open reading frame (ORF) potentially encoding a protein of 5,373 amino acids (molecular mass 603,080 Da) with conserved motifs characteristic of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase. The ORF is the longest so far reported in the fungal kingdom. The putative RdRp and helicase were shown to be related to putative RdRps and helicases of members of the genus Endornavirus. As is the case with endornaviruses, the coding (sense) strand of L1 dsRNA contained a discontinuity (nick) at nt position 2,552. A region between the RdRp and helicase domains of the polyprotein also had an amino acid sequence, resembling UDP glycosyltransferases (UGTs) in Oryza sativa endornavirus and Phytophthora endornavirus 1. Regions in the L1 dsRNA-encoded protein presumed to contain putative helicase, UGT and RdRp motifs were present at comparable positions to those in other endornaviruses. L1 dsRNA of H. mompa strain V670 was assigned to the genus Endornavirus, and here, we designate it as H. mompa endornavirus 1-670 (HmEV1-670). This represents the first report of a fungal endornavirus whose complete nucleotide sequence has been determined.
