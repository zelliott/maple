The berberine bridge enzyme ((S)-reticuline:oxygen oxidoreductase (methylene-bridge-forming), EC 1.5.3.9) catalyzes the oxidative cyclization of the N-methyl moiety of (S)-reticuline into the berberine bridge carbon, C-8, of (S)-scoulerine. This is a reaction that has neither an equivalent in organic chemistry nor a parallel in nature. The uniqueness of this catalytic reaction prompted an in depth study that began with the isolation of the cDNA encoding the berberine bridge enzyme followed by the overexpression of this cDNA in insect cell culture. The heterologously expressed enzyme has herein been shown to contain covalently attached FAD in a molar ratio of cofactor to protein of 1:1.03. Site-directed mutagenesis and laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry suggest that the site of covalent attachment is at His-104. The holoenzyme exhibited absorbance maxima at 380 and 442 nm and a fluorescence emission maximum at 628 nm (310 nm excitation). Enzymic transformation of a series of (S)-reticuline derivatives modified with respect to the stereochemistry at C-1 or in the aromatic ring substitution suggests that ring closure proceeds in two steps: formation of the methylene iminium ion and subsequent ring closure via an ionic mechanism.
