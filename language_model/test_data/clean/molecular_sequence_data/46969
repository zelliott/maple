An index patient with pseudohomozygosity for factor V Leiden was identified. Each of his two children inherited a different paternal factor V allele; a daughter was heterozygous for factor V Leiden, with 100% factor V activity, and a son was heterozygous for factor V deficiency, with 50% factor V activity. Genomic DNA was obtained from family members, and the 25 factor V exons and flanking intronic regions were sequenced in the proband and confirmed in the children. Within exon 13 of factor V, a 4 base insertion was found at NT 2856 in the proband and son. but not the daughter. This mutation, here designated factor V Stanford, results in a frameshift with loss of a thrombin activation site (R1545V) and premature termination of translation at amino acid 1560.
