The development of airways hyperreactivity in allergic IL-13(-/-) mice is controversial and appears to correlate with the number of times that the original 129 x C57BL/6 founder strain has been crossed to the BALB/c background. In this investigation, we compared allergic responses in founder IL-13(-/-) mice crossed for either 5 (N5) or 10 (N10) generations to BALB/c mice. Whereas allergic N5 IL-13(-/-) mice developed airways hyperreactivity, tissue eosinophilia, elevated IgE, and pulmonary expression of Ym proteins, these processes were attenuated in N5 IL-13(-/-) mice treated with an IL-4-neutralizing Ab, and in N10 IL-13(-/-) mice. These data showed that IL-4 was more effective in regulating allergic responses in N5 IL-13(-/-) mice than in N10 IL-13(-/-) mice. To elucidate the mechanism associated with these observations, we show by restriction and sequence analysis that N5 IL-13(-/-) mice express the C57BL/6 form of IL-4Ralpha and N10 IL-13(-/-) mice express the BALB/c form. Despite the near identical predicted molecular mass of these isoforms, IL-4Ralpha from N5 IL-13(-/-) mice migrates with a slower electrophoretic mobility than IL-4Ralpha from N10 IL-13(-/-) mice, suggesting more extensive posttranslational modification of the N5 form. The Thre(49)Ile polymorphism in the extracellular domain of BALB/c IL-4Ralpha has been demonstrated to disrupt N-linked glycosylation of Asn(47) and increase the dissociation rate of the IL-4Ralpha/IL-4 interaction. Collectively, these data show that polymorphisms in IL-4Ralpha, which have been shown to affect the interaction with IL-4, correlate with the ability of IL-4 to regulate allergic responses in IL-13(-/-) mice.
