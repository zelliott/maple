Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a bi-segmented, double-stranded RNA virus which belongs to the genus Avibirnavirus of the family Birnavirideae. In this study, we determined the complete nucleotide sequences of a reassortment IBDV strain TL2004 with segments A and B derived from attenuated and very virulent strains of IBDV. This strain is pathogenic to SPF-embryonated eggs and chickens, although it is not as virulent as very virulent strain. Genomic sequence in GenBank analysis showed that both types of natural genetic reassortment of infectious bursal disease virus emerged in China. Our findings, which strongly suggest genetic exchange between attenuated and very virulent strains of IBDV, emphasizes the risk of generating uncontrolled chimeric viruses by using live attenuated vaccines.
