ARPP-16 (cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of Mr = 16,000) is a substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase and is enriched in the basal ganglia. ARPP-16 has been purified to homogeneity from the soluble fraction of bovine caudate nuclei. An additional substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase of Mr = 19,000 (ARPP-19) was found to cross-react with rabbit anti-serum prepared against purified ARPP-16. Immunological analysis indicated that ARPP-16 was enriched in the basal ganglia while ARPP-19 was present in similar levels in all brain regions studied and was also present in non-neuronal tissues. ARPP-19 was also purified to homogeneity from bovine caudate nucleus cytosol. Using oligonucleotide probes based on the partial amino acid sequence of purified ARPP-16, cDNA clones for ARPP-16 and ARPP-19 were isolated from a bovine caudate nucleus cDNA library and sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequences of the two proteins were identical except that ARPP-19 had an additional 16 amino acids at the NH2-terminal. The two cDNA clones share an identical 3'-untranslated region of 756 nucleotides. The cDNA clone for ARPP-16 contained 806 additional nucleotides located 3' to this common sequence. The 5'-untranslated regions of the two clones were entirely different. The results suggest the possibility that ARPP-16 and ARPP-19 are produced by alternative transcription and splicing.
