The product of the psbH gene has been identified in Synechocystis 6803 thylakoid membranes as a 6 kDa phosphoprotein. This protein becomes phosphorylated in vitro despite the fact that in cyanobacteria it is truncated at the N-terminus such that the phosphorylation site identified in the higher plant protein is missing. Phosphorylation occurred both in the light and in the dark but was inhibited by oxidising conditions, DCMU and zinc ions. The cyanobacterial 6 kDa phosphoprotein degrades when the membranes are subjected to high intensity illumination.
