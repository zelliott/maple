The oncogene v-mos transforms mammalian fibroblasts and encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase. Expression of the c-mos protooncogene is most abundant in germ cells, suggesting a normal role for c-mos in meiosis. Here we describe the isolation of cDNA clones containing the complete coding region of the Xenopus laevis homolog of c-mos (mosxe). The mosxe gene is transforming when introduced into murine NIH 3T3 cells, and transformation is abrogated by a lysine-to-arginine mutation in the canonical ATP-binding site. Microinjection of in vitro transcribed mosxe RNA into prophase-arrested Xenopus oocytes causes a resumption of meiosis, leading to germinal vesicle breakdown and oocyte maturation. Oocyte maturation was not observed after microinjection of in vitro transcribed mosxe RNA encoding the lysine-to-arginine mutation. These results demonstrate that the mosxe-encoded protein can induce progression through the cell cycle for both meiotic and mitotic cells and that this property is dependent on the presumptive ATP-binding domain in the protein kinase.
