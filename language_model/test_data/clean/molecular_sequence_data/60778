Immune cells express P2 purinoceptors of the P2Y and P2X subtypes. In the present work, we show that three dendritic cell (DC) lines, D2SC/1, CB1, and FSDC, representative of immature DCs, express the P2X7 (formerly P2Z) receptor, as judged from RT-PCR amplification, reactivity to a specific antiserum, and pharmacological and functional evidence. Receptor expression is higher in FSDC cells, a cell line that is functionally more mature than D2SC/1 and CB1. From the wild-type DC population, we selected cell clones lacking the P2X7R (P2X7less). We also used a P2XR blocker, oxidized ATP, to irreversibly inhibit the P2X7R. Ability of P2X7less FSDCs or of oxidized ATP-inhibited FSDCs to stimulate Ag-specific TH lymphocytes was severely decreased although Ag endocytosis was minimally affected. During coculture with TH lymphocytes, wild-type FSDC secreted large amounts of IL-1beta. Release of this cytokine was reduced in P2X7less DCs. These data show that DCs express the P2X7 purinoceptor and suggest a correlation between P2X7R expression and Ag-presenting activity.
