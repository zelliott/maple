The human DDX6 gene (alias RCK) at chromosome 11 band q23 was identified through the study of the breakpoint of t(11;14)(q23;q32) translocation in a B-cell lymphoma cell line, RC-K8. DDX6 encodes a DEAD box protein/RNA helicase. Positive mouse genomic and cDNA recombinant clones were obtained by screening mouse B-cell genomic and cDNA libraries with a human DDX6 cDNA probe. The deduced amino acid sequence of an open reading frame from a cDNA clone revealed a protein with 92.5% identity to human ddx6/p54. All positive mouse genomic recombinant clones, and cDNA clones containing mouse Ddx6 (previous gene symbol: Rck), were localized by fluorescent in situ hybridization to band B of mouse Chromosome 9, a region showing conserved linkage homology to human chromosome 11 band q23. Mouse Ddx6 was localized to the region between Ncam and D9Mit45 by molecular linkage analysis. A 7.5-kb mRNA and a 54-kDa protein were identified as mouse Ddx6 gene products which are similar in size to products of the human DDX6 gene, as shown by Northern and Western blot analyses.
