Two distinct mariner-like elements, Atmar-1 and Atmar-2, were isolated from the genome of the mosquito Ochlerotatus atropalpus. Full-sized Atmar-1 elements, obtained by screening a genomic library, have a 1293-bp consensus sequence with 27-bp inverted terminal repeats and a 1047-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding the transposase. The Atmar-2 elements were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA and contain the central part of the transposase ORF. Individual clones of both mariner elements contain deletions, frameshifts, and stop codons. The Atmar-1 elements are present in 370-1200 copies, while the Atmar-2 elements are present in approximately 100-300 copies per haploid genome. One of the Atmar-1 elements, Atmar-1.33, could be mobilized, suggesting the presence of functional Atmar-1 elements elsewhere in the genome. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that Atmar-1 elements belong to the irritans subfamily and Atmar-2 elements to the cecropia subfamily of mariner elements.
