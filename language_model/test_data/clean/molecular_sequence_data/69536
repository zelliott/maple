The concept of antigene therapy of disease is based on the ability of an oligonucleotide (the therapeutic agent) to bind to double-stranded genomic DNA (the target associated with the disease). Examples are herein given of the linkage of a series of polyamines to a 21-mer homopyrimidine oligonucleotide. These conjugated 21-mers can each form a triple helix with an appropriate double-stranded homopurine-homopyrimidine DNA according to Hoogsteen base-pairing rules. No triple helix was found when unmodified third strand was used at 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 100 mM sodium chloride solution. In contrast, the spermine-conjugated oligonucleotide had a melting temperature of 42 degrees C. According to the melting profile, the appended spermine moiety was found to affect the Tm only of the triple helix, but not of the subsequent melting of the underlying double helix. The Tm enhancing ability of the spermine-conjugate was found to be better than that of other polyamine-conjugates.
