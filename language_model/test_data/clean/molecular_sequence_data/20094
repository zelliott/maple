Two human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 (HLA-DRB1*1376 and -DRB1*1465) and one HLA-A (HLA-A*2471) novel alleles have been identified in individuals from the Brazilian Bone Marrow Donor Registry. DNA sequencing of exon 2 for HLA-DRB1 alleles showed two and five nucleotide substitutions in -DRB1*1376 and -DRB1*1465, compared with closely related alleles, respectively. These substitutions result in a change of amino acid residues in HLA-DRB1*1376 at position 74 (Arg --> Glu) and in -DRB*1465 at positions 47 (Tyr --> Phe), 57 (Asp --> Ser) and 74 (Glu --> Ala). On the other hand, sequence analysis of exons 2 and 3 for HLA-A*2471 showed a single substitution, leading to a single amino acid change at position 151 (His --> Arg). These three novel alleles may have originated from other HLA alleles by gene conversion. However, it is also possible that HLA-A*2471 has evolved from one of the alleles of the HLA-A*2402 group through a point mutation.
