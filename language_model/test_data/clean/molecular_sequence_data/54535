Liriomyza trifolii (Diptera: Agromyzidae) is one of the most economically significant pests in the world. In this paper we present sequence data for the complete mitochondrial genome of L. trifolii. The circular genome is 16,141 bp long and contains one encoding region including 37 genes and one non-coding A+T-rich region. Gene numbers and organization is similar to that of the typical insect mitochondrial genomes except that two additional tRNA genes are found in the A+T-rich region (tRNA(Thr) and tRNA(Leu(UUR))). All of the protein initiation codons are ATN, except ND1 which begins with GTG and COI which is initiated by the quadruplet ATCA. The 22 tRNA anticodons of L. trifolii match those observed in Drosophila yakuba, and all of tRNAs form the typical cloverleaf structure except for tRNA(Ser(AGN)), which has lost the DHU-arm. The A+T-rich region of L. trifolii also contains two previously noted Diperan features--a highly conserved polyT stretch and a (TA)(n) stretch.
