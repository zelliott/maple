A 353-bp region encoding for the NH2 terminus of the noncollagenic part of the alpha 1(V) chain was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), subcloned and sequenced. The subcloned PCR product (pGC1) presented the same nucleotide sequence as the original fragment from the published sequence of COL5A1. In situ hybridization, using pGC1 as a probe, mapped the COL5A1 gene to chromosome 9q34.3. This assignment shows that COL5A1 is not synthetic with COL5A2, which is localized together with other collagen genes on chromosome 2.
