With the aim of finding genes involved in the floral transition of woody species four MADS box genes containing cDNAs from apple (Malus domestica) have been isolated. Three genes were isolated from vegetative tissue of apple, but were homologues of known genes that specify floral organ identity. MdMADS13 is an AP3-like B class MADS box gene, and was mainly expressed in petals and stamens as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis. MdMADS14 and -15 are AGAMOUS-like genes. They differed slightly in expression patterns on Northern blots, with MdMADS15 mRNA levels equally high in stamens and carpels, but MdMADS14 preferably expressed in carpels. MdMADS14 is likely to be the apple orthologue of one of the Arabidopsis thaliana SHATTERPROOF genes, and MdMADS15 closely resembled the Arabidopsis AGAMOUS gene. It has been shown with RT-PCR that the three floral apple MADS box genes are expressed in vegetative tissues of adult as well as juvenile trees, albeit at low levels. MdMADS12 is an AP1-like gene that is expressed at similar levels in leaves, vegetative shoots, and floral tissues, and that may be involved in the transition from the juvenile to the adult stage.
