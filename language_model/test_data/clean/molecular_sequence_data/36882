Periodic transcription during the cell cycle of the budding yeast DNA polymerase alpha gene (POL1) requires the cis-acting element 5' ACGCGT 3', which has been found in the 5' non-coding region of all the DNA synthesis genes analyzed so far. Search for trans-acting mutations affecting POL1 expression led to the isolation of the temperature-sensitive reg1033 mutant, that showed increased levels of both DNA polymerase alpha and delta gene transcripts. Cloning of the REG1033 gene demonstrated that it is essential for cell viability and required for proper expression of the POL1 gene. DNA sequence comparison established that the REG1033 gene is identical to MOT1, a gene encoding a presumptive DNA helicase which modulates transcription of several yeast genes.
