In view of the high structural and pharmacological similarities between the alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors of humans and other mammalian species, it has been concluded, in particular, from experiments in rabbits that the (2A)-adrenoceptor is the exclusive site of action of central antihypertensive drugs, although the amino acid sequence of the alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor of just this species was unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was to determine the complete nucleotide sequence of the coding region of the rabbit alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor gene. Degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to regions of the alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor conserved between rat and man were used in a polymerase chain reaction with genomic DNA prepared from rabbit. A 1,356-base pair product with an open reading frame of 1,353 base pairs was obtained that encodes a protein of 451 amino acids which is similar to the alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors of other mammals (man, pig, rat, mouse, guinea-pig and cattle) but not to their alpha(2B)- and alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor subtypes suggesting its classification as an alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor. However, the degree of amino acid sequence identity is, at best, only 80% and, thus, about 10% less than between the other mammalian species. Compared with the human sequence there are 81 substantial changes of amino acids. In conclusion, rabbit and human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors substantially differ in their amino acid sequence which may explain the opposite pharmacodynamic properties of the central antihypertensive drug rilmenidine (alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonism and antagonism, respectively) reported in the literature. Hence, the present study supports the view that experiments with central antihypertensive drugs in rabbits are not reliably predictive for the site of action of such drugs in man.
