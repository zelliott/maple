A monoclonal antibody 137BL7 raised against purified DR1 protein was shown to bind specifically to 5/5 DR1, 18/18 DR2 cells and 0/23 non-DR1,2 cells by cell-EIA. Further analysis by FACS using HLA-transfectants revealed that 137BL7 also bound specifically to the DRB5 transfectants in addition to the expected DR1 transfectants. However, it did not bind to the DR2 (DR15) transfectants, showing that cross-reactivity with DR2 cells lies with the DRB5 (DR51) rather than the DRB1 gene product. A comparison of the HLA-DR amino acid sequences of DR1 and DR51 antigens revealed a common glutamic acid residue at position 96, which may form the putative binding epitope of this mAb.
