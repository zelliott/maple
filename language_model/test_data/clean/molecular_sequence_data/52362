p53 point mutations in primary gastric carcinomas were analyzed by performing cDNA deoxynucleotide sequencing of the gene. Out of 16, 9 (56.3%) primary gastric carcinoma cases, including early cancer, showed one or more p53 point mutations in their open-reading frame, and 4 out of 9 cases had a p53 point mutation within highly conserved domains. The characteristics of the p53 mutation spectrum observed in primary tumors were (a) frequent mutation at an A:T pair (50%, 7 out of 14 mutations), (b) high transversion incidence (29%, 4 out of 14 mutations), (c) no transition at CpG, and (d) no G:C to T:A transversion. Our results suggest that p53 mutation is a common event in gastric carcinoma occurring from the early stage of progression with its specific mutation spectrum.
