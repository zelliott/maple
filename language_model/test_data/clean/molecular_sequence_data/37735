A 1-mm microbore hydrophilic interaction column has been used for the separation of 2-aminoacridone (2-AMAC)-derivatized glycan mixtures, released from naturally occurring and recombinant proteins. Primary structure identification of the 2-AMAC glycan derivatives was carried out by HPLC using fluorescence and mass spectrometric detection. In some cases, enzymatic digestion of the 2-AMAC glycans was applied to confirm glycan structure. This strategy is considerably more rapid than methods normally used in glycan analysis, which involves manual collection of separated oligosaccharide derivatives and analysis of individual fractions by mass spectrometry.
