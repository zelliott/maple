Yeast RAD51, a homologue of Escherichia coli recA, plays a crucial role in mitotic and/or meiotic recombination and in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks. We have identified unique multiple alternative transcripts of a human TRAD/R51H3/RAD51D gene, a member of the recA/RAD51 gene family. One of the transcripts encoded a 328-amino-acid protein with 83.0% overall amino acid identity and 98. 2% similarity with the mouse TRAD gene and had two nucleotide binding consensus sequences, motif A and motif B, conserved among members of this family. Other transcripts encoded truncated proteins with a partial N-terminal region of the orthologue or short proteins lacking internal sequences which contain nucleotide binding motifs. Northern blot analysis revealed that multiple transcripts of the human TRAD gene were expressed in various tissues and their distribution was not ubiquitous.
