Immunization of rats with soluble antigen (ovalbumin) and the castor bean toxin, ricin, eliminates a subpopulation of CD8+ T cells which suppress IgE responses in vivo. This treatment also reduces the ability of splenic T cells to produce interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and enhances their capacity to make interleukin-4 (IL-4). In this report we describe the effect of immunization with ricin and antigen on the expression of mRNA for other T-helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines--IL-5 and IL-10--and their relationship to serum IgE and IL-4 mRNA expression. Splenocytes were taken from rats at different times after immunization with antigen or ricin and antigen and activated in vitro with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin for 6 hr and total RNA extracted and reverse transcribed. Cytokine gene expression was detected using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Expression of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 was increased 7-20-fold 11 days after immunization with ricin and antigen (from 0.107% to 0.769% beta-actin for IL-4, from 0.0167% to 0.381% beta-actin for IL-5, and from 0.0581% to 0.954% beta-actin for IL-10), and preceded maximum serum IgE levels by 4-5 days. There was no increase in IgE or mRNA for these cytokines in rats immunized with antigen alone. The level of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 expression declined rapidly after 12 days. Our results suggest that immunization with antigen and ricin preferentially induces a Th2 response, and that CD8+ T cells may play a part in down-regulating the development of Th2 T cells.
