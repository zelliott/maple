A small (8.2-kb) ColE1 plasmid encoding TEM-144 (a new beta-lactamase with a ceftazidimase profile) was sequenced by a gene-walking strategy. The bla(TEM) allele was carried on a Tn2 element, disrupting a Rom protein gene. TEM-144 differs from TEM-1 by two mutations (R164C and E240K) and from the ceftazidime-hydrolyzing TEM-91 by one mutation (T182M).
