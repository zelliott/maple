Tocopherols (vitamin E) comprise a class of lipid-soluble antioxidants synthesized only in plants, algae, and some cyanobacteria. The majority of tocopherols in photosynthetic cells is in the alpha form, which has the highest vitamin E activity in humans, whereas the beta, gamma, and delta forms normally account for a small percentage of total tocopherols. The antioxidant activities of these forms of tocopherol differ depending on the experimental system, and their relative activities in vivo are unclear. In a screen for suppressors of the xanthophyll-deficient npq1 lor1 double mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we isolated a vte3 mutant lacking alpha-tocopherol but instead accumulating beta-tocopherol. The vte3 mutant contains a mutation in the homolog of a 2-methyl-6-phytyl-1,4-benzoquinone methyltransferase gene found in plants. The vte3 npq1 lor1 triple mutant with beta-tocopherol survived better under photooxidative stress than did the npq1 lor1 mutant, but the vte3 mutant on its own did not have an obvious phenotype. Following transfer from low light to high light, the triple mutant showed a higher efficiency of photosystem II, a higher level of cell viability, and a lower level of lipid peroxide, a marker for oxidative stress, than did the npq1 lor1 mutant. After high-light transfer, the level of the photosystem II reaction center protein, D1, was also higher in the vte3 npq1 lor1 mutant, but the rate of D1 photodamage was not significantly different from that of the npq1 lor1 mutant. Taken together, these results suggest that the replacement of alpha-tocopherol by beta-tocopherol in a xanthophyll-deficient strain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contributes to better survival under conditions of photooxidative stress.
