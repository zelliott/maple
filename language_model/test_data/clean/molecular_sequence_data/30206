Previous studies demonstrated correct tissue- and temporal-specific expression of human gamma- and beta-globin genes in transgenic mice; however, expression was extremely low. When the erythroid-specific DNase I super-hypersensitive (HS) sites that are normally located upstream of the human beta-globin locus were fused individually to gamma- or beta-globin genes, expression increased to endogenous mouse globin levels but temporal specificity was lost. In contrast, when the HS sequences were combined with fragments containing both gamma- and beta-globin genes, correct developmental regulation was restored. We suggest that human gamma- to beta-globin gene switching during development results from competition of individual globin gene family members for interaction with the HS sequences and that factors influencing these competitive interactions determine temporal specificity.
