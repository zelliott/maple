In this study, we report the presence of the SXT element and Class I integron in Vibrio cholerae non-O1, non-O139 strains isolated from Varanasi, India. Isolates were resistant to cotrimoxazole, trimethoprim and/or streptomycin, furazolidone and ampicillin. None contained plasmids. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing revealed the presence of antibiotic resistance gene cassettes, aadA1, aadA2, aadA5 and dfrA15, in the Class I integron and SXT, an integrative conjugative element containing dfr18, sulII and strAB, in three and six of the isolates respectively. Conjugation experiments, followed by PCR analysis of transconjugants, provided evidence for the transferable nature of intSXT and associated antibiotic resistance gene cassettes. This is the first report of the occurrence of SXT ICE, dfr18, sulII, strAB and aadA5 genes in environmental V. cholerae non-O1, non-O139 strains from Varanasi, India, that had been isolated before 1992.
