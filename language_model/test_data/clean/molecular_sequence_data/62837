Recently, rapid progress in our structural knowledge of K(+)-selective channels has started to provide a basis for comprehending the biophysical machinery underlying their electrophysiological properties. These studies have begun to reveal how a diverse array of distinct, cytoplasmically positioned domains affect the activity of associated channels. Some of these establish functional diversity by selectively mediating channel assembly. More importantly, these cytoplasmic domains couple intracellular signals to the gating of their associated pore. New structural insights are providing a clearer understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms of these K(+) channels that, in turn, partly underlie complex neurological phenomena.
