Erythroid Kr√ºppel-like factor (EKLF) is a trans-acting factor that binds specifically to the beta-globin promoter CACCC box. EKLF is essential for adult erythroid development in mice. We have cloned and sequenced a cDNA encoding the human homologue of this gene, which shares 69% identity with the mEKLF protein. The expression of hEKLF is restricted to fetal liver and adult bone marrow. The genomic locus of hEKLF was mapped to chromosomal band 19p13.12-p13.13, using fluorescence in situ hybridization.
