Impatiens necrotic spot tospovirus (INSV) is a significant pathogen of ornamentals. The tripartite negative- and ambi-sense RNA genome encodes six proteins that are involved in cytoplasmic replication, movement, assembly, insect transmission and defence. To gain insight into the associations of these viral proteins, we determined their intracellular localization and interactions in living plant cells. Nucleotide sequences encoding the nucleoprotein N, non-structural proteins NSs and NSm, and glycoproteins Gn and Gc of a Kentucky isolate of INSV were amplified by RT-PCR, cloned, sequenced and transiently expressed as fusions with autofluorescent proteins in leaf epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana. All proteins accumulated at the cell periphery and co-localized with an endoplasmic reticulum marker. The Gc protein fusion also localized to the nucleus. N and NSm protein self-interactions and an NSm-N interaction were observed by using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. A tospovirus NSm homotypic interaction had not been reported previously.
