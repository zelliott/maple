We report here a new HLA-B*56 allele, B*560502, identified by sequencing-based typing in the Korean population. HLA-B*560502 differs from B*560501 by a single nucleotide at position 141 in exon 2 (T(r)C). This single nucleotide substitution may not result in an amino acid difference in the alpha1 domain at residue 23. The putative haplotype involving B*560502 may be A*24-DRB1*1201-DQA1*0503-DQB1*0304-DPB1*0202.
