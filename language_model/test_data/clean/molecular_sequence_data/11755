The icosahedral structures of alphaviruses and of the external shell of the viral nucleocapsid have been defined to very high resolutions, revealing details of the interactions between the glycoproteins to form trimeric spikes and the nucleocapsid. The structural studies complement biochemical and molecular genetic studies showing that a sequence-specific interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of the glycoproteins and the nucleocapsid drives budding.
