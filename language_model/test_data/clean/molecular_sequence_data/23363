Cell-mediated immunity directed against human papillomavirus 16 (HPV-16) antigens was studied in six patients affected with grade 3 vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN3, also known as bowenoid papulosis). Five of the patients presented with a chronic and persistent disease that relapsed after destructive treatments. They showed no detectable anti-HPV blood T-cell responses and no T-cell intraepidermal vulvar infiltrate containing both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. The last patient had a complete clearance of viral lesions, 8 months after disease onset and 2 months after electrocoagulation of <50% of the VIN3 lesions. She showed high frequency anti-E6 and anti-E7 effector blood T cells by ex vivo ELISpot-IFNgamma assay before clinical regression. Immunohistochemical study of her vulvar biopsy revealed a marked dermal infiltrate containing a majority of CD4+ T lymphocytes and an epidermal infiltrate made up of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. This seems to be the first evidence of an association between spontaneous regression of VIN3 lesions and HPV-specific T-cell responses detectable in the blood. Hence, an increase of HPV-specific effector T lymphocyte responses by vaccine-based therapeutic strategies might be useful to clear the lesions in bowenoid papulosis disease.
