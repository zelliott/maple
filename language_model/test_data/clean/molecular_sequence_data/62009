Apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] contains the largest numbers of kringle domains identified to date. Of these, apo(a) kringle V shows significant sequence homology with plasminogen kringle 5, which is reported to be a potent angiogenesis inhibitor. To determine the effects of apo(a) kringle V on angiogenesis, it was expressed as a soluble protein (termed rhLK8) in Pichia pastoris and its in vitro and in vivo anti-angiogenic properties were examined. rhLK8 inhibited the migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. This function was associated with the down-regulation of the activation of focal adhesion kinase and the inhibition of the consequent formation of actin stress fibers/focal adhesions. rhLK8 also inhibited new capillary formation in vivo, as assessed by the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay and the Matrigel plug assay. These results indicate that rhLK8 may be an effective angiogenesis inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo.
