Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-polarity, single-stranded RNA virus, distantly related to the pestivirus and flavivirus genera. These viruses replicate through the formation of a minus-strand RNA intermediate, which encodes the positive-strand genome, which is subsequently encapsidated, enveloped, and released from infected cells. Minus-strand RNA is not found in the mature, circulating virions of flaviviruses. In an attempt to study the relative amounts of viral plus and minus strand in the liver and serum of HCV-infected individuals, we have developed a technique to amplify specifically each of the viral strands using a modified reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction protocol on extracted RNA. Liver tumor and nontumor tissue from a patient with C-100-3 antibody was analyzed using this technique. In both cases, viral plus and minus strands were detected, although the plus-strand signal was several fold stronger than minus-strand signal by Southern hybridization. Sera from 11 C-100-3 antibody-positive patients with abnormal serum AIT levels were similarly analyzed. In all cases viral plus strand was detected, and in 10 of 11 cases viral minus strand was detected. The minus-strand signal was always much weaker than the plus-strand signal and the ratio of plus strand to minus strand varied among patients. No correlation was found between the level of minus strand detected or its ratio to plus strand with the level of serum transaminases or any other clinical parameter.
