Peptide-specific IgG from a rabbit immunized with an alanine-lysine-proline-arginine ((ALA1)-tuftsin) containing 14-mer "ferritin" peptide neutralized rat liver ferritin inhibition of in vitro CSF-1-dependent monocytopoiesis. Antiferritin IgG similarly neutralized the inhibitory effect of ferritin but did not neutralize peptide inhibition of the in vitro myelopoietic response. No cross-reactivity between the respective antibodies and Ag was detected either by Western immunoblot or by competitive ELISA. Depletion of adherent cells before marrow cell culture significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of ferritin but did not influence peptide inhibition of CSF-1-stimulated colony formation. Adherent marrow cells and P388D1 cells treated with both CSF-1 and ferritin, but not either alone, produced inhibitory supernatant culture media that were neutralized by antipeptide but not antiferritin IgG. High resolution molecular sieve chromatography of the inhibitory adherent marrow cell and P388D1 supernatants resolved two peaks of 50 to 60 kDa and approximately 30 kDa in each. The inhibitory activity in all four peaks was neutralized by antipeptide but not antiferritin IgG. The ferritin/CSF inhibitors were not further characterized although identity with IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, transforming growth factor-beta, and IFN-alpha/beta could be eliminated. The results indicate that ferritin inhibition of CSF-1-dependent monocytopoiesis is mediated by an endogenously produced inhibitor, or inhibitors, that shares antigenic similarity with the (ALA1)-tuftsin-containing 14-mer peptide and that adherent marrow cells, most likely monocytes or macrophages, produce the endogenous inhibitors in response to both CSF-1 and ferritin.
