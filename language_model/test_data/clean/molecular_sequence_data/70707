We examined the cellular and subcellular distribution of the cloned kappa opioid receptor (KOR1) and its trafficking to the presynaptic plasma membrane in vasopressin magnocellular neurosecretory neurons. We used immunohistochemistry to show that KOR1 immunoreactivity (IR) colocalized with vasopressin-containing cell bodies, axons, and axon terminals within the posterior pituitary. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that a major fraction of KOR1-IR was associated with the membrane of peptide-containing large secretory vesicles. KOR1-IR was rarely associated with the plasma membrane in unstimulated nerve terminals within the posterior pituitary. A physiological stimulus (salt-loading) that elicits vasopressin release also caused KOR1-IR to translocate from these vesicles to the plasma membrane. After stimulation, there was a significant decrease in KOR1-IR associated with peptide-containing vesicles and a significant increase in KOR1-IR associated with the plasma membrane. This stimulus-dependent translocation of receptors to the presynaptic plasma membrane provides a novel mechanism for regulation of transmitter release.
