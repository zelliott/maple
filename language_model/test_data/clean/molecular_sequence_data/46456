Biosynthesis of ecdysteroids, the insect steroid hormones controlling gene expression during molting and metamorphosis, takes place primarily in the prothoracic gland (PG). The activity of the PG is regulated by various neuropeptides. In the silkworm Bombyx mori, these neuropeptides utilize both hormonal and neuronal pathways to regulate the activity of the PG, making the insect an excellent model system to investigate the complex signaling network controlling ecdysteroid biosynthesis. Here we report another group of neuropeptides, orcokinins, as neuronal prothoracicotropic factors. Using direct mass spectrometric profiling of the axons associated with the PG, we detected several peptide peaks which correspond to orcokinin gene products in addition to the previously described Bommo-FMRFamides (BRFas). In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed that orcokinins are produced in the prominent neurosecretory cells in the ventral ganglia, as well as in numerous small neurons throughout the central nervous system and in midgut endocrine cells. One of the two pairs of BRFa-expressing neurosecretory cells in the prothoracic ganglion coexpresses orcokinin, and these neurons project axons through the transverse nerve and terminate on the surface of the PG. Using an in vitro PG bioassay, we show that orcokinins have a clear prothoracicotropic activity and are able to cancel the static effect of BRFas on ecdysteroid biosynthesis, whereas the suppressive effect of BRFas on cAMP production remained unchanged in the presence of orcokinins. The discovery of a second regulator of PG activity in these neurons further illustrates the potential importance of the PG innervation in the regulation of insect development.
