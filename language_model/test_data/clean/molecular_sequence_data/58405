A 21808 bp nucleotide sequence at 75 degrees on the genetic map of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome was determined. The sequence of this region is adjacent to the glpPFKD operon involved in glycerol utilization. Twenty-six ORFs were identified, one of which corresponds to the cspB gene, encoding a cold-shock protein. Seventeen of the deduced protein sequences of these ORFs displayed significant homology to known proteins in the data banks. One putative operon was identified, consisting of five ORFs, that is probably involved in the uptake and processing of copper. The location of cspB in this sequence does not confirm the genetic mapping data, indicating that the gene is closely linked to comK, which is located at 80 degrees on the B. subtilis chromosome.
