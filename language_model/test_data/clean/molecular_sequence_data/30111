Asparagine-linked sugar chains of sphingolipid activator protein 1 (SAP-1) purified from normal human liver and GM1 gangliosidosis (type 1) liver were comparatively investigated. Oligosaccharides released from the two SAP-1 samples by hydrazinolysis were fractionated by paper electrophoresis and by Aleuria aurantia lectin-Sepharose and Bio-Gel P-4 (under 400 mesh) column chromatography. Structures of oligosaccharides in each fraction were estimated from data on their effective molecular sizes, behavior on immobilized lectin columns with different carbohydrate-binding specificities, results of sequential digestion by exoglycosidases with different aglycon specificities, and methylation analysis. Sugar chains of SAP-1 purified from normal human liver and from GM1 gangliosidosis (type 1) liver were different from each other, although both of them were derived from complex-type sugar chains. The sugar chains of the former were the following eight degradation products from complex-type sugar chains by exoglycosidases in lysosomes: Man alpha 1----6(Man alpha 1----3)Man beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----4GlcNAcOT, Man alpha 1----6(Man alpha 1----3)Man beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----4(Fuc alpha 1----6)GlcNAcOT, Man alpha 1----6Man beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----4GlcNAcOT, Man alpha 1----6Man beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----4(Fuc alpha 1----6)GlcNAcOT, Man beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----4GlcNAcOT, Man beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----4(Fuc alpha 1----6)GlcNAcOT, GlcNAc beta 1----4GlcNAcOT, and GlcNAcOT. In contrast to these, the sugar chains of the latter were sialylated and nonsialylated mono- to tetraantennary complex-type sugar chains that were not fully degraded due to a metabolic defect in acid beta-galactosidase activity.
