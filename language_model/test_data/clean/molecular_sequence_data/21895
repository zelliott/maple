Two aerobic bacterial strains, designated SP1PR4(T) and SP1PR5, were isolated from tundra soil samples collected from Saana fjeld, North-western Finland (69° 03' N 20° 50' E). Cells of both strains were Gram-negative, non-motile rods. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the strains belong to the genus Terriglobus in subdivision 1 of the phylum Acidobacteria. Strains SP1PR4(T) and SP1PR5 shared identical BOX and ERIC fingerprints and 99.7 % 16S rRNA gene similarity indicating that, together with their identical physiological features, these strains are members of the same species. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of SP1PR4(T) and SP1PR5 with Terriglobus roseus DSM 18391(T) was 97.1 %. A low DNA-DNA hybridization value (<20 %) and rpoB gene sequence similarity (83.6 %) with T. roseus DSM 18391(T) indicated that the tundra soil isolates represent novel members of the genus Terriglobus. Strains SP1PR4(T) and SP1PR5 grew at pH 4.5-7.5 and 4-30 °C. Sugars were the preferred growth substrates. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0), C(16 : 1)ω7c, iso-C(13 : 0) and C(16 : 0). The DNA G+C content of strain SP1PR4(T) was 57.3 mol%. Based on phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and physiological analyses, the name Terriglobus saanensis sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate the two strains; the type strain is SP1PR4(T) ( = DSM 23119(T)  = ATCC BAA-1853(T)).
