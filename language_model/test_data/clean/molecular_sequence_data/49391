A novel approach to isolation and functional characterization of the Hansenula polymorpha genes basing on the use of two strains of different origin is described. One of these strains is better suited for the isolation of genomic DNA fragments, while the other is preferable for their functional analysis. Thirty three genomic sequences governing expression of a reporter protein have been isolated. Analysis of the sequence encoding a homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cofilin revealed two introns. Another isolated DNA fragment encoded a homolog of the S. cerevisiae V ps10p. Disruption of the corresponding gene resulted in secretion of a vacuolar protein, carboxypeptidase Y, into the culture medium.
