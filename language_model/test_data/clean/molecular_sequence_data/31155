MDG is a very important component of the Drosophila genome. MDG have many sites of localisation in chromosomes and can change their localisation. Perhaps the process of MDG integration has some specificity. To study this problem we sequenced the flanking region of MDG1 DNA. The analysis of this sequences reveals the following features. 1. The 5'-flanking sequences contain 7 TATA-boxex, 5 of which form a cluster. 2. The 3'-flanking sequences contain TTTAAA block which is similar to TATA-box for alpha- and gamma-casein genes of mammals. 3. The flanking region are rich in repeated sequences, the longest of which TCCTCCT (R) and TTCTTC (R2) are on the 5'-flank and on the 3'-flank respectively, so that the whole structure is: 5'-R1NNR1-MDG1-R2NNR2-3', where N is some nucleotide. 5'-flanking sequences are AT-rich, while the 3'-flank contains 10 consecutive thymidines 4 nucleotides apart from MDG1. The MDG1 and MDG "17.6" share several common repeats in the flanking sequences, the longest of which TACTTACAT is 63 bases upstream MDG1 and 11 bases upstream MDG "17.6". This sequence differs strongly from the consensus enhancer sequence.
