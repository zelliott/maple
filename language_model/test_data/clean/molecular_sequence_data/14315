Botrytis cinerea has been described as a species complex containing two cryptic species, referred to as groups I and II. The first B. cinerea group I strains outside of Western Europe were collected in Hungary in 2008 from strawberry and rape plants. Sympatric B. cinerea cryptic species were analyzed using a population genetic approach and phenotypic markers. Statistically significant, but moderate population differentiation was found between the two groups in Hungary. Group I was originally typified by the lack of the transposable elements Boty and Flipper. However, all the Hungarian group I isolates carried the Boty element and one isolate additionally contained Flipper, indicating a much wider genetic variation than previously believed. Vegetative compatibility analyses showed that twelve of the thirteen B. cinerea group I isolates studied belonged to a unique vegetative compatibility group (VCG), but VCGs overlapped between groups. Phenotypic markers such as fenhexamid resistance or asexual spore size were found unsuitable to differentiate between the cryptic species. The results did not confirm the complete separation of the two cryptic species, previously determined with genealogical concordance of the phylogenetic species recognition using multiple gene sequences, and suggest instead the possibility of information exchange between them.
