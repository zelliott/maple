Tumor biopsies from exophytic and flat condylomas at different locations on the genital epithelium (10 cases) and in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grades 1-2 (6 cases) were analysed for HPV types 6 and 11 DNA and RNA. The presence of mRNA species which could encode the E6, E7, E1M, E2, E2C, E4, E5 and L1 proteins was determined using the RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique with primers that flank previously mapped or predicted splice sites. The state of the viral DNA in the tumor biopsies was established by Southern blot analysis. We could detect the various mRNA species in biopsies from condylomas associated with both HPV types. The size of the RNA PCR products were in agreement with the previously mapped splice sites of mRNAs recovered from an experimental condyloma induced by HPV11. The major viral transcript encoding the E1i--E4 protein was detected in all the tumor biopsies. From the rare transcripts the rate of detection of mRNA species encoding the E1M, E2C proteins was the highest. In 2 of 6 CIN biopsies analysed only the major viral transcript was detected. The overall results of this study suggest that early gene products of HPV types 6 and 11 may be important in the induction of cellular proliferation and condylamatous differentiation but these possibly may not be required for the development of the HPV-associated cervical neoplasia.
