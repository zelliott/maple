A protein II (P.II) gene from Neisseria gonorrhoeae was cloned in Escherichia coli and characterized by DNA sequence analysis. As with other reported P.II sequences, this gene contains an ATG initiation codon which is out of frame with respect to the remainder of the P.II amino acid sequence. A translational fusion was constructed in E. coli which linked the P.II sequence to the signal peptide of beta-lactamase. This P.II fusion differs from the gonococcal protein only in the first seven residues at the N terminus. In E. coli, the P.II fusion product exhibits properties analogous to those of P.II in N. gonorrhoeae. The P.II fusion product is a major component of the E. coli outer membrane and it is exposed on the cell surface. The P.II fusion protein also exhibits the heat-modifiable phenotype of gonococcal P.II.
