Nuclear extracts from different mouse tissues have been used to study the interaction of factors with the steroid-inducible promoter of mouse mammary tumor virus. In addition to the glucocorticoid receptor that interacts with the distal region of the promoter, several tissue-specific proteins were found to bind to the 5' flanking region of the receptor-binding site and to the basal promoter region. The differences in the pattern of protection observed suggest that tissue-specific factors might co-operate with steroid receptors and result in a cell-type-dependent modulation of hormone action.
