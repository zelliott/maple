The zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) has a large Z chromosome and highly condensed W chromosome. We used the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to isolate female-specific sequences ZBM1 and ZBM2. Southern blot hybridization to male and female zebra finch genomic DNA suggested that these sequences were located on the W chromosome, although homologous sequences appeared to be autosomal or Z-linked. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones corresponding to ZBM sequences showed hybridization to the whole W chromosome, suggesting that the BACs encode sequences that are repeated across the entire W chromosome. Based on the sequencing of a ZBM repetitive sequence and Z chromosome derived BAC clones, we demonstrate a random distribution of repeat sequences that are specific to the W chromosome or encoded by both Z and W. The positions of ZW-common repeat sequences mapped to a noncoding region of a Z chromosome BAC clone containing the CHD1Z gene. The apparent lineage-specificity of W chromosome repeat sequences in passerines and galliform birds suggest that the W chromosome had not differentiated well from the Z at the time of divergence of these lineages.
