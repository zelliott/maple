Resveratrol synthase (RS), a key enzyme in biosynthesis of stilbene-type phytoalexins, catalyzes the formation of resveratrol from coumaroyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. Two cDNA clones, pGSC1 and pGSC2, have been isolated from cDNA libraries established with poly(A)-rich RNA from peanut (Arachis hypogaea) cell cultures specifically induced for RS. These cDNAs were used to identify two genomic clones (pGSG10 and pGSG11). Sequence analysis shows that the two clones overlap in a large stretch of nearly identical sequences, and that pGSG10 contains the 5' and pGSG11 the 3' end of RS genes. The sequences reveal a single intron, and the size of the predicted protein is 42.7 kDa, in close agreement with that observed in polyacrylamide gels (43 kDa). Chalcone synthase (CHS), a key enzyme of flavonoid biosynthesis, utilizes the same substrates as RS, but the product is different (naringenin chalcone). Comparison of RS with CHS consensus sequences shows that the two genes are related. Homology extends throughout the coding region, and the intron in RS is at the same position as a conserved intron in CHS. However, RS reveals a substantial number of amino acid differences to CHS in positions highly conserved in all CHS enzymes. It is proposed that the two proteins possess a common scaffold necessary for binding of the substrates and the type of enzyme reaction, and that the differences are responsible for the formation of different products.
