We have constructed a "shot-gun" type ribozyme-trimming system. By concatenating several units, each consisting of a trans-acting ribozyme (targeted to HIV-RNA) and cis-acting ribozymes (trimming 5'- and 3'-ends of the trans-acting ribozyme), several kinds of trans-acting ribozymes can be liberated upon transcription and self-cleavage. Since each liberated HIV-RNA-targeted ribozymes can work independently, they can simultaneously cleave HIV-RNA at several different sites. Ribozymes were targeted at relatively conserved GUC-containing sites at LTR, gag and tat regions.
