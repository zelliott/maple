The genes for three small ribonucleases from different strains of Streptomyces aureofaciens have been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purification of these ribonucleases from the periplasmic space is described. The yields range from 10 to 50 mg of protein per liter of culture medium. The molar absorption coefficients, isoelectric pH values, and pH of optimum activity are reported.
