To clone a new gene related to human spermatogenesis.

cDNA probes of embryo and adult testis were used to hybridize the cDNA microarray of adult testis, and the clones of differential hybridization were sequenced and analyzed.

A novel isoform of calpastatin exclusively and highly expressed in human adult testis was found.

A novel isoform of calpastatin expresses in human testis and it is related to spermatogenesis.
