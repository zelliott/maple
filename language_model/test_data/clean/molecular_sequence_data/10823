Despite recent advances in antiviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, successful global intervention will require an effective vaccine. Expanding evidence suggests that cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses will be an important component of such a vaccine. The varying geographic distribution of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) clades, with the relative absence of clade B HIV-1 outside the developed world, is considered a major obstacle to the development of a single efficacious vaccine. An understanding of cross-reactive CTL responses between different HIV-1 clades is crucial in the design of a vaccine which will be broadly immunogenic. In this study, we examined the ability of HIV-1 Gag-, reverse transcriptase-, and Env-specific CTL clones isolated from individuals infected in the United States to recognize non-B clade viral sequences and found that all were cross-reactive with the majority of non-B clade viral sequences tested. We next studied HIV-1-specific CTL responses in African individuals infected with clade A, C, or G virus and evaluated cross-recognition of clade B virus. Of 14 persons evaluated, all demonstrated cross-reactivity with the U.S. clade B viral constructs. We conclude that significant CTL cross-reactivity exists between clade B and non-B epitopes, suggesting that CTL cross-recognition among HIV-1 clades is more widespread than anticipated and that a vaccine based on a single clade may be broadly applicable.
