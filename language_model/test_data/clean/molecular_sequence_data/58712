The gene for 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase (aroA) cloned from Campylobacter jejuni (Cj) strain 81116 was identified by complementation of an Escherichia coli (Ec) auxotrophic aroA mutant. The Cj aroA gene has been sequenced. It encodes an enzyme of 428 amino acids (aa), that is homologous to other bacterial EPSP synthases, especially that of Bacillus subtilis with which it has a 39% aa identity. The transcriptional start point was mapped. It is present in an upstream open reading frame (ORF) that has a strong homology to the gene encoding phenylalanine tRNA synthetase (pheS). Downstream from aroA another ORF is present which is homologous to the lytB gene of Ec. The stop codon of the aroA gene overlaps the start codon of lytB.
