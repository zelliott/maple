Blood sera, originating four regions of Russia and Byelorussia and previously tested for the content of antibodies to HIV-1 proteins, were studied in the enzyme immunoassay on the basis of recombinant sequences gp160, as well as on the basis of oligopeptides corresponding to sequences V3 of six HIV-1 strains. The possibility of using sequences gp160, contained in fusion polypeptides synthesized in Escherichia coli cells, for the detection of antibodies in laboratory research was shown. Differences in the reactivity of the sera under study with respect to fragments gp160 correlated with the geographical origin of these sera: similarity between the serum samples from Elista and Rostov and their difference from serum samples collected in other regions were shown.
