Porcine kobuvirus, an emerging virus, may be the underlying etiological cause of a large-scale outbreak of diarrhea in suckling piglets in China that started in 2010. We report the complete genome sequence of the porcine kobuvirus variant CH/HNXX-4/2012 with a 30-amino-acid deletion in its 2B-coding region that was isolated in this outbreak. This will help the phenotypic variation and evolutionary characteristics of porcine kobuvirus to be understood.
