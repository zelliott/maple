YopQ in Yersinia enterocolitica (YopK in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis) is a type III secreted protein required for virulence of yersiniae. In this study YopQ expression, secretion and nucleotide sequences of the corresponding yopQ gene from different yersinia strains were analysed. The cytosolic accumulation differed significantly among serotypes of Y. enterocolitica. These differences might be attributable to variations in the nucleotide sequence and their consequences on mRNA secondary structure. An mRNA signal hypothesis has been proposed for YopQ, predicting the coupling of translation and secretion via an mRNA signal. This hypothesis claims a strictly co-translational secretion of YopQ without its intracellular accumulation. The presence of YopQ in the cytosol, even with a closed secretion apparatus, is demonstrated. Moreover, post-translational secretion of YopQ could be demonstrated. These findings do not support the mRNA signal hypothesis for co-translational secretion.
