We have previously demonstrated that the onset of TCR alpha gene rearrangement is mainly restricted to the J alpha50 gene in fetal day 1delta thymocyte hybridomas. Now, J alpha50 rearrangements from fetal thymocyte hybridomas and from day 15.5 fetal thymus have been isolated and sequenced. We demonstrate that J alpha50 is rearranged to the rearranged Vdelta1 Ddelta2 gene segment. This indicates that the TCR alpha rearrangement process is initiated in fetal thymocytes far earlier than previously thought. These thymocytes have their delta genes still accessible for rearrangement and therefore, are controlled by the TCR delta enhancer (Edelta) (and/or another TCR delta specific cis-acting element). Our results further suggest that both Edelta and the TCR alpha enhancer (Ealpha) are active at the onset of alpha rearrangements or alternatively, the initial activation of the J alpha locus is controlled by Edelta. In addition, Vdelta1 Ddelta2 J alpha50 gene segments are replaced by secondary alpha rearrangements, indicating that thymocytes with the early alpha rearrangement are committed to the alphabeta lineage.
