To investigate the genetic basis of differing thermotolerance in the closely related species Drosophila virilis and Drosophila lummei, which replace one another along a latitudinal cline, we characterized the hsp70 gene cluster in multiple strains of both species. In both species, all hsp70 copies cluster in a single chromosomal locus, 29C1, and each cluster includes two hsp70 genes arranged as an inverted pair, the ancestral condition. The total number of hsp70 copies is maximally seven in the more thermotolerant D. virilis and five in the less tolerant D. lummei, with some strains of each species exhibiting lower copy numbers. Thus, maximum hsp70 copy number corresponds to hsp70 mRNA and Hsp70 protein levels reported previously and the size of heat-induced puffs at 29C1. The nucleotide sequence and spacing of the hsp70 copies are consistent with tandem duplication of the hsp70 genes in a common ancestor of D. virilis and D. lummei followed by loss of hsp70 genes in D. lummei. These and other data for hsp70 in Drosophila suggest that evolutionary adaptation has repeatedly modified hsp70 copy number by several different genetic mechanisms.
