Elevation in the rate of glucose transport in polyoma virus-infected mouse fibroblasts was dependent upon phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase; EC 2.7.1.137) binding to complexes of middle tumor antigen (middle T) and pp60c-src. Wild-type polyoma virus infection led to a 3-fold increase in the rate of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake, whereas a weakly transforming polyoma virus mutant that encodes a middle T capable of activating pp60c-src but unable to promote binding of PI 3-kinase induced little or no change in the rate of 2DG transport. Another transformation-defective mutant encoding a middle T that retains functional binding of both pp60c-src and PI 3-kinase but is incapable of binding Shc (a protein involved in activation of Ras) induced 2DG transport to wild-type levels. Wortmannin (< or = 100 nM), a known inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, blocked elevation of glucose transport in wild-type virus-infected cells. In contrast to serum stimulation, which led to increased levels of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) RNA and protein, wild-type virus infection induced no significant change in levels of either GLUT1 RNA or protein. Nevertheless, virus-infected cells did show increases in GLUT1 protein in plasma membranes. These results point to a posttranslational mechanism in the elevation of glucose transport by polyoma virus middle T involving activation of PI 3-kinase and translocation of GLUT1.
