Crotamine is a small basic myotoxin peptide of Crotalus durissus venom, with beta-defensin scafold and variable concentration in individual venoms. The crotamine gene was mapped to the end of chromosome 2 and the signal intensity differed significantly between the two homologues. In contrast to crotamine, the paralogous crotasin gene is scarcely expressed in the venom glands. In this study, we analyzed the crotamine concentrations in the venoms of a total of 23 rattlesnakes from diverse Brazilian localities by ELISA as well as the copy number of both crotamine and crotasin genes by real-time PCR. Crotamine was found to constitute 5-29% of venom proteins varying greatly among individual animals. The crotamine gene exists from 1 to 32 copies per haploid genome, whereas the crotasin gene is present from 1 to 7 copies. Furthermore, we observed that the crotamine concentration and crotamine gene copy number are positively correlated (r(2)=0.68), implying the variation of crotamine in venom results from the variation of the gene copy number. Sequencing of 50 independent copies of crotamine and crotasin genes from four different rattlesnakes revealed the presence of six crotasin isoforms with a single amino acid difference from the original crotasin sequence, whereas only two additional crotamine isoforms were observed. Taken together, our results suggested that after duplication from a common ancestor gene, crotamine and crotasin may have diverged in such a way that the crotamine gene underwent repetitive duplication to increase its copy number, whereas the crotasin gene diversified its sequence.
