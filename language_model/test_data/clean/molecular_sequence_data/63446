Acyl-CoA oxidases (in peroxisomes) and acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (in mitochondria) catalyse the first step in fatty acid beta-oxidation, the pathway responsible for lipid catabolism and plant hormone biosynthesis. The interplay and differences between peroxisomal and mitochondrial beta-oxidation processes are highlighted by the variation in the enzymes involved. Structure and sequence comparisons are made with a focus on the enzyme's mechanistic means to control electron transfer paths, reactivity towards molecular oxygen, and spatial and architectural requirements for substrate discrimination.
