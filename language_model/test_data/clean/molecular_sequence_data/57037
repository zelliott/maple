We have isolated and mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization 80 new cosmids on the short arm of chromosome 3. These markers were isolated from a radiation-reduced hybrid, DM1, made from a cell line that was monochromosomal for human chromosome 3. Selected cosmids were used in double-label cohybridization experiments in which polymerase chain reaction products, generated by an Alu oligonucleotide primer from genomic DNA, were used for chromosome banding. Fifty-six of the cosmid probes map between 3p14.3 and 3p22 while 24 other probes cluster around bands 3p23-3p25. Three probes that appeared to map close to the chromosome 3 region bearing a t(3,8)p14.2; q24.1 translocation associated with renal cell carcinoma were analyzed by interphase mapping techniques and hybridized to metaphase spreads from the translocation cell line. These 80 probes will be useful in the elucidation of genetic alterations associated with diseases such as small cell lung carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and von Hippel-Lindau disease.
