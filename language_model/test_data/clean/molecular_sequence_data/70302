Immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes are assembled during lymphocyte development by a novel, highly regulated series of gene rearrangement reactions known as V(D)J recombination. All rearranging loci are flanked by conserved heptamer-nonamer recombination signal sequences. Gene rearrangement results in the imprecise fusion of coding sequences and the precise fusion of signal sequences. DNA molecules with double-stranded breaks near signal sequences have been detected in cells undergoing V(D)J recombination of the TCR delta locus. We have devised a ligation-mediated PCR assay that detects broken-ended molecules in purified genomic DNA. Using this assay we found that DNA breaks occurring precisely at the signal sequence-coding sequence junction are a general feature of V(D)J recombination, appearing in association with each type of rearranging immunoglobulin gene segment. We show that a significant fraction of these broken ends are blunt and 5'-phosphorylated. In addition, detection of these broken-ended signal sequences is dependent on the activity of RAG-1 and RAG-2, and is restricted to the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. The pattern of broken-ended molecules detected in cells at various stages of development reflects the activity of the V(D)J recombinase at different loci during B- and T-cell development.
