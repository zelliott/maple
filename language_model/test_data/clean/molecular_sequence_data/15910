The interaction of 4'-N(2-aminoethyl)aminomethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen-modified oligonucleoside methylphosphonates with synthetic ds-DNA containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter was studied. The oligomers effectively crosslinked with either coding or noncoding ss-DNA when irradiated at 365 nm, but not with ds-DNA. The extent of the crosslinking reaction, which was complete within 16 min: (a) reached its maximum at an oligomer concentration of 3 microM; (b) remained constant below the Tm of the duplex and then rapidly decreased; and (c) appeared to depend upon the sequence surrounding the psoralen crosslinking site. An oligomer crosslinked to the template strand inhibited transcription by T7 RNA polymerase whereas an oligomer crosslinked to the non-template strand had only a small inhibitory effect. Oligomers did not crosslink to ds-DNA undergoing transcription nor did they inhibit the transcription reaction.
