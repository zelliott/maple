The epoxide hydrolases and haloalkane dehalogenases database (EH/HD) integrates sequence and structure of a highly diverse protein family, including mainly the Asp-hydrolases of EHs and HDs but also proteins, such as Ser-hydrolases non-heme peroxidases, prolyl iminopetidases and 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolases. These proteins have a highly conserved structure, but display a remarkable diversity in sequence and function. A total of 305 protein entries were assigned to 14 homologous families, forming two superfamilies. Annotated multisequence alignments and phylogenetic trees are provided for each homologous family and superfamily. Experimentally derived structures of 19 proteins are superposed and consistently annotated. Sequence and structure of all 305 proteins were systematically analysed. Thus, deeper insight is gained into the role of a highly conserved sequence motifs and structural elements.
