HSP47 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident molecular chaperone involved in collagen production. This study examined the stress-induced pattern of hsp47 gene expression in Xenopus cultured cells and embryos. Sequence analysis revealed that protein encoded by the hsp47 cDNA exhibited 70-77% identity with fish, avian and mammalian HSP47. In A6 kidney epithelial cells hsp47 mRNA and HSP47 were present constitutively and inducible by heat shock but not ER stressors including tunicamycin and A23187, both of which enhanced BiP mRNA. Furthermore A23187 treatment inhibited constitutive accumulation of hsp47 mRNA and retarded heat-induced accumulation of hsp47 and hsp70 mRNA. Interestingly, hsp47 gene expression but not hsp70 or BiP mRNA accumulation was enhanced by treatment with a procollagen-specific stressor, beta-aminopropionitrile. In Xenopus embryos hsp47 mRNA was present constitutively throughout development. In tailbud embryos hsp47 mRNA was enriched in tissues associated with collagen production including notochord, somites and head region. Heat shock-induced accumulation of hsp47 mRNA was enhanced primarily in embryonic tissues already exhibiting hsp47 mRNA accumulation. These studies suggest that the pattern of Xenopus hsp47 gene expression is similar to hsp70 in response to heat shock but also displays unique features including a response to a procollagen-specific stressor and preferential expression in collagen-containing tissues.
