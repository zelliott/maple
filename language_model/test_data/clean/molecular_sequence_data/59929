A neurotoxic peptide, huwentoxin-II (HWTX-II), was purified from the venom of the Chinese bird spider Selenocosmia huwena by ion exchange chromatography and reversed phase HPLC. The toxin can reversibly paralyse cockroaches for several hours, with an ED50 of 127 +/- 54 microg/g. HWTX-II blocks neuromuscular transmission in an isolated mouse phrenic nerve diaphragm preparation and acts cooperatively to potentiate the activity of huwentoxin-I. The complete amino sequence of HWTX-II was determined and found to consist of 37 amino acid residues, including six Cys residues. There is microheterogeneity (Ile/Gln) in position 10, and mass spectrometry indicated that the two isoproteins have a tendency to dimerize. It was determined by mass spectrometry that the six Cys residues are involved in three disulphide bonds. The sequence of HWTX-II is highly homologous with ESTX, a toxin from the tarantula Eurypefina californicum.
