Differences in gene expression in prostate cells are believed to be secondary to epithelial-stromal interactions. We theorized that bone matrix may provide a fertile "soil" for prostate cancer by inducing androgen-dependent genes and allowing for androgen-independent growth.

Human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) were grown under different conditions and analyzed for differential expression of mRNA. LNCaP cells were grown in the presence of 10 nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT), on extracellular matrix (ECM) derived from bone cells (without exogenous DHT), and on plastic culture dishes without exogenous DHT. A differential display of mRNA produced by LNCaP cells grown in the above conditions was then analyzed.

Multiple unique transcripts were present in cells that were grown in the presence of DHT and on bone ECM (without exogenous DHT), but not on plastic culture dishes without exogenous DHT. Nine of these transcripts were then cloned and analyzed. Many (5/9) of these transcripts were found to contain multiple ATTA motifs in their corresponding 3'-untranslated regions. ATTA motifs have been shown to be homeobox protein-binding sites. Homeobox proteins and their target genes are thought to regulate cellular differentiation. Consistent with this, we demonstrated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that homeobox genes were differentially expressed in LNCaP cells when the cells were grown in the presence of DHT and on bone ECM (without exogenous DHT), but not on plastic culture dishes without exogenous DHT. Furthermore, we assayed LNCaP/fetal fibroblast chimeric tumors (n = 8) that were grown in male nude mice. Some of these tumors continued to grow in these mice despite treatment with surgical castration. In blinded studies, we were able to determine which tumor samples were androgen independent by their expression of homeobox genes. All samples that were androgen independent (n = 4) expressed the homeobox genes. Finally, gel retardation assay demonstrated that the homeobox proteins were able to bind to our cloned DNA sequences. Furthermore, footprinting analysis showed that the homeobox proteins bound to the ATTA motif in the 3'-region of our target DNA.

Bone ECM, in the absence of DHT, has the ability to regulate androgen-responsive genes. Furthermore, many of these genes contain homeobox binding sites and the expression of homeobox genes may itself be regulated by bone ECM. If so, this may partially explain the clinical observation that bone provides a fertile "soil" for prostate cancer growth and metastasis.
