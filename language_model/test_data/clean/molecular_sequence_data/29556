The taxa Rhynchopus Skuja and Diplonema Griessmann were first described as remarkable protists with euglenid affinities. Later on, the placement of Diplonema within the Euglenozoa was confirmed by molecular data. For this study two new sequences were added to the euglenozoan data set. The uncertainly placed Rhynchopus can be identified as a close relative to Diplonema by small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) analysis. The new sequence of Diplonema ambulator is in close relationship to two other Diplonema species. Our molecular analyses clearly support the monophyly of the diplonemids comprising Rhynchopus and Diplonema. Yet the topology at the base of the euglenozoan tree remains unresolved, and especially the monophyly of the euglenids is arguable. SSU rDNA sequence analyses suggest that significantly different GC contents, high mutational saturation in the euglenids, and different evolutionary rates in the euglenozoan clades make it difficult to identify any sister group to the diplonemids.
