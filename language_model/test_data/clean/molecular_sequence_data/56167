The genes coding for bacterioopsin, haloopsin, and sensory opsin I of a halobacterial isolate from the Red Sea called Halobacterium sp. strain SG1 have been cloned and sequenced. The deduced protein sequences were aligned to the previously known halobacterial retinal proteins. The addition of these new sequences lowered the number of conserved residues to only 23 amino acids, or 8% of the alignment. Data base searches with two highly conserved peptides as well as with an alignment profile yielded no significant similarity to any other protein, so the halobacterial retinal proteins should be regarded as a distinct protein family. The protein alignment was used to make predictions about the structure of the retinal proteins as well as about the amino acids in contact with retinal proteins. These results were in excellent agreement with the structural model of bacteriorhodopsin of Halobacterium halobium as well as with mutant studies, indicating that (i) structure predictions based on the sequences of a membrane protein family can be quite accurate; (ii) halorhodopsin and sensory rhodopsin I have tertiary structures similar to that of bacteriorhodopsin; (iii) conserved amino acids do not take part in reactions specific for one group of proteins, e.g., proton translocation for bacteriorhodopsins, but have a crucial role in determining the conformation and reactions of the chromophore; and (iv) the general mode of action (light-induced chromophore and protein movements) is the same for all halobacterial retinal proteins, ion pumps as well as sensors.
