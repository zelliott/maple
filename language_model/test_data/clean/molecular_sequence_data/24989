The risks of transmitting viral infection by blood and products derived from plasma have long been known and still remain an area of concern. Blood banks and transfusion centres are faced with the imminent introduction of nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) of plasma pools as used by the plasma industry. In this paper, we show a part of our results of a validation study of an in-house method for routine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening for hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in plasma pools and the results of testing 2,718 anti-HCV negative plasma pools for the presence of HCV RNA. The European Committee for Proprietary Medical Products (CPMP) recommended that from 1 July 1999, only batches derived from plasma pools tested and found non-reactive for HCV RNA, using validated test methods of suitable sensitivity and specificity, should be batch released by authorities. The quality and efficiency of NAT detection of HCV RNA is among others influenced by the efficacy of RNA isolation, the primer selection and the use of control samples. Using modern molecular biology techniques (sensitive and specific in-house amplification methods for detection of HCV RNA and automated sequencing), we analysed samples of plasma pools from different Croatian transfusion centres. By detection of HCV RNA in an NIBSC working reagent (genotype 3) and a Pelispy HCV RNA run control (genotype 1) we determined a high reproducibility and sensitivity (below 100 International Units (IU)/ml) for our in-house method. By direct sequencing PCR cDNAs we proved the specificity of the test system and the possibility of determining the HCV genotype when the method was used for PCR screening of HCV RNA in single donations. Of 2,718 anti-HCV negative plasma pools we have found that 2.1$ were HCV RNA positive. Results of our investigation confirm the necessity of testing HCV RNA in plasma pools to further increase the safety of human plasma-derived drugs.
