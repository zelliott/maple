We have recently established the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to the major food allergen, ovomucoid, as mAb 7D, recognizing the carbohydrate moiety of ovomucoid, and mAb 6H, the peptide moiety (Biosci. Biothechnol. Biochem., 68, 2490-2497, (2004)). Using these mAbs, we found commercially available ovalbumin preparations contaminated with a considerable amount of ovomucoid together with other glycoproteins. To examine the contaminants, egg white was subjected to cation-exchange chromatography. An unidentified protein was found in egg white that reacted with mAb 7D but not with mAb 6H, having a molecular size of about 52 kDa and a blocked N-terminus. Two internal amino acid sequences of the fragments obtained after a lysyl endopeptidase and a hydroxylamine treatment revealed the protein to be ovalbumin Y (ovalbumin-related gene Y protein). We conclude that ovalbumin Y is a unique chimeric glycoprotein having an amino acid sequence similar to that of ovalbumin, but having a carbohydrate moiety similar to that of ovomucoid.
