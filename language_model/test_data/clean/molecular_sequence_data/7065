Primary structures of several dolichol-coupled enzymes, mammal and yeast N-acetylglucosaminylphosphote transferases (GPT), yeast mannosyl transferase and dolicholphosphomannosyl transferase were compared. The enzymes presented take part in the synthesis of oligosaccharide precursor used for N-glycosylation of proteins in endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells. For GPT family equalization of amino acid sequences (AAS) was conducted and the profile of invariability of the primary structure was calculated. At the comparison of AAS in the enzymes outlined with the ones in carbohydrate-binding proteins homologous segments were identified and their possible role was discussed.
