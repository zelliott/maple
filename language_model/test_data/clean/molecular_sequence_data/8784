Inherited forms of prion disease have been linked to mutations in the gene encoding PrP, a neuronal and glial protein that is attached to the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. One familial form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is associated with a mutant PrP containing six additional octapeptide repeats. We report here our analysis of cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing a murine homologue of this mutant PrP. We find that, like wild-type PrP, the mutant protein is glycosylated, GPI-anchored, and expressed on the cell surface. Surprisingly, however, cleavage of the GPI anchor using phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C fails to release the mutant PrP from the surface of intact cells, suggesting that it has an additional mode of membrane attachment. The phospholipase-treated protein is hydrophobic, since it partitions into the detergent phase of Triton X-114 lysates; and it is tightly membrane-associated, since it is not extractable in carbonate buffer at pH 11.5. Whether membrane attachment of the mutant PrP involves integration of the polypeptide into the lipid bilayer, self-association, or binding to other membrane proteins remains to be determined. Our results suggest that alterations in the membrane association of PrP may be an important feature of prion diseases.
