Ten cases of hepatoblastoma were studied for overexpression of p53 protein by immunohistochemistry and for possible p53 gene mutation by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct DNA sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction products. Only one case of the macrotrabecular type at stage IV showed overexpression of p53 protein. No DNA mobility shift was found in any of these cases studied by SSCP analysis. DNA sequencing performed on the case showing overexpression of p53 protein revealed no mutation within exons 5 to 8. The associated adrenal cortical carcinoma of the same case also showed overexpression of p53 protein, but no mutation of the p53 gene. These results indicate that mutation of the p53 gene is infrequent in hepatoblastoma. This observation supports the view that mutation of the p53 gene is not as important in the oncogenesis of childhood neoplasms as in adult cancers.
