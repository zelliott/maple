The gene encoding the major replicative protein, NS1, of minute virus of mice (MVM) was transferred into a recombinant vaccinia virus vector in place of the vaccinia thymidine kinase gene. The NS1 gene was placed under control of a bacteriophage T7 promoter and expressed in cells coinfected with another recombinant vaccinia virus, vTF7-3, which encodes the T7 RNA polymerase. Expression of NS1 was further enhanced by the presence of a 5' untranslated region, derived from encephalomyocarditis virus, which allows efficient cap-independent translation. This system was used to produce and analyze wild-type NS1 and two mutant forms of the protein, NS1K405R and NS1K405M, in which the highly conserved lysine codon located in the putative purine triphosphate binding site of NS1 was changed to arginine and methionine, respectively. Full-length NS1 was expressed efficiently in both human and mouse cells infected with each of the three recombinant viruses, and in each case the NS1 was rapidly and efficiently translocated into the nucleus. Wild-type NS1 expressed in this way was biologically active. It was able to trans-activate an MVM P38 promoter located in a host chromosomal site, whereas the two mutant forms of NS1 showed no significant activity in this assay, and it was capable of resolving palindromic junction fragments cloned from multimeric MVM replicative form DNA molecules. These substrates, representing MVM genomic left-end:left-end and right-end:right-end fusions, were resolved in a DNA synthesis-dependent in vitro reaction supplemented with nuclear extracts containing recombinant wild-type NS1. Neither of the two mutant forms of the polypeptide had any detectable activity in this assay.
