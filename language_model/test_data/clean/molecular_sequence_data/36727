The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for detecting parvovirus B19 DNA in clinical specimens. A pair of oligonucleotide primers spanning the PstI-fragment of the B19 virus genome was used for PCR, and a PCR product of 727 bp was amplified. B19 virus DNA was detected in all sera (n = 26) of individuals in the incubation period and acute phase of infection. PCR was useful for detecting viral B19 DNA in amniotic fluid and fetal blood of hydropic fetuses, confirming fetal B19 virus infection.
