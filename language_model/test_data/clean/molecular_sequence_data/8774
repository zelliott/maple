The antioxidant response element (ARE) found in the 5'-flanking region of the rat quinone reductase gene has been further characterized by mutational and deletion analysis. The results indicate that the 31-base pair ARE, which contains a 13-base pair palindromic sequence, can be further separated into three regions, all three of which are required for elevated basal level gene expression. These three regions include the proximal and distal half-sites as well as a 3'-flanking region consisting of 4 adenine nucleotides. Neither the proximal nor the distal half-site alone mediates transcriptional activation by beta-naphthoflavone. However, when placed together the two half-sites restore responsiveness to the inducer. Interestingly, the presence of only 1 of the 4 adenine nucleotides in the 3'-flanking region of the proximal half-site is required for responsiveness to the inducer. Point mutations within the ARE indicate that several nucleotides in both the proximal and distal half-sites are required for basal level gene expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis using the ARE as the probe indicates that enhancers found in the glutathione S-transferase Ya and P genes recognize a similar trans-acting factor(s) found in crude nuclear extracts from human Hep G2 cells. Further, this complex can be detected in nuclear extracts from rat liver and rat hepatoma cells but not in mouse Hepa 1c1c7 cells or in human HeLa cells. The ARE-nucleoprotein complex can also be detected in F9 cells which lack significant levels of Jun/Fos proteins. Although the rat ARE resembles the human quinone reductase ARE which contains a consensus TRE, the 2-nucleotide change in the core sequence (TGACTCA versus TGACTTG) eliminates the high affinity TRE motif in the rat ARE. The rat ARE forms a nucleoprotein complex in Hep G2 and other cells with different properties than AP-1.
