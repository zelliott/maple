A study of 250 specimens of human myocardium by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed an allelic variant of isoform MLC1-V/sB, which was identified by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody against MLC1-V/sB and peptide mapping after in situ tryptic digestion of electroblotted proteins. The substitution Asn-144 for His-144 was found in this new allelic variant of MLC1-V/sB.
