The genus Calathus Bonelli comprises 24 species on the Canary Islands. Sequences of 927 and 687 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and II genes, respectively, as well as the intervening tRNA leu gene in 21 of the 24 species, have identified three genetically divergent and unequivocally monophyletic groupings. A phylogeographic analysis is presented for the major monophyletic group comprising all the species of Gran Canaria, La Gomera, and El Hierro, and two Tenerifean species. A distance-based phylogenetic analysis and maximum parsimony analysis have clearly shown that this clade is composed of four distinct lineages. DNA sequence data suggest a recent origin for this clade and that lineages have not evolved at the same rate. Compared with diversification patterns observed in other Coleoptera on the Canary Islands, diversification has been recent relative to the time of colonization within the islands of Gran Canaria and La Gomera. Calathus diversification on La Gomera has been greater than on Gran Canaria. The influences of geological and ecological history are discussed in relation to Calathus diversification.
