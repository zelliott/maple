Semaphorins constitute a large and growing gene family, several members of which are axon guidance molecules. We report the characterization of sema4g, a novel class IV member of the semaphorin gene family, located on mouse chromosome 19. sema4g is expressed early in development in the brain, spinal cord, and several sensory organs as well as specific populations of projection neurons, compatible with the well-established function of semaphorins as axon guidance molecules.
