Substrate sequence requirements of the hairpin ribozyme have been partially defined by both mutational and in vitro selection experiments. It was considered that the best targets were those that included the N downward arrowGUC sequence surrounding the cleavage site. In contrast to previous studies that failed to evaluate all possible combinations of these nucleotides, we have performed an exhaustive analysis of the cleavage of 64 substrate variants. They represent all possible sequence combinations of the J2/1 nucleotides except the well established G(+1). No cleavage was observed with 24 sequences. C(+2) variants showed little or no cleavage, whereas U(+2) substrates were all cleavable. The maximal cleavage rate was obtained with the AGUC substrate. Cleavage rates of sequences HGUC (H = A, C, or U), GGUN, GGGR (R = A or G), AGUU, and UGUA were up to 5 times lower than the AGUC one. This shows that other sequences besides NGUC could also be considered as good targets. A second group of sequences WGGG (W = A or U), UGUK (K = G or U), MGAG (M = A or C), AGUA, and UGGA were cleaved between 6 and 10 times less efficiently. Furthermore, the UGCU sequence of a noncleavable viral target was mutated to AGUC resulting in a proficiently cleavable substrate by its cognate hairpin ribozyme. This indicates that our conclusions may be extrapolated to other hairpin ribozymes with different specificity.
