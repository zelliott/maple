Evidence is presented that the cytoplasmic domain of the type I interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) may be a GTPase. This domain conserves segments of hydrophobic amino acids that suggest a structural relatedness to the ras protooncogene protein and other members of the GTPase superfamily, despite a lack of significant detectable sequence homology. When the hydrophobic segments of the IL-1R were aligned with similar segments of the GTPases, it became apparent that the IL-1Rs possess a number of conserved amino acids that represent plausible functional residues for base-specific binding of GTP, magnesium chelation, and phosphate ester hydrolysis. Furthermore, a segment of five contiguous residues were found that is identical between ras and the IL-1R, and which is positioned to form part of the guanine base binding pocket. If this model is correct, then the IL-1Rs possess a highly conserved effector protein binding region, but one that is entirely unrelated to the effector regions of other superfamily members. Therefore, if the IL-1R is indeed a GTPase, then its activation function may be directed to as-yet unrecognized effector target proteins, as part of a unique cellular signal transduction pathway.
