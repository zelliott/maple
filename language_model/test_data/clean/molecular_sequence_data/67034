Eukaryotic organisms respond to various stresses with the synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSPs). HSP110 is a large molecular mass HSP that is part of the HSP70/DnaK superfamily. In this study, we have examined, for the first time, the expression of the hsp110 gene in Xenopus laevis cultured cells and embryos. Sequence analysis revealed that the protein encoded by the hsp110 cDNA exhibited 74% identity with its counterparts in mammals and only 27-29% with members of the Xenopus HSP70 family. Hsp110 mRNA and/or protein was detected constitutively in A6 kidney epithelial cells and was inducible by heat shock, sodium arsenite, and cadmium chloride. However, treatment with ethanol or copper sulfate had no detectable effect on hsp110 mRNA levels. Similar results were obtained for hsp70 mRNA except that it was inducible with ethanol. In Xenopus embryos, hsp110 mRNA was present constitutively during development. Heat shock-inducible accumulation of hsp110 mRNA occurred only after the midblastula stage. Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed that hsp110 mRNA accumulation in control and heat shocked embryos was enriched in selected tissues. These studies demonstrate that Xenopus hsp110 gene expression is constitutive and stress inducible in cultured cells and developmentally- and tissue specifically-regulated during early embryogenesis.
