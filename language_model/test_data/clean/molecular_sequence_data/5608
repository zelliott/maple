Phenobarbital is a classical inducer of the drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 genes, but the molecular mechanism of induction has not been elucidated. Functional analyses have identified a phenobarbital-responsive unit in the rat CYP2B1/2 and mouse Cyp2b10 genes about -2.3 kilobase pairs from the transcriptional start site, but little or no changes in protein binding to this region were observed in vitro. To examine the role of chromatin structure, protein binding to the phenobarbital-responsive unit assessed by in vitro DNase I footprinting was compared with that assessed by DNase I in vivo footprints in native chromatin. A region centered on a putative nuclear factor-1 site was the major protected region in in vitro footprints, and there were no detectable differences in binding between extracts from control and phenobarbital-treated animals. In contrast, phenobarbital treatment dramatically altered the protection pattern in native chromatin. In control samples a core region of about 25 base pairs (bp) centered on the nuclear factor-1 site was protected. However, after phenobarbital treatment, the protection of this core region was increased, and more dramatically the region of protection was extended 20 bp to either side so that a total of about 60 bp were protected. These results provide the first evidence that phenobarbital treatment alters the composition or architecture of proteins binding to the phenobarbital-responsive unit region and indicate that chromatin structure is important in this process. Because proteins are bound to the region in the untreated animal, the mechanism of induction involves the activation of proteins bound to the region and possibly recruitment of additional regulatory proteins rather than conversion of a closed chromatin structure to an open one that can bind regulatory factors.
