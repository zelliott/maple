The parietal yolk-sac carcinoma cell line PYS-2, which has been described to synthesize a trace amount of H-2 antigens, was shown to express low levels of Kb- and/or Db-specific antigens by flow cytometric analysis. Further studies of H-2 cDNA clones from PYS-2 cDNA library revealed 8 out of 10 clones were identified as classical H-2Kb and 2 were H-2Db, which confirmed the result from the immunofluorescent analysis. However, we have not isolated Qa, Tla or other embryonic class I cDNAs from our PYS-2 library.
