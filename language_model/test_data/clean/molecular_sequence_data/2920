The Bacillus subtilis dnaF (polC) gene that codes for the alpha subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme has been sequenced. It consists of 4005 base pairs coding for 1335 amino acids (from the start to the stop codon), giving a molecular weight of 151,273. A mutation (azp-12) that confers resistance to the antimicrobial drug 6-(p-hydroxyphenylazo)-uracil is due to a single base change at nucleotide 3523, from TCA to GCA, resulting in a change of the 1175th amino acid, serine, to alanine. It is in the active site and located at the C-terminal part of the enzyme. The amino acid composition in an N-terminal domain has 26% homology to the epsilon subunit coded by the dnaQ gene of Escherichia coli, which is a 3'----5' proofreading exonuclease, supporting an earlier observation that this function is an integral part of the polymerase molecule in B. subtilis.
