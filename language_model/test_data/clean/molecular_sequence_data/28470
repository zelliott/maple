Two new lupane glycosides along with five known triterpenoids were isolated from the roots of Pulsatilla chinensis (Ranunculaceae). The structures of the new glycosides were determined to be 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->3)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-23-hydroxybetulinic acid 28-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1-->4)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester (pulsatilloside D, 6) and 3-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->4)][alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1-->2)]-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-23-hydroxybetulinic acid 28-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1-->4)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester (pulsatilloside E, 7) by spectroscopic analysis and chemical methods. The compounds were evaluated for cytotoxic activities against K-562 human leukemia and HeLa cells.
