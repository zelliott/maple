Although the 5' cap-dependent scanning mechanism can account for the translational initiation of most mRNAs in eukaryotic cells, several viral and cellular mRNAs contain nucleotide sequences in their 5' non-coding regions that can mediate binding of ribosomes to the mRNA, regardless of the modification state of the 5' ends. During the past year, some nuclear proteins normally involved in RNA processing have been shown also to facilitate 'internal' ribosome binding. Unexpected dual functions have, therefore, been suggested for these RNA-binding proteins, in both RNA biogenesis in the nucleus and RNA translation in the cytoplasm.
