A mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase I gene fragment (NDI) was sequenced for three laboratory maintained isolates of Schistosoma japonicum. Comparison of sequences representing the isolates (originally obtained from the Anhui and Zhejiang provinces of the People's Republic of China, and from the Philippines) revealed inter-isolate sequence variations of 0.2-0.6% and no intra-isolate variation was found. The sequences also indicated that while the amplification products of the Zhejiang and Philippine isolates contained a recognition site for the endonuclease RsaI, there was no such site in the Anhui isolate. This was tested by digesting amplification products from a number of individual worms with RsaI. Then an infection experiment was designed to test the value of this genetic marker for studies of the population biology of S. japonicum in the final host. For this, the two Chinese isolates were used. Three groups of mice (A-C) were exposed firstly to a primary infection and then challenge-infected at weeks 4 and 7 of the experiment. In group A the first infection was done with the Anhui isolate, and the two others with the Zhejiang isolate, thereby providing a specific, detectable cohort. In groups B and C the Anhui isolate was used for the second and third infection. All mice were perfused 5 weeks after the last challenge infection, and the NDI was subsequently amplified from DNA of the perfused worms and digested with RsaI. The digestion revealed that while infection groups A and B contained mixed populations of the Anhui and Zhejiang isolates, only Zhejiang worms were present in group C. We concluded that the absence/presence of the RsaI site in the NDI provides a useful marker for the delineation of cohorts of S. japonicum.
