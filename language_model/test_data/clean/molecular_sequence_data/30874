Efficient cleavage and polyadenylation of eukaryotic messenger RNAs require at least two signal elements: an AAUAAA or closely related sequence located 7-30 base pairs (bp) upstream of the site of processing, and a G/U- or U-rich sequence located 3' to the cleavage site. The herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (tk) gene contains two copies of the AATAAA hexanucleotide and a GT-rich region. We have shown that the first AATAAA and the GT-rich region are essential for efficient processing, both in vivo and in vitro, whereas the second AATAAA does not appear to play any role in the formation of tk mRNA 3' ends. The failure of a signal containing only the second AATAAA and the GT-rich element to signal cleavage and polyadenylation suggested that these two elements might be too close together to constitute a functional polyadenylation signal. The experiments described in this report were directed at determining the effects on mRNA 3' end formation of alterations in spacing between signal elements. Wild-type tk contains 19 bp between these two elements. Constructs were made in which an AATAAA and the GT-rich region were separated by various distances ranging from 7 to 43 bp. The quantity and location of 3' ends of the tk mRNA produced by these constructs in Cos-1 cells were measured by S1 nuclease protection analysis. Signal efficiency was gradually reduced as the separation between the two signal elements was increased; with a separation of 43 bp, the signal functioned at approximately one-eighth the efficiency of the parental construction. Bringing the two signals closer together resulted in decreased signal efficiency; with a separation of 7 or 9 bp, no tk mRNA polyadenylated within the normal region was produced. Altering the sequences between these two elements without changing the distance had small effects on processing efficiency.
