Polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 are the products of PKD1 and PKD2, genes that are mutated in most cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Since the first two polycystins were cloned, three new members, polycystin-L, -2L2, and -REJ, have been identified. In this study, we describe a sixth member of the family, polycystin-1L1, encoded by PKD1L1 in human. The full-length cDNA sequence of PKD1L1, determined from human testis cDNA, encodes a 2849-amino-acid protein and 58 exons in a 187-kb genomic region. The deduced amino acid sequence of polycystin-1L1 has significant homology with all known polycystins, but the longest stretches of homology were found with polycystin-1 and -REJ over the 1453- and 932-amino-acid residues, respectively. Polycystin-1L1 is predicted to have two Ig-like PKD, a REJ, a GPS, a LH2/PLAT, a coiled-coil, and 11 putative transmembrane domains. Several rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signatures are also found in polycystin-1L1. Dot-blot analysis and RT-PCR revealed that human PKD1L1 is expressed in testis and in fetal and adult heart. In situ hybridization analysis showed that the most abundant and specific expression of Pkd1l1 was found in Leydig cells, a known source of testosterone production, in mouse testis. We have assigned PKD1L1 to the short arm of human chromosome 7 in bands p12--p13 and Pkd1l1 to mouse chromosome 11 in band A2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. We hypothesize a role for polycystin-1L1 in the heart and in the male reproductive system.
