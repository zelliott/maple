Since the cloning of a full length cDNA encoding the thyrotropin receptor (TSHr), several laboratories have been actively trying to develop an optimal animal model to understand the pathogenesis of TSHr mediated autoimmune diseases and have made considerable progress. To date, results from our laboratory have indicated that the nature of the antigen, and the adjuvant used for immunization, immunogenetic background of the animal and fine specificities of antibodies elicited might play an important role in determining the qualitative nature of the antibody response. Although an ideal animal model for either Graves' disease or primary myxedema is not yet available, ongoing studies in our laboratory and elsewhere hold promise for establishing animal models for various TSHr mediated autoimmune diseases in the near future.
