Calcitonin-immunoreactive cells were found in the intestine of goldfish. These cells were distributed mainly in the anterior part of the intestine, dispersed in the intestinal epithelium. The nucleus was located in the basal portion of the serosal side, and the cytoplasm was elongated to the luminal side. From the anterior part of the intestine, cDNA fragments with the same nucleotide sequence as that of the goldfish calcitonin gene were amplified by RT-PCR method. After administration of one of three kinds of solutions (saline, consommé soup, or high Ca consommé soup) into the digestive tract of the goldfish, the number of those cells was the largest in the consommé group at 6 h after ingestion, although blood Ca levels were the highest in the high Ca consommé group. The function of calcitonin cells in the intestine may be to restrain the acute absorption of nutrients and not to control blood Ca levels.
