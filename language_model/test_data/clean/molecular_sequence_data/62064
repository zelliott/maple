The bovine cDNA encoding CD11a, a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in multiple leukocyte functions, was sequenced and compared with the human and murine sequences. Despite some focal differences, it shares all the main characteristics of its known mammalian homologs. Along with the bovine CD18-encoding cDNA, which is available for a long time, the sequence data provided here will allow the successful expression of bovine CD11a, thus giving the first opportunity to express the Bos taurus beta(2)-integrin CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1, alpha(L)beta(2)) in vitro as a tool to examine the specificities of inflammation in the bovine species.
