The cochlea has been suggested to express some Na+/ Ca2+ exchangers (NCX), since efficient acoustic transduction requires cytosolic calcium homeostasis. The present study revealed that several spliced isoforms of NCX are expressed in the guinea pig cochlea. Moreover, to determine their localization in the cochlea, microdissected RT-PCR was performed. The guinea pig cochlea was microdissected into three parts (lateral wall, the organ of Corti and modiolus). The cochlear lateral wall and the organ of Corti expressed only a single isoform of NCX1. On the other hand, five isoforms of NCX1 and four isoforms of NCX3 were detected in the cochlear modiolus. The alternative splicing may provide diverse functions for NCX in the cochlea.
