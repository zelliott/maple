We report the sequence of 3978 bp of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens chromosome which contains a putative operon encoding the homologues of the transmembrane proton channel protein MotA, and the flagellar switch proteins FliM, FliN and FliG. Two transposon insertions in fliG result in a non-flagellate phenotype, indicating that this gene at least is required for flagellar assembly.
