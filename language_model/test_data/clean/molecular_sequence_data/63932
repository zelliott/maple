The lacto-N-neotetraose tetrasaccharide was synthesized on a new dendrimeric support, based on polyethylene glycol. Starting from 1-thio-beta-D-lactose, the trisaccharide (2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1-->3)-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-->4)-1-thio-beta-D-glucopyranose was obtained using Neisseria meningitidis beta-(1-->3)-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase according to a soluble synthesis approach, bound on the support and galactosylated using the milk beta-(1-->4)-galactosyl transferase to give after cleavage the tetrasaccharide lacto-N-neotetraose.
