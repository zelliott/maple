A novel protein MGC5306 has been identified in yeast-two-hybrid analysis by screening a HeLa cDNA library with a truncated DNA polymerasebeta (polbetaDelta) as bait. The polbetaDelta is expressed in various types of cancers. Co-immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis confirms not only its interaction with polbetaDelta but also with wild-type polbeta. Binding to polbeta indicates potential function of MGC5306 in repair pathway. Transfection of cells with MGC5306-GFP and Western blot analysis with anti-MGC5306 antibody reveal its nuclear localization. MGC5306 is expressed in human carcinomas and tumor cell lines but not in normal tissues, suggesting MGC5306 is most likely involved in carcinogenesis. An antigrowth activity and modulations of cell cycle events are identified in cells expressing siRNAMGC5306.
