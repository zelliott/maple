A cDNA homologue to the human defender against apoptotic death gene (dad-1), which is involved in programmed cell death, was isolated from satsuma mandarin (Citrus unshiu Marc.) fruit. It (Citdad-1-1) was 345 bp long, with a deduced protein sequence of 115 amino acids. Southern hybridization suggests that dad-1-related sequences are present as a small gene family in the citrus genome. Expression of Citdad-1-1 was progressively down-regulated in leaves as they matured, but not in juice sac/segment epidermis (edible part) towards fruit ripening. The role of dad-1 during citrus development is also discussed.
