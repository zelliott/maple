RNase-related proteins (RRPs) are S- and S-like RNase homologs lacking the active site required for RNase activity. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of the rice (Oryza sativa) RRP gene (OsRRP). A single copy of OsRRP occurs in the rice genome. OsRRP contains three introns and an open reading frame encoding 252 amino acids, with the replacement of two histidines involved in the active site of RNase by lysine and tyrosine respectively. OsRRP is preferentially expressed in stems of wild-type rice and is significantly down-regulated in an increased tillering dwarf mutant ext37.
