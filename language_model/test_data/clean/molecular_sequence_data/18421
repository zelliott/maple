The amino acid sequences of insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 from porcine plasma have been determined by mass analysis of peptides obtained from tryptic and AspN digests for the former protein and from tryptic and peptic digests for the latter. Complete homology to the human Type 1 protein was indicated by the overlapping peptide map obtained by mass analysis. For the Type 2 protein, a mutation of a Ser in the human protein to an Asn in the porcine was confirmed by the combination of mass analysis and automated protein microsequencing. The studies were performed on 3 micrograms (0.4 nmol) of each protein, indicating the sensitive potential of this method in primary structure-homology studies.
