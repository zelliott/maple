The peptides corresponding to the four repeats found in the microtubule binding region of tau protein were synthesized and their ability for self-aggregation in presence of heparin or chondroitin sulfate was measured. Mainly, only the peptide containing the third tau repeat is able to form polymers in a high proportion. Additionally, the peptide containing the second repeat aggregates with a very low efficiency. However, when this peptide contains the mutation (P301L), described in a fronto temporal dementia, it is able to form polymers at a higher extent. Finally, it is suggested to have a role for the first and fourth tau repeats. It could be to decrease the ability of the third tau repeat for self-aggregation in the presence of heparin.
