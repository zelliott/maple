The complete nucleotide sequence of two human enterovirus 71 strains (KMM09 and KM186-09) isolated in Yunnan,China, were determined by RT-PCR and sequencing. As with other human enteroviruses, the genomes were 7 409 nucleotides (nts) in length and encoded 2 193 aa. Phylogenetic analysis based on VP1 regions revealed that the two isolates belonged to subgenotype C4a. In structural genomic regions, subgenotype C4 was most homologous to other strains of C genotype when compared to other genotypes. In non-structural genomic regions, subgenotype C4 was more homologous to CA16/G10 and other strains of B genotype than to other strains of C genotype. RDP3 and Blast analysis displayed evidence of recombination in non-structural genomic regions between subgenotype B3 and C4, C4 and CA16/G10. The full-length genome of the human enterovirus 71 strains provided an overview of the diversity of genetic characteristics of a circulatinghuman enterovirus 71.
