"Curtobacterium psychrophilum," proposed by Inoue and Komagata in 1976, is a psychrophilic gram-positive irregular rod isolated from Antarctic soil. This organism grew optimally at 9 to 12 degrees C and did not grow at higher than 18 degrees C. Chemotaxonomic characteristics of this organism were the presence of 2,4-diaminobutyric acid in the cell wall and menaquinone-10 as the predominant respiratory quinone. The cellular fatty acid profile, which contained a significant amount of an anteiso-branched monounsaturated acid, 12-methyl tetradecenoic acid, was a distinctive characteristic of this organism and was reasonable for adaptation to low temperature. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S ribosomal DNA sequences revealed that this organism was positioned at a separate branch in the family Microbacteriaceae, actinomycetes with group B peptidoglycan. We propose the name Cryobacterium psychrophilum gen. nov., sp. nov. for this organism. The type strain is JCM 1463 (= IAM 12024 = ATCC 43563 = IFO 15735 = NCIMB 2068).
