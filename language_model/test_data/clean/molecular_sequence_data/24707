One hallmark of innate immunity apparently conserved from primitive life forms through to humans is the ability of the host to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Since macrophage pattern recognition receptors are not well defined in Drosophila, we set out to identify such receptors. Our findings reveal that Drosophila macrophages express multiple pattern recognition receptors and that the Drosophila scavenger receptor, dSR-CI, is one such receptor capable of recognizing both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, but not yeast. Our data indicate that scavenger receptor bacterial recognition is conserved from insects to humans and may represent one of the most primitive forms of microbial recognition.
