Fibroblast collagenase (MMP-1), a 169-residue protein with a molecular mass of 18.7 kDa, is a matrix metalloproteinase which has been associated with pathologies such as arthritis and cancer. The assignments of the 1H, 15N, 13CO and 13C resonances, determination of the secondary structure and analysis of 15N relaxation data of the inhibitor-free catalytic fragment of recombinant human fibroblast collagenase (MMP-1) are presented. It is shown that MMP-1 is composed of a beta-sheet consisting of five beta-strands in a mixed parallel and antiparallel arrangement (residues 13-19, 48-53, 59-65, 82-85 and 94-99) and three alpha-helices (residues 27-43, 112-124 and 150-160). This is nearly identical to the secondary structure determined from the refined X-ray crystal structures of inhibited MMP-1. The major difference observed between the NMR solution structure of inhibitor-free MMP-1 and the X-ray structures of inhibited MMP-1 is the dynamics of the active site. The 2D 15N-1H HSQC spectra, the lack of information in the 15N-edited NOESY spectra, and the generalized order parameters (S2) determined from 15N T1, T2 and NOE data suggest a slow conformational exchange for residues comprising the active site (helix B, zinc ligated histidines and the nearby loop region) and a high mobility for residues Pro138-Gly144 in the vicinity of the active site for inhibitor-free collagenase. In contrast to the X-ray structures, only the slow conformational exchange is lost in the presence of an inhibitor.
