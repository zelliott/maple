Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) is believed to play an important role in the activation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Recent findings suggesting an involvement of reactive oxygen species in signal transduction pathways leading to NF-kappa B activation have encouraged the possible clinical use of antioxidants in blocking HIV activation. We have examined the effects of vitamin E and alpha-lipoate derivatives on NF-kappa B activation, and have observed that each of these antioxidants behave differently. Here we propose mechanisms of antioxidant actions in influencing cell signalling for NF-kappa B activation.
