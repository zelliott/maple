Post-translational protein modification with ubiquitin, or ubiquitylation, is one of the hottest topics in a modern biology due to a dramatic impact on diverse metabolic pathways and involvement in pathogenesis of severe human diseases. A great number of eukaryotic proteins was found to be ubiquitylated. However, data about particular ubiquitylated proteins are rather disembodied.

To fill a general need for collecting and systematizing experimental data concerning ubiquitylation we have developed a new resource, UbiProt Database, a knowledge base of ubiquitylated proteins. The database contains retrievable information about overall characteristics of a particular protein, ubiquitylation features, related ubiquitylation and de-ubiquitylation machinery and literature references reflecting experimental evidence of ubiquitylation. UbiProt is available at http://ubiprot.org.ru for free.

UbiProt Database is a public resource offering comprehensive information on ubiquitylated proteins. The resource can serve as a general reference source both for researchers in ubiquitin field and those who deal with particular ubiquitylated proteins which are of their interest. Further development of the UbiProt Database is expected to be of common interest for research groups involved in studies of the ubiquitin system.
