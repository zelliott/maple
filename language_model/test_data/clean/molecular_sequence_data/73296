Length variation at the BTGL1 variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) locus, which includes both minisatellite and microsatellite motifs, was examined in a wide sample of cattle. A total of 22 alleles were uncovered. The distribution of allele size variation implicated mechanisms involving both minisatellite and microsatellite sequences. This was confirmed by direct sequences of two alleles. Differences between the two alleles involved repeat number variation of microsatellite motifs and a complex event involving the minisatellite motif, but point mutations were not observed.
