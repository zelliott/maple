Based on the sequences of the highly conserved segments in the previously cloned sialyltransferases, a cDNA encoding Galbeta1, 3GalNAc alpha2,3-sialyltransferase (SIATFL) has been isolated from human fetal liver. Expression analysis of the gene has been performed with various carcinoma cell lines, fetal tissues, fetal and adult liver and both hepatoma and the surrounding tissue from the same liver. The SIATFL gene was expressed poorly in fetal liver and in adult liver, slightly in hepatoma and highly in the surrounding tissue of hepatoma. The cDNA encoding the putative active domain was expressed in COS-1, Escherichia coli, and Pichia pastoris. The recombinant protein expressed in COS-1 could catalyse the transfer of NeuAc from CMP-NeuAc to asialo-fetuin. No enzyme activity was detected with a 32-kDa protein in E. coli and both 32-kDa and 41-kDa proteins in P. pastoris. These results suggested that correct glycosylation of the enzyme might play a key role in its folding that may be directly related to the enzymatic activity.
