Cysticercosis caused by infection with embryonated eggs of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium is an important cause of neurological disease worldwide. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA, the pathogen has been divided into two geographic clades, corresponding to Afro-American and Asian genotypes. In this study the genotyping of T. solium was carried out by using the nuclear DNA sequences of the immunodiagnostic antigen genes Ag1V1 and Ag2. The two geographic genotypes were supported by the Ag2 sequences, especially showing unique substitutions in each of the genotypes. It seems likely that the Ag2 may be a novel nuclear DNA marker to distinguish the two geographic genotypes of T. solium.
