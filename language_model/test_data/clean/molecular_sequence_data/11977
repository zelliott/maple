Mannose receptor is a differentiation marker of macrophages. Circulating monocytes isolated from plasma are devoid of this receptor; upon culture this receptor is rapidly expressed. Its expression is modulated by a variety of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory agents. In the present study, we investigated its transcription level during the differentiation process. Mannose receptor mRNA was monitored by quantitative RT-PCR on freshly harvested monocytes and on monocytes cultivated up to four days. No transcription was detected in freshly harvested cells, the transcription increased during the first 24 h upon adhesion and then decreased.
