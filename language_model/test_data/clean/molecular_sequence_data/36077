The nucleotide sequence of two non-contiguous DNA fragments of 4.0 and 2.2 kb, respectively, of the kinetoplast maxicircle of Trypanosoma brucei brucei EATRO strain 427 has been determined, completing the sequence analysis of the so-called variable region (see also de Vries et al., 1988, Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 27, 71-82). Analysis of the entire 8-kb variable region sequence revealed the presence of a 5.2-kb cluster of imperfect, tandemly repeated sequences, flanked by DNA of unique sequence. Both repetitive and unique DNA evolve rapidly, but comparison to the closely related strain EATRO 164 indicated that the repetitive cluster is more prone to sequence and size divergence. The variable region is transcribed into RNAs of varying lengths but appears to be devoid of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins or tRNAs, as judged from computer analysis. Moreover, genes that could encode guide RNAs involved in producing the known edited mitochondrial mRNA sequences are also absent. The repetitive DNA cluster within this region consists of 14 blocks each containing one 130 bp repeat and a variable number of 19 bp repeats. A duplicated sequence was identified (5'-GGGGTTGGTGT) which proved to be identical to the eleven 5'-terminal residues of the universal minicircle dodecamer involved in initiation of leading strand synthesis. This suggests a role for these sequences in the initiation of maxicircle DNA replication. With the data presented in this report, the nucleotide sequence analysis of the 23016 bp maxicircle of T. brucei brucei EATRO strain 427 has been completed.
