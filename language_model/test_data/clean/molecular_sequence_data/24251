Plasma samples from 19 patients were analyzed for HIV-1 directed humoral immune responses prior to and 1 year after initiation of HAART. Eight of the subjects were classified as virologic successes, defined by a >100-fold decrease in viral load (VL) over the 1-year study period and a final VL <500 copies/ml. The eleven HAART failures were defined as subjects with <10-fold decrease in VL. At study entry (before HAART), VL and CD4 counts were similar between the two groups. Humoral immune responses before therapy and after 1 year of therapy were measured by V3 peptide antibody binding titers and neutralization of HIV-1 MN and four subtype B clinical isolates. Before HAART, neutralizing antibody titers to the clinical isolates and HIV(MN), as well as HIV V3 envelope binding titers to several V3 peptides, were significantly higher among treatment successes compared with treatment failures. After 1 year on HAART, neutralization declined in titer and narrowed in specificity among the HAART successes. In contrast, a significant increase in both neutralizing titer and breadth was seen among HAART failures.
