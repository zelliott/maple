The amino acid sequence of the rat 60S ribosomal subunit protein L29 was deduced from the sequence of nucleotides in a recombinant cDNA. Ribosomal protein L29 has 155 amino acids, the NH2-terminal methionine is removed after translation of the mRNA, and has a molecular weight of 17,183. Hybridization of the cDNA to digests of nuclear DNA suggests that there are 20 to 22 copies of the L29 gene. The mRNA for the protein is about 750 nucleotides in length. Rat L29 is related to yeast ribosomal protein YL43.
