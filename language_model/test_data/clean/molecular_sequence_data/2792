A temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant, tsG1, has been isolated from the CVS (Challenge Virus Standard) strain of rabies virus. The ts mutation affects the glycoprotein (G protein); it consists of an amino acid substitution (leucine to phenylalanine) at position 132. tsG1 exhibits a slightly reduced pathogenicity when administered via the intracerebral route and complete avirulence after intramuscular inoculation, associated with a very high protective power for adult mice. The ts mutation does not seem to block the transport of the G protein to the plasma membrane at the non-permissive temperature (39.6 degrees C). It abolishes the c.p.e. of the virus in cell cultures.
