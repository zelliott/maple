Gaegurin 4 (GGN4) is a cationic peptide of 37 amino acids (MW 3748) isolated from the skin of Rana rugosa. It has shown a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity in vitro against Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, fungi and protozoa. To understand its mechanism of antimicrobial action, we examined the effect of GGN4 on the membrane conductance and the electrical properties of GGN4-induced pores in planar lipid bilayers under voltage clamp. Natural and synthetic GGN4 (0.01-1 microg/mL) increased the membrane conductance in a concentration-dependent manner, but GGN4 (1-23), an N-terminal fragment of the peptide with little antimicrobial activity, failed to increase the conductance. At symmetrical 100 mM KCI, unitary conductances of about 120 pS were frequently observed. Their current-voltage relations were linear and open state probabilities were close to 1, but longer closing events were seen more frequently at negative voltages. In addition, GGN4-induced pores were selective for cation over anion, the permeability ratio of K+ to Cl- being 6: 1 in neutral and 7: 1 in acidic lipid bilayers. In conclusion, our results indicate that GGN4 forms voltage-dependent and cation-selective pores in planar lipid bilayers. The ionophoric property of GGN4 is likely to contribute to its antimicrobial activity.
