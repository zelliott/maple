The nucleotide sequences of the Escherichia coli genome between the glycogen biosynthetic genes glgB and glgC, and 1170 bp of DNA which follows glgA have been determined. The region between glgB and glgC contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 1521 bp which we call glgX. This ORF is capable of coding for an Mr 56,684 protein. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence for the putative product shows significant similarity to the E. coli glycogen branching enzyme, and to several different glucan hydrolases and transferases. The regions of sequence similarity include residues which have been reported to be involved in substrate binding and catalysis by taka-amylase. This suggests that the proposed product may catalyze hydrolysis or glycosyl-transferase reactions. The cloned region which follows glgA contains an incomplete ORF (1149 bp), glgY, which appears to encode 383 aa of the N terminus of glycogen phosphorylase, based upon sequence similarity with the enzyme from rabbit muscle (47% identical aa residues) and with maltodextrin phosphorylase from E. coli (37% identical aa residues). Results suggest that neither ORF is required for glycogen biosynthesis. The localization of glycogen biosynthetic and degradative genes together in a cluster may facilitate the regulation of these systems in vivo.
