We have purified to homogeneity a 15-kDa perchloric acid (PCA)-soluble protein from rat thymus nuclei. This highly acidic protein showed a Mr of ca. 30 kDa in acetic acid/urea gels, probably due to oligomer formation. Sequence analysis of internal tryptic and thermolytic peptides revealed that the purified protein is, in fact, prothymosin alpha, a very hydrophilic polypeptide, which has been previously classified as a thymic or immunomodulating hormone. We found that prothymosin alpha is a rather abundant nuclear protein in rat thymus; its concentration is comparable to that of a well-characterized nonhistone protein HMG-14. The subcellular localization and physicochemical properties of prothymosin alpha suggest that its function is related to those of other long polyacidic regions containing nuclear proteins.
