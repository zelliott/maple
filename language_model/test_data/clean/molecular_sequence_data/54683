Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is responsible for respiratory tract disease, particularly in the young and elderly population. An epidemiological and phylogenic study was performed on children admitted to hospital with an acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRI). Data were obtained and analyzed over three consecutive winters, from 2002-2003 to 2004-2005. Each year during the winter period, from November to March, 2,415 nasal swabs were tested by a direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA) for influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses. Rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and coronaviruses OC43 and 229E were detected by RT-PCR. A RT-PCR designed for the M gene was performed on negative samples for hMPV detection and phylogenic analyses. For the three consecutive winters, hMPV represented 10%, 22.6%, and 8.8% of virus-negative samples, respectively. In most cases, clinical symptoms indicated a LRI with a final diagnosis of bronchiolitis. During the winter of 2003-2004, all viral clusters (A1, A2, B1, and B2) that circulated in France shifted progressively from the A group to the B group. This study determined the prevalence of hMPV in Normandy, its clinical impact and permitted the analysis of the molecular evolution during the successive outbreaks.
