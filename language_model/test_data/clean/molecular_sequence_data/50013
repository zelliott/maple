Point mutations found in rhodopsin associated with the retinal degenerative disease retinitis pigmentosa have been expressed in mammalian COS-1 cells, purified, and characterised. The mutations characterised-most of them for the first time-have been Met44Thr, Gly114Asp, Arg135Leu, Val137Met, and Pro171Leu in the transmembrane domain; Leu328Pro and Ala346Pro in the C-terminal tail of the cytoplasmic domain; and Gly106Trp in the intradiscal domain. Several of these mutations cause misfolding which results in impaired 11-cis-retinal binding. Two of them, Met44Thr and Val137Met, show spectral and structural features similar to those of wild type rhodopsin (Type I mutants) but significantly increased transducin initial activation rates. We propose that, in the case of these mutants, abnormal functioning resulting in faster activation kinetics could also play a role in retinitis pigmentosa by altering the stoichiometric balance of the different proteins involved in the phototransduction biochemical reactions.
