Zidovudine (ZDV) is by far the most widely used drug to counteract human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, both in monotherapy and in combination therapy regimens. However, the majority of patients under prolonged ZDV therapy have been shown to harbour HIV-1 mutant genomes displaying reduced sensitivity to the drug in vitro. In order to investigate the pathogenic role of in vitro resistance to ZDV, six HIV-1-infected ZDV-treated subjects were evaluated longitudinally (mean follow-up 28.5 months, range 12-39 months) for HIV-1 DNA load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and for the presence of HIV-1 pol gene mutations responsible for ZDV resistance. Quantitation of HIV-1 DNA was performed by competitive polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) and the pol genotype was determined by direct sequencing of PCR products. All of the six patients developed one or more of the HIV-1 pol mutations known to confer resistance to ZDV in vitro (Met41-->Leu, Asp67-->Asn, Lys70-->Arg, Thr215-->Phe/Tyr, Lys219-->Gln/Glu). A temporal association was found between HIV-1 DNA burden and the level of ZDV resistance, as predicted on the basis of the pol genotype (genotypic resistance). Both virus load and ZDV resistance were inversely correlated with CD4+ cell counts. These results are compatible with a direct in vivo pathogenetic role for pol gene mutations shown to be involved in resistance to ZDV in vitro. Monitoring the degree of genotypic resistance to ZDV and to other antiretroviral drugs should be considered in designing protocols for the management of treated patients.
