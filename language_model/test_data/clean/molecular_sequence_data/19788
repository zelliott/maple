It has been suggested that VH4-34 gene segment expression is counter-selected in multiple myeloma (MM) due to a self-tolerance mechanism. We cloned and sequenced a VH4-34 gene segment from bone marrow mononuclear cells of a stage III MM patient. We show that VH4-34 was expressed by the serum IgA myeloma (M)-protein, as demonstrated by reactivity with the VH4-34 specific 9G4 mAb and mass spectrometry (MS). The M-protein had weak reactivity with nuclei. These results demonstrate that VH4-34 may be expressed in secreted IgA M-protein with weak autoreactivity. Thus, counter-selection of VH4-34 is pronounced but not absolute in MM. Mechanisms of how VH4-34 can occasionally be expressed in MM and clinical implications are discussed.
