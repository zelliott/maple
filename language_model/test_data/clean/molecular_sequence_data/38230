Equine arteritis virus (EAV) is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Arteriviridae of the order Nidovirales. The unsegmented, infectious genome of EAV is 12,704 nt in length [exclusive of the poly(A) tail] and contains eight overlapping genes that are expressed from a 3'-coterminal nested set of seven leader-containing mRNAs. To investigate the importance of the overlapping gene arrangement in the viral life-cycle and to facilitate the genetic manipulation of the viral genome, a series of mutant full-length cDNA clones was constructed in which either EAV open reading frames (ORFs) 4 and 5 or ORFs 5 and 6 or ORFs 4, 5, and 6 were separated by newly introduced AflII restriction endonuclease cleavage sites. RNA transcribed from each of these plasmids was infectious, demonstrating that the overlapping gene organization is not essential for EAV viability. Moreover, the recombinant viruses replicated with almost the same efficiency, i.e., reached nearly the same infectious titers as the wildtype virus, and stably maintained the mutations that were introduced. The AflII site engineered between ORFs 5 and 6 was subsequently used to generate a virus in which the ectodomain of the ORF 6-encoded M protein was extended with nine amino acids derived from the extreme N-terminus of the homologous protein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV; family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales). This nonapeptide contains a functional O-glycosylation signal as well as an epitope recognized by an MHV-specific monoclonal antibody, both of which were expressed by the recombinant virus. Although the hybrid virus had a clear growth disadvantage in comparison to the parental virus, three serial passages did not result in the loss of the foreign genetic material.
