The PyAG1 gene, identified by the screening of a Plasmodium yoelii genomic DNA library with a rhoptry-specific Mab, encodes a protein with a zinc finger structure immediately followed by the consensus sequence of the Arf GAP catalytic site. The serum of mice immunized with the recombinant protein recognized specifically the rhoptries of the late infected erythrocytic stages. Blast analysis using the Genbank database gave the highest scores with four proteins presenting an Arf1 GAP activity. If presenting also this activity, the PyAG1 protein could be involved in the regulation of the secreted protein vesicular transport and, consequently, in the rhoptry biogenesis.
