The review considers recent data on the structural-functional organization of the genome of orthopoxviruses pathogenic for humans, including the variola, monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses. Emphasis was placed on the structure of molecular virulence factors that suppress the inflammatory reactions, immune response, and interferon effects induced by virus infection.
