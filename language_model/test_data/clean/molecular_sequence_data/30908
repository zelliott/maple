A recombinant form of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (rPAI-1) has been purified from lysates of pCE1200, a bacterial expression vector containing the full length PAI-1 gene, by utilizing sequential anion exchange and cation exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose and S-Sepharose columns. Approximately 140 mg of rPAI-1, estimated at 98% purity on the basis of analytical high performance liquid chromatography, could be obtained from 200 g wet weight of cells. The purified protein exhibited a single Coomassie Blue-stainable band at the region of Mr = 42,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and an NH2-terminal amino acid sequence consistent with the expected translation product of the pCE1200 PAI-1 insert. The rPAI-1 rapidly inhibited single- and two-chain tissue plasminogen activators, as well as urokinase, with apparent second order rate constants in the range of 2-5 x 10(7) M-1 s-1. A specific activity measurement of 250,000 units/mg was calculated for the rPAI-1 based on its ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of a single-chain tissue plasminogen activator. Stability studies showed that the activity of the rPAI-1 was very stable when stored at temperatures of 25 degrees C or lower, but decayed within hours when stored at 37 degrees C. Sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment, which partially activates the latent form of natural PAI-1, inactivated rPAI-1. These results show that the purified rPAI-1 produced from pCE1200 displays many of the properties associated with the biologically active form of natural PAI-1.
