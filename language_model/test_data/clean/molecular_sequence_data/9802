Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease inducible in susceptible animals by myelin Ag-specific CD4+ Th1 cells. The mechanisms by which these cells induce inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) are incompletely understood. To determine the roles of Fas and FasL in the involvement of CNS autoimmune injury, we determined susceptibility to EAE of Fas-or FasL-deficient mice. Compared with wild-type mice, mice expressing lpr (Fas) and gld (FasL) mutations were relatively resistant to the development of clinical EAE, and this correlated with fewer inflammatory infiltrates and cells undergoing apoptosis in the CNS of the mutant mice. The gld and lpr mice, however, developed significant T cell responses with production of Th1 cytokines in response to the encephalitogenic myelin peptide. These results suggest that the Fas/FasL pathway plays a critical role in the development of EAE probably by mediating apoptosis within the target tissue.
