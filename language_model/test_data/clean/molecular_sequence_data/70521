The gene encoding the 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase of Haemophilus influenzae has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. A complex of the purified protein with a substrate analog has been crystallized and its structure solved by multiple anomalous dispersion using phase information obtained from a single crystal of selenomethione-labeled protein. The enzyme folds into a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet flanked on one side by two alpha-helices and on the other by three consecutive alpha-helices, giving a novel beta1alpha1beta2beta3alpha2beta4alpha3alpha4alpha5 polypeptide topology. The three-dimensional structure of a binary complex has been refined at 2.1 A resolution. The location of the substrate analog and a sulfate ion gives important insight into the molecular mechanism of the enzyme.
