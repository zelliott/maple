About 98% of the DNA sequence of the lymphotropic Aleutian disease parvovirus isolate ADV-SL3 was determined and analysed. The sequence revealed that this isolate was a type-1 ADV strain, supporting that the currently used typing of ADV viruses does not correlate with virulence or pathogenicity. ADV-SL3 had a very high overall homology of 99.5% to the prototype strain ADV-G at the DNA level. Comparative sequence analyses with various ADV isolates of known virulence did not reveal a consensus sequence that could obviously be responsible for the apparently unique biological properties of this virus strain.
