In the framework of the European project aimed at the sequencing of the Bacillus subtilis genome, a DNA fragment of 12315 bp was cloned and sequenced. The DNA fragment is located between rrnB (275 degrees) and pai (284 degrees). Twelve ORFs were predicted to encode putative proteins. Two of these (ald and yukl) coincided with known B. subtilis genes. The products of two other genes (yukK and yukL) showed significant similarity to known proteins present in databases, e.g. pyoverdin synthase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and pristinamycin synthase D of Streptomyces pristinaespiralis.
