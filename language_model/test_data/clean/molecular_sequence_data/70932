Protein kinase CK2 (casein kinase II) is a serine-threonine protein kinase with a wide range of substrates, many of which are involved in cell cycle regulation. CK2 activity is elevated in a variety of human tumors and we have used a transgenic mouse model to demonstrate that dysregulated expression of CK2 can induce lymphoma. Thus, CK2 fulfills the definition of an oncogene: A mutated, dysregulated, or mis-expressed gene that contributes to cancer in a dominant fashion. CK2 cooperates in transforming cells with other lymphoid oncogenes such as myc and tal-1, and here we show cooperativity with loss of the tumor suppressor gene p53. To understand more about the physiological and pathological role of CK2, we are cloning the murine CK2alpha' cDNA and gene. CK2alpha' will be used to generate transgenic and knockout mice and the regulatory elements for gene expression will be analyzed.
