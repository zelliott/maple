The molten globule state of equine lysozyme is more stable than that of alpha-lactalbumin and is stabilized by non-specific hydrophobic interactions and native-like hydrophobic interactions. We constructed a chimeric protein which is produced by replacing the flexible loop (residues 105-110) in human alpha-lactalbumin with the helix D (residues 109-114) in equine lysozyme to investigate the possible role of the helix D for the high stability and native-like packing interaction in the molten globule state of equine lysozyme. The stability of the molten globule state formed by the chimeric protein to guanidine hydrochloride-induced unfolding is the same as that of equine lysozyme and is substantially greater than that of human alpha-lactalbumin, although only six residues come from equine lysozyme. Our results also suggest that the non-native interaction in the molten globule state of alpha-lactalbumin changes to the native-like packing interaction due to helix substitution. The solvent-accessibility of the Trp residues in the molten globule state of the chimeric protein is similar to that in the molten globule state of equine lysozyme in which packing interaction around the Trp residues in the native state is partially preserved. Therefore, the helix D in equine lysozyme is one of the contributing factors to the high stability and native-like packing interaction in the molten globule state of equine lysozyme. Our results indicate that the native-like packing interaction can stabilize the rudimentary intermediate which is stabilized by the non-specific hydrophobic interactions.
