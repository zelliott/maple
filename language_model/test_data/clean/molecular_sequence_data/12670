We have identified a novel Drosophila homeodomain gene, unplugged (unp), whose function is required for formation of the tracheal branches that penetrate the CNS. In unp mutant embryos the segmentally repeated ganglionic branches stall and fail to penetrate the CNS and the segment-specific cerebral branch and associated cerebral anastomosis fail to form. Expression of unp in the founder cells for the cerebral branch within the first tracheal metamere is repressed in posterior segments by Ubx and other bithorax complex genes. This pattern of expression and homeotic gene regulation is reproduced by an unusual 2.6 kb cis-regulatory sequence located downstream of the unp transcription unit. Since the unp protein is localized to the nucleus of tracheal precursor cells as they migrate and extend, unp protein appears to play a regulatory role in neural branching of the tracheae, and the segment-specific aspects of these neural branching patterns appear to be generated by homeotic regulation of unp expression.
