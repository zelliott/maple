The white-tailed deer is the definitive host of the parasitic nematode Parelaphostrongylus tenuis. This parasite also infects a wide variety of domesticated livestock, causing a debilitating neurologic disease. Glycoconjugates are becoming increasingly implicated in nematode strategies to maintain persistent infections in immunologically competent hosts. In this study, we have carried out detailed mass spectrometric analysis together with classical biochemical techniques, including western blotting and immunohistochemical staining with anticarbohydrate monoclonal antibodies and have shown that P. tenuis contains complex-type N-glycans with the antennae capped with Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc sequence. By mimicking a vertebrate glycan, Galalpha1-3Gal may aid the parasite in evading immunological detection by the host. This is the first report of the Galalpha1-3Gal sequence in a nematode.
