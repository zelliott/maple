Ribose 2'-hydroxyls make a key contribution to the enormous structural and functional potential of RNA molecules. Here, we report the identification of 2'-deoxy modifications in the catalytic RNA subunit of RNase P from Escherichia coli that interfere with tRNA binding. This was accomplished by modification interference employing pools of RNase P RNA that carried a low level of Rp-deoxy-phosphorothioate (Rp-deoxyNMPalpha(S) ) modifications randomly distributed over its 380 nt. A gel retardation assay allowed us to separate RNase P RNA pools into tRNA-binding and nonbinding fractions. Differences in the intensity of phosphorothioate-specific iodine hydrolysis patterns of the two RNA fractions revealed positions where the Rp-deoxyNMPalpha(S) modification interferes with tRNA binding. A comparison with interference patterns obtained for the Rp-NMPalpha(S) modification alone has identified some 20 positions in the backbone of E. coli RNase P RNA where the functional defect caused by the Rp-deoxyNMPalpha(S) double modification is attributable to the 2'-deoxy modification (or possibly the C5 methyl group in the case of U residues because we used deoxyTMPalpha(S) for partial substitution of UMP). Most of the corresponding 2'-OH functions were localized in regions that have been reported to crosslink to photoreactive tRNA derivatives, suggesting that these 2'-hydroxyls are located along the tRNA binding interface of E. coli RNase P RNA. Our results indicate that the modification interference approach applied here will be useful generally to identify structurally and functionally important 2'-hydroxyls in large RNAs and ribozymes.
