We have examined the rate of evolution of Ross River virus, a mosquito-borne RNA virus, during epidemic spread through tens of thousands of nonimmune humans over a period of 10 months. Two regions of the Ross River virus genome were sequenced: the E2 gene (1.2 kb in length), which encodes the major neutralization determinant of the virus, and 0.4 kb of the 3'-untranslated region. In the E2 gene, a single nucleotide change was selected which led to a predicted amino acid change at residue 219. No changes were selected in the 3'-untranslated region. By comparison with rates of evolution reported for non-arthropod-borne RNA viruses, the rate for Ross River virus is surprisingly low. We identify three features of the Ross River virus replication and transmission cycle which may limit the rate of evolution of arthropod-borne viruses in the field.
