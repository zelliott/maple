Dimerization with extradenticle or PBX homeoproteins dramatically improves DNA binding by HOX transcription factors, indicating that recognition by such complexes is important for HOX specificity. For HOX monomeric binding, a major determinant of specificity is the flexible N-terminal arm. It makes base-specific contacts via the minor groove, including one to the 1st position of a 5'-TNAT-3' core by a conserved arginine (Arg-5). Here we show that Arg-5 also contributes to the stability of HOX.PBX complexes, apparently by forming the same DNA contact. We further show that heterodimers of PBX with HOXA1 or HOXD4 proteins have different specificities at another position recognized by the N-terminal arm (the 2nd position in the TNAT core). Importantly, N-terminal arm residues 2 and 3, which distinguish the binding of HOXA1 and HOXD4 monomers, play no role in the specificity of their complexes with PBX. In addition, HOXD9 and HOXD10, which are capable of binding both TTAT and TAAT sites as monomers, can cooperate with PBX1A only on a TTAT site. These data suggest that some DNA contacts made by the N-terminal arm are altered by interaction with PBX.
