The biochemical properties of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) vary in different tissues, and different protein isoforms of the enzyme have been described. Alternative splicing of G6PD intron VII has been detected in transformed lymphoblasts, granulocytes and spermatocytes; the function of this mRNA species is still unknown. We developed a PCR for detecting alternatively spliced G6PD mRNA in K562 and in erythroblasts at different stage of maturation obtained from human peripheral BFU-E in order to evaluate a possible physiological role during erythroid maturation. Trace events of alternative splicing of G6PD intron VII sequences were observed in K562 cells but not in BFU-E-derived erythroid precursors; we consider this phenomenon a non-functional activity in the cells analysed.
