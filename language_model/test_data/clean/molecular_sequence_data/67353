Here we present a whole-genome shotgun sequence of Rhodococcus species strain JVH1, an organism capable of degrading a variety of organosulfur compounds. In particular, JVH1 is able to selectively cleave carbon-sulfur bonds within alkyl chains. A large number of oxygenases were identified, consistent with other members of the genus.
