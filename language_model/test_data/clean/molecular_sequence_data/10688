Six hundred and thirty primary breast cancer were screened for abnormalities in exons 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the TP53 tumour suppressor gene. Analysis of the structure of the TP53 gene exons was performed with the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) method and with direct sequencing of amplified DNA. In a breast tumour case from a postmenopausal patient, we found a deletion of 36 bp in intron 5 and no immunohistochemical staining for p53. We amplified and sequenced the cDNA region between exons 4 and 7 and showed that the deletion causes the skipping of exon 6. The resulting mRNA sequence had a frameshift that yields an inactive protein with a truncated C terminus. These results show the first example of intronic deletion causing exon skipping at the TP53 gene level.
