The N-glycosylation patterns of a genetically engineered human interleukin-2 variant glycoprotein (IL-Mu6), produced by BHK-21 cells from long-term suspension and microcarrier cultures in the presence and absence of fetal calf serum were compared. IL-Mu6 was used as a model protein in studying the effect of different controlled cell culture conditions on the expression of N-glycans in recombinant glycoproteins. IL-Mu6 contains a single amino acid substitution (Glu100<==>Asn) generating a potential N-glycosylation recognition site (Asn100-Xxx-Thr/Ser) in addition to the natural O-glycosylation at position Thr3. Parallel cell cultivations were carried out in two continuously perfused 2.5-liter stirred bioreactors under defined culture conditions. Major differences were found in the glycoprotein products obtained during these different cultivation conditions. Serum-free cultures resulted in a higher level of terminal sialylation and proximal alpha 1-6 fucosylation. The ratio of O- to N-glycans as well as the amount of nonglycosylated product and the antennarity of N-linked carbohydrates in the model protein exhibited major differences depending on the presence or absence of serum, the condition of growth and the cultivation procedure.
