Several studies have suggested that Otu domain had de-ubiquitinating activity and Tudor domain was important for the formation of germ cells. Here, we reported a novel zebrafish ovary-specific gene containing Otu and Tudor domain, z-otu, which was expressed at stages I-III oocytes and embryonic stages from zygotes to early blastula during embryonic cells maintained their totipotency. Therefore, z-otu might link the ubiquitin signaling pathway to early oogenesis and maintaining the totipotency of embryonic cell.
