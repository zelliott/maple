A synthetic library that presents potential pharmacophores in a linear fashion with variable spacing was designed (alpha, beta, gamma-library). To prove the concept, we synthesized a number of individual compounds as well as a model library. Diamino acids connected by amide bonds via their alpha- or side-chain amino groups were used to form the backbone (scaffold) of this library. The remaining amino group of the diamino acids were acylated by a variety of carboxylic acids, generating an appreciable diversity of compounds in this library. The compositions of compounds in the library were identified by reading a peptide tag synthesized concurrently with the library structures. This code contained the information regarding the carboxylic acid coupled, and the diamino acid and amino group to which the acid was coupled.
