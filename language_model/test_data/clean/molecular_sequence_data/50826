A combination of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction was utilized to detect baseline endothelin-1 (ET-1) mRNA expressed in renal tubules dissected from rats. 5' and 3' primers were constructed according to human ET-1 genomic DNA. Rat ET-1 mRNA was found to be expressed only in cortical through medullary collecting ducts in addition to glomeruli. Sites for tubular synthesis of ET-1 corroborate well with major ET-1 binding sites along the nephron, indicating autocrine/paracrine role of ET-1 in the renal tubules and supporting a prevailing concept on such function of ET-1 in many differing tissues.
