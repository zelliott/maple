Pseudomonas extremaustralis 14-3b presents genes involved in the synthesis of different polyhydroxyalkanoates, in tolerance and degradation of pollutants, and in microaerobic metabolism. Several genomic islands were detected. Genetic machinery could contribute to the adaptability to stressful conditions. This is the first genome sequence reported from a Pseudomonas isolated from cold environments.
