In order to understand the microspore and pollen development, recently, we have isolated a number of anther-specific genes in the model legume, Lotus japonicus. From these anther-specific genes, we identified one novel microspore-specific gene, LjImfb-c82. In order to determine the molecular characterization of LjImfb-c82, full-length cDNA clone was first isolated and sequenced. It encoded a protein of 286 amino acids (LjHIR1), which had sequence similarity to Hypersensitive-Induced Response like protein. LjHIR1 was specifically expressed in microspore on the in situ hybridization experiment. From the sequence similarity to prohibitin-domain protein, the LjHIR1 might be related to ion channel regulation in microspore development.
