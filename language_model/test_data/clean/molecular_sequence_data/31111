Immunoreactive gonadotropin-releasing hormone (ir-GnRH) was detected in brain extracts of newborn and 10-day-old rats and in adult guinea pigs; it was also present in extracts of the neural ganglion and gland of a protochordate. Radioimmunoassay (RIA) using different GnRH antisera after high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed that the dominant form of GnRH is the mammalian form (pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH2) both during ontogenesis in the rat and in the adult guinea pig known to have variant forms of other peptide hormones. None of the other forms of GnRH identified in nonmammalian species to date appear to be present in the rat or guinea pig. A small amount of an unidentified HPLC early eluting form of GnRH is present, but detection by antiserum B-6 implies that it is also mammalian GnRH, with the possibility of changes in positions 2-4. The molecular form of GnRH in a protochordate, the sea squirt Chelyosoma productum, is distinct from salmon and mammalian GnRHs. Cross-reactivity with the sea squirt GnRH-like molecule was highest with an antiserum made against lamprey GnRH; the same antiserum was used to stain nerve fibers in the neural ganglion and some of its roots. This is the first report using RIA, HPLC, and immunocytochemistry to show that protochordates have GnRH-like material. The results suggest that GnRH may have been present at the transition between the invertebrates and vertebrates.
