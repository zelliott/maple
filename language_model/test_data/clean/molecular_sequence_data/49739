Akt (also called protein kinase B) is one of the major downstream targets of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. This protein kinase has been implicated in insulin signaling, stimulation of cellular growth, and inhibition of apoptosis as well as transformation of cells. Although a number of cellular proteins have been identified as putative targets of the enzyme, additional substrates may play a role in the varied responses elicited by this enzyme. We have used a combination of 14-3-3 binding and recognition by an antibody to the phosphorylation consensus of the enzyme to identify and isolate one of the major substrates of Akt, which is also a 14-3-3 binding protein. This 40-kDa protein, designated PRAS40, is a proline-rich Akt substrate. Demonstration that it is a substrate of Akt was accomplished by showing that 1) PRAS40 was phosphorylated in vitro by purified Akt on the same site that was phosphorylated in insulin-treated cells; 2) activation of an inducible Akt was alone sufficient to stimulate the phosphorylation of PRAS40; and 3) cells lacking Akt1 and Akt2 exhibit a diminished ability to phosphorylate this protein. Thus, PRAS40 is a novel substrate of Akt, the phosphorylation of which leads to the binding of this protein to 14-3-3.
