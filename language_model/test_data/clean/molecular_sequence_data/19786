The calC2 mutation in Aspergillus nidulans causes hypersensitivity to Calcofluor White, along with other drug sensitivities that indicate a defect in cell wall integrity. We have cloned CalC by complementation, isolating the A. nidulans orthologue of protein kinase C (PkcA). The pkcA allele of the calC2 strain contains a mutation predicted to introduce a charged arginine residue in place of neutral glycine at a conserved site located immediately beside the C1B regulatory domain. Both PkcA and calC2 map to the same region of chromosome VIII. A PkcA::GFP chimera localizes to hyphal apices and growing septa, as well as to the conidiogenous apices of phialides, indicating a role for PkcA in polarized cell wall growth. These observations support the hypothesis that the role of PkcA in A. nidulans, is comparable to that played by Pkc1p in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall integrity pathway.
