This study assessed (1) T-cell responses following vaccination of HIV-1 negative volunteers with HIV-1LAI recombinant gp160 (rgp160) vaccine, and (2) effects of vaccine injection schedule and MHC HLA type on those responses. In one trial, volunteers received rgp160 in two accelerated schedules (Groups 1 and 2). In the other trial, volunteers received rgp160 vaccine at 0, 1, 6, and 12 months and some received vaccine at 18 months (Groups 3 and 4). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from vaccinees in Groups 3 and 4 were stimulated by more peptides representing envelope glycoprotein T-cell epitopes than Groups 1 and 2 (p = 0.01). Transient anti-envelope glycoprotein CTL activity was more frequently detectable in Groups 1 and 2 (p = 0.03). MHC HLA-Cw7, DR1 and DQw1 alleles appeared to be associated with PBMC responses to envelope glycoprotein.
