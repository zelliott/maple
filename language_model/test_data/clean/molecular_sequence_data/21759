We have previously described a novel artificial NFEV β-secretase (BACE1) cleavage site, which when introduced into the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), significantly enhances APP cleavage by BACE1 in in vitro and cellular assays. In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of a single chain fragment of variable region (scFv), specific to the EV neo-epitope derived from BACE1 cleavage of the NFEV-containing peptide, and its conversion to IgG1. Both the scFv displayed on phage and EV-IgG1 show exquisite specificity for binding to the EV neoepitope without cross-reactivity to other NFEV containing peptides or WT-APP KMDA cleavage products. EV-IgG1 can detect as little as 0.3 nmol/L of the EV peptide. EV-IgG1 antibody was purified, conjugated with alkaline phosphatase and utilized in various biological assays. In the BACE1 enzymatic assay using NFEV substrate, a BACE1 inhibitor MRK-3 inhibited cleavage with an IC(50) of 2.4 nmol/L with excellent reproducibility. In an APP_NFEV stable SH-SY5Y cellular assay, the EC(50) for inhibition of EV-Aβ peptide secretion with MRK-3 was 236 nmol/L, consistent with values derived using an EV polyclonal antibody. In an APP_NFEV knock-in mouse model, both Aβ_EV40 and Aβ_EV42 peptides in brain homogenate showed excellent gene dosage dependence. In conclusion, the EV neoepitope specific monoclonal antibody is a novel reagent for BACE1 inhibitor discovery for both in vitro, cellular screening assays and in vivo biochemical studies. The methods described herein are generally applicable to novel synthetic substrates and enzyme targets to enable robust screening platforms for enzyme inhibitors.
