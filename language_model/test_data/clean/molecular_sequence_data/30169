The patterns of protein synthesis in rat lenses ranging in age from newborn to 4 months were compared. After incubation of lenses in [35S]methionine-containing medium it was possible to identify the de novo synthesized crystallins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and fluorography, in combination with peptide mapping and immunoblotting. It was found that the relative synthesis of alpha A and beta A3 stays fairly constant in rat lenses of all investigated ages. The relative synthesis of beta B2 and gamma s shows a pronounced increase with age in these post-natal lenses. A differential decrease can be observed in the relative synthesis of the other six gamma-crystallins (gamma A-gamma F). There appears to be a good correlation between the changes in relative synthesis of the various crystallins and previously reported alterations in mRNA levels, although certain mRNAs exhibit marked differences in translational efficiency.
