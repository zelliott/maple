The cariogenic bacterium Streptococcus mutans attaches to tooth surfaces via a cell surface adhesin termed streptococcal antigen I/II (SA I/II). Mapping studies identified an adhesion epitope within residues 1025-1044. A synthetic peptide (p1025) spanning these residues inhibited adhesion of S. mutans in vitro and was tested in an in vivo human streptococcal adhesion model. Direct application of p1025 to the teeth prevented recolonisation of the oral cavity by S. mutans but not Actinomyces naeslundii. This review also describes various other adhesion-inhibiting peptides have been identified in vitro. We suggest that adhesion-blocking synthetic peptides may provide novel anti-infective agents. Topical application of such peptides at mucosal surfaces does not provide sustained selective pressure and in contrast to antibiotics, may not induce resistance.
