Immunodetection of thin layer chromatograms of neutral glycosphingolipids of pig kidney cortex with a polyclonal antibody directed against the Gal alpha 1-3Gal determinant revealed several glycosphingolipids reacting with different intensities. A minor glycosphingolipid was isolated by preparative high performance thin layer chromatography. It was characterized as a type 2 hexaglycosylceramide with the following structure Gal alpha 1-3Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-Cer by fast atom bombardment- and desorption-chemical ionization-mass spectrometry, methylation analysis and hydrolysis with alpha-galactosidase followed by immunostaining with an anti-Lewis(x) monoclonal antibody. The proton NMR spectrum was found compatible with the proposed structure. Two other glycosphingolipids carrying the new determinant were partially characterized as an octa- and a branched-dodecaglycosylceramide. The expression of the Gal alpha 1-3 Lewis(x) determinant appeared to be developmentally regulated as it increased with age. The characterization of Gal alpha 1-3Le(x) in pig kidney indicates a new epitope capable of recognition by human natural antibodies in the context of xenotransplantation of pig organs to man. It also adds new members to the family of Le(x)-based glycolipids.
