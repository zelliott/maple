Genomic DNA size was measured in clinical isolates of Haemophilus influenzae by Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis of DNA restriction fragments. Because of the high (64%) A+T content of H. influenzae DNA, restriction enzymes that recognize sequences with at least four GC base pairs were expected to be rare cutters. Five enzymes that produced fragments greater than 200 kb in size were used to digest intact chromosomes and fragments resolved by TAFE and/or FIGE: ApaI (GGGCCC), EagI (CGGCCG), NotI (GCGGCCGC), RsrI (CGGA/TCCG), and SmaI (CCCGGG). All five had recognition sequences with at least six GC base pairs. The genomic DNA size of H. influenzae serotype b, estimated with ApaI, EagI, NotI, RsrII, and SmaI, is 1,950 kb.
