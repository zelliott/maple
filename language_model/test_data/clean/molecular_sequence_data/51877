In Drosophila melanogaster males, X-Y meiotic chromosome pairing is mediated by the nucleolus organizers (NOs) which are located in the X heterochromatin (Xh) and near the Y centromere. Deficiencies for Xh disrupt X-Y meiotic pairing and cause high frequencies of X-Y nondisjunction. Insertion of cloned rRNA genes on an Xh- chromosome partially restores normal X-Y pairing and disjunction. To map the sequences within an inserted, X-linked rRNA gene responsible for stimulating X-Y pairing, partial deletions were generated by P element-mediated destabilization of the insert. Complete deletions of the rRNA transcription unit did not interfere with the ability to stimulate X-Y pairing as long as most of the intergenic spacer (IGS) remained. Within groups of deletions that lacked the entire transcription unit and differed only in length of residual IGS material, pairing ability was proportional to the dose of 240-bp intergenic spacer repeats. Deletions of the complete rRNA transcription unit or the 28S sequences alone blocked nucleolus formation, as determined by binding of an antinucleolar antibody, yet did not interfere with pairing ability, suggesting that X-Y pairing may not be mechanistically related to nucleolus formation. A model for achiasmatic pairing in Drosophila males based upon the combined action of topoisomerase I and a strand transferase is proposed.
