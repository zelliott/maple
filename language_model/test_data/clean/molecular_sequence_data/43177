The docking of transport vesicles with their target membrane is thought to be mediated by p115. We show here that GM130, a cis-Golgi matrix protein, interacts specifically with p115 and so could provide a membrane docking site. Deletion analysis showed that the N-terminus binds to p115, whereas the C-terminus binds to Golgi membranes. Mitotic phosphorylation of GM130 or a peptide derived from the N-terminus prevented binding to p115. The peptide also inhibited the NSF- but not the p97-dependent reassembly of Golgi cisternae from mitotic fragments, unless it was mitotically phosphorylated. Together, these data provide a molecular explanation for the COPI-mediated fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus at the onset of mitosis.
