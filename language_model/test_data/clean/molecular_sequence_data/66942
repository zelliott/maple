The D-type cyclin genes play key roles in plant development of Arabidopsis. To investigate the functions of cyclins in monocots, a putative ortholog of cyclin D2 genes was isolated from wheat shoot tissues, and designated as Triae;CYCD2;1. The transcripts of Triae;CYCD2;1 were primarily localized in the proliferating tissues, particularly, in shoot apical meristem and leaf primordia of wheat plants. Ectopic expression of Triae;CYCD2;1 in Arabidopsis affected plant morphology and retarded plant growth. Further examination showed that the promotion of cell division and the inhibition of cell differentiation occurred in both transgenic plants and tissues. In vitro experiments indicated that Triae;CYCD2;1 had functional roles in responding to cytokinin and auxin. Molecular analysis revealed that the transcript levels of several cell cycle-associated genes, particularly Arath;CYCD3;1, were increased in the Arabidopsis plants with the expressing Triae;CYCD2;1. The results in this study provide new information on D-type cyclin in wheat.
