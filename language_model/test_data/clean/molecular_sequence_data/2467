We have discovered a new restriction endonuclease, MfeI, in nuclear extracts from T cells contaminated with Mycoplasma fermentans. This endonuclease was identified while studying proteins binding to the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain gene promoter. MfeI cuts at the recognition sequence C'AATTG generating EcoRI compatible cohesive ends. Potential applications are discussed.
