The 1509 bp cryptic plasmid, pPF1, from Phormidium foveolarum, a strain of filamentous cyanobacteria of the LPP group, was completely sequenced. The pPF1 nucleotide sequence had 97.8% overall similarity with that of a small plasmid from Plectonema boryanum. The structural organization of pPF1 and vector construction are discussed.
