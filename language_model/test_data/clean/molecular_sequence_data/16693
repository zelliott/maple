DNA-methylation profiles of leaf tissues of Rosa hybrida cv. Carefree Beauty collected from in vivo-grown greenhouse plants, in vitro-grown proliferating shoots at different passages, regenerants of embryogenic callus, regenerants of organogenic callus, as well as calli from undifferentiated callus (UC), embryogenic callus, and organogenic callus were investigated using an amplified fragment-length polymorphism (AFLP)-based detection technique. Three types of AFLP bands were recovered. Type I bands were observed with both isoschizomers Msp and HpaII, while type II and type III bands were observed only with MspI and HpaII, respectively. Sequence analysis of the three types of AFLP bands revealed that a nonmethylated MspI/HpaII-recognition site 5'-CCGG-3' resulted in a type I band, while an inner 5-methylcytosine generated most type II and type III bands. About 40% of inner and 20% of outer cytosines in 5'-CCGG-3' sequences were fully methylated, and only a few hemimethylated outer cytosines were observed. Changes in types of AFLP bands among different tissues were frequently observed, including appearance and disappearance of type I, II, and III AFLP bands, as well as exchanges between either type I and type II or type I and type III AFLP bands. Methylation alterations of outer cytosines in 5'-CCGG-3' sequences triggered appearance and disappearance of type I and II AFLP bands. Methylation changes of both outer and inner cytosines resulted in either removal or generation of type III AFLP bands. Methylation alteration of an inner cytosine was responsible for exchange between type I and type II, while hemimethylation of an outer cytosine accounted for exchange between type I and type III AFLP bands. During UC induction, a significant DNA-methylation alteration was detected in both inner and outer cytosines. Variations in methylation profiles significantly differed between somatic embryogenesis and in vitro organogenesis. Demethylation of outer cytosines occurred at a high frequency during somatic embryogenesis, and most altered AFLP bands in embryogenic callus were passed on to its regenerants. However, most methylation-altered AFLP bands during organogenesis were recovered in shoot regenerants derived via organogenic callus. Seven tissue-specific bands were isolated, cloned, and sequenced. Blast search revealed that two of these might be derived from functional genes.
