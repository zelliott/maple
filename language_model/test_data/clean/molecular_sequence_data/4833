As a step in the evolutionary studies of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and for the purpose of developing new reagents that will facilitate a more detailed analysis of IgE-mediated inflammatory reactions in a large animal model, we here present the cloning of the epsilon chain of IgE in the domestic pig (Sus scrufa). A partial cDNA clone for the epsilon chain of pig IgE was isolated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using degenerate primers directed against conserved regions in the second (CH2) and the fourth (CH4) constant domains of IgE. cDNA derived from mRNA isolated from the spleen and lymph nodes of a pig actively sensitized with a protein extract from the nematode Ascaris suum was used as template. Screening of a spleen cDNA library with the partial cDNA clone as probe resulted in isolation of a clone that contained the entire coding region. The nucleotide sequence was determined and was found to conform with the previously identified mammalian epsilon-chain sequences. The highest degree of similarity was found to sheep IgE. A DNA construct encoding a baculovirus signal sequence, a histidine hexapeptide, and the CH2-CH3-CH4 domains of the pig IgE epsilon chain was obtained by PCR amplification. The construct was ligated into the baculovirus expression vector pVL1392. Infection of High Five insect cells with recombinant baculovirus resulted in expression and secretion of a soluble 6 x His-CH2-CH3-CH4 protein product.
