The teleost non-specific cytotoxic cells (NCC) are evolutionary precursors of the mammalian natural killer (NK) cells and an important element of innate immunity. The non-specific cytotoxic cell receptor protein (NCCRP1) is a characteristic cell surface protein with main functions in target cell recognition and cytotoxicity with sequence information available for many species of fish. We have isolated a cDNA encoding the Axolotl homologue of fish NCCRP1 out of limb regeneration blastema and analysed its expression by RT-PCR. Sequence analysis revealed a high degree of homology with teleost NCCRP1 on nucleotide and deduced amino acid levels. NCCRP1 contains a conserved C-terminal F-box-associated domain (FBA) and proline-rich motifs (PRM) characteristic for this protein family. NCCRP1 is expressed in multiple tissues with high levels in limb regeneration blastema. The present work describes for the first time the cloning of the NCCRP1 gene in a tetrapod vertebrate providing a valuable link between fish and higher vertebrates. Our findings suggest the existence of NCC in axolotl and a role of the innate immune system in the processes of limb regeneration.
