Elevated levels of intracellular calcium are a major cause of myocardial dysfunction. To find possible mediators of the deregulated calcium we searched for EF-hand calcium-binding proteins of the S100 family. By PCR technology we identified three members of the S100 protein family (S100 alpha, CACY, and CAPL) in the human heart. We cloned the corresponding cDNAs and examined their expression levels in various human tissues by Northern blot analysis. All three proteins are expressed at high levels in the human heart. Whereas CACY and CAPL mRNAs are expressed ubiquitously, S100 alpha mRNA is restricted to heart, skeletal muscle, and brain. Interestingly, the expression pattern of S100 alpha, CACY, and CAPL in human tissues differs significantly from that in rodent tissues.
