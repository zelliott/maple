About 30% of the primary structure of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) from the cobra Naja naja oxiana has been determined. The sequence around the serine residue labeled by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) was found to be TVTLFGESAGAASVGM which is similar to the active sites of AChE from other tissues. The part of the primary structure determined shows 76% identity with AChE from Torpedo and 42% identity with the Drosophila enzyme. A surprisingly large identity (42% in the sequence determined) was found with lysophospholipase from rat.
