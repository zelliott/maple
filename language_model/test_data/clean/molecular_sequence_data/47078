In here we report the identification of two new members of the T-box gene family, zf-tbx5 and zf-tbx4, from the Zebrafish, Danio rerio. The amino acid sequences within the T-box domain share high homology with the mouse, chick, and newt orthologs. Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed specific expression of these genes in the eye and Fin buds. zf-tbx5 expression is restricted to the pectoral Fin bud, whilst zf-tbx4 transcripts are confined in the pelvic Fin bud. These results reveal the conserved expression pattern of Tbx5 and Tbx4 during appendage development in all animal species studied to date.
