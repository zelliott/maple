Screening of an anther cDNA expression library resulted in the isolation of two almost identical cDNA clones, termed mipA and mipB, showing homology with sequences encoding transmembrane channel proteins from the MIP family. Both clones were expressed in several tissues, but not in pollen. MipA was preferentially expressed in the surrounding sporophytic tissues of stamens. Anthers subjected to drought were induced to accumulate even more mip transcripts, which was entirely due to higher mipA gene expression. On basis of isolation procedures, sequence homology and drought inducibility of mipA we conclude that the encoded proteins probably are constituents of the pollen coat and are aquaporins.
