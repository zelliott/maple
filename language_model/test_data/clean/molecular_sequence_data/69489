We have isolated a clone from a Theileria parva infected lymphocyte cDNA library which has the potential to encode a protein of 480 amino acids. This protein is particularly rich in glutamine and proline and has some short repeated amino acid motifs based on the sequences QPXP and QPXQ. We have called it the 'QP protein'. Southern blotting suggests that the QP protein gene is present as a single copy in the T. parva Muguga genome. Northern blotting revealed that the gene is transcribed in both schizonts and piroplasms. We have expressed part of the QP protein as a fusion with glutathione S-transferase in Escherichia coli and used this product to raise an anti-QP protein serum. Western blots of T. parva lysates using this serum showed a major polypeptide of approximately 100 kDa and two further polypeptides of approximately 67 and 72 kDa. Indirect immunofluorescence assays using the anti-QP protein serum on infected cells showed that the protein is associated with the schizont. The pattern of staining in the indirect immunofluorescence assays and the structure of the protein suggest that it is a component of the schizont membrane.
