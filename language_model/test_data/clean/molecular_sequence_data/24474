Cyclophilin (CyP) is one of the enzymes that act as peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerases (EC 5.2.1.8). The cDNA and an intronless gene coding for cytosolic CyP have been isolated from yellow lupine. The deduced amino acid sequence of the characterized open reading frame shows approximately 80% homology with cytosolic CyP from other organisms. Southern blots of genomic DNA indicate that there is a small family of genes for CyP-related genes in the yellow lupine genome. RNA blot analyses demonstrate that CyP genes are expressed in all plant organs. The amount of CyP transcripts is dramatically increased in root nodules. In situ hybridization experiments indicate that CyP transcripts are localized mainly in meristematic tissues, with the highest level observed in the nodule meristem zone. The promoter of the sequenced gene contains 5' AAAGAT 3' and AT-rich motifs that are characteristic for some nodulin promoters.
