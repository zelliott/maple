The 4942 bp DNA sequence of Zea mays transposon MuA2 was determined. Previous evidence indicated MuA2 controls activity of the Mu1 transposon located in the mutable allele a1-mum2. MuA2 contains two large, ATG-initiated open reading frames (ORFs) of 612 and 232 codons, respectively, located on opposite strands. MuA2 produces two transcripts, each containing one of these ORFs. Four different tandem direct repeat sequences are located downstream of the 612 codon ORF. The restriction map of MuA2 is identical to that of transposon MuR1, which also is known to regulate mutability of a1-mum2. Furthermore, except for a single nucleotide, MuA2 is identical to the Mutator element Mu9.
