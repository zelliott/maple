The complete amino acid sequence of a 14 kDa structural protein (LM-76) isolated from pharate cuticle of the locust, Locusta migratoria, was determined by Edman degradation of the intact protein and enzymatically derived peptides. Plasma desorption and electrospray mass spectrometry was used as an integrated part of the structure determination. Protein Lm-76 has characteristics similar to proteins previously isolated from the pharate locust. The amino acid composition shows a high content of alanine (32%) and absence of the amino acids Glu, Cys, Met, Phe and Trp. The sequence has a central hydrophilic region surrounded by two hydrophobic regions with 7 repeats of a (Tyr)-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala/Val motif. The conservation around the prolyl residues within this sequence motif is demonstrated for the hitherto sequenced presumptive exocuticle proteins from L. migratoria. The N-terminal region of protein Lm-76 is enriched in the amino acids Gly, Leu and Tyr located in the conserved sequence NH2-Gly-Tyr-Leu-Gly-Gly-(Tyr)-.
