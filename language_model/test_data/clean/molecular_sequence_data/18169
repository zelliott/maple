The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify genomic DNA of several wheat genotypes. The oligonucleotides used as primers were the terminal sequences of a gamma-gliadin gene. The electrophoretic analysis of the PCR products showed specific bands which revealed both inter- and intra-specific genetic polymorphism among the examined genotypes. The technique is proposed as a very simple and efficient alternative to RFLP markers.
