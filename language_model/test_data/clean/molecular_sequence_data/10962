Site-directed mutagenesis was used to assess the contribution of individual residues and a bound calcium in the 55-69 region of the thermolysin-like protease of Bacillus stearothermophilus (TLP-ste) to thermal stability. The importance of the 55-69 region was reflected by finding that almost all mutations had drastic effects on stability. These effects (both stabilizing and destabilizing) were obtained by mutations affecting main chain flexibility, as well as by mutations affecting the interaction between the 55-69 region and the rest of the protease molecule. The calcium-dependency of stability could be largely abolished by mutating one of its ligands (Asp57 or Asp59). In the case of the Asp57-->Ser mutation, the accompanying loss in stability was modest compared with the effects of other destabilizing mutations or the effects of (combinations of) stabilizing mutations. The detailed knowledge of the stability-determining region of TLP-ste permits effective rational design of stabilizing mutations, which, presumably, are also useful for related TLP such as thermolysin. This is demonstrated by the successful design of a stabilizing salt bridge involving residues 65 and 11.
