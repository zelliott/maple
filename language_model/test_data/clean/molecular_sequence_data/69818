A porcine glucosephosphate isomerase-processed pseudogene has been isolated and sequenced. The pseudogene has several base substitutions as well as an insertion and deletions, and is 83% homologous to the corresponding cDNA. It contains an intervening sequence of 565 bp, is truncated at the 3' end, and is flanked by direct repeats of seven nucleotides. Fluorescent in situ hybridization to porcine metaphase chromosomes localized the processed pseudogene to Chromosome (Chr) 1q1.6-1.7. A (GT)14(AT)15 microsatellite was detected close to the processed pseudogene.
