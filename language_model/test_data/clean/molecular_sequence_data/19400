Only limited but contrasting reports are available on microsatellites based population structure of Plasmodium vivax. Further, there is complete lack of information on microsatellites in the flanking regions of the P. vivax drug resistance genes to trace the origin and spread of the drug resistant vivax malaria. Therefore, we scanned +/-300 kb flanking sequences of the P. vivax dihydrofolate reductase (pvdhfr) gene for di-nucleotide microsatellite repeats with minimum of 8 unit array length. Only 13 such repeats were detected in this region as compared to 738 di-nucleotide repeats present in +/-300 kb flanking region of P. falciparumdhfr gene. We have analyzed here the nucleotide sequence of 110 Indian P. vivax isolates for four of these di-nucleotide microsatellites (two in the nearest regions at -38.83 kb and +6.15 kb, and two in the farthest regions at -230.54 kb and +283.28 kb). All the four microsatellites were found to be highly polymorphic in the population where number of alleles varied from 4 to 10 with the median values of 9-11 at these loci. The expected heterozygosity (He) at these loci ranged from 0.50 to 0.82. We did not find any association between pvdhfr mutations and the flanking microsatellite alleles. There was a regional variation in the microsatellites polymorphism which was not associated with the reported prevalent rates of drug resistance or malaria transmission. In conclusion, the level of microsatellite polymorphism in P. vivax is as high as in P. falciparum. These results will be valuable in understanding the evolutionary history of the pvdhfr alleles as well as for designing the malaria control strategies.
