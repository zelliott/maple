The function of the p12(I) protein of human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) has been under debate. p12K (lysine) and p12R (arginine) variants of this protein at amino acid 88 and a shorter life of p12K had been reported by another group. Because HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) patients usually have a higher provirus load than asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers (ACs), and p12(I) had been suggested to confer a proliferative effect on HTLV-I-infected cells in vitro, it is possible that the relatively unstable p12K is less frequent in HAM/TSP patients than in ACs. To elucidate whether p12K and other alterations in the p12 gene were related to the outcome of HTLV-I infection, we sequenced the p12 gene in 144 HAM/TSP patients, 41 adult T cell leukemia (ATL) patients, and in 46 ACs. p12K was observed in only two HAM/TSP patients, but was not present in either ATL patients or ACs. Interestingly, a premature termination codon in the p12 was observed in 5.6% of HAM/TSP patients and in 4.9% of ATL patients but none was found in ACs. The p12 initiation codon was destroyed in one HAM/TSP patient. These HTLV-I variants with truncated p12 protein or with a destroyed initiation codon in the p12 gene appeared to have been transmitted in the subjects' families. These findings suggest that p12 is dispensable for the transmission and maintenance of HTLV-I infection, although it is premature to conclude that sequence varitation in the p12 gene is associated with differences in the outcome of HTLV-I infection.
