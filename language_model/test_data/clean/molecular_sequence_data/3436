Silene latifolia is a dioecious plant and has heteromorphic sex chromosomes: the X and Y chromosomes. The Y chromosome is the largest, and its genetic control seems to be most strict among dioecious plants. To identify the putative sex-determination elements on the Y chromosome, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was used to screen for Y chromosome specific DNA fragments, and 31 clones were successfully produced. Genomic Southern hybridization and FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) analyses revealed that one of the clones, #2-2, is a Y chromosome specific fragment that has a single copy on the Y chromosome. Sequence tagged site (STS)-PCR analysis also succeeded in amplifying one fragment in males and no fragments in females. Cloning and sequencing of the #2-2 flanking region using inverse PCR revealed an open reading frame (ORF) corresponding to 285 amino acids in length (ORF285), but no expression of the ORF285 gene was identified. ORF285 may be a clue to the origin of dioecy.
