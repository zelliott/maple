Chickens from both broiler and broiler breeder pullet flocks experiencing symptoms of chicken anemia virus (CAV) infection were first observed at the Poultry Health Research Laboratory at the University of Arkansas in September 1992. Flocks had experienced higher than normal mortality with subcutaneous hemorrhages on the wings, neck, and thorax. Postmortem and histopathologic evaluation revealed thymus and bursal atrophy and lesions consistent with those reported for CAV infection. Because this infection had not previously been observed by Poultry Health Research Laboratory personnel in Arkansas-grown chickens, the establishment of a definitive diagnosis was deemed important. The presence of CAV was established by infecting MSB-1 cells with pooled liver homogenates from groups of 10 specific-pathogen-free chickens that had previously been inoculated in an attempt to experimentally reproduce the disease observed in the field. Cytopathic effects in the infected MSB-1 cells were first evident following the fifth passage. Indirect fluorescent antibody technique identified infected MSB-1 cells following at least five blind passages. To further confirm the presence of CAV, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used to amplify a specific portion of the virus genome from infected MSB-1 cells and tissue extracts from several submitted chickens. Sequence analysis of a 186-bp PCR amplification product revealed that the Arkansas isolate was very similar to the Cuxhaven-1 isolate (99.5% sequence identity).
