We had shown that production of quinolinic acid is high in the brain of epilepsy-prone El mice and that this is due to an increase in the activity of 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase (3-HAO, EC 1.13.11.6). We demonstrated here that the level of mRNA for 3-HAO was markedly increased in the brain of El mice.
