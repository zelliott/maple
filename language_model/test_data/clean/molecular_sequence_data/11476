Cyclins are a complex group of proteins involved in regulation of the eukaryotic cell division cycle via their interaction with cyclin dependent kinases (Cdks). Cyclin gene sequences have been cloned from a number of plant species, including alfalfa, but the diversity of these genes suggests that there are many plant cyclins which have yet to be characterized. A RACE-PCR strategy has been adopted for cloning cyclin gene sequences expressed during direct somatic embryogenesis in alfalfa. RT-PCR with nested degenerate primers was used to amplify the highly conserved "cyclin box" region of a novel A-like cyclin mRNA sequence expressed after induction of somatic embryogenesis. The sequence of this PCR product was used to design primers for 5'- and 3'-RACE protocols. 5'-RACE using a modified SLIC (single strand ligation to single stranded cDNA) procedure revealed considerable sequence heterogeneity in the N-terminal region of the coding sequence with several closely related sequences apparent. Conventional 3'-RACE generated a single cyclin sequence. The complete coding sequence of one member of this A-like cyclin subgroup has been obtained by this RACE strategy and confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing of alfalfa genomic DNA.
