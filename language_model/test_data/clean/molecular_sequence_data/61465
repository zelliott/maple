Human isolates of the highly prevalent TT virus (TTV) have been classified into five major genomic groups (1-5). The geographical distribution of the groups throughout the world is not well known. Five different PCR assays were developed in an attempt to amplify specifically TTV DNAs of each genomic group. Serum samples collected from 72 Brazilian adults (24 voluntary blood donors, 24 hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers, and 24 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients) were tested. TTV DNA from at least one genomic group was detected in 11 (46%) blood donors, 13 (54%) HBV carriers, and 24 (100%) HIV-1 patients. All five genomic groups were detected in the three populations, with the exception of group 2 in blood donors. Some samples, negative with all five specific assays, were positive with the commonly used untranslated region (UTR) PCR system. On the other hand, TTV DNA was detected in some samples by using specific assays but not with the UTR PCR. Mixed infections with 2-5 TTV isolates from different groups were detected in 21% blood donors, 29% HBV carriers, and 71% HIV-1 patients. Fifteen PCR products (three obtained with each assay) were sequenced. Most sequences showed high (>86%) homology with those of TTV isolates belonging to their presumed groups. However, three sequences had low homology with all TTV sequences available from the DNA databanks. In conclusion, TTV isolates belonging to all five known genomic groups circulate in Brazil, and the results suggest the existence of new and as yet uncharacterised major genomic groups.
