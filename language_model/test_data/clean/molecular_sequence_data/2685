The annexins are a family of calcium-binding proteins. Data from protein and cDNA sequencing have shown that at least five distinct but closely related mammalian annexins exist each of which possesses four or eight homologous internal repeats which may be calcium-and phospholipid-binding domains. The proteins are present within a wide range of tissues and cell types, with each cell type having all or a subset of the proteins. The proteins are localised on the inner surface of the plasma membrane associated with the cytoskeleton and in some cases also with intracellular structures. Some members of the family are major substrates for tyrosine and serine kinases. The precise functions of the proteins are unknown but they are likely to play important roles in cellular regulation. Previously suggested functions are inhibition of phospholipase A2, membrane-cytoskeletal linkage and control of membrane fusion events in exocytosis. It is also suggested that they may be involved in the regulation of cell surface receptors.
