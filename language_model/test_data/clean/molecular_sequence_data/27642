Factor IX (F.IX) is a vitamin K-dependent plasma protein, a deficiency of which results in hemophilia B. A canine model of hemophilia B exists; attempts to use this model for gene transfer experiments or characterization of the hemophilic defect require elucidation of normal canine F.IX structure. We report the isolation and characterization of the coding region for canine F.IX cDNA. Canine F.IX possesses 86% identity at the amino-acid level with human F.IX. The leader peptide, Gla domain, EGF domains, and the carboxy-terminal portion of the heavy chains show extensive sequence conservation between the canine and human. All Glu residues undergoing gamma-carboxylation in humans are conserved in canines. The complete coding sequence for canine F.IX has been determined, and the derived translation product has been analyzed. A similar approach should allow identification of the causative mutation in canine hemophilia B. Furthermore, this clone may prove a valuable resource in gene transfer experiments for this disease.
