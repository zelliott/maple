We previously identified a 66 kDa axonemal protein (Ci-Axp66.0) in sperm of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. Here we found that Ci-Axp66.0 shows sequence similarity to the DC2 subunit of the Chlamydomonas outer arm docking complex. Analysis of secondary structure of Ci-Axp66.0 suggested that the N-terminal two-thirds of the molecule is rich in coiled coil structure, as in Chlamydomonas DC2. Immunogold localization revealed that it is located in the vicinity of outer arm dynein. Ci-Axp66.0 was partly extracted from the axonemes by a high salt solution and co-purified with outer arm dynein. This co-purification was not affected by the absence of Mg(2+) in isolation buffer, indicating that Ci-Axp66.0 is associated with outer arm dynein. These results suggest that Ci-Axp66.0 is a component of the outer arm dynein docking complex in the axonemes of Ciona sperm.
