A novel gonadotropin hormone releasing hormone analog, (D-Phe6,Gln8,des-Gly10)GnRH ethylamide, has been developed in our laboratory which stimulates not only ovulation but also follicular maturation in various kinds of fish and mammals. A large-scale liquid phase synthesis has been worked out for this analog. The synthetic product was characterized for structure and purity by various physicochemical methods. Though its structure was derived from the native chicken type I sequence, this peptide was one of the most effective analogs among those reported so far in the literature for artificial propagation of fish. The peptide was effective both during and out of spawning season. It was also potent in treating various sexual disorders such as anestrous, inactive ovaries and follicular cysts in cows.
