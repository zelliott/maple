We investigated, using PCR-SSCP analysis, the relationship between schizophrenia and the polymorphism of d-benzphetamine N-demethylase (cytochrome P-450j or CYP2E1), which metabolizes psychotropic substances such as d-benzphetamine and alcohols. Among 41 patients with schizophrenia, no statistically significant change in the frequency of the mutant (C2) allele relative to in controls was found, and no novel structural mutation in the CYP2E1 gene, which would be expected to alter the CYP2E1 protein, was found. This could be explained by no linkage of the CYP2E1 gene (mutations in the exon 1-9, and C1/C2 polymorphism) to schizophrenia.
