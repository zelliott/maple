We have identified two discrete transactivation domains within the mouse oestrogen receptor whose relative activities vary according to the target promoter. One domain lies within the N-terminal region and is active in the absence of oestradiol. The second domain is contained within the C-terminal portion of the protein and depends upon oestrogen binding for its activity. The location and oestrogen dependence of this domain has been confirmed using chimaeric receptors containing the Lex A DNA binding domain. Although transactivation by the C-terminal domain is dependent upon ligand binding the analysis of receptor deletion mutants has demonstrated that these two functions are not entirely coincident.
