We have demonstrated that calf liver protein disulfide-isomerase (Mr 57,000) is a substrate for calf thymus thioredoxin reductase and catalyzes NADPH-dependent insulin disulfide reduction. This reaction can be used as a simple assay for protein disulfide-isomerase during purification in place of the classical method of reactivation of incorrectly oxidized ribonuclease A. Protein disulfide-isomerase contains two redox-active disulfides/molecule which were reduced by NADPH and calf thioredoxin reductase (Km approximately 35 microM). The isomerase was a poor substrate for NADPH and Escherichia coli thioredoxin reductase, but the addition of E. coli thioredoxin resulted in rapid reduction of two disulfides/molecule. Tryptophan fluorescence spectra were shown to monitor the redox state of protein disulfide-isomerase. Fluorescence measurements demonstrated that thioredoxin--(SH)2 reduced the disulfides of the isomerase and allowed the kinetics of the reaction to be followed; the reaction was also catalyzed by calf thioredoxin reductase. Equilibrium measurements showed that the apparent redox potential of the active site disulfide/dithiols of the thioredoxin domains of protein disulfide-isomerase was about 30 mV higher than the disulfide/dithiol of E. coli thioredoxin. Consistent with this, experiments using dithiothreitol or NADPH and thioredoxin reductase-dependent reduction and precipitation of insulin demonstrated differences between protein disulfide-isomerase and thioredoxin, thioredoxin being a better disulfide reductase but less efficient isomerase. Protein disulfide-isomerase is thus a high molecular weight member of the thioredoxin system, able to interact with both mammalian NADPH-thioredoxin reductase and reduced thioredoxin. This may be important for nascent protein disulfide formation and other thiol-dependent redox reactions in cells.
