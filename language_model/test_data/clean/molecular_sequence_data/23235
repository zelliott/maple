The present experiments were designed to study the importance of the carboxy-terminus of HKalpha2, for both function and integrity of assembly with beta1-Na+,K+-ATPase.

For this purpose, stop codons were created, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), at different positions in the carboxy-terminus of HKalpha2. Subsequently, chimeras between HKalpha2 and the carboxy-terminus of alpha1-Na+,K+-ATPase or with the carboxy-terminus of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase were created. Human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells were used as expression systems for functional studies using 86Rb+ uptake and alpha/beta assembly using specific antibodies.

The results demonstrate that the entire carboxy-terminus of HKalpha2 is required for optimal protection of the alpha/beta complex from degradation and for functionality as evidenced by 86Rb+ uptake. The results also demonstrate that there was flexibility in the sequence of the carboxy-terminus. The last two tyrosines (Y1035Y1036) of HKalpha2 could be mutated to alanines and the carboxy-terminus of HKalpha2 could be replaced by the carboxy-terminus of alpha1-Na+,K+-ATPase while preserving transport activity.

The entire carboxy-terminus of HKalpha2 is required for stable assembly with beta1-Na+,K+-ATPase and functionality.
