We have studied the inhibitory effect of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides on the expression of hepatitis B virus surface antigens. Human hepatoma cell line PLC/PRF/5 harbors several integrated copies of the HBV genome and produces and secretes hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) to the medium. Synthetic antisense oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to various regions of the surface antigen gene were synthesized and their ability to block its expression was tested. Oligodeoxynucleotides (17- and 21-mers) complementary to regions covering ATG codons of both preS2 and S genes significantly inhibited preS2 and S protein production. Less efficient inhibition was achieved when the oligonucleotide complementary to the inside S gene region was assayed.
