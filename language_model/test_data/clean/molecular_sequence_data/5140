Acanthamoeba castellanii transcription initiation factor-IB (TIF-IB) is the TATA-binding protein-containing transcription factor that binds the rRNA promoter to form the committed complex. Minor groove-specific drugs inhibit TIF-IB binding, with higher concentrations needed to disrupt preformed complexes because of drug exclusion by bound TIF-IB. TIF-IB/DNA interactions were mapped by hydroxyl radical and uranyl nitrate footprinting. TIF-IB contacts four minor grooves in its binding site. TIF-IB and DNA wrap around each other in a right-handed superhelix of high pitch, so the upstream and downstream contacts are on opposite faces of the helix. Dimethyl sulfate protection assays revealed limited contact with a few guanines in the major groove. This detailed analysis suggests significant DNA conformation dependence of the interaction.
