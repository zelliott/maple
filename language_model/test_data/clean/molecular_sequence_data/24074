We have isolated and characterized the porcine testis-specific phosphoglycerate kinase 2 (PGK2) gene, and 1665 bp of full-length PGK2 cDNA were also compiled using modified rapid amplification 5'-RACE and 3'-RACE information. The results of genomic and cDNA sequences of the porcine PGK2 gene demonstrated that it is a single-exon intronless gene with a complete open reading frame of 1251 bp encoding a PGK protein of 417 amino acids. Real-time quantitative PCR results showed that PGK2 mRNA was solely expressed in the testis. There was a lower amount of PGK2 expression in the testis of a 10-month-old herniated boar and a very small amount of PGK2 expression in the testis of an 8-week-old cryptorchid piglet compared to an adult boar. Two SNPs in the PGK2 gene (SNP-A: T427C; SNP-B: C914A) resulting in amino acid substitutions (SNP-A: Ser102-Pro102; SNP-B: Thr264-Lys264) were detected and genotyped among six pig breeds. The nucleotide C at SNP-A responsible for the amino acid exchange to proline could lead to the loss of a casein kinase II (CK2) phosphorylation site in the PGK2 peptide. Association analyses between PGK2 genotypes and several traits of sperm quantity and quality were performed. The results showed that SNP-B has a positive significant effect on semen volume in the breed Pietrain (p = 0.08), i.e., boars carrying genotype CC revealed an increased volume of 49 ml compared with boars having the genotype AA.
