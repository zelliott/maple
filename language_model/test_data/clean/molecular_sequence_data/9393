The untranscribed DNA sequences of the intergenic spacer regions (ISRs) in the groESL gene of 23 Vibrio species were determined and compared. ISR sequence length (41-85 bp) was variable. Vibrio species could be divided into three groups according to the length and homology of their ISR sequences. DNA array hybridization using ISR-specific probes accurately distinguished Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus from other species.
