Quenching of the fluorescence of buried tryptophans (Trps) is an important reporter of protein conformation. Human gammaD-crystallin (HgammaD-Crys) is a very stable eye lens protein that must remain soluble and folded throughout the human lifetime. Aggregation of non-native or covalently damaged HgammaD-Crys is associated with the prevalent eye disease mature-onset cataract. HgammaD-Crys has two homologous beta-sheet domains, each containing a pair of highly conserved buried tryptophans. The overall fluorescence of the Trps is quenched in the native state despite the absence of the metal ligands or cofactors. We report the results of detailed quantitative measurements of the fluorescence emission spectra and the quantum yields of numerous site-directed mutants of HgammaD-Crys. From fluorescence of triple Trp to Phe mutants, the homologous pair Trp68 and Trp156 were found to be extremely quenched, with quantum yields close to 0.01. The homologous pair Trp42 and Trp130 were moderately fluorescent, with quantum yields of 0.13 and 0.17, respectively. In an attempt to identify quenching and/or electrostatically perturbing residues, a set of 17 candidate amino acids around Trp68 and Trp156 were substituted with neutral or hydrophobic residues. None of these mutants showed significant changes in the fluorescence intensity compared to their own background. Hybrid quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical (QM-MM) simulations with the four different excited Trps as electron donors strongly indicate that electron transfer rates to the amide backbone of Trp68 and Trp156 are extremely fast relative to those for Trp42 and Trp130. This is in agreement with the quantum yields measured experimentally and consistent with the absence of a quenching side chain. Efficient electron transfer to the backbone is possible for Trp68 and Trp156 because of the net favorable location of several charged residues and the orientation of nearby waters, which collectively stabilize electron transfer electrostatically. The fluorescence emission spectra of single and double Trp to Phe mutants provide strong evidence for energy transfer from Trp42 to Trp68 in the N-terminal domain and from Trp130 to Trp156 in the C-terminal domain. The backbone conformation of tryptophans in HgammaD-Crys may have evolved in part to enable the lens to become a very effective UV filter, while the efficient quenching provides an in situ mechanism to protect the tryptophans of the crystallins from photochemical degradation.
