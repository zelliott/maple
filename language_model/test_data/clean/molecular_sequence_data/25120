Autocatalytic degradation of purified Bacillus subtilis neutral proteinase was examined under various conditions. At elevated temperatures, under non-inhibitory conditions, mature protein was rapidly degraded, but no accumulation of specific breakdown products occurred. However, by incubating purified neutral proteinase on ice during extended periods of time, specific peptides accumulated. These peptides were analysed by SDS/PAGE and Western blotting, and the N-terminal sequences were determined for the four major peptides, which had sizes of 30, 22, 20 and 15 kDa. Sequence data identified five fission sites in the neutral proteinase, three of which were identical with autodigestion target sites in thermolysin, a thermostable neutral proteinase. Comparison of the identified fission sites of the B. subtilis neutral proteinase with the known substrate-specificity of the enzyme indicated that they were in agreement, showing a preference for the generation of fissions at the N-terminal side of large hydrophobic residues, such as leucine, isoleucine and methionine. These results suggest a high degree of similarity in the three-dimensional structures of B. subtilis neutral proteinase and thermolysin.
