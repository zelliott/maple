Octamer binding transcription factors (Oct factors) play important roles in activation of transcription of various genes but, in some cases, require cofactors that interact with the DNA binding (POU) domain. In the present study, a yeast two-hybrid screen with the Oct-1 POU domain as a bait identified MAT1 as a POU domain-binding protein. MAT1 is known to be required for the assembly of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK), which is functionally associated with the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH). Further analyses showed that MAT1 interacts with POU domains of Oct-1, Oct-2, and Oct-3 in vitro in a DNA-independent manner. MAT1-containing TFIIH was also shown to interact with POU domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2. MAT1 is shown to enhance the ability of a recombinant CDK7-cyclin H complex (bipartite CAK) to phosphorylate isolated POU domains, intact Oct-1, and the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, but not the originally defined substrate, CDK2. Phosphopeptide mapping indicates that the site (Ser385) of a mitosis-specific phosphorylation that inhibits Oct-1 binding to DNA is not phosphorylated by CAK. However, one CAK-phosphorylated phosphopeptide comigrates with a Cdc2-phosphorylated phosphopeptide previously shown to be mitosis-specific, suggesting that, in vitro, CAK is able to phosphorylate at least one site that is also phosphorylated in vivo. These results suggest (i) that interactions between POU domains and MAT1 can target CAK to Oct factors and result in their phosphorylation, (ii) that MAT1 not only functions as a CAK assembly factor but also acts to alter the spectrum of CAK substrates, and (iii) that a POU-MAT1 interaction may play a role in the recruitment of TFIIH to the preinitiation complex or in subsequent initiation and elongation reactions.
