Group A RNA phages consist of four genes-maturation protein, coat protein, lysis protein and replicase genes. We analyzed six plasmids containing lysis protein genes and coat protein genes of Escherichia coli group A RNA phages and compared their amino acid sequences with the known proteins of E. coli(group A), Pseudomonas aeruginosa(PP7) RNA phages and Rg-lysis protein from Qbeta phage. The size of lysis proteins was different by the groups but the coat proteins were almost the same size among phages. The phylogenetic analysis shows that the sub-groups A-I and A-II of E. coli RNA phages were clearly dispersed into two clusters.
