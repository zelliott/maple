Recombinant cDNA clones representing the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins of two mumps virus strains different in fusogenicity were constructed. Upon transfection of COS7 cells, extensive cell fusion was observed only when cells expressed the F protein of the fusing strain together with the HN protein derived from either strain. Mutational analyses further showed that the amino acid at position 195 of the F protein plays a critical role in determining the extent of cell fusion induced by mumps virus, since replacement of Ser-195 by Tyr significantly reduced the fusion inducibility of otherwise fusion-competent F protein.
