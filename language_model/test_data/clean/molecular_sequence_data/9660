The novel gene named PSX1, encoding a new protopectinase with the polymethoxygalacturonase activity, was isolated from Trichosporon penicillatum. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that the PSX1 gene is composed of 1080 bases (360 amino acids, 38,747 Da). The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the open reading frame correspond to a signal peptide and propeptide processed by a Kex2-like proteinase. Mature PPase SX1 was composed of 334 amino acids (36,121 Da). PPase SX1 produced by a S. cerevisiae transformant harboring the PSX1 gene degraded methoxylated polygalacturonic acid as a substrate, but not degraded unmethoxylated polygalacturonic acid.
