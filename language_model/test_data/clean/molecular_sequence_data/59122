Computer methods for database search, multiple alignment and cluster analysis indicated significant homology between amino-acid sequences of 21 amidases or amidohydrolases (EC 3.5). All of them were found to be involved in the reduction of organic nitrogen compounds and ammonia production. A conserved motif was found which may be important in amide binding and in catalytic mechanisms. Homology studies between these amidases and some ureases, nitrilases and acyl-transferases or enzymes with unknown functions provided new insight into the evolution of these proteins. Dissemination of these genes seemed to be facilitated by transfer of genetic elements such as transposons and plasmids.
