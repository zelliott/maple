The dicyemid mesozoans are simple multicellular parasites with a long cylindrical axial cell surrounded by a single outer layer of 20 to 30 ciliated peripheral somatic cells. Their larval development proceeds within the axial cell. Here we demonstrate the appearance of extrachromosomal circular DNAs and their fate during early embryogenesis in Dicyema japonicum. These DNAs are highly heterogeneous in sequence, suggesting that they consist of unique--not repetitive--elements. Potential open reading frames were not evident in the elements, so these DNAs are unlikely to have a protein-encoding function. In situ hybridization revealed that the circular DNA elements were restricted to the early embryonic larvae and gradually faded out as larvae approached maturity. Furthermore Southern blot analysis and polymerase chain reaction analysis using a high molecular weight DNA as a template provided evidence that the extrachromosomal DNA circles are originally present in chromosomes. These observations suggest DNA elimination--or selective replication--of the elements from chromosomes during early embryogenesis in dicyemid mesozoans.
