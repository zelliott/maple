Here, we report on the sequence features and chromosomal location of a novel human gene which shares significant homology with the bovine brain-specific protein p25. Based on polymerase chain reaction analysis with a human/rodent monochromosomal hybrid cell panel and a radiation hybrid panel, the gene was mapped on to p15.3 region of chromosome 5.
