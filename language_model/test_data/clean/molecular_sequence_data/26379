Novobiocin affects DNA metabolism in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, resulting in cell death. In prokaryotes, the drug is a specific inhibitor of DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase that can be purified on a novobiocin-Sepharose column. The yeast type II topoisomerase is neither the biochemical, nor the genetic target of the antibiotic. We have purified the major yeast novobiocin binding proteins and identified one of them as the beta-subunit of the yeast mitochondrial F1 ATP synthetase, a protein highly conserved throughout evolution. The inactivation of this protein might explain the toxic effects of novobiocin on higher eukaryotic cells.
