To identify residues that control the interactions between MHC-heavy chains and (beta 2m) sequence comparisons were made between murine class I MHC molecules with high (H-2Dd, H-2Kb) and low (H-2Ld, H-2Db) affinities for beta 2m. A single residue at position 9 was evaluated for its contribution to the stability of the complex. Mutagenesis of the glutamic acid at position 9 of H-2Ld to valine, as is found in H-2Dd and H-2Kb, resulted in both qualitative and quantitative effects on inter-chain interactions, intracellular transport, peptide binding, and peptide presentation. In in vitro translation and assembly studies, the E9V mutation resulted in a more stable association of beta 2m with the heavy chain after immunoprecipitation with the alpha 2 domain-specific Ab 30-5-7 in the presence of an H-2Ld-restricted peptide. E9V variant expressed in transfected L cells had similar surface expression compared with H-2Ld despite exhibiting a slower rate of maturation. However, cells expressing E9V were unable to present peptide Ag to a specific T cell hybridoma. H-2LdE9V in E-3 cells, which are defective in TAP-dependent peptide transport, was expressed at higher levels than H-2Ld and was stabilized more efficiently by the addition of exogenous human beta 2m. Thus, amino acid position 9 not only plays an important role in the interaction of the MHC-1 molecule with the beta 2m, it also qualitatively and quantitatively influences peptide binding and Ag presentation.
