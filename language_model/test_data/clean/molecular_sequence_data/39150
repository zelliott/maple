Samples of foregut content were collected from 86 macropodid marsupials and examined for the presence of endosymbiotic ciliates. Four host species were examined: Macropus giganteus (eastern grey kangaroo), M. fuliginosus (western grey kangaroo), M. robustus (common wallaroo) and Thylogale billardierii (Tasmanian pademelon). Ciliate morphology was determined by microscopical examination of live and silver-impregnated specimens. Isotrichid ciliates were detected in 51 (59%) of the 86 animals examined. Five new species and one new genus are described. Three of the species belong to the genus Dasytricha Schuberg, 1888; D. dehorityi n. sp. from M. giganteus, D. dogieli n. sp. from M. robustus and D. mundayi n. sp. from T. billardierii. Bitricha n. g. is characterised by the possession of two fields of somatic ciliation, a transverse ventral and a longitudinal dorsal field. B. oblata n. sp. is described from M. giganteus and M. fuliginosus and B. tasmaniensis n. sp. is described from T. billardierii. The occurrence of isotrichid ciliates in both metatherian and eutherian mammals suggests that the family either evolved prior to the divergence of the mammalian lineages or switched hosts from one group to the other following host diversification.
