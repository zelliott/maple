A system for detection and strain differentiation of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) by reverse transcription of polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (isolation of RNA, choice of primers for nested PCR, and purification of PCR products) and sequencing is developed and optimized. A nucleotide sequence of gene F site, coding for the F2/F1 cleavage site of F0 fusion protein and including several hypervariable regions, is determined for 10 Russian strains and vaccine strains. The data indicate a replacement of NDV populations in Russia and a rapid evolution of the virus. The origin of pathogenic NDV strains which have been circulating up to the present time is still unknown.
