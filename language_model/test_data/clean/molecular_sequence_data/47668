In normal retinas, the phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer segments is mediated in part through a mannose receptor protein located in the apical retinal pigment epithelium membrane. As dystrophic rats of the Royal College of Surgeons have a defect in which the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is unable to phagocytize the shed outer segments, it is hypothesized that mannose receptor expression will be lost with the progression of photoreceptor degeneration. Immunohistochemical and molecular techniques have been used to study the developmental expression of the mannose receptor in normal and dystrophic retinal pigment epithelium. By immunofluorescence, the mannose receptor is localized to the retinal pigment epithelium, apical membrane region, beginning around 5 days postnatally in both normal and dystrophic retinas. In immunoblots, bands at 175 kDa are labelled by an anti-mannose receptor antibody in apical membrane samples from both normal and dystrophic RPE at all developmental times sampled. RT-PCR analysis reveals that mannose receptor message is present in normal and dystrophic RPE samples at all developmental time points examined. The present study demonstrates that the expression of the mannose receptor begins prior to outer segment differentiation and the initiation of phagocytosis in both normal and dystrophic RPE. Expression of the mannose receptor continues to be unchanged during the progression of photoreceptor degeneration in the dystrophic retina.
