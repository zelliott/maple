In contrast to the highly polymorphic HLA class Ia genes that exhibit a broad somatic tissue distribution, the restricted constitutive expression of HLA-G to trophoblast and a subset of thymic epithelial cells suggests tight transcriptional control of this MHC class Ib gene. Transactivation of MHC class I genes is mediated by three major regulatory modules present in their promoter region namely enhancer A, ISRE, and SXY. The 220-bp promoter sequence of HLA-G comprises modified enhancer A and SXY modules and lacks the ISRE which renders this gene unresponsive to NK-kappaB, IRF1, and class II transactivator DNA-binding factors. A number of other HLA-G upstream regulatory elements have recently been described. Using different transgenic HLA-G mouse models under the control of the HLA-G promoter, several groups have shown by in situ hybridization and/or qualitative or quantitative RT-PCR that constitutive HLA-G transcriptional expression in placental tissue decreased with gestational time. This suggests that once the placenta is fully formed, the functions of HLA-G might not be so crucial.
