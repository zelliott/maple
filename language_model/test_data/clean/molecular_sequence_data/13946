Seven peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of toxin 2 from the scorpion Centruroides noxius were chemically synthesized, purified and assayed in mice for their putative neutralizing properties against scorpion toxins. All the peptides were immunogenic and some produced neutralizing antibodies, as verified by injecting the antisera with toxin into naive animals. However, direct challenge of pre-immunized mice (with the longest synthetic peptides of 27 and 57 amino acid residues) revealed an unexpected sensitization phenomena: the animals did not resist injection of one LD50 of purified toxin 2 (5% survival), but pre-immunization of mice with native toxin protected 100% of the animals. These findings suggest that vaccine preparations with synthetic peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of certain toxins should be analyzed cautiously.
