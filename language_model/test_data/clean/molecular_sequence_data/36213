We have isolated and sequenced a cDNA from the shaking-B locus of Drosophila melanogaster. The cDNA contains an open reading frame with extensive homology to another D. melanogaster gene, l(1)ogre. This suggests the existence of a new family of proteins required for the development and maintenance of the D. melanogaster nervous system.
