The CSK-gene encodes an intracellular protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK). In contrast to members of the src-family, an autophosphorylation site corresponding to Tyr416, as well as the equivalent of the regulatory Tyr527 in p60c-src are missing in the amino acid sequence deduced from the gene. CSK phosphorylates other members of the src-family of tyrosine kinases at their regulatory carboxy-terminus. By regulating the activity of these kinases, CSK may play an important role in cell growth and development. Here we describe the structure of the human CSK gene. The entire coding region spans a genomic distance of only 4.9 kb. It encompasses 12 exons ranging between 66 and 220 bp in size. The introns between coding exons vary between 76 and 920 bp in length. An exon coding for the 5'-untranslated region of CSK is separated from the first coding exon by an intron of more than 6400 bp. Based on comparisons of sequence homologies within the catalytic domains, the intracellular PTKs are divided into the src-family, the fes/fer- and the abl/arg-group. The genomic structure of four members of the SRC-family revealed nearly identical exon/intron boundaries within the catalytic domain of this family. They differ from those described for FES. Comparing the genomic structure of CSK with the exon/intron organisation of both, it is obvious that the exon/intron boundaries are in common either with those of the SRC-type or the FES boundaries. This intermediate exon/intron structure of CSK between FES and the SRC-family agrees with the position of CSK in a phylogenetic tree based on sequence homology within the kinase domain.
