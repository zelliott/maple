Expression of tissue kallikrein in human neutrophils has been suggested by previous studies using enzymatic and immunochemical techniques. Secretion of this potent biological factor by neutrophils would be of marked significance in the inflammatory process. The present study utilized the polymerase chain reaction following reverse transcriptase generation of total neutrophils cDNA to demonstrate the presence of tissue kallikrein mRNA in the human neutrophils. In addition, use of sequence-specific primers demonstrated the presence of mRNA for the hGK-1 gene, but not for the hPK gene product or the gene for prostate-specific antigen. These results confirm that tissue kallikrein is present in neutrophils and may be secreted as part of the inflammatory process.
