The standard method for separating peptide mixtures is reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with gradients of increasing concentrations of acetonitrile in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid. With modern instruments and columns, complex peptide mixtures can be separated, and low picomole amounts can be collected in tens of microliters. Difficult separations are addressed by modifying the gradient slope or organic eluant composition. Further improvements in resolution are often needed, requiring fundamental changes in mobile phase composition or selection of complementary chromatographic separation mechanisms. For the present study, tryptic digests of cytochrome c from various species were separated in the presence of dilute hydrochloric acid by reversed phase on a Waters Delta-Pak C18 high-performance insert column and by strong cation exchange on a Waters Protein-Pak SP 8HR. Different and enhanced reversed-phase selectivity was obtained by replacing trifluoroacetic acid with dilute hydrochloric acid at the same pH. The increased optical clarity of hydrochloric acid-based mobile phases in the low ultraviolet wavelengths yielded increased sensitivity. Very different selectivity was observed with the cation-exchange chromatography. These data expand the options for peptide mapping by providing additional selectivity combined with increased mass sensitivity and spectral information in the low ultraviolet.
