Chemical, genetic, and structural studies have defined a critical role for Asp-49 in the calcium-mediated activation of extracellular phospholipases A2 (PLA2). In 1984, a new class of PLA2 was isolated in which this invariant aspartate was replaced with a lysine (Maragnore, J.M., Merutka, G., Cho, W., Welches, W., Kezdy, F.J., and Heinrikson, R.L. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13839-13843; Maragnore, J.M., and Heinrikson, R.L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 4797-4804). The enzymatic activity of Lys-49 PLA2s has been questioned based on biochemical, mutational, and structural studies (van den Bergh, C.J., Slotboom, A.J., Verheij, H.M., and de Haas, G.H. (1988) Eur. J. Biochem. 176, 353-357). In this paper, we describe the structures of two crystal forms of the Lys-49 PLA2 isolated from the venom of Agkistridon piscivorus piscivorus. The refined models, along with complementary biochemical analysis, clarify the structural basis for the enzymatic inactivity of Lys-49 proteins.
