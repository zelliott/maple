Zymomonas mobilis is undoubtedly one of the most unique bacterium within the microbial world. Known since 1912 under the names Termobacterium mobilis, Pseudomonas linderi, and Zymomonas mobilis, reviews on its uniqueness have been published in 1977 and 1988. The bacterium Zymomonas mobilis not only exhibits an extraordinarily uniqueness in its biochemistry, but also in its growth behavior, energy production, and response to culture conditions, as well as cultivation techniques used. This uniqueness caused great interest in the scientific, biotechnological, and industrial worlds. Its ability to couple and uncouple energy production in favor of product formation, to respond to physical and chemical environment manipulation, as well as its restricted product formation, makes it an ideal microorganism for microbial process development. This review explores the advances made since 1987, together with new developments in the pure scientific and applied commercial areas.
