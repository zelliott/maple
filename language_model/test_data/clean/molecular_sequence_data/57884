c-Myc and wild-type p53 have been shown to play important roles in the regulation of cellular proliferation and oncogenic transformation. We have previously shown that the p53 promoter contains a conserved consensus recognition sequence for the basic-helix-loop-helix-containing proteins, identical to the specific binding site for c-Myc/Max heterodimers. Here, we demonstrate that this element, which is required for full promoter activity, is bound by in vitro translated c-Myc/Max heterodimers. Furthermore, we found that in cotransfection assays, c-Myc trans-activates the p53 promoter as well as a hybrid herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter containing multiple copies of a synthetic p53-derived c-Myc binding site. The p53 promoter deleted of the basic-helix-loop-helix consensus recognition sequence is not trans-activated by c-Myc, thus suggesting that c-Myc trans-activates the p53 promoter through the basic-helix-loop-helix recognition motif. These findings raise the possibility that the p53 gene may be a potential target for trans-activation by c-Myc in vivo.
