The isolation and molecular characterization of the gene coding for L14 ribosomal protein from L. braziliensis is described. There are 2 copies of the gene per haploid genome, repeated in a head-to-tail tandem orientation and located in a single chromosome of approximately 950 kb. Northern blot analyses indicate the presence of a single transcript of 0.95 kb which is up-regulated when parasites reach the stationary growth phase. L. braziliensis L14 gene codes for a 175 amino acid long polypeptide showing 75-83% sequence identity with L14 proteins from trypanosomatids and approximately 25% with its counterparts from higher eukaryotic organisms. L14 ribosomal proteins from trypanosomatids and higher eukaryotes share along their molecules a similar distribution pattern of theoretically functional domains. L. braziliensis L14 recombinant protein is not recognized by sera from cutaneous leishmaniasis patients. Immunization of mice with one dose of L14 recombinant protein and a second dose of L14 protein covalently linked to the HSP70 from Trypanosoma cruzi induces a high antibody level against this L14 protein, which is mostly of the IgG2a subtype, as well as a strong increase in splenocyte proliferation index.
