Incubation of S-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)glutathione (S-BDB-G), a reactive analogue of glutathione, with the 3-3 isoenzyme of rat liver glutathione S-transferase at pH 6.5 and 25 degrees C results in a time-dependent inactivation of the enzyme. The kobs exhibits a nonlinear dependence on S-BDB-G concentration from 50 to 900 microM, with a kmax of 0.073 min-1 and KI = 120 microM. The addition of 5 mM S-hexylglutathione, a competitive inhibitor with respect to glutathione, completely protects against inactivation by S-BDB-G. About 2.0 mol of [3H]S-BDB-G/mol of enzyme subunit is incorporated concomitant with 100% inactivation, whereas only 0.96 mol of reagent/mol subunit is incorporated in the presence of S-hexylglutathione when activity is fully retained. Modified enzyme, prepared by incubating glutathione S-transferase with [3H]S-BDB-G in the absence or in the presence of S-hexylglutathione, was reduced with NaBH4, reacted with N-ethylmaleimide, and digested with trypsin. Analysis of the tryptic digests, fractionated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, revealed Tyr115 as the amino acid whose reaction with S-BDB-G correlates with inactivation. Examination of the stability of S-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)glutathione and modified enzyme in the absence and presence of dithiothreitol and under acidic conditions suggests that for stable linkage to peptides, the carbonyl moieties of the reagent should be reduced immediately after modification of a protein. Comparison of results from the 4-4 and 3-3 isoenzymes of rat liver glutathione S-transferase (both of the mu gene class) indicates: the 4-4 isoenzyme exhibits a greater affinity for S-BDB-G; Cys86 is labeled by [3H]S-BDB-G in both isoenzymes but is nonessential for activity; in the 3-3 isoenzyme, Cys86 is more accessible to S-BDB-G; and Tyr115 is an important residue in the hydrophobic binding site of both enzymes.
