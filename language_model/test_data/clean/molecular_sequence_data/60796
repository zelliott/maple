Plasmodium is unable to carry out de novo fatty acid synthesis and has to obtain these compounds from their host for subsequent activation by thioesterification with coenzyme A. This activity is catalyzed by a fatty acyl-CoA synthetase enzyme (EC 6.2.1.3). Here, we describe a novel gene from P. falciparum whose recombinant purified product from baculovirus-transfected insect cell line had the enzymatic activity of a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase. It was named pf acs1, since it belongs to a multi-member gene family as revealed by the sequence of several clones and a multi-band pattern in Southern blots. The sequence specifies a product of 820 amino acid residues. It was transcribed and expressed in infected erythrocytes having an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa. Immuno-labeling of infected erythrocytes with a specific antibody against the carboxy-terminal part of the PfACS1 localized the product early after the erythrocyte invasion in vesicle-like structures budding off the parasitoforous membrane toward the red cell cytoplasm. Its unique carboxy- terminal structure of 70 extra amino acid residues, longer than any other reported acyl-CoA synthetase, is probably related to its localization in the cytoplasm of the host erythrocyte. The phylogenetic relationship among other AMP-forming enzymes, placed PfACS1 closer to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sharing significant amino acid identities, especially in the conserved signature motif that modulates fatty acid substrate specificity and ATP/AMP-binding domains. Taking into account the importance of this enzymatic activity for the parasite, its extra-cellular location inside the infected erythrocyte, and the divergence with respect to the homologous human enzymes, it may be an important protein as a potential target candidate for chemotherapeutic antimalaria drugs.
