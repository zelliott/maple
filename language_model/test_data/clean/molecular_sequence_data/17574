A bovine genomic library was constructed using a cosmid vector, pHC79, and bovine DNA partially digested by EcoRI. Bovine P-450(11 beta) cDNA, pcP-450(11 beta)-2 [Morohashi et al. (1987) J. Biochem. 102,559-568], was used as a probe for screening the genomic library. Ten clones carrying P-450(11 beta) genomic DNA were isolated from 8 x 10(4) colonies and classified into five groups (CB11 beta-1, CB11 beta-3, CB11 beta-7, CB11 beta-20, and CB11 beta-21) according to differences in the restriction endonuclease sites. Nucleotide sequences of amino acid coding regions of the five clones were determined by the dideoxy sequencing method using synthetic nucleotides corresponding to various parts of the cDNA as primers. The nucleotide sequences revealed that three clones, CB11 beta-1, CB11 beta-3, and CB11 beta-21, were pseudogenes. Amino acid sequences coded by the other two clones, CB11 beta-7 and CB11 beta-20, were identical with that coded by a previously described cDNA, pcP-450(11 beta)-3 [Kirita et al. (1988) J. Biochem. 104, 683-686]. The promoter regions of the five clones were introduced in front of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene of pSV00CAT and used to examine P-450(11 beta) gene regulation in cultured cells. The five recombinant plasmids showed cAMP-responsive CAT activities in Y-1 cells, a cell strain derived from adrenal tumor. The induction rates of the recombinant plasmids carrying the promoters of normal genes, CB11 beta-7 and -20, were larger than those of pseudogenes, CB11 beta-1, -3, and -21. CAT activities expressed by the promoter regions of the normal genes in the presence or absence of cAMP in Y-1 cells were almost equal to that by the promoter region of human P-450(SCC) gene. Though the promoter of the P-450(SCC) gene also showed cAMP-responsive CAT activity in I-10 cells, a cell strain derived from Leyding cell tumor, P-450(11 beta) gene promoter did not express the activity in I-10 cells.
