Naturally occurring noncytotoxic vacA type s2 strains of Helicobacter pylori have a 12-residue extension to the vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) compared with cytotoxic type s1 strains. We show that adding the region encoding this extension to type s1 vacA completely abolishes vacuolating cytotoxin activity but has no effect on VacA production.
