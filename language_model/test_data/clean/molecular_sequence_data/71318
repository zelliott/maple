We have identified a novel 3845 bp cDNA differentially expressed in a human melanoma metastasis model. Northern blot analysis showed expression in the poorly and intermediately metastasizing cell lines and a marked downregulation in the highly metastatic cell lines. Using RT-PCR expression was also seen in several other tumor cell lines and normal cell types of human origin. cDNA sequence analysis revealed an ORF of 687 amino acids containing seven putative transmembrane domains C-terminally and a long N-terminus. The gene was mapped to 16q13. Highest homology was observed with members of the EGF-TM7 subfamily of the secretin/calcitonin receptor family. We propose the delineation of a subfamily of TM7 proteins, LN-TM7, containing seven transmembrane proteins with a long N-terminal extracellular part.
