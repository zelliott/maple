This study seeks to analyze nearly full-length viral genomes for distinct genetic characteristics that are unique to local or regional strains and to identify regions that have high variability or are highly conserved. Nearly full length sequences of seven HIV-1 samples were obtained to ascertain the circulating subtype diversity in the HIV-1 epidemic in Jamaica as well as conduct detailed sequence analysis. The phylogenetic analysis of the seven sequences showed all the sequences clustering with HIV-1 pure B subtype references. The predicted amino acid sequenced in the V3 loop for the Jamaican samples showed that six samples contained the characteristic conserved tetrapeptide motif GPGR. One occurrence in isolate 09JM.PF09WX displayed a GQGP tetrameric motif similar to that found in a Korean B strain. All seven isolates (100%) were R5 viruses for preferential cofactor usage. These samples were collected from individuals who had tested positive for 1-5 years and were drug naive. The results suggested that the viruses were isolated from patients in the nonprogressive stage of disease. These are early stages in the assessment and the patient should be monitored to predict the progression of the disease and when HAART should begin.
