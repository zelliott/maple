In animal models, CD8+ T cells are a critical effector mechanism in the protective immunity against malaria. Conventional approaches to the development of many vaccines, including those against malaria, have however proved inadequate. In particular, an alternative approach is needed for the development of vaccines designed to induce a cellular immune response mediated by CD8+ T cells. Advances in the field of molecular immunology during the past decade have provided an insight into the presentation of peptides by MHC class I molecules and their recognition by CD8+ T cells. These studies have provided a conceptual basis for the development of efficacious parasitic and viral vaccines. By a combination of immunochemical and cellular immunologic analyses based on specific peptide binding motifs, a subunit malaria vaccine that includes CD8+ T cell epitopes restricted by the most common class I HLA alleles, including HLA-A2, can now be constructed.
