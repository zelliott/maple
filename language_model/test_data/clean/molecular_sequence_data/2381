While studying the organization of the mouse glycerol-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (Gdc-1 on chromosome 15), we identified a novel transcriptional unit located only 3.4 kilobases (kb) upstream of the 5' end of the Gdc-1 gene. This gene has been provisionally named D15Kz1. The unusual proximity of these two genes led us to investigate the pattern of expression and sequence characteristics of the new gene for comparison with those of Gdc-1. D15Kz1 was found to have transcripts of 3.2 and 3.4 kb in length. The 3.4-kb transcript was expressed at low levels in all tissues examined, whereas the 3.2-kb transcript was detected only in the cerebral cortex and the brown fat. D15Kz1 and Gdc-1 are not coordinately regulated, as evidenced by the characteristics of their expression in several tissues and in differentiating 3T3-F442A adipocyte cultures. A cDNA sequence of 3,105 bases isolated from an embryonal carcinoma lambda gt10 cDNA library had a large open reading frame of 461 amino acids at one end followed by 1.6 kb of sequence with multiple stop codons. Algorithms used to search the protein and nucleic acid data bases detected no significant sequence similarity to any other protein or gene. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA using the D15Kz1 cDNA as a probe indicated that D15Kz1 is a single-copy gene in the mouse genome and that it is conserved in humans, rats, and chickens. This conservation of gene sequences suggests that D15Kz1 encodes a protein with an important cellular function.
