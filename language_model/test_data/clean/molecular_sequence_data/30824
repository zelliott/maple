The C-terminal tetrapeptide, Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2, is a full agonist of gastrin, but des-Phe analogues, including Boc-Trp-Met-Asp-NH2, are antagonists. To ascertain the minimum structural requirement for an antagonist, we used conventional solution phase methodology to synthesize analogues with further modifications including removal of the alpha-amino group of Trp, conversion of the indole to a phenyl ring, and methylation of amide bonds. These analogues were tested for their effect on pentagastrin-stimulated acid release in dogs surgically prepared with a gastric fistula. When infused intravenously at a dose of 20 pmol kg-1 h-1, the peptides significantly inhibited acid secretion. The extent of inhibition ranged from 12% to 60%. Thus, tripeptide analogues based on the C-terminal sequence of gastrin act as potent and specific antagonists of gastrin-stimulated acid secretion.
