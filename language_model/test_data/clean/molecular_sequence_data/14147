cDNAs and an intronless single-copy nuclear gene (TPI1) encoding triosephosphate isomerase have been cloned and sequenced from the marine red alga Gracilaria verrucosa. The predicted amino-acid sequence of TPI1 is readily alignable with those of other known TPIs; 26 of 27 active-site residues and 19 of 26 intersubunit-contact residues are identical between TPIs of G. verrucosa and/or animals and green plants. A partial cDNA sequence of a second TPI gene (TPI2), presumably encoding plastid-localized TPI, was recovered by PCR and demonstrated by phylogenetic analysis to be red algal; no TP12 cDNA or genomic clones could be recovered. Genomic Southern analysis demonstrated that at least two TPI-like genes are present in the nuclear DNA of G. verrucosa.
