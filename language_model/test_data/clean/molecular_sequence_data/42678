A trans-activator protein Tax of HTLV-1 activates the transcription of various cellular genes as well as viral promoter through the multiple enhancer elements and leads cells to the transformation. Tax protein interacts to enhancer DNA elements by associating with cellular enhancer binding proteins such as CREB, NF-kappa B and SRF. In addition, we found recently that Tax interacts with an I kappa B protein, the inhibitor of NF-kappa B, resulting in the enhancement of nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B molecules. Therefore, Tax seems to modulate the transcription by the interaction with multiple transcription factors in different modes of control.
