Proteins which are secreted or associated with the cell envelope of Mycobacterium tuberculosis may contain protective T-cell epitopes. Prior to this study, a recombinant clone bank of enzymatically active M. tuberculosis-alkaline phosphatase fusions, were screened for immunogenicity in a murine T-cell model. Five of these were selected for further study, and the IFN-gamma secretion and proliferation of human PBMC from purified protein derivative- (PPD)-positive and PPD-negative donors were measured in response to oligopeptides, Mtb-PhoA fusions and one full-length protein. Epitopes from four of the five selected antigens were immunoreactive in the human model and corresponded to cytochrome d ubiquinol oxidase, cytochrome c oxidase subunit II, MTV005.02 and MTV033.08. Thus, this strategy identified novel human immunogenic peptides as possible candidates for a subunit vaccine.
