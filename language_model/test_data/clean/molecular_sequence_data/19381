We report the first case of infection caused by Graphium basitruncatum in a man with acute leukemia who developed persistent fungemia and skin lesions. G. basitruncatum, a member of the Microascaceae, is phylogenetically and morphologically distinct from Graphium penicillioides and the opportunistic pathogens Scedosporium apiospermum (Pseudallescheria boydii) and Scedosporium prolificans.
