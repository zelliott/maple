The binding capacity of large sets of peptides corresponding to naturally occurring sequences and carrying previously defined A24-specific motifs was analyzed. It was found that only a minority (9-25%) of the motif-carrying peptides bound the relevant HLA-A molecule with good affinity (IC 50% < or = 50 nM), while the majority of them bound only weakly or not at all (IC 50% > or = 500 nM). By correlating the presence of specific residue types at each position along the peptide sequence with average binding affinity, the prominent influence of specific secondary interactions (secondary anchor residues) was revealed. Moreover, secondary interactions appeared to be size-dependent in that the specific effects detected differed in 9-mer and 10-mer peptide sets. Based on these observations, A24-specific refined motifs were also established for both 9-mer and 10-mer ligands, and their merit was verified by testing the binding capacity of independent sets of synthetic peptides. Such refined motifs should facilitate accurate prediction of potential A24-restricted peptide epitopes. It was also noted that certain crucial secondary interactions appear to be remarkably similar in the case of A24 and other HLA-A molecules previously analyzed (A*0201, A3, A11, and others). This may reflect contributions to binding affinity of relatively invariant residues located within the polymorphic pockets of the HLA binding groove.
