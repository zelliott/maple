The embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV)-like proteins are mRNA-binding proteins that regulate mRNA stability. The neuronal members of this family are required for neuronal differentiation. We identified the binding region of purified HuD protein to a target neuronal mRNA encoding for the tau microtubule-associated protein and demonstrated an in vivo interaction between the ELAV-like protein and its target tau mRNA. We show that treatment of neuronal cells with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed against HuD blocks the induction of neurite outgrowth and decreases the levels of tau mRNAs, indicating that the ELAV-like proteins are required for neuronal differentiation.
