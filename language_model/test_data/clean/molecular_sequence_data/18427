The DNA sequence of the Salmonella typhimurium glyA gene has been determined. The polypeptide deduced from the DNA sequence contains 417 amino acids and has a calculated molecular weight of 45428 daltons. S1 nuclease mapping experiments located the transcription start point and possible transcription termination region. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences for the S. typhimurium and Escherichia coli glyA genes were compared. The nucleotide sequences show 89% identity, and the amino acid sequences show 93% identity. In S. typhimurium there is an absence of REP sequences between the translation termination site and the proposed transcription termination site that are present in the E. coli sequence. A conserved sequence is found in both organisms extending from 79 to 117 bp upstream of the consensus -35 sequences of the glyA promoters. This conserved sequence shows homology to a sequence preceding the S. typhimurium metE gene determined to bind the MetR regulatory protein.
