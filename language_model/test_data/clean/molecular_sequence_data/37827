We examined the role that aromatic residues located in the transmembrane helices of the alpha(1a)-adrenergic receptor play in promoting antagonist binding. Since alpha(1)-antagonists display low affinity binding at beta(2)-adrenergic receptors, two phenylalanine residues, Phe-163 and Phe-187, of the alpha(1a)-AR were mutated to the corresponding beta(2)-residue. Neither F163Q nor F187A mutations of the alpha(1a) had any effect on the affinity of the alpha(1)-antagonists. However, the affinity of the endogenous agonist epinephrine was reduced 12.5- and 8-fold by the F163Q and F187A mutations, respectively. An additive loss in affinity (150-fold) for epinephrine was observed at an alpha(1a) containing both mutations. The loss of agonist affinity scenario could be reversed by a gain of affinity with mutation of the corresponding residues in the beta(2) to the phenylalanine residues in the alpha(1a). We propose that both Phe-163 and Phe-187 are involved in independent aromatic interactions with the catechol ring of agonists. The potency but not the efficacy of epinephrine in stimulating phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis was reduced 35-fold at the F163Q/F187A alpha(1a) relative to the wild type receptor. Therefore, Phe-163 and Phe-187 represent novel binding contacts in the agonist binding pocket of the alpha(1a)-AR, but are not involved directly in receptor activation.
