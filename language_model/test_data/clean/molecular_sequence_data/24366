KChIP2, a gene encoding three auxiliary subunits of Kv4.2 and Kv4.3, is preferentially expressed in the adult heart, and its expression is downregulated in cardiac hypertrophy. Mice deficient for KChIP2 exhibit normal cardiac structure and function but display a prolonged elevation in the ST segment on the electrocardiogram. The KChIP2(-/-) mice are highly susceptible to the induction of cardiac arrhythmias. Single-cell analysis revealed a substrate for arrhythmogenesis, including a complete absence of transient outward potassium current, I(to), and a marked increase in action potential duration. These studies demonstrate that a defect in KChIP2 is sufficient to confer a marked genetic susceptibility to arrhythmias, establishing a novel genetic pathway for ventricular tachycardia via a loss of the transmural gradient of I(to).
