DNA helicase I, encoded on the Escherichia coli F plasmid, catalyzes a site- and strand-specific nicking reaction within the F plasmid origin of transfer (oriT) to initiate conjugative DNA strand transfer. The product of the nicking reaction contains a single phosphodiester bond interruption as determined by single-nucleotide resolution mapping of both sides of the nick site. This analysis has demonstrated that the nick is located at precisely the same site previously shown to be nicked in vivo (T. L. Thompson, M. B. Centola, and R. C. Deonier, J. Mol. Biol. 207:505-512, 1989). In addition, studies with two oriT point mutants have confirmed the specificity of the in vitro reaction. Characterization of the nicked DNA product has revealed a modified 5' end and a 3' OH available for extension by E. coli DNA polymerase I. Precipitation of nicked DNA with cold KCl in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate suggests the existence of protein covalently attached to the nicked DNA molecule. The covalent nature of this interaction has been directly demonstrated by transfer of radiolabeled phosphate from DNA to protein. On the basis of these results, we propose that helicase I becomes covalently bound to the 5' end of the nicked DNA strand as part of the reaction mechanism for phosphodiester bond cleavage. A model is presented to suggest how helicase I could nick the F plasmid at oriT and subsequently unwind the duplex DNA to provide single-stranded DNA for strand transfer during bacterial conjugation.
