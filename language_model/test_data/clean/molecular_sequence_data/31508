A novel high DNA G+C content bacterium, designated strain D7-27(T), was isolated from clay soils collected inside a natural cave in Jeju, Republic of Korea. The cells of the organism were aerobic, Gram-stain-positive, non-motile rods; its colonies were white, circular and entire in margin. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison showed that strain D7-27(T) formed a coherent cluster with Humibacter albus of the family Microbacteriaceae (97.6 % sequence similarity). The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained ornithine and 2,4-diaminobutyric acid as the diagnostic diamino acids. The major menaquinones were MK-12 and MK-11, with MK-10 as a minor component. The polar lipids consisted mainly of phosphatidylglycerol and an unknown glycolipid. Mycolic acids were not present. The predominant fatty acids were anteiso-C17 : 0 and cyclohexyl-C17 : 0. The DNA G+C content was 66.3 mol%. DNA-DNA relatedness between strain D7-27(T) and H. albus DSM 18994(T) was 28.6 % (17.6 % in a reciprocal test). On the basis of the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and DNA-DNA hybridization data, strain D7-27(T) ( = KCTC 33009(T) = DSM 25738(T)) is considered as the type strain of a novel species of the genus Humibacter, for which the name Humibacter antri sp. nov. is proposed. An emended description of the genus Humibacter is also provided.
