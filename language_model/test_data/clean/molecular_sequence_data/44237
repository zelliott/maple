mTEF-1 is the prototype of a family of mouse transcription factors that share the same TEA DNA binding domain (mTEAD genes) and are widely expressed in adult tissues. At least one member of this family is expressed at the beginning of mouse development, because mTEAD transcription factor activity was not detected in oocytes, but first appeared at the 2-cell stage in development, concomitant with the onset of zygotic gene expression. Since embryos survive until day 11 in the absence of mTEAD-1 (TEF-1), another family member likely accounts for this activity. Screening an EC cell cDNA library yielded mTEAD-1, 2 and 3 genes. RT-PCR detected RNA from all three of these genes in oocytes, but upon fertilization, mTEAD-1 and 3 mRNAs disappeared. mTEAD-2 mRNA, initially present at approx. 5,000 copies per egg, decreased to approx. 2,000 copies in 2-cell embryos before accumulating to approx. 100,000 copies in blastocysts, consistent with degradation of maternal mTEAD mRNAs followed by selective transcription of mTEAD-2 from the zygotic genome. In situ hybridization did not detect mTEAD RNA in oocytes, and only mTEAD-2 was detected in day-7 embryos. Northern analysis detected all three RNAs at varying levels in day-9 embryos and in various adult tissues. A fourth mTEAD gene, recently cloned from a myotube cDNA library, was not detected by RT-PCR in either oocytes or preimplantation embryos. Together, these results reveal that mTEAD-2 is selectively expressed for the first 7 days of embryonic development, and is therefore most likely responsible for the mTEAD transcription factor activity that appears upon zygotic gene activation.
