We have isolated the Xenopus homologue of cardiac myosin-binding protein C ( cMyBP-C) and describe its expression during early embryogenesis. cMyBP-C is expressed in both somites and heart at the time these tissues differentiate. Expression in the somites declines in older tadpoles. There is a high degree of conservation in residues where mutations causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have been identified in humans.
