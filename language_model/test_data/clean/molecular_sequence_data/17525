We review and discuss the biological and DNA-binding properties of the bacteriophage SPO1 transcription factor 1 (TF1), a DNA-binding protein belonging to the ubiquitous prokaryotic family of Type II DNA-binding proteins. We review recent information on the effects of certain mutations in TF1 on DNA-binding and on its ability to sharply bend DNA. We also compare the DNA-binding properties of the three best-studied type II DNA-binding proteins, Escherichia coli HU, E. coli integration host factor, and TF1, and discuss them in the context of the structure and properties of chromatin in prokaryotes.
