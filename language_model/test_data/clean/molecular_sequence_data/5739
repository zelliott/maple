The dynamics of changes in the cellularity and extracellular matrix composition of dental pulp varies considerably during tooth development and maturation. In this paper, we studied matrix proteoglycans where we hypothesized that they played important roles in structural, spatial, and transport aspects of pulpal development and maintenance. The pulpal tissue was collected from partially erupted bovine incisors, pulverized, and then extracted with 6 M guanidine-HCl. The extract was subjected to anion column chromatography (DEAE-8HR), and the fractions collected were screened by dot-blot immunoassay by means of monoclonal antibodies generated against 4- and 6-sulfated chondroitin sulfate isomers, and keratan sulfate, 2-B-6, 3-B-3, and 5-D-4, respectively. The chondroitin-6-sulfate was the major glycosaminoglycan species and occurred as a large-molecular-weight proteoglycan (> 500 kDa). After further purification, it was subjected to agarose/acrylamide composite gel electrophoresis, and it migrated as a single band stained with Stains-All. The band was immunopositive against antibody 3-B-3 by Western blot analysis. The partial amino acid sequence analyses of the core protein clearly indicated this molecule to be versican. The presence of link protein was also confirmed by Western blot analysis with an anti-link protein monoclonal antibody, 8-A-4. Furthermore, immunohistochemical study indicated that the distributions of versican and link protein coincide in the dental pulp and are enriched in the peripheral area of the tissue just beneath the odontoblast layer. Since the dental pulp contains hyaluronan, versican may bind to hyaluronan via its hyaluronan-binding domain, where this association is stabilized by link protein. This complex, then, could form large hydrated proteoglycan aggregates that fill the extracellular space, support odontoblasts, and/or facilitate the transport function of metabolites and nutrients within the tissue.
