Insulin chain B, containing each one arginyl and lysyl residue in its peptide chain, inhibited hemagglutination by Porphyromonas gingivalis. To determine the further inhibitory profile, chain B was digested into 4 fragments by protease, which was contained in the preparation of hemagglutinin from P. gingivalis. Identification of each fragment by the amino acid analysis revealed that the chain was cleaved at the carboxyl site of arginyl and/or lysyl residues, but one fragment contained citrulline instead of arginine at its carboxyl terminal. This citrulline might have originated from arginine by an arginine deiminase-like enzyme of P. gingivalis. Only one fragment that contained the arginyl residue exhibited inhibitory activity on hemagglutination, but it was considerably weakened compared with that of the intact chain B. The difference in the inhibitory activity seemed to depend on the position of an arginyl residue in the peptide; this was also confirmed using several derivatives of bradykinin. The present result suggests that the internal arginyl residue in a peptide chain may be critical for the inhibition of the hemagglutination by P. gingivalis.
