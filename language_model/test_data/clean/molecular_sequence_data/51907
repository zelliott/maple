Using degenerate oligodeoxyribonucleotides (oligos) derived from the N-terminal sequence of an aryldialkylphosphatase (ADPase) from Nocardia sp. strain B-1, an amplification reaction was used to isolate a DNA segment containing a 57-bp fragment from the adpB gene. Based on the nucleotide (nt) sequence of this fragment, a nondegenerate oligo was synthesized and used to screen a subgenomic library of strain B-1 DNA for fragments containing adpB. A 3.55-kb PstI fragment containing adpB was cloned into Escherichia coli, and the nt sequence of a 1600-bp region containing adpB was determined. Under control of the lac promoter of pUC19, adpB expression in E. coli cultures was approx. 15-fold higher than in strain B-1 under the native adpB promoter. Comparison of adpB with the Flavobacterium ADPase-encoding gene, opd, revealed no significant homology at the nt or aa levels.
