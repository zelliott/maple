A chimeric protein was obtained by fusing together the ricin toxin A chain (RTA) gene and a DNA fragment encoding the N terminus of protein G of the vesicular stomatitis virus. Chimeric RTA (cRTA) retained full enzymic activity in a cell-free assay, but was 10-fold less toxic against human leukemic cells than either native RTA (nRTA) or unmodified recombinant RTA (rRTA). However, conjugates made with cRTA and human transferrin (Tfn) showed 10-20-fold greater cell killing efficacy than Tfn-nRTA or Tfn-rRTA conjugates despite equivalent binding of the three conjugates to target tumor cells. As a consequence, by fusion of the KFT25 peptide to the RTA sequence, the specificity factor (i.e. the ratio between nonspecific and specific cytotoxicity) of Tfn-cRTA was increased 90-240 times with respect to those of Tfn-nRTA and Tfn-rRTA. cRTA interacted with phospholipid vesicles with 15-fold faster kinetics than nRTA at acidic pH. Taken together, our results suggest that the ability of vesicular stomatitis virus protein G to interact with cell membranes can be transferred to RTA to facilitate its translocation to the cell cytosol. Our strategy may serve as a general approach for potentiating the cytotoxic efficacy of antitumor immunotoxins.
