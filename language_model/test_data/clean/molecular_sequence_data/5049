The expression of genes encoding G-protein beta gamma subunits was investigated in isolated olfactory receptor neurons from channel catfish. DNA sequencing of PCR products showed that the beta 1, beta 2, gamma 2 and gamma 3 genes were expressed in the neurons. Western blotting showed that at least three of these subunit proteins were expressed. This first analysis of the expression of beta gamma genes in olfactory receptor neurons suggests that these subunits may be involved in a variety of transduction events in these cells.
