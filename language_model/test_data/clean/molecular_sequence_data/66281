Salicylic acid (SA) is an important signal involved in the activation of defence responses against abiotic and biotic stress. In tobacco, benzoic acid or glucosyl benzoate were proposed to be precursors of SA. This is in sharp contrast with studies in Arabidopsis thaliana, where SA derives from isochorismate. We have determined the importance of isochorismate for SA biosynthesis in Nicotiana benthamiana using virus-induced gene silencing of the isochorismate synthase (ICS) gene. Plants with silenced ICS expression do not accumulate SA after exposure to UV or to pathogen stress. Plants with silenced ICS expression also exhibit strongly decreased levels of phylloquinone, a product of isochorismate. Our data provide evidence for an isochorismate-derived synthesis of SA in N. benthamiana.
