The genetic variability of the envelope surface domain (SU) of simian foamy virus (FV) of African green monkeys was studied. To assess the interindividual diversity of FV, isolates were obtained from 19 animals living together in a monkey house. The monkeys had been imported from Kenya prior to being placed in long-term housing in the research institute. In addition, a simian FV isolate and proviral DNA were obtained from an animal caretaker infected in this setting. DNA of the complete SU (1779 to 1793 bp) was analyzed by PCR and sequencing. The sequences revealed four clusters with high homologies (>95%). Between the clusters, divergencies ranged from 3 to 25%. Obviously, the clusters reflect four different strains or subtypes of simian FV type 3 that were prevalent in the colony. In contrast to lentiviruses, hypervariable regions could not be detected in the FV SU. Furthermore, to analyze the intraindividual diversity of FV, we investigated the virus population within an individual monkey at a given time point and its evolution over 13 years. For this purpose, 22 proviral SU clones generated by PCR from one oral swab and seven isolates obtained from the same animal between 1982 and 1995 were examined. These sequences revealed exceptionally high homology rates (99.5 to 100%), and only a minimal genetic drift was recognized within the series of isolates. In conclusion, the low in vivo divergency of FV SU suggests that genetic variability is not important for the maintenance of FV persistence.
