Transposon mini-Tn7 vectors insert into the chromosome of several Gram-negative bacteria in a site-specific manner. Here, we showed the application of mini-Tn7 as single copy site-specific integration vector system for Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. The transposition of the mini-Tn7 into the bacterial genome was detected at a Tn7 attachment (attTn7) site located downstream of glmS1. Furthermore, using a newly constructed vector pBBR1FLP2 containing the flipase (FLP) recombinase for site-specific excision of the sequence between the FLP recombinase target (FRT) sites, and a sacB counter selection marker, an unmarked mini-Tn7 insertion mutant was created. Mini-Tn7 insertion did not affect bacterial virulence on the tested plant. The mini-Tn7 and FLP-FRT systems also work well in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.
