Conserved carla- and potyvirus primers were used in RT-PCR to amplify virus fragments from garlic and other bulb crops in China and the fragments were subsequently sequenced and compared in phylogenetic analyses. Garlic plants from Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Shangdong and Yunnan provinces all contained at least one isolate each of Garlic latent virus (genus Carlavirus), Onion yellow dwarf virus (OYDV, genus Potyvirus) and Leek yellow stripe virus (LYSV, genus Potyvirus). The complete sequence of a Zhejiang isolate of LYSV was also determined, providing the first complete sequence of this virus. The genome was 10142 nucleotides long excluding the poly(A) tail and had the typical features of the genus Potyvirus, although some of the amino acids surrounding the polyprotein cleavage sites were unusual. Shallot yellow stripe virus (SYSV) was amplified from bunching onion (Allium fistulosum var. caespitosum) in Zhejiang province, providing the first record of SYSV in China. Lily mottle virus was amplified from dragon-teeth lily (Lilium brownii var. viridulum).
