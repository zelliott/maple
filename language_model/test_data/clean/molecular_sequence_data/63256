Immunodominance in self-Ag-reactive pathogenic CD4(+) T cells has been well established in several experimental models. Although it is clear that regulatory lymphocytes (Treg) play a crucial role in the control of autoreactive cells, it is still not clear whether immunodominant CD4(+) Treg clones are also involved in control of autoreactivity. We have shown that TCR-peptide-reactive CD4(+) and CD8(+) Treg play an important role in the spontaneous recovery and resistance from reinduction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in B10.PL mice. We report, by sequencing of the TCR alpha- and beta-chain associated with CD4(+) Treg, that the TCR repertoire is limited and the majority of CD4(+) Treg use the TCR Vbeta14 and Valpha4 gene segments. Interestingly, sequencing and spectratyping data of cloned and polyclonal Treg populations revealed that a dominant public CD4(+) Treg clonotype expressing Vbeta14-Jbeta1.2 with a CDR3 length of 7 aa exists in the naive peripheral repertoire and is expanded during the course of recovery from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Furthermore, a higher frequency of CD4(+) Treg clones in the naive repertoire correlates with less severity and more rapid spontaneous recovery from disease in parental B10.PL or PL/J and (B10.PL x PL/J)F(1) mice. These findings suggest that unlike the Ag-nonspecific, diverse TCR repertoire among the CD25(+)CD4(+) Treg population, TCR-peptide-reactive CD4(+) Treg involved in negative feedback regulation of autoimmunity use a highly limited TCR V-gene repertoire. Thus, a selective set of immunodominant Treg as well as pathogenic T cell clones can be targeted for potential intervention in autoimmune disease conditions.
