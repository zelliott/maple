On mild acid-catalysed degradation of the lipopolysaccharide from Hafnia alvei O39 followed by gel filtration of Sephadex G-50, the O-specific polysaccharide and three oligosaccharides were obtained, which represent the core substituted with 0-2 O-antigen repeating-units. On the basis of sugar and methylation analyses, 13C-n.m.r. data, solvolysis of the polysaccharide with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, and computer-assisted 13C-n.m.r. analysis of the Smith-degraded polysaccharide, it was concluded that the biological repeating unit of the O39 antigen was Formula; see text
