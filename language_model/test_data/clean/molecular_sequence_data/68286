From chromosomal region 17q21.3, where a tumour suppressor gene(s) for breast and ovarian cancers is thought to be present, we have isolated a novel gene from a cosmid clone that revealed somatic rearrangements in two breast cancers. The gene (MDC) encodes a 524-amino acid metalloprotease-like, disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich protein with sequence similarity to members of the snake-venom metalloprotease/disintegrin family and guinea-pig sperm-surface protein PH-30. These proteins have been implicated in cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Rearrangements in both tumours involve multiple exons and disrupt the coding region of the new MDC.
