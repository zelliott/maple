We determined the NS1/E2 N-terminal sequence including the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) from five individuals chronically infected with HCV: two from the Czech Republic and three from Germany. From each sequence, six 12-mer overlapping peptides were synthesized and used in a peptide scan to evaluate seroreactivity of each of those patients, as well as three anti-HCV positive blood donors to the different isolates. We could show the general presence of antibodies to multiple HVR1 specific sequences reflecting the existence of multiple variants in infected persons. Finally, we observed the persistance of HCV infections in all individuals despite an active humoral response directed against the virus.
