Familial dysautonomia (FD), a recessively inherited disease, has been mapped to chromosome 9q31. Highly polymorphic dinucleotide repeat markers flanking the genetic locus and at the same genetic location have been identified. We describe the prenatal diagnosis of FD using linkage and linkage disequilibrium analyses with these markers. Twelve families were analysed for informativeness and of these, seven went on to have prenatal testing (a total of eight fetuses tested). All of these fetuses were predicted to be heterozygous unaffected (FD carriers). Seven fetuses have come to term and are normal. In the absence of a recombinant proband, a panel of three proximal and three distal markers is sufficient to provide informative flanking markers and an 87-96 per cent likelihood of a highly predictive test. In an additional family at 1:4 risk for FD, no DNA was available from the propositus. This family was analysed using linkage disequilibrium to the #18 allele of the tightly linked marker D9S58 in conjunction with linkage analysis using data from two unaffected children. Prenatal diagnosis in this family indicated an affected fetus.
