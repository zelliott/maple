Characterization of inherited variations within tandem arrays of dinucleotide repeats has substantially advanced the construction of genetic maps using linkage approaches over the last several years. Using a backbone of 10 newly identified microsatellite repeats on human chromosome 4 and 6 previously identified short tandem repeat element polymorphisms, we have constructed several genetic maps and a physical map of human chromosome 4. The genetic and physical maps are in complete concordance with each other. The genetic maps include a 15-locus microsatellite-based linkage map, a framework map of high support incorporating a total of 39 independent loci, a 25-locus high-heterozygosity, easily used index map, and a gene-based comprehensive map that provides the best genetic location for 35 genes mapped to chromosome 4. The 16 microsatellite markers are each localized to one of nine regions of chromosome 4, delineated by a panel of somatic cell hybrids. These results demonstrate the utility of PCR-based repeat elements for the construction of genetic maps and provide a valuable resource for continued high-resolution mapping of chromosome 4 and of genetic disorders to this chromosome.
