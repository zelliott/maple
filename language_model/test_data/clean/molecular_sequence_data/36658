Recent studies have revealed the presence of a new group of opioid peptides, the hemorphins, in the human pituitary as well as in human cerebrospinal fluid. The hemorphins are structurally related to sequence segments residing in the beta, delta, gamma or epsilon-chains of hemoglobin. In this study we have applied fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) to elucidate the sequence of a hemorphin fragment isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with cerebrovascular bleedings. The FAB-MS was used in conjunction with carboxypeptidase Y digestion and results indicated that this procedure proved to be a powerful tool for rapid sequence determination. The recovered peptide was thus found to be identical with the sequence 32-41 of the above mentioned hemoglobin chains.
