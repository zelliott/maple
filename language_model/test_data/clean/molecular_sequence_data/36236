Type 2 helper T cell (Th2) clone has been reported to secrete interleukin (IL) 4 and IL5 in response to the specific antigen presented by syngeneic antigen-presenting cells. In the present report, we synthesized phosphorothioate analogue of an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to nucleotide 17-36 of IL4 mRNA (S-oligo), and tested its ability to inhibit IL4 production from a Th2 clone, D10.G4.1. (D10). D10 cells were cultured with mitomycin C-treated C3H spleen cells in the presence of 100 micrograms/ml conalbumin for 48-72 h. Secreted IL4 and IL5 were assayed biologically using HT2 cells and dextran sulfate-stimulated murine B cells, respectively. When 5-10 micrograms/ml S-oligo was added to the culture, IL4 production from D10 was suppressed by 70-90%. The same concentrations of S-oligo inhibited neither the antigen-induced proliferation of D10 nor the secretion of IL5 from the Th2 clone. These results suggest that this S-oligo is useful for inhibiting the production of IL4 preferentially without affecting other functions of Th2 cells.
