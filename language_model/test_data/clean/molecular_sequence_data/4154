CDP-diacylglycerol synthase (CDS) is a key rate-limiting enzyme in the phospholipid metabolism of Plasmodium falciparum, converting phosphatidic acid to CDP-diacylglycerol. The CDS gene is predominantly expressed in the mature intraerythrocytic stages. Consequently, we physically and functionally characterized the CDS gene promoter. The mRNA transcription initiation site was mapped 121 bp upstream of the CDS gene translation start site. A 1909 bp 5' upstream sequence was isolated and found to be transcriptionally active thus constituting a functional CDS promoter. Mapping of this promoter identified a 44 bp cis-acting sequence, located between -1640 and -1596 bp upstream of the ATG codon, essential for efficient transcriptional activity. This 44 bp sequence binds specifically to nuclear factors from trophozoite stage parasites. We further showed that a 24 bp element, lying within the 44 bp sequence, mediates the specific binding to nuclear proteins and shows no significant homology to known eukaryotic DNA consensus sequence elements that bind transcription factors. The deletion of the 24 bp element abrogated promoter activity, indicating that this cis-acting sequence element is essential for efficient transcription of the CDS gene.
