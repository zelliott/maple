We report here a novel gene, NPGPR, which encodes a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is most similar to the peptide receptor subfamily. The coding region of the human NPGPR gene predicts a seven transmembrane domain receptor of 522 amino acids and having a relatively large N-terminus of 147 amino acids. The NPGPR sequence has 30-33% amino acid identity to NPY receptors and similar percentage identity to orexin receptors (32%). Northern blot analysis reveals an abundant 1.5 kb NPGPR transcript in human placenta. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR determined additional sites of expression in thymus, testis and small intestine. These sites of mRNA expression suggest a potential role for the novel receptor in signaling to tissues undergoing active cell growth and differentiation. At low levels, NPGPR message is detectable in several other tissues including spleen, prostate, brain, heart, ovary, colon, kidney, lung, liver, and pancreas.
