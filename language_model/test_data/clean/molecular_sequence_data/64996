The cDNA of a decapentaplegic (dpp) orthologue from the sawfly, Athalia rosae (Hymenoptera), was cloned and characterized. The clone (Ar dpp) was 2,566 bp long and encoded 395 amino acids in a single open reading frame. Genomic Southern blotting showed that Ar dpp is a single copy gene. The deduced amino acid sequence can be aligned along its entire length with known insect DPPs. It shared common characteristics such as a signal sequence, a pro-domain region, and a ligand domain with seven cysteines at conserved locations. Ar dpp was expressed as a single 5.0-kb mRNA in embryos, larvae, pupae and adults. In situ hybridization showed that Ar dpp was expressed in the dorsal region proper in early embryonic stages and in the embryonic appendages of cephalic segments (labrum, antenna, mandible, maxilla, and labium), thoracic segments (thoracic legs), and all abdominal segments except the tenth segment (pleuropodia and proleg primordia). The present results indicate that Ar dpp expression reflects the primary determination of embryonic appendages.
