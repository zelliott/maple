In recent years, the localization and function of placental tissue proteins (PPs), extracted by Bohn et al., have been extensively studied, the genetic code has been identified for each of the PPs. The present study was carried out to clarify the mRNA expression and protein localization of PP11, PP12, PP19 at the cell level and also to define PP19 the nature of which has remained obscure. PP19 was said to be placenta-derived S-100P. PP11 mRNA was not expressed in cytotrophoblast-derived normal placental tissue or endometrium-derived normal cells, but was expressed in syncytiotrophoblast-derived normal placental tissue, and in choriocarcinoma and endometrial adenocarcinoma, suggesting its involvement in carcinogenesis. PP12 mRNA was expressed in cytotrophoblast-derived normal placental tissue or endometrium-derived normal cells, but was not expressed in syncytiotrophoblast-derived normal placental tissue, choriocarcinoma or endometrial adenocarcinoma, suggesting that this protein serves in the function of normal cells. PP19 mRNA was expressed in the squamous epithelial cells of the uterine cervix and the villous cells, PP19 was localized in more differentiated regions, where cells tended toward keratinization, in both normal and dysplastic uterine cervices. In squamous cell carcinoma, PP19 was localized in more differentiated cells with a large cytoplasm. PP19 mRNA was not expressed in normal endometrial glands, but was detected in endometrial adenocarcinoma, suggesting its involvement in cell differentiation in cervical epitherial cells.
