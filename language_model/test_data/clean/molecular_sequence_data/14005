A gene encoding a P-type cation translocating ATPase was cloned from a genomic library of rat-derived Pneumocystis carinii. The nucleotide sequence of the gene contains a 2781 base-pair open reading frame that is predicted to encode a 101,401 dalton protein composed of 927 amino acids. The P. carinii ATPase protein (pcal) is 69-75% identical when compared with eight proton pumps from six fungal species. The Pneumocystis ATPase is less than 34% identical to ATPase proteins from protozoans, vertebrates or the Ca++ ATPases of yeast. The P. carinii ATPase contains 115 of 121 residues previously identified as characteristic of H+ ATPases. Alignment of the Pneumocystis and fungal proton pumps reveals five homologous domains specific for fungal H+ ATPases.
