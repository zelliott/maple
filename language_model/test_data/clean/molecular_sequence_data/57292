We have amplified, by the polymerase chain reaction, and have sequenced the D-loop region of the mitochondrial DNA from the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus). The sperm whale D-loop was aligned with D-loop sequences from four other cetaceans (Commerson's dolphin, orca, fin whale, and minke whale) and an out-group (cow). This alignment showed the sperm whale sequence to be larger than that of other cetaceans. In addition, some sequence blocks were highly conserved among all six species, suggesting roles in the functioning of mitochondrial DNA. Other blocks that were previously reported to be well conserved among cetaceans showed little sequence conservation with the sperm whale D-loop, which argues against the functional importance of these sequence blocks in cetaceans.
