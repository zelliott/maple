From the dried bulbs of the lily (Lilium brownii), a protein with strong antifungal and mitogenic activities was isolated. It also exhibited an inhibitory action on the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The protein was single-chained and possessed a molecular weight of 14.4 kDa and an N-terminal sequence distinct from chitinases and antimicrobial proteins of garlic, leek and onion which belong to a family closely related to lily. However, there was a small degree of resemblance to cyclophilins and a considerable extent of identity to the 6.5 kDa arginine/glutamate-rich polypeptide from Luffa cylindrica seeds. A nearly homogeneous preparation was obtained after the extract was fractionated on DEAE-cellulose and Affi-gel Blue gel since subsequent chromatography on Mono S and Superdex 75 both yielded a single peak.
