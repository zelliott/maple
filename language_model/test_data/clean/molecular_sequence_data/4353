The Cre3 gene confers a high level of resistance to the root endoparasitic nematode Heterodera avenae in wheat. A DNA marker cosegregating with H. avenae resistance was used as an entry point for map-based cloning of a disease resistance gene family at the Cre3 locus. Two related gene sequences have been analysed at the Cre3 locus. One, identified as a cDNA clone, encodes a polypeptide with a nucleotide binding site (NBS) and a leucine-rich region; this member of the disease resistance gene family is expressed in roots. A second Cre3 gene sequence, cloned as genomic DNA, appears to be a pseudogene, with a frame shift caused by a deletion event. These two genes, related to members of the cytoplasmic NBS-leucine rich repeat class of plant disease resistance genes were physically mapped to the distal 0.06 fragment of the long arm of wheat chromosome 2D and cosegregated with nematode resistance.
