Tourette syndrome (TS) is an etiologically heterogeneous disorder, the pathogenesis of which is incompletely understood. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is involved in regulation of developmental processes and cellular differentiation, in transcription regulation, in DNA repair, and in cell death. However, the relationship between TS and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PARP1 is unknown. Therefore, the aim of this experiment was to test the hypothesis that whether the PARP1 SNP, rs1805404 (c.243C>T, Asp81Asp), had an association with TS. A case-control experiment was designed to test this hypothesis. 123 TS children and 122 normal children were enrolled in this study. Polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism was used for the detection of the PARP1 SNP, rs1805404, in TS patients and normal children. The data showed that there is a significant difference in genotype distributions between these two groups. The CT genotype was a risk factor for TS with an odds ratio of 2.34 for the CT versus TT genotype (95% CI 1.16-4.74). The data also showed this SNP had an association with TS under recessive model (P = 0.0426), and TT genotype had a protective effect against TS with an odds ratio of 0.50 (95% CI 0.26-0.98). The findings of this study suggested that variants in the PARP1 gene might play a role in susceptibility to TS.
