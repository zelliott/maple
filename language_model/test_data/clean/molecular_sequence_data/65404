We report expression profiles of several genes of carbohydrate metabolism, cell wall invertase (CWI) in particular, to better understand sugar transport and its utilization in developing caryopses of grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]. Gene expression analyses for CWI using RNA gel blot and real-time quantitative PCR approaches on developing caryopses, including the glumes (maternal tissue appended to the seeds), showed expression of SbIncw (ZmIncw2 ortholog) primarily in the basal sugar unloading zone of endosperm. The expression of ZmIncw1 ortholog was significantly less abundant and restricted to the glumes. The protein and enzyme activity data corroborated the temporal transcript expression profile that showed maximal CWI protein (INCW) expression preceding the starch-filling phase of endosperm development, i.e. 6-12d-after-pollination (DAP). Protein gel blot analysis using polyclonal maize INCW1 antibodies showed a single polypeptide of 72kDa. The highest level of enzyme activity was unique to the basal part of the endosperm, in particular the basal endosperm transfer cell (BETC) layer and the maternal pedicel region that were highly enriched for the INCW protein, as seen by immunolocalization. High hexose-to-sucrose ratio in 6-12 DAP seeds, and negligible starch deposition in glumes corroborated the CWI activity data. Additionally, we report transcription profiles of several other genes related to sugar-to-starch metabolism in developing sorghum endosperm. As in maize, the INCW-mediated apoplastic cleavage of sucrose in the BETC and pedicel during the early developmental stages of caryopses is essential for the normal development of filial tissues. The unique cell-specificity of the INCW protein to both proximal and distal ends of placental sac shown here for the first time is likely to greatly increase uptakes of both hexose sugars and water through turgor sensing into developing seed. This trait is unique to sorghum among cereals and may facilitate its survival in drought environment.
