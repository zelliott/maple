In the course of the purification of enone reductase participating to the reduction of pulegone, two reductases (NtRed-1 and NtRed-2) were isolated from cultured cells of Nicotiana tabacum. The partial amino acid sequences of the reductases revealed that NtRed-1 was allyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (Accession No. BAA89423) and NtRed-2 was malate dehydrogenase (Accession No. CAC12826). cDNA cloning and expression of these reductases in Escherichia coli were performed. Reduction with recombinant proteins was examined with cyclic alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones, such as pulegone, carvone and verbenone, as substrates. It was found that the recombinant NtRed-1 catalyses the hydrogenation of the exocyclic C-C double bond of pulegone.
