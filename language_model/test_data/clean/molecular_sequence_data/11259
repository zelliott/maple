Two Eucalyptus homologues of the Arabidopsis floral homeotic gene AP1 (EAP1 and EAP2) show 60-65% homology to AP1. EAP1 and EAP2 are expressed predominantly in flower buds. EAP2 produces two different polypeptides arising from differential splicing at an intron, the shorter EAP2 protein diverging from the longer sequence after amino acid 197 and having a translation stop after residue 206. This truncated protein includes both MADS- and K-box amino acid sequences. Ectopic expression of the EAP1 or either of the two EAP2 polypeptides in Arabidopsis driven by the 35S promoter produces effects similar to the corresponding AP1 construct, causing plants to flower earlier, have shorter bolts and resemble the terminal flower mutant (tfl).
