CYP1C is the newest member of the CYP1 family of P450s; however, its physiological significance, inducers, and metabolic functions are unknown. Two full-length alleles of Fundulus heteroclitus CYP1C1 complementary DNA were cloned. The 529 amino acid protein shared the highest amino acid identity with Stenotomus chrysops CYP1C1 (81%). To investigate whether the carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) was a CYP1C1 inducer, we used real-time PCR to quantitatively measure tissue- and sex-specific expression of both CYP1C1 and CYP1A messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in BaP-exposed adult fish. CYP1C1 mRNA expression was constitutively higher than CYP1A in brain, spleen, eye, and gonad, while CYP1A was higher in gastrointestinal tract (GI), heart, gill, and liver. Kidney had equal but high expression of both CYP1s. There were sex differences in constitutive CYP1 expression in the GI, liver, gill, and eye. BaP exposure caused induction of CYP1C1 expression in female and male heart (31- and 17-fold), gill (seven- and four-fold), and liver (six- and five-fold), respectively. Embryo CYP1 expression was constitutively highest at 2 weeks posthatch, and whole embryos expressed 3- to 15-fold more CYP1C1 mRNA compared to CYP1A. BaP, 10 microg/l for 10 days, caused induction of both genes at 120 and 240 h postfertilization. Our results suggest that teleost CYP1C, in addition to CYP1A, is inducible by BaP, has a broad tissue distribution, and should be further investigated for its role in carcinogen bioactivation.
