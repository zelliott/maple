The genetic diversity among 80 Vitis materials including 62 indigenous accessions of 17 wild Vitis species in China and 7 interspecific hybrids, 10 V. vinifera L. cultivars, and 1 V. riparia Michaux were evaluated by simple sequence repeat and sequence-related amplified polymorphism markers. A total of 10 simple sequence repeat primers and 11 sequence-related amplified polymorphism primer combinations were amplified, and 260 bands were generated, of which 252 were polymorphic with an average polymorphism rate of 97.02%. Genetic relationships among the different Vitis species indicated that V. ficifolia and V. yeshanensis could be considered a separate species. As for the 4 major ecogeographic regions of Chinese wild Vitis species, the genetic diversities of Chinese wild Vitis species from the Qinling Mountain region (H = 0.1947, I = 0.3067) and the mid-downstream Yangtze River region (H = 0.1834, I = 0.2925) were higher, with results suggesting that these regions may be one of the major centers of Vitis origin. An understanding of the genetic diversity of these Chinese wild Vitis species could provide the theoretical foundation for further protection and reasonable utilization in grape breeding.
