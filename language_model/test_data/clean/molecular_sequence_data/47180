The complete nucleotide sequence of the fish rhabdovirus viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) has been determined. The genome comprises 11158 bases and contains six long open reading frames encoding the nucleoprotein N, phosphoprotein P, matrix protein M, glycoprotein G, nonstructural viral protein NV, and polymerase L. Genes are arranged in the order 3'-N-P-M-G-NV-L-5'. The exact 3' and 5' ends were determined after RNA-oligonucleotide ligation or RACE. They show inverse complementarity as in other rhabdovirus genomes. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences exhibit significant homology to corresponding sequences in the related fish rhabdovirus infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus.
