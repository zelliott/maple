Semaphorin gene family contains a large number of secreted and transmembrane proteins, and some of them are functioning as the repulsive and attractive cues of the axon guidance during development. Here we report murine orthologues of a novel member of class 6 semaphorin gene, semaphorin 6D (Sema6D), mapped on the chromosome 2. Sema6D is mainly expressed in the brain and lung, and the ubiquitous expression in the brain continues from embryonic late stage to adulthood, as determined by Northern blot and in situ hybridization. We also found that Sema6D has five different splicing variants, and the expression patterns of individual isoforms differ depending on the tissues. Thus, Sema6D may play important roles in various functions including the axon guidance during development and neuronal plasticity.
