Lysogeny is widespread in the lactic acid bacteria. The majority of lysogens can be induced by UV irradiation or treatment with mitomycin C, but indicator strains which allow lytic growth of the induced phage are often not easy to identify. A few temperate phages have been shown to transduce chromosomal and/or plasmid markers. Information about the molecular biology of the temperate phages from lactic acid bacteria is sparse and needs significant supplementation in order that these potentially valuable phages might be utilized more efficiently as tools for improving existing starter strains in dairy fermentations.
