By alignment to the carboxy-terminal-deduced aa sequence of human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein B (gB), conserved hexameric aa motifs with putative function for localization in the inner nuclear membrane (INM) were identified in the nucleoplasmic tails of herpes simplex virus type 1 gB and of the cellular lamin B receptor. Fusion of the respective hexamers to CD8 as a reporter redirected transport of the chimeras into the INM, suggesting their functioning as modular signal motifs. Consecutive experiments showed that the three-residue motif RxR represents a consensus sequence which is sufficient for localization of the CD8 reporter in the INM.
