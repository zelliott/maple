We report the complete mitochondrial DNA sequence of the spotted asparagus beetle, Crioceris duodecimpunctata. The genome complement, gene order, and nucleotide composition of this beetle's mitochondrial genome were found to be typical of those reported for other insects. Unusual features of this genome include the substitution of UCU for GCU as the anticodon for tRNA(Ser), an unusual TpsiC loop for the tRNA(Ile) gene, and the identification of a putative ATT start codon for cox1. The utility of complete mitochondrial genome data for phylogenetic inference of the insect orders was tested, and compared to that of cox1 and combined mitochondrial ribosomal DNA sequences. Even though the number of insect orders represented by complete mitochondrial genomes is still limited, several well-established relationships are evident in the phylogenetic analysis of the complete sequences. Monophyly of the orders Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Coleoptera were consistently recovered. Monophyly of the Holometabola was also observed in some (though not all) analyses. The accumulation of complete mitochondrial sequences from a broader array of insect orders holds the promise of clarifying the early diversification of insects.
