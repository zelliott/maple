The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) plays an important role in malignant transformation and in apoptosis. Its role in human cancer has now been firmly established. IGF-IR signaling occurs only when the receptor is activated by its ligands, which induce autophosphorylation of the receptor at several tyrosine residues. Although the IGF-IR (phosphorylated or not) can be detected in human cancers with conventional antibodies, it would be desirable to obtain antibodies that can detect the IGF-IR only when activated by its ligands. We describe and characterize in this paper such an antibody and show that it can be used in sections of human cancers to detect an autophosphorylated IGF-IR. This antibody will be useful in detecting autocrine or paracrine influences on normal and tumor cells and could eventually be also useful in diagnostic and prognostic studies of human primary and metastatic cancer.
