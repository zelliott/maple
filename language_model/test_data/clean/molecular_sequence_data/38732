A new method of epitope mapping based on chimeric swine vesicular disease (SVD) viruses produced by fusion PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Seven out of 16 neutralising and non-neutralising newly produced monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) discriminated between SVD isolate ITL/1/66 and NET/1/92. Using fusion PCR eight chimeric viruses were produced containing different supplementary pieces of the P1 region of both parent strains. Using these chimeric viruses we were able to map the epitope regions recognised by these seven neutralising and non-neutralising Mabs. This new method, using chimeric viruses produced by fusion PCR, is particularly valuable for the epitope mapping of non-neutralising MAbs.
