Recently, human and rodent homologs of yeast repair genes Rad51 and Rad52 have been identified and proposed to play roles in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. In this study, cell cycle-dependent expression of human and rodent RAD51 and RAD52 proteins was monitored using two approaches. First, flow cytometric measurements of DNA content and immunofluorescence were used to determine the phase-specific levels of RAD51 and RAD52 protein expression in irradiated and control populations. The expression of both proteins was lowest in G0/G1, increased in S and reached a maximum in G2/M. No difference was found in the whole-cell level of RAD51 or RAD52 protein expression between gamma-irradiated and control cell populations. Second, cell cycle-dependent protein expression was confirmed by Western analysis of populations synchronized in G0, G1 and G2 phases. Analysis of V3, a hamster equivalent of SCID, indicates that the protein level increases of RAD51 and RAD52 from G0 to G1/S/G2 do not require DNA-PK.
