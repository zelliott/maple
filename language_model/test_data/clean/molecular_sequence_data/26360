In the present work, we intend to determine the capacity of human lymphocytes to recognize subfragments of the serine-stretch protein SERP, a blood-stage antigen from Plasmodium falciparum. Individuals sensitized by a previous P. falciparum infection were studied. Some recombinant proteins (RP) including RP7 and RP10 (amino acids 631-684 and 631-892 of SERP, respectively), were recognized in proliferation assays by lymphocytes from 28 sensitized individuals and not by lymphocytes from control, non-sensitized, donors. Synthetic peptides covering predefined zones of particular interest were tested and appeared to induce proliferative responses of lymphocytes from sensitized donors, allowing identification of putative T cell epitopes.
