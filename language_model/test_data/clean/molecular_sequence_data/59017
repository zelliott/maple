The 5'-flanking region of the gene for a Ca(2+)-binding protein regucalcin was cloned from a rat genomic library which was constructed in lambda EMBL3 SP6/T7 vector. The genomic library was screened by using the radiolabeled probe with the 5' region (0.5 kb) of rat regucalcin complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA). Positive clone had the 5.5 kb fragment which was hybridized with the 5'-probe. This fragment contained three exons (I-III) of the gene coding for a rat regucalcin. The nucleotide sequence of exons completely agreed with that of a rat regucalcin cDNA clone. A supposed translational initiation site existed in the exon II. Homology analysis showed that a putative transcription start site in the rat regucalcin gene was located at position 26 downstream from a TATA-box. Another upstream element, a CCAAT box-like sequence, was located at -170. Moreover, there were many regulatory elements (Hox, AP-1, AP-2 and AP-4) in the 5'-flanking region of the rat regucalcin gene. The organization of rat regucalcin gene seemed to be about 18 kb in size and consisted of seven exons and six introns.
