We have analysed 1H, 15N-HSQC spectra of the recombinant, NADP(H)-binding component of transhydrogenase in the context of the emerging three dimensional structure of the protein. Chemical shift perturbations of amino acid residues following replacement of NADP+ with NADPH were observed in both the adenosine and nicotinamide parts of the dinucleotide binding site and in a region which straddles the protein. These observations reflect the structural changes resulting from hydride transfer. The interactions between the recombinant, NADP(H)-binding component and its partner, NAD(H)-binding protein, are complicated. Helix B of the recombinant, NADP(H)-binding component may play an important role in the binding process.
