We present here a detailed physical map encompassing over 600 kb of mouse Chromosome (Chr) 17 in the region of plasminogen, D17Rp17e, and quaking. This region is cloned in yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs). We have identified several CpG islands within this region from pulsed field gel mapping of mouse genomic DNA and YAC DNA. Five new DNA probes have been generated. One, D17Leh514, is a minimum of about 90 kb distal to plasminogen. Four, D17Leh513, D17Leh512, D17Leh511, and D17Leh510, are proximal to D17Rp17e, the closest previously described genetic marker to quaking viable and quaking lethal-1 mutations. We have genetically mapped D17Leh511 to within 0.15 cM of these mutations. The genetic distance to D17Rp17e from D17Leh511 is also 0.15 cM; the physical distance of less than 360 kb (minimum 200 kb) is consistent with an approximation of 2 Mbp per cM.
