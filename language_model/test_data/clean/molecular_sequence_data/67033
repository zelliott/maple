This review covers current developments in molecular-based studies of the structure and function of carboxylesterases. To allay the confusion of the classic classification of carboxylesterase isozymes, we have proposed a novel nomenclature and classification of mammalian carboxylesterases on the basis of molecular properties. In addition, mechanisms of regulation of gene expression of carboxylesterases by xenobiotics and involvement of carboxylesterase in drug metabolism and enzyme induction are also described.
