The synergistic interaction between pectin and chitosan in aqueous acid solution and in the gel phase has been studied by oscillatory shear measurements. Mixtures of pectin and chitosan form thermoreversible gels over a broad composition range by lowering the temperature. The value of the gelation temperature depends on the composition of the mixture, with low values for mixtures with low pectin contents. For incipient gels, a power law can describe the frequency dependence of the complex viscosity, with power law exponents close to -1. The gel evolution of pectin-chitosan mixtures upon a temperature quench below the gel point has been studied. Evidence is provided for a relation between gelation and phase separation in the process of temperature-induced gelation of pectin-chitosan mixtures. A simple model is proposed to rationalize the gelation process in these systems.
