We have previously identified the gene (the ssc gene) defective in the thermosensitive and antibiotic-supersusceptible outer membrane permeability mutant SS-C of Salmonella typhimurium and shown that this gene is analogous to the Escherichia coli gene firA (L. Hirvas, P. Koski, and M. Vaara, EMBO J. 10:1017-1023, 1991). Others have tentatively implicated firA in a different function, mRNA synthesis. Here we report that the defect in the thermosensitive outer membrane omsA mutant of E. coli (T. Tsuruoka, M. Ito, S. Tomioka, A. Hirata, and M. Matsuhashi, J. Bacteriol. 170:5229-5235, 1988) is due to a mutation in firA; this mutation changed codon 271 from serine to asparagine. The omsA-induced phenotype was completely reverted by plasmids containing wild-type firA or ssc. Plasmids carrying the omsA allele, or an identical mutant allele prepared by localized mutagenesis, under the control of lac elicited partial complementation. Transcomplementation studies with plasmids carrying various mutant alleles of the S. typhimurium gene indicated that the ability of these plasmids to complement the omsA mutation was similar to their ability to complement the ssc mutation. The antibiotic-supersusceptible phenotype of the omsA mutant closely resembled that of the ssc mutant, i.e., the omsA mutant was supersusceptible to hydrophobic antibiotics and large-peptide antibiotics against which the intact outer membrane is an effective permeability barrier. As previously demonstrated with the omsA mutant, the outer membrane of the ssc mutant became selectively ruptured after incubation for 1 h at the growth-nonpermitting temperature; 82% of the periplasmic beta-lactamase and less than 3% of the cytoplasmic marker enzyme were released into the medium. All of these findings are consistent with our concept that firA is an essential gene involved in generation of the outer membrane.
