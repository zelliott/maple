The unbound fraction from CM52 columns was used as the source of at least four additional myelin basic protein (MBP) molecules. From this fraction we routinely obtained two major fractions called C8-A and C8-B. The C8-A and C8-B fractions were further purified on HPLC. Each contained two proteins in the 17- to 18-kDa range which we called C8-A(H) (higher M(r)), C8-A(L) (lower M(r)), C8-B(H), and C8-B(L). The citrulline values (calculated as citrulline plus ornithine) were high in three of the four proteins, which was accompanied by a compensatory decrease in the arginine values. The compositions clearly identified these four proteins with the citrullinated form of MBP. Western blot analysis showed that both H and L forms reacted with anti MBP antibodies. Partial sequence analysis after cyanogen bromide cleavage, showed that the sequences of both proteins in the C8-B fraction (C8-B(H) and C8-B(L)) were identical to the 18.5-kDa isoform of MBP. Mass spectrometry by electrospray ionization of the C8-B(H) and C8-B(L) provided us with accurate masses of 18,558.08 +/- 8.13 and 17,266.63 +/- 2.24, respectively. We concluded that the H and L proteins from the C8-B fractions were MBPs. Although similar detailed analyses of the C8-A(H) and C8-A(L) have not been done they are also considered to be MBP on the basis of the immunoreactivity with anti MBP antibodies. The origins of these proteins is not known at this time and their functional significance is obscure. The possibility that they are found in early forms of myelin, as components of transitional membranes between oligodendrocytes and myelin or are involved in remyelination, cannot be discounted.
