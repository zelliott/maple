Mouse microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP4) is a protein that co-locates with microtubules in vivo. It is encoded by a single-copy gene that expresses multiple transcripts in most cell types [West et al., J. Biol. Chem. 266 (1991) 21886-21896]. This report describes the identification of two distinct 3'-untranslated regions (UTR) for MAP4 transcripts. The 3'-UTRs of the transcripts are identical up to the site of polyadenylation of the shorter mRNA. The longer transcript contains an additional 775 nucleotides after the first polyadenylation site. Both poly(A) tails follow the canonical polyadenylation site motif, AAUAAA. These data show that two different UTRs arise as a result of alternative polyadenylation site usage. Northern blots of RNA from different tissues probed with coding sequence show hybridization to the common 5.5- and 6.5-kb transcripts, whereas blots probed with sequence unique to the longer 3'-UTR show hybridization only to the 6.5-kb band. Both transcripts are found within the same cell type. In addition, muscle contains additional transcripts of 8 and 9 kb, of which only the 9-kb transcript hybridizes to the longer 3'-UTR probe.
