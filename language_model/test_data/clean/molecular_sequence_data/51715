The family of serotonin receptors consists of at least eight distinct subtypes, divided into four classes based on their pharmacological and functional characteristics. Here we report the cloning and expression in Swiss 3T3 cells of the human 5-HT2 and 5-HT1A receptor subtypes. Both genes encode functional receptors for 5-HT, that differ considerably in genomic structure, primary amino acid sequence, pharmacology and signal transduction. The 5-HT1A receptor transfectants displayed a single high affinity site for the agonist [3H](+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin HBr ([3H]8-OH-DPAT) and a pharmacological profile specific for the 5-HT1A receptor. In these transfectants, 5-HT mediated a dose-dependent inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels. Cells expressing the 5-HT2 receptor exhibited high affinity binding for the antagonist [3H]ketanserin with a 5-HT2 receptor specific pharmacological profile. In these cells 5-HT activated phospholipase C in a dose-dependent manner. The 5-HT2 receptor displayed a genomic organization quite different from the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor subtypes. While these receptors are encoded by one single exon, the 5-HT2 receptor is encoded by three exons separated by two introns. The latter finding adds and additional molecular criterion for receptor classification.
