A computational method to identify residues likely to initiate allosteric signals has been developed. The method is based on differences within stability and flexibility profiles between wild-type and perturbed structures as computed by a distance constraint model. Application of the approach to three bacterial chemotaxis protein Y (CheY) orthologs provides a comparison of allosteric response across protein family divergence. Interestingly, we observe a rich mixture of both conservation and variability within the identified allosteric sites. While similarity within the overall response parallels the evolutionary relationships, >50% of the best scoring putative sites are only identified in a single ortholog. These results suggest that detailed descriptions of intraprotein communication are substantially more variable than structure and function, yet do maintain some evolutionary relationships. Finally, structural clusters of large response identify four allosteric hotspots, including the β4/α4 loop known to be critical to relaying the CheY phosphorylation signal.
