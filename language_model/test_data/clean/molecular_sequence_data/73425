Annexin IV was found to be highly expressed in various human adenocarcinoma cell lines, but not in an erythroleukemia cell line, K562. We investigated the effects of transfection of human annexin IV cDNA into K562 cells on cell surface lectin receptors. cDNA transfectants were found to be more sensitive to cytotoxic lectins such as Ricinus communis agglutinin and wheat germ agglutinin than mock transfectants. The results of flow cytometric analyses with various lectins showed that the transfectants expressed more sugar chains which bind to Ulex europaeus agglutinin I and Maackia amurensis mitogen than mock transfectants. These results suggest that transfection of annexin IV cDNA increases the expression of alpha-2,3-sialylated and/or fucosylated sugar chains on the surface.
