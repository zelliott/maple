The binding of the synthetic heptasaccharide,beta-D-Galp-(1----3)-beta-D-Galp-(1----6)-beta-D-Galp-(1 ----6)-beta-D-Galp-(1----6)-beta-D-Galp-1-OCH3 (10) with two monoclonal IgAs of the X24 gene-family has been investigated. The ligand 10 was synthesized by silver triflate mediated coupling of O-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzoyl-beta-D-galactopyranosyl)-(1----3)-O-(2,4,6,-t ri-O-benzoyl-beta-D-galactopyranosyl)-(1----3)-2,4,6-tri-O-benzoyl-alpha -D-galactopyranosyl chloride (5) to the benzoylated, all-beta-(1----6)-linked methyl galactotetraoside 13, having O-6(4) free, followed by debenzoylation of the formed, fully protected methyl galactoheptaoside. The blockwise synthesis of the nucleophile 13 from readily available monosaccharides, and the synthesis of 5 from the corresponding beta-1-O-benzoylated trisaccharide, is also described. Heptasaccharide 10 binds with the (1----6)-beta-D-galactan-specific monoclonal antibodies X-24 and J539 with essentially the same Ka-values (5.4 x 10(5) M-1 and 6.4 x 10(5) M-1, respectively) as does the methyl beta-glycoside of all-beta-(1----6)-linked galactotetraose 14 (5.7 x 10(5) M-1 and 5.9 x 10(5) M-1, respectively). Of the series of homologous oligosaccharides studied previously (di- through a hexa-saccharide), 14 was found to show the highest affinity of interaction with both these immunoglobulins. The beta-(1----3)-linked galactotriose, which forms the bulky terminus of 10, does not appear to bind to these IgA. Thus, the observation that the affinity of 10 is the same as that of 14 confirms that these immunoglobulins bind internal tetrasaccharide sequences of the antigenic (1----6)-beta-D-galactopyranan.
