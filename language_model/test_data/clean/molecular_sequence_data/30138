Tomaymycin is a member of the pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepine [P(1,4)B] antitumor antibiotic group. This antibiotic is proposed to react with the exocyclic 2-amino group (N2) of guanine to form a covalent adduct that lies snugly within the minor groove of DNA. While DNA-footprinting experiments using methidiumpropyl-EDTA have revealed the favored bonding sequences for tomaymycin and related drugs on DNA, the stereochemistry at the covalent bonding site (C-11) and orientation in the minor groove were not established by these experiments. In previous studies using a combined fluorescence, high-field NMR, and molecular modeling approach, we have shown that for tomaymycin there are two diastereomeric species (11R and 11S) on both calf thymus DNA and d(ATGCAT)2. Although we were able to infer the identity (stereochemistry at C-11 and orientation in the minor groove) of the two species on d(ATGCAT)2 by high-field NMR and fluorescence studies, in combination with molecular mechanics calculations, definitive experimental evidence was lacking. We have designed and synthesized a self-complementary 12-mer [d(CICGAATTCICG)2] based on the Dickerson dodecamer [d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2] that bonds identically two tomaymycin molecules, each having a defined orientation and stereochemistry. Thus the bis(tomaymycin)-12-mer adduct maintains the self-complementarity of the original duplex molecule. Two-dimensional proton J-correlated spectroscopy (COSY) of the bis(tomaymycin)-d(CICGAATTCICG)2 adduct (I = inosine) unequivocally shows that C-11 of tomaymycin covalently bonds through N2 of guanine with an 11S stereochemistry in the sequence 5'-CGA-3'.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
