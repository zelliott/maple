The complete sequence of a Dictyostelium discoideum cDNA is presented that codes for monoubiquitin extended at its C-terminus by a 52 amino acid tail. The sequence of both the ubiquitin portion and the tail is highly homologous to the one of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and to a partial mouse sequence. The highly basic tail sequence contains a putative metal and nucleic acid-binding motif. The gene encoding the 0.6 kb mRNA of the C-terminally extended ubiquitin is represented only once in the haploid genome. The 0.6 kb mRNA as well as its translation product, a 15 kDa protein, is expressed in exponentially growing cells and remains present for at least 5 h of development. Using antibodies against a synthetic peptide that corresponds to the C-terminal amino acid sequence, a 15 kDa protein containing the extension a synthetic peptide that corresponds to the C-terminal amino acid sequence, a 15 kDa protein containing the extension was also detected in yeast.
