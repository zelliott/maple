Using Trichophyton mentagrophytes cDNA as a template, we performed PCR amplification with the UB1S and UB1R primers for isolation of a partial fragment of T. mentagrophytes ubiquitin gene. We screened the T. mentagrophytes cDNA library prepared with Uni-ZAP phage vector by hybridization with the T. mentagrophytes ubiquitin fragment, UB1S-UB1R. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of T. mentagrophytes ubiquitin gene encoded two ubiquitin repeats in 162 bp to 624 bp. The deduced amino acid sequences of ubiquitin from T. mentagrophytes shared about 98% similarity with those of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Neurospora crassa, and Cryptococcus neoformans.
