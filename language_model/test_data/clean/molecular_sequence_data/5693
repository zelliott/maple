Proteins of the achaete-scute family of transcription factors play important roles in neurogenesis in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a Japanese pufferfish, Fugu rubripes achaete-scute homolog 1, Fash1. Sequence alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence of Fash1 with other vertebrate homologs of the achaete scute homolog 1 subclass shows that the carboxyl 2/3 of the protein, including the basic helix-loop-helix, a putative nuclear localization signal and several consensus phosphorylation sites, is highly conserved. Strikingly, the similarity in this region between eight vertebrate species is close to 90%.
