The rRNA gene promoter regions of three diploid wheats Triticum boeoticum Boiss, Triticum urartu Tum. ex Gandil, and Triticum monococcum L. have been sequenced and analyzed. It has been found that the rRNA promoter initiation regions of diploid wheats contain the sequences, which differ from the evolutionary conserved TATAGTAGG (+1 is underlined) motif of monocots. The transient expression assay in wheat protoplasts confirmed that cloned sequences are active promoters. Deletion analysis showed that the promoter sequence localized between -113 and +15 (relative to +1) is enough to direct RNA polymerase I-dependent transcription.
