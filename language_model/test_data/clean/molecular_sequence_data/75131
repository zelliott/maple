1. The hemD gene, encoding uroporphyrinogen III synthase, has been located adjacent to the hemC gene at 85 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome. 2. The entire nucleotide sequence (741 base pairs) of the hemD gene is reported. 3. E. coli strains harbouring plasmics containing the hemD gene produce greatly elevated levels of uroporphyrinogen III synthase. 4. Purified uroporphyrinogen III synthase, isolated from the hemD-containing strain ST1046, has an Mr of 29,000, in close agreement with that predicted from the nucleotide sequence. 5. The existence of a hem operon is suggested.
