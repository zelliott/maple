A cDNA clone derived from sporulated oocysts of Eimeria tenella and encoding the expression product GX3262 was identified using a monoclonal antibody raised against Eimeria acervulina sporozoites. The cDNA fragment containing the coccidial antigen gene was cloned in bacteriophage lambda gt11, transferred to a plasmid, and introduced into Escherichia coli for analysis of the gene products. The strain carrying the plasmid produced GX3262 as part of a fusion protein consisting of the first 1,006 amino acids of E. coli beta-galactosidase and 112 amino acids of the E. tenella protein of approximately 12 kilodaltons. Partially purified antigen, heat-killed recombinant bacterin, and live E. coli containing the recombinant coccidial antigen were used to immunize 1-week-old or newly hatched broiler chicks. Several immunization protocols were utilized, including boosts with partially purified beta-galactosidase-GX3262, bacterin, or small numbers of live E. tenella oocysts. After challenge with an experimental E. tenella infection, the birds were evaluated by scoring cecal lesions to determine the level of protection. The greatest degree of protection was seen after only a single immunization of 2-day-old birds with a live recombinant E. coli preparation. The results presented here identify GX3262 as a potential candidate coccidial vaccine antigen and provide evidence for the first time that newly hatched chickens can be successfully vaccinated with a recombinant antigen.
