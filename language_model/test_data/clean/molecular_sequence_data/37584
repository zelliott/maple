Aeromonas caviae W-61 produces multiple extracellular xylanases, the xylanases 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. In this study, we purified and characterized the xylanase 5 of A. caviae W-61, and amplified a part of xylanase 5 gene (xyn5). The purified xylanase 5 was found to be a single polypeptide with molecular mass of 140 kDa. It was an endo-beta-1,4-xylanase showing optimum temperature 40 degrees C and optimum pH 6.0. Xylobiose, xylotriose, xylotetrose, xylopentose, xylohexose and a small amount of xylose were detected as the hydrolysis products. The N-terminal amino acid sequence and several internal amino acid sequences of xylanases 5 were determined. From the sequence, a 1.8 kbp fragment was amplified by PCR using forward and reverse primers. DNA sequencing confirmed the presence of nucleotide sequences corresponding to the N-terminal amino acid sequence and the internal amino acid sequences of xylanase 5.
