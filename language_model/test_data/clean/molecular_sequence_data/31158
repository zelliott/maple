Data on nearest neighbors of 5-methylcytosine residues in eukaryotic DNA were analyzed. It was found that the methylation sites C*G and C*NG may be located in three palindromic families: RYRY, YYRR and YYRYRR. It was shown that all the methylated sequences in these DNAs can appear as a result of 5-MeC----T substitutions, proceeding by deamination of 5-MeC residues in the "prototype" sites of each of these families: G*CGC*, C*C*GG and C*C*GCGG. The multiplicity of DNA-methyltransferases in eukaryotic cells and their evolutionary origin from prokaryotic type II methylases, recognizing analogous sequences in DNA, are discussed.
