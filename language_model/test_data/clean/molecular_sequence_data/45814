We isolated a full-length cDNA encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase (HMG-S) from the pine engraver beetle, Ips pini (Say), and examined its genomic structure. The intron-less gene has a predicted 460 amino acid cytosolic protein product with 73% identity to HMG-S from Dendroctonus jeffreyi, and high identity (58-64%) with other insect HMG-Ss. Topically applied juvenile hormone (JH) III induced HMG-S mRNA levels up to 6.5-fold in both sexes, mostly in the anterior midgut, though there were differences between males and females in the timing, sensitivity to JH III dose and tissue distribution of HMG-S mRNA. These data further validate the coordinate regulation of mevalonate pathway genes for de novo isoprenoid pheromone production in bark beetles.
