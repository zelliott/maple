Transglycolytic synthesis of 3'-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine by sequential use of beta-galactosidase from Bacillus circulans and trans-sialidase from Trypanosoma cruzi was described. These reactions depicted the first complete synthesis of a biologically important oligosaccharide with high regioselectivity avoiding use of glycosyltransferases and NDP sugars.
