The lysine residues of rat heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were acetylated by acetic anhydride in the absence and presence of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) or biliverdin reductase (BVR). Nine acetylated peptides were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in the tryptic fragments obtained from HO-1 acetylated without the reductases (referred to as the fully acetylated HO-1). The presence of CPR prevented HO-1 from acetylation of lysine residues, Lys-149 and Lys-153, located in the F-helix. The heme degradation activity of the fully acetylated HO-1 in the NADPH/CPR-supported system was significantly reduced, whereas almost no inactivation was detected in HO-1 in the presence of CPR, which prevented acetylation of Lys-149 and Lys-153. On the other hand, the presence of BVR showed no protective effect on the acetylation of HO-1. The interaction of HO-1 with CPR or BVR is discussed based on the acetylation pattern and on molecular modeling.
