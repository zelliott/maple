The structurally diverse xenobiotic peroxisome proliferators (PPs) increase the number of peroxisomes per cell and the levels of several enzymes, and cause hepatomegaly, often leading to hepatocarcinogenesis in a species- and tissue-specific manner. The deadlocked problems of the molecular mechanism of PP action and its physiological meanings have begun to be understood through cDNA cloning of a PP-activated receptor (PPAR). PPAR, a member of the steroid/thyroid/vitamin superfamily of nuclear receptors, has isoforms and differentially heterodimerizes with other nuclear receptors, providing potential mechanisms not only for species- and tissue-specific actions but also for diverse actions of PPs. Recent findings related to PPAR are summarized, and its possible role in lipid metabolism and involvement in PP-induced hepatocarcinogenesis are discussed.
