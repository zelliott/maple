Screening of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV) is widely used for monitoring the prevalence of HCV infections and to assess HCV infectivity. Among HCV-infected individuals in the general population, the interval between the detection of HCV RNA and the development of HCV antibodies is usually 5 to 6 weeks, but in rare cases, seroconversion may be prolonged up to 6 to 9 months. In this study, we tested for the presence of HCV RNA during the antibody-undetectable period of 19 drug-injecting HCV seroconverters to gain insight into the antibody-negative carrier status in this population. HCV seroconversion status was determined by testing the first and last serum samples obtained from each subject, using third-generation antibody screening and confirmation assays. Serial samples were tested for HCV-specific antibodies to establish the moment of seroconversion and HCV RNA by single reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and branched DNA assay (bDNA) in serum. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were independently collected and tested for HCV RNA. HCV RNA-positivity was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization and sequencing of serial samples. The 19 HCV seroconverters had a mean follow-up of 5 years (range, 1 to 8 years). Of the 19, 4 were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected before HCV seroconversion. HCV RNA was detected in serum before seroconversion in 12 (63.2%) of the 19 HCV seroconverters, independent of HIV status. In 7 of these 12, the antibody-undetectable period was relatively short (2 to 10 months). The other 5, who were all HIV-negative before HCV seroconversion, had intermittent low levels of HCV RNA before seroconversion for a period of more than 12 months, with a mean of 40.8 months (range, 13 to 94 months). In all 5 individuals, independent repeats of the experiments confirmed the presence of HCV RNA in serum, and in 3 of these individuals, HCV-positivity was confirmed in independently collected plasma and PBMC samples. Low levels of HCV RNA may be present during prolonged antibody-undetectable periods before seroconversion in a number of injecting drug users. Independent of HIV status, their immune system appears to be unable to respond to these low HCV RNA levels and was sometimes only activated after reinfections with distinct HCV genotypes. These results indicate that primary HCV infection may not always elicit the rapid emergence of HCV antibodies and suggests that persistent low levels of HCV RNA (regardless of the genotype) may not elicit at all or delay antibody responses for prolonged periods of time.
