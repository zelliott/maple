The Baylisascaris schroederi infection rate among wild giant pandas may reach over 50% or even 100%, making it one of the leading causes of death from primary or secondary infection in wild populations. Until now, little was known about how protective immunity to B. schroederi infection could be achieved. The present study was conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of recombinant Bs-Ag1 from B. schroederi, by cloning the full-length Bs-Ag1 gene of B. schroederi and expressing it in a heterologous host, Escherichia coli BL21. In mice vaccinated with rBs-Ag1 coupled with Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA), there was a significant reduction (69.2%) in the recovery of challenged B. schroederi L3 compared with either nonvaccinated controls or mice vaccinated with FCA alone. Our study supports the use of Bs-Ag1 as a potential candidate for vaccination against B. schroederi infection and provides basic data for further vaccination trials with mixtures of antigens (with Bs-Ag2 and Bs-Ag3) to B. schroederi.
