Aa1 is a toxin purified from the venom of the North African scorpion Androctonus australis. It blocks fast K(+) currents in cerebellar granular cells [Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1468 (2000) 203]. Two full-length cDNAs (about 250 bp) encoding the precursors of putative Aa1 isoforms (AaTX1 and AaTX2) were amplified by PCR from a venom gland cDNA library of A. australis. The deduced precursors were composed of 59 amino acid residues including a signal peptide of 22 residues and a mature toxin of 37 residues. The peptides display 94% sequence identity with Aa1. Intron-exon organisation of the gene corresponding to the AaTX1 cDNAs was also depicted.
