The gene coding for the GM2 activator protein (GM2A) was previously mapped by us to chromosome 5 by an ELISA-based technique. Here we confirm this assignment using a PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrids and describe a regional localization to chromosome 5q32-33 by in situ hybridization. We also confirm the assignment of a pseudogene GM2AP to chromosome 3.
