An intense proteolysis of muscle proteins, mainly due to the action of endogenous proteolytic enzymes, has been reported to occur during the processing of dry-cured ham. This gives rise to an important generation of free amino acids and peptides of small size that contribute directly or indirectly to flavor characteristics of the final product. The nature and properties of the free amino acids generated during postmortem proteolysis have been well established. However, little is known about the identity of peptides generated during the processing of dry-cured ham. In the present paper, we describe the isolation (by ethanol precipitation followed by size exclusion and reverse phase chromatographies) and identification (by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS and collision-induced dissociation MS/MS) in a Spanish dry-cured ham of the following four oligopeptides: (A) TKQEYDEAGPSIVHR, (B) ITKQEYDEAGPSIVHRK, (C) DSGDGVTHNVPIYE, and (D) DSGDGVTHNVPIYEG. This is the first time that these peptide fragments have been reported in dry-cured ham at the end of processing. Sequence homology analysis revealed that the four peptides originated from muscle actin, indicating an extensive hydrolysis of this protein during dry-curing. Some of the cleavage sites corresponding to these fragments in actin were reproduced by other authors through the incubation of this myofibrillar protein in the presence of cathepsin D (EC 3.4.23.5), thus supporting a relevant action of this enzyme during the processing of dry-cured ham.
