Recently intestinal spirochetes were isolated from rheas in Ohio and Iowa with a necrotizing typhlocolitis. These intestinal spirochetes, strains R1 and NIV-1, were characterized and compared with other intestinal spirochetes, including strains of S. hyodysenteriae. Both rhea spirochetes were indole positive, strongly beta-hemolytic, grew under a 1% O2:99% N2 atmosphere, and were morphologically similar to spirochetes in the genus Serpulina. Analysis of rRNA gene restriction patterns (ribotypes), and immunoblots of whole cell proteins, indicated both spirochetes were similar to Serpulina hyodysenteriae strains from swine. Comparisons of nearly complete sequences (> 1458 bases) of the 16S rRNA gene of the two rhea spirochetes with S. hyodysenteriae strains confirmed that rhea spirochetes R1 and NIV-1 were strains of S. hyodysenteriae. These results indicate that S. hyodysenteriae has a broader host range than previously recognized.
