Newly recognized mammalian secretory proteins such as preprolactin are translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent manner. Recent studies revealed that there are two recognition steps for signal peptides during this translocation. The first step is recognition by SRP, which results in elongation arrest, and the second step is interaction between signal peptides and the translocation channel embedded in the ER membrane. To determine the roles of the hydrophobic region of signal peptides in the recognition by SRP and the membrane-embedded translocation machinery, we constructed chimeric proteins consisting of the mature region of preprolactin and signal peptides containing different numbers of leucine residues. The translocation of these chimeric proteins was completely dependent on SRP, and the efficiency increased as the number of leucine residues increased up to 10 and then decreased. Although the efficiency of elongation arrest also increased as the number of leucine residues increased up to 10, it only slightly decreased as the number increased up to 20. Similar results were obtained when the hydrophobic region was replaced by alternate leucine and alanine residues, except that the most efficient translocation occurred when the number was 14. Taken together, the present results suggests that the total hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic region of signal peptides is a determinant for recognition by both SRP and the membrane-embedded translocation machinery, although the specificities of the two signal recognition steps are slightly different from each other.
