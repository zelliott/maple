The isolation and sequence of a cDNA clone encoding the complete mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (mMDH) of watermelon cotyledons is presented. Taking advantage of the polymerase chain reaction technology partial cDNA clones from the central part, the 3' part and the 5' part of the mRNA were obtained with oligonucleotides based on directly determined amino acid sequences. Subsequently, two complete cDNA clones for mMDH were synthesized with a sense primer corresponding to the nucleotide sequence of the amino terminal end of pre-mMDH and two antisense primers corresponding to the major alternative adenylation sites found in the mRNA. The amino acid residues for substrate and cofactor binding identified by X-ray crystallography for pig heart cytoplasmic MDH are conserved in the 320 amino acid long mature higher-plant mMDH. A presequence of 27 amino acids is present at the amino terminal end of the precursor protein.
