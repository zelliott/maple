This review focuses on the location and interaction of three functional sites in F1-ATPases. These are catalytic sites which are located in beta subunits, noncatalytic nucleotide-binding sites which are located at interfaces of alpha and beta subunits and modulate the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme, and a site that binds inhibitory amphipathic cations which is at an interface of alpha and beta subunits. The latter site may participate in transmission of conformational signals between catalytic sites in F1 and the proton-conducting apparatus of F0 in the intact ATP synthases.
