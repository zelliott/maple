The in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity of isolated peptides from of tuna cooking juice hydrolyzed by Protease XXIII (PR) and orientase (OR) was determined. The results showed that the peptide fractions with the molecular weight over 1,422 Da possessed the greatest DPP-IV inhibitory activity. The amino acid sequences of the three peptides isolated from PR and OR hydrolysates were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS, and they were Pro-Gly-Val-Gly-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-Ile-Gly-Pro-Cys-Tyr-Glu (1412.7 Da), Cys-Ala-Tyr-Gln-Trp-Gln-Arg-Pro-Val-Asp-Arg-Ile-Arg (1690.8 Da) and Pro-Ala-Cys-Gly-Gly-Phe-Try-Ile-Ser-Gly-Arg-Pro-Gly (1304.6 Da), while they showed the dose-dependent inhibition effect of DPP-IV with IC(50) values of 116.1, 78.0 and 96.4 Î¼M, respectively. In vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion retained or even improved the DPP-IV inhibitory activities of the three peptides. The results suggest that tuna cooking juice would be a good precursor of DPP-IV inhibitor, and the DPP-IV inhibitory peptides can successfully passed through the digestive tract.
