High-level production of human alpha- and beta-globins in cultured Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9) cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses is described. The expressed globins are produced to 70-140 mg protein/liter of cell culture or 5-10% of the total cellular protein. Two recombinant baculoviruses for alpha-globin, H alpha and H beta alpha, differ in their construction in that the 5'-untranslated region of the beta-globin gene is inserted 5' to the alpha-globin mRNA coding region in H beta alpha. This insertion results in a 40% increase in yield of alpha-globin over that of H alpha. Consistent with previous observations of the processing of recombinant proteins in Sf-9 cells, both alpha- and beta-globins expressed in Sf-9 cells are correctly processed to remove the initiating methionine from the amino termini of the globins. Sequencing of the expressed globins in Sf-9 cells confirms their identity with globins purified from human normal adult hemoglobin.
