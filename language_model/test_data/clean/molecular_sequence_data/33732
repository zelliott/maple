Clip domain serine protease (cSP), characterized by conserved clip domains, is a new serine protease family identified mainly in arthropod, and plays important roles in development and immunity. In the present study, the full-length cDNA of a cSP (designated EscSP) was cloned from Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis by expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and PCR techniques. The 1380 bp EscSP cDNA contained a 1152 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative cSP of 383 amino acids, a 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of 54 bp, and a 3'-UTR of 174 bp. Multiple sequence alignment presented twelve conserved cysteine residues and a canonical catalytic triad (His(185), Asp(235) and Ser(332)) critical for the fundamental structure and function of EscSP. Two types of cSP domains, the clip domain and tryp_spc domain, were identified in the deduced amino acids sequence of EscSP. The conservation characteristics and similarities with previously known cSPs indicated that EscSP was a member of the large cSP family. The mRNA expression of EscSP in different tissues and the temporal expression in haemocytes challenged by Listonella anguillarum were measured by real-time RT-PCR. EscSP mRNA transcripts could be detected in all examined tissues, and were higher expressed in muscle than that in hepatopancreas, gill, gonad, haemocytes and heart. The EscSP mRNA expression in haemocytes was up-regulated after L. anguillarum challenge and peaked at 2 h (4.96 fold, P < 0.05) and 12 h (9.90 fold, P < 0.05). Its expression pattern was similar to prophenoloxidase (EsproPO), one of the components of crab proPO system found in our previous report. These results implied that EscSP was involved in the processes of host-pathogen interaction probably as one of the proPO system members.
