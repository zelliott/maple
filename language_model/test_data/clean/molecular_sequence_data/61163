The SecYEG complex constitutes a protein conducting channel across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. It binds the peripheral ATPase SecA to form the translocase. When isoleucine 278 in transmembrane segment 7 of the SecY subunit was replaced by a unique cysteine, SecYEG supported an increased preprotein translocation and SecA translocation ATPase activity, and allowed translocation of a preprotein with a defective signal sequence. SecY(I278C)EG binds SecA with a higher affinity than normal SecYEG, in particular in the presence of ATP. The increased translocation activity of SecY(I278C)EG was confirmed in a purified system consisting of SecYEG proteoliposomes, while immunoprecipitation in detergent solution reveal that translocase-preprotein complexes are more stable with SecY(I278C) than with normal SecY. These data imply an important role for SecY transmembrane segment 7 in SecA binding. As improved SecA binding to SecY was also observed with the prlA4 suppressor mutation, it may be a general mechanism underlying signal sequence suppression.
