1. Involvement of cholinergic mechanisms in the contractile response to Leu13-motilin (LMT, KW-5139) was investigated in rabbit duodenal segments, and longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus (LM-MP) preparations preincubated wtih [3H]-choline. 2. Contractile response to LMT (0.1 nM-1 microM) consisted of an initial rapid (phasic) contraction and a tonic contraction slowly fading to a sustained plateau. LMT caused a concentration-dependent phasic contraction of rabbit isolated duodenal segments. The EC50 value was 2.5 nM and the maximum amplitude of the contraction was 103% of the response induced by acetylcholine (ACh, 100 microM). Neither tetrodotoxin nor atropine changed the EC50 value or the maximum amplitude of the response to LMT. 3. Both atropine and tetrodotoxin decreased the amplitude and accelerated fading of the tonic contraction produced by LMT. 4. LMT (30 nM-3 microM) induced an increase of 3H-outflow, in a concentration-dependent manner. The LMT-induced increase of 3H-outflow was prevented by removal of external Ca2+ or by the presence of tetrodotoxin. 5. Porcine motilin (10 nM-1 microM) also stimulated the release of 3H at a similar concentration-range to that seen with LMT. 6. Pretreatment with LMT (3 microM for 20 min) decreased LMT- and the porcine motilin-evoked release of 3H but did not alter the high K(+)-evoked release. 7. Our results suggest that LMT and porcine motilin stimulate the release of ACh from enteric neurones through the same receptor, and that the release of ACh plays a role in tonic components of contraction in the rabbit duodenum.
