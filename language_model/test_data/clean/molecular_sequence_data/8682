To investigate whether both tissue culture and PCR on a sequence from the repetitive rDNA could contribute to the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis, blood samples and, if they were available, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and aqueous humor samples from 72 human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive patients with suspected toxoplasmosis were prospectively tested. For 10 patients with fever of unknown origin but without confirmed toxoplasmosis, no Toxoplasma gondii was detected. For two patients with confirmed toxoplasmic uveitis, only PCR of aqueous humor samples was positive. Of 60 patients (48 with CSF samples) with neurological signs, 25 (from 13 of whom CSF samples were available) had confirmed cerebral toxoplasmosis and 10 had a positive PCR of CSF and/or blood samples, while for 1 patient culture of the CSF sample was also positive. Unlike tissue culture, PCR of rDNA is of value for the detection of cerebral toxoplasmosis in human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive patients, provided that both CSF and blood samples are available (sensitivity, 76.9%; specificity, 100%).
