Sequence analysis of Streptomyces lavendulae NRRL 2564 chromosomal DNA adjacent to the mitomycin resistance locus mrd (encoding a previously described mitomycin-binding protein [P. Sheldon, D. A. Johnson, P. R. August, H.-W. Liu, and D. H. Sherman, J. Bacteriol. 179:1796-1804, 1997]) revealed a putative mitomycin C (MC) transport gene (mct) encoding a hydrophobic polypeptide that has significant amino acid sequence similarity with several actinomycete antibiotic export proteins. Disruption of mct by insertional inactivation resulted in an S. lavendulae mutant strain that was considerably more sensitive to MC. Expression of mct in Escherichia coli conferred a fivefold increase in cellular resistance to MC, led to the synthesis of a membrane-associated protein, and correlated with reduced intracellular accumulation of the drug. Coexpression of mct and mrd in E. coli resulted in a 150-fold increase in resistance, as well as reduced intracellular accumulation of MC. Taken together, these data provide evidence that MRD and Mct function as components of a novel drug export system specific to the mitomycins.
