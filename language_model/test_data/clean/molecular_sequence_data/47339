The N-type voltage-dependent calcium channels play a significant role in neurotransmitter release. The alpha1B subunit of the N-type calcium channel functions as the primary subunit that forms the pore and contains the structural motifs that mediate the pharmacological and gating properties of the channel. We report on an isoform of the alpha1B subunit that is preferentially expressed by the monoaminergic neurons of the rat brain. This isoform contains a 21-amino acid cassette in the synprint site present in the cytoplasmic loop between domains IIS6 and IIIS1. RT-PCR of micropunched tissue was used to show preferential expression of this isoform in regions of the brain containing monoaminergic neurons and to a lesser extent in the cerebellum. Double-label in situ hybridization was used to show expression of this isoform mRNA in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral mesencephalon. The expression of two distinct N-type calcium channels containing these alpha1B subunit isoforms by the monoaminergic neurons may provide for synapse-specific regulation of neurotransmitter release.
