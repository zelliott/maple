The ends of eukaryotic chromosomes have special properties and roles in chromosome behavior. Selection for telomere function in yeast, using a Chinese hamster hybrid cell line as the source DNA, generated a stable yeast artificial chromosome clone containing 23 kb of DNA adjacent to (TTAGGG)n, the vertebrate telomeric repeat. The common repetitive element d(GT)n appeared to be responsible for most of the other stable clones. Circular derivatives of the TTAGGG-positive clone that could be propagated in E. coli were constructed. These derivatives identify a single pair of hamster telomeres by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The telomeric repeat tract consists of (TTAGGG)n repeats with minor variations, some of which can be cleaved with the restriction enzyme MnlI. Blot hybridization with genomic hamster DNA under stringent conditions confirms that the TTAGGG tracts are cleaved into small fragments due to the presence of this restriction enzyme site, in contrast to mouse telomeres. Additional blocks of (TTAGGG)n repeats are found approximately 4-5 kb internally on the clone. The terminal region of the clone is dominated by a novel A-T rich 78 bp tandemly repeating sequence; the repeat monomer can be subdivided into halves distinguished by more or less adherence to the consensus sequence. The sequence in genomic DNA has the same tandem organization in probably a single primary locus of >20-30 kb and is thus termed a minisatellite.
