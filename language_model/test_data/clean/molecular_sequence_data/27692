A novel bovine brain inositol-phospholipid-specific phospholipase C has been identified on the basis of chromatographic behaviour and purified to apparent homogeneity by a rapid three-step procedure. The purified enzyme has a molecular mass of 85 kDa on SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a specific activity of 24 mumol.min-1.mg-1. The enzyme is dependent on Ca2+ and shows a marked preference for inositol phospholipid substrates. The unique nature of this polypeptide was confirmed through partial protein sequence analysis.
