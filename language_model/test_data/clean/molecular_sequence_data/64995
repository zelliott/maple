Wnt signaling molecules regulate the development of multiple organs in vertebrate embryos. We have isolated cDNA clones for frizzled10 (Fz10), which encodes a putative Wnt receptor, to further characterize the mechanisms of Wnt signaling in mouse embryos. Interestingly, Fz10 is expressed in the same regions as Wnt7a in the neural tube, limb buds, and MÃ¼llerian duct.
