Primers for the detection of F.tularensis in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been obtained. The method of PCR permits the identification of up to 10 F.tularensis cells in the analysis of pure and mixed cultures, as well as suspensions prepared from the organs of laboratory animals. The possibility of the simultaneous analysis of several samples makes this system for the detection of F.tularensis useful for epidemiological investigations.
