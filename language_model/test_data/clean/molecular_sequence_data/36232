An exonic single nucleotide substitution in the human androgen receptor gene (hAR) could be detected in an Italian family with two children affected by complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), also called testicular feminization. This mutation leads to a guanine to adenine transition in exon 5, changing the sense of the codon from methionine (ATG) to valine (GTG). As this mutation abolishes a NcoI restriction site, a rapid test for the mutation can be performed by digestion of the polymerase chain reaction products with this enzyme. Previous results of indirect gene diagnosis in this family could be confirmed by this method.
