1. The behavioural responses of two species of freshwater pulmonate snails [Bulinus (P.) globosus and Bulinus rohlfsi] to sugar gradients were investigated by means of diffusion olfactometers. 2. Both snail species proved to be very discriminating in their responses. Of the 17 sugars tested, 35.3%, namely D(-)glucuronic, maltotriose, maltose, cellobiose, D(-)arabinose, D(+)mannose proved to be statistically significant attractants or arrestants to B. rohlfsi. Only 23.5% of these sugars (maltotriose, maltose), D(+) mannose and D(+) xylose were significant attractants or arrestants to B. (P.) globosus. 3. Glucuronic acid was a significant repellent to B. rohlfsi but none of the sugars was a repellent to B. (P.) globosus. 4. The results are compared with those obtained for other snail species and their relevance to the ecology and control of the snails are discussed.
