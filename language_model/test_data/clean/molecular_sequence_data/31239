A cDNA encoding the mature region of goat alpha-lactalbumin and the 3'-non-coding region was fused to cDNA of the N-terminal half of porcine adenylate kinase which had been placed under the control of the tac promoter in an expression vector in Escherichia coli. In addition, a methionine codon was inserted between the two cDNAs. When the plasmid carried the full-length 3'-non-coding region, little accumulation of the fused protein was observed. However, the deletion of two-thirds of the 3'-non-coding region produced significant expression of the fused protein in E. coli strain JM105. Since goat alpha-lactalbumin contains no methionine residue, the mature goat alpha-lactalbumin was isolated by CNBr digestion of the fused insoluble protein and refolded using thioredoxin. The homogeneous and biologically active goat alpha-lactalbumin was purified by Ca2+ ion-dependent hydrophobic chromatography.
