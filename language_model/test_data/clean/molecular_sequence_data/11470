PCR technology permits the detection of viruses at levels several orders of magnitude lower than is possible by other methods. This high sensitivity facilitates detection of virus sequences during the early stages of infection of plants and in soil and vector samples. Early detection of beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) in Beta vulgaris is an important part of the strategy for prevention of the spread of rhizomania, a commercially significant disease of sugar beet. A diagnostic test for BNYVV has been developed. This test involves amplification of the viral genome by PCR coupled with non-isotopic labeling and detection of specific sequences. The PCR amplification of BNYVV sequences has been optimized with respect to primer design, sample preparation and reaction conditions. Several non-isotopic labeling strategies for signal amplification have been compared. Hybridization with digoxigenin-labelled cDNA permits the most sensitive detection of PCR products and is the most appropriate method for routine diagnosis. These observations are discussed in the context of the application of PCR for detecting a wide range of viruses.
