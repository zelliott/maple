The modulation of chemical carcinogenesis by three biological response modifiers was assessed in a mouse model. CBA mice given 20-methylcholanthrene s.c. were treated with peptidoglycan monomer, azure B and indomethacin for one month, either from day 0 or 75 after methylcholanthrene injection to assess their effects on tumor incidence (on days 150 and 300), time of tumor appearance, time of death, and duration and dynamics of tumor growth. All three agents significantly influenced some of the parameters of tumor growth, except tumor incidence on day 300. Highly significant sex differences in tumor appearance and growth were observed. Tumors with late appearance grew faster in comparison to tumors with early appearance. The data presented indicate that the effectiveness of anti-cancer body defense mechanisms can be best defined by the time of tumor appearance.
