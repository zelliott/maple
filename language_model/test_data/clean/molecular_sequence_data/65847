Four BK virus (BKV) subtypes are distinguishable by serological and molecular methods. The type I followed by type IV represents the most common subtype. Subtypes II and III occur rarely. The complete sequence of a German subtype II isolate was determined. The lack of data on the structure of the non-coding region (NCR) of subtype II and III viruses prompted us to study this part of the genome in more detail. Sequence comparisons revealed that the archetypal configuration of subtype I strain WW seems to be predominant among BKV subtypes.
