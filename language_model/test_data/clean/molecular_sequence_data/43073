Nucleotide sequencing of the region upstream of two ferredoxin genes, fdxC and fdxN, of Rhodobacter capsulatus revealed the existence of one open reading frame (ORF), ORFU1, in the same orientation as these genes and two other ORFs, ORFU2 and ORFU3, in the opposite orientation. Two potential -24/-12 promoters were found in front of ORFU1 and ORFU2, respectively, and there was a putative upstream activator sequence (UAS) or NifA-binding site between them. The ORFs corresponded to no known nif genes. However, analysis of their putative products showed that the product of ORFU1 (M(r) 47,912) and that of ORFU3 (M(r) 19,090) had a flavodoxin-like domain and a 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxin-like domain, respectively, and that the product of ORFU2 (M(r) 20,424) was a hydrophobic protein with six potential membrane-spanning portions. Results of interposon mutagenesis and complementation experiments indicated that ORFU2 but not ORFU1 is essential for nitrogen fixation and that additional gene(s) essential for nitrogen fixation must be present in the unsequenced region adjacent to ORFU3. Translational fusion analysis involving lacZYA and fdxN or ORFU3 provided evidence that the putative UAS is responsible for regulation of both ORFU1-fdxC-fdxN and ORFU2-ORFU3 operons in opposite orientations, and that the control of the latter is stricter than that of the former.
