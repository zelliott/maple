The nematode's surface comprises a multilayered cuticle, which consists mainly of collagen proteins. We identified, cloned and characterized the first cuticular collagen gene, Mjcol-3, of the plant-parasitic nematode Meloidogyne javanica. The gene putatively encodes a 32.4-kDa collagen protein, including a propeptide which possesses a subtilisin-like protease-cleavage site. Six introns were identified in the gene sequence, with three slightly different acceptor-splicing sites. The basic structure of the predicted MJCOL-3 protein sequence is highly similar to that of the Caenorhabditis elegans DPY-7, with 65.9% identity between the two amino acid sequences. Relative to DPY-7, the putative MJCOL-3 protein has a shorter carboxy-terminus. This non-conserved feature may indicate different contributions of DPY-7 and MJCOL-3 collagens to the structure of the cuticle. Mjcol-3 is developmentally regulated: transcripts were found mainly in preparasitic developing eggs, less in parasitic third- and fourth-stage juveniles and young females shortly after the fourth molt, and much less in females before egg-laying.
