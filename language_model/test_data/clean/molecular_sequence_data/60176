A gene katA that encodes a novel catalase-peroxidase was cloned from the chromosome of Legionella pneumophila. The nucleotide sequence revealed that KatA was highly homologous to members of the bacterial bifunctional catalase-peroxidase family. In addition, KatA has a N-terminal signal sequence and was considered to be present in the periplasm of the bacterium.
