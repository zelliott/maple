Lake Pavin is a meromictic crater lake located in the French Massif Central area. In this ecosystem, most methane (CH(4)) produced in high quantity in the anoxic bottom layers, and especially in sediments, is consumed in the water column, with only a small fraction of annual production reaching the atmosphere. This study assessed the diversity of methanogenic and methanotrophic populations along the water column and in sediments using PCR and reverse transcription-PCR-based approaches targeting functional genes, i.e. pmoA (α-subunit of the particulate methane monooxygenase) for methanotrophy and mcrA (α-subunit of the methyl-coenzyme M reductase) for methanogenesis as well as the phylogenetic 16S rRNA genes. Although methanogenesis rates were much higher in sediments, our results confirm that CH(4) production also occurs in the water column where methanogens were almost exclusively composed of hydrogenotrophic methanogens, whereas both hydrogenotrophs and acetotrophs were almost equivalent in the sediments. Sequence analysis of markers, pmoA and the 16S rRNA gene, suggested that Methylobacter may be an important group actively involved in CH(4) oxidation in the water column. Two main phylotypes were characterized, one of which could consume CH(4) under conditions where the oxygen amount is undetectable.
