The gene responsible for autosomal dominant, fully penetrant, nonsyndromic sensorineural progressive hearing loss in a large Costa Rican kindred was previously localized to chromosome 5q31 and named DFNA1. Deafness in the family is associated with a protein-truncating mutation in a human homolog of the Drosophila gene diaphanous. The truncation is caused by a single nucleotide substitution in a splice donor, leading to a four-base pair insertion in messenger RNA and a frameshift. The diaphanous protein is a profilin ligand and target of Rho that regulates polymerization of actin, the major component of the cytoskeleton of hair cells of the inner ear.
