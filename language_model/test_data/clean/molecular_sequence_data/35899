E-selectin has a "multi-recognition" capability in terms of epitope binding specificity, depending on adhesion conditions (static vs. low- or high-shear stress dynamic systems). Specifically, (i) adhesion based on expression of alpha 2-->3 sialylated Le(x) (SLe(x)) is prominent under static or low shear stress dynamic conditions; (ii) adhesion under high shear stress dynamic conditions does not depend on the known SLe(x) species, but rather on Lex with an adjacent unidentified sialosyl substitution, which shows different susceptibility to sialidases and antibodies compared to known SLe(x).
