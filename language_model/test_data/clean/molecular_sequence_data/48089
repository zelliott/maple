A high-molecular-mass O-specific polysaccharide was obtained by mild acid degradation of Proteus vulgaris O8 lipopolysaccharide followed by gel permeation chromatography. Studies of the polysaccharide by sugar and methylation analyses and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, including 2D COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, and H-detected 1H, 13C heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence (HMQC) experiments, demonstrated the presence of a tetrasaccharide repeating unit having the following structure: [sequence: see text] The role of an epitope associated with the alpha-L-FucpNAc-(1-->3)-D-GlcpNAc disaccharide in serological cross-reactivity of P. vulgaris O8 is discussed.
