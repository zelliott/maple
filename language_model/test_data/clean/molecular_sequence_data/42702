A 7.6-kbp BamHI/XbaI EJ subfragment of the Towne XbaI-E fragment of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) strain Towne has been previously designated as morphological transforming region III (mtrIII) because it induced focal and tumorigenic transformation of rodent fibroblasts. However, in two separate cell systems, mtrIII sequences were not retained because they were not detected in either the focal, tumor or tumor-derived cell lines. In this report, mtrIII was localized to a 2.1-kbp SalI/XbaI DNA fragment. The sequence of the 2,085-bp region was determined and compared to the colinear DNA from HCMV strain AD169. DNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of five open reading frames in Towne mtrIII, two of which are conserved in strain AD169. The localization and sequence analysis of mtrIII will allow further investigation as to the mechanism(s) by which HCMV may play a role in human cancer.
