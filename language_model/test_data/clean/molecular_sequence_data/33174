A Gram-negative, short ovoid- to coccus-shaped, aerobic, motile, non-spore-forming bacterium (designated strain KS-11(T)) was isolated from sediment of the eutrophic Guanting reservoir in Beijing, China. Colonies grown on R2A agar plates were circular, convex and colourless to orange. The strain grew in the presence of up to 1 % NaCl (optimum, 0 % NaCl). Growth occurred at 25-40 degrees C (optimum, 28-37 degrees C) and at pH 6.0-9.5 (optimum, pH 7.5-9.0). On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain KS-11(T) was shown to belong to the class Alphaproteobacteria, being closely related to Paracoccus marinus (96.9 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), followed by Paracoccus koreensis (96.8 %), Paracoccus solventivorans (96.8 %), Paracoccus alkenifer (96.2 %) and Paracoccus kocurii (95.8 %). The major fatty acids of strain KS-11(T) were summed feature 7 (C(18 : 1)omega7c/omega9t/omega12t) (83.8 %) and C(18 : 0) (6.5 %) and the G+C content of the genomic DNA was 69.0 mol%. Based on comparative analysis of physiological and chemotaxonomic data, it is proposed that strain KS-11(T) represents a novel species of the genus Paracoccus, named Paracoccus chinensis sp. nov. The type strain is KS-11(T) (=CGMCC 1.7655(T)=NBRC 104937(T)).
