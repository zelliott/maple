A new Rhizobium species that nodulates Phaseolus vulgaris L. is proposed on the basis of a sequence analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA. This taxon, Rhizobium etli sp. nov., was previously named Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar phaseoli (type I strains) and is characterized by the capacity to establish an effective symbiosis with bean plants, the reiteration of the nitrogenase structural genes, the organization of the common nodulation genes into two separate transcriptional units bearing nodA and nodBC, the presence of the polysaccharide inhibition gene, psi, and the 16S ribosomal DNA sequence. An analysis of the sequence of a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene shows that this gene is quite different from the gene of R. leguminosarum. In addition, all R. etli strains have identical sequences. We describe these analyses and discuss additional evidence supporting our proposal.
