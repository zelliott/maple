Analysis of the crystal structure of HIV-1 integrase reveals a cluster of lysine residues near the active site. Using site-directed mutagenesis and photo-crosslinking we find that Lys156 and Lys159 are critical for the functional interaction of integrase with viral DNA. Mutation of Lys156 or Lys159 to glutamate led to a loss of both 3' processing and strand transfer activities in vitro while maintaining the ability to interact with nonspecific DNA and support disintegration. However, mutation of both residues to glutamate produced a synergistic effect eliminating nearly all nonspecific DNA interaction and disintegration activity. In addition, virus containing either of these changes was replication-defective at the step of integration. Photo-crosslinking, using 5-iododeoxyuracil-substituted oligonucleotides, suggests that Lys159 interacts at the N7 position of the conserved deoxyadenosine adjacent to the scissile phosphodiester bond of viral DNA. Sequence conservation throughout retroviral integrases and certain bacterial transposases (e.g. Tn10/IS10) supports the premise that within those families of polynucleotidyl transferases, these residues are strategic for DNA interaction.
