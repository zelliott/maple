The polysaccharide moiety of the O23 antigen (lipopolysaccharide) consists of D-glucose, D-galactose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose, and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactose in the molar ratios 2:1:2:1. Methylation analysis of the polysaccharide as well as one- and two-dimensional 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy of the polysaccharide and a trisaccharide obtained by Smith degradation showed that the O23 polysaccharide has the primary structure [formula: see text].
