KNOTTED1 (KN1)-like homeobox (KNOX) transcription factors are involved in the establishment and maintenance of plant meristems; however, few direct targets of KNOX proteins have been recognized. Using a combination of double mutant analysis and biochemistry, we found that in maize (Zea mays), KN1 negatively modulates the accumulation of gibberellin (GA) through the control of ga2ox1, which codes for an enzyme that inactivates GA. The ga2ox1 mRNA level is elevated in immature leaves of dominant KNOX mutants and downregulated in reproductive meristems of the null allele kn1-e1. KN1 binds in vivo to an intron of ga2ox1 through a cis-regulatory element containing two TGAC motifs. VP16-KN1 activates transcription in planta from a chimeric promoter containing this binding site. The domains of expression of kn1 and ga2ox1 mRNAs overlap at the base of the shoot apical meristem and the base of newly initiated leaves, suggesting that KN1-mediated activation of ga2ox1 maintains a boundary between meristem cell identity and rapidly elongating cells of the shoot. The KN1 binding site is conserved in ga2ox1 genes of different grasses, suggesting that the local regulation of bioactive GA levels through KNOX proteins is a common theme in grasses.
