Tissue factor pathway inhibitor is the major potent physiologic inhibitor of tissue factor-induced coagulation. Several potential binding sites for transcription factors have been described in the 750 bp of the 5' flanking region of the human tissue factor pathway inhibitor gene reported earlier. To identify elements that regulate the expression of tissue factor pathway inhibitor in endothelial, hepatocyte, and monocyte cells, the sequence of an additional 770 bp of tissue factor pathway inhibitor was determined. Comparison of this new sequence as well as that reported earlier with consensus sequences for transcription factor binding sites provided matches for GATA-2, SP1, and c-Myc sequences. Moreover, plasmids containing deletion mutants of the 5' tissue factor pathway inhibitor promoter region and the luciferase reporter gene were transfected into HepG2, ECV304, and THP1 cells. Three negative regulatory elements were localized between -548 to -390, - 390 to -75, and -1158 to -796 relative to the transcriptional start, respectively, in HepG2, ECV304 and THP-1 cells.
