Regulation of the membrane cofactor protein (MCP: CD46) was examined. While the expression of MCP in mice carrying MCP(BC2) cDNA with 125 bp of 3' untranslated region (3'UT) was minimal, that in mice carrying MCP cDNA without total 3' UT was evident in many organs. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis clearly showed the presence of mRNA even in transgenic mice with 3' UT, suggesting that the expression was regulated at the post-transcriptional stage. The in vitro expression data of MCP molecules on the stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell clone corresponded to that in transgenic mice. The first 125 bp downregulated the expression of MCP molecules in combination with not only beta-actin, but also SR alpha, promoter. Also, this region inhibited expression of decay accelerating factor (DAF: CD55) molecules when it was inserted into cDNA of DAF. Furthermore, the first 32 bp of the 3' UT revealed the same downregulation effect as 125 bp on MCP molecules. These findings indicated that the first 125 bp (and the first 32 bp in particular) of 3' UT regulate the expression of MCP molecules in transgenic mice.
