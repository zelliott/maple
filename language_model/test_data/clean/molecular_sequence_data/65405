Plant genetic tumors represent neoplastic growths, which arise spontaneously in hybrid plants without apparent external induction. To understand the molecular nature of unregulated cell proliferation, a cyclin D cDNA clone encoding a cyclin D of 1104bp was isolated from a genetic tumor and designated Nicgl;CYCD3;1 gene. DNA gel blot analysis suggested that there are two copies of Nicgl;CYCD3;1 in the genetic tumors. Northern analysis showed that this gene had the highest expression level in genetic tumor compared to Nicotiana glauca, N. langsdorffii and hybrid plants. Plant morphology of hybrid plant was an intermediate between N. glauca and N. langsdorffii and was altered in the genetic tumors. The cell cycle distribution in N. glauca was G0/G1, 90.59; S, 0.60; G2/M, 8.81; in N. langsdorffii it was G 0/G1, 86.22; S, 6.90; G2/M, 6.88; in hybrid plants it was G 0/G1, 96.40; S, 1.79; G2/M, 1.81; and in genetic tumors G 0/G1, 74.70; S, 2.35; G2/M, 22.94. These data provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic tumor formation from interspecific hybrid between N. langsdorffii and N. glauca.
