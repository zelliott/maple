A doxorubicin-resistant subline (5637/DR5.5) from human bladder cancer cells (5637) was induced by stepwise increase in the doxorubicin concentration. 5637/DR5.5 cells were cross-resistant to vinblastine and etoposide but not to mitomycin C and cisplatin. We analyzed the mdr1, MRP (multidrug resistance-associated protein), and DNA topoisomerase II gene expression using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) and investigated possible differences in the accumulation and efflux of radiolabeled daunorubicin. 5637/DR5.5 cells do not express the mdr1 gene, but the expression levels of MRP are markedly higher than in drug-sensitive 5637 cells. The intracellular accumulation of radiolabeled daunorubicin was markedly decreased in the 5637/DR5.5 cells in comparison with the parent cells. This reduced drug accumulation was associated with an enhanced drug efflux, but was reversed when cells were incubated with cyclosporin A. Cyclosporin A at the concentration of 5 microM caused 3.4-fold enhancement of daunorubicin-sensitivity in the 5637/DR5.5 cells. On the other hand, there was no difference in DNA-topoisomerase II activity between the parent and resistant cells. The resistance of the 5637/DR5.5 cells is therefore associated with an enhanced drug efflux mediated by the MRP gene overexpression, as distinct from P-glycoprotein, and is modulated by cyclosporin A.
