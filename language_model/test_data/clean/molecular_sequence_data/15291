Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to Cucumber mosaic virus coat protein (CMV-CP) were designed from cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences of the light chain genes of 10 out of 14 different hybridoma cell lines. Ten of these mAbs revealed a very restricted germline family VkappaII, within which gene bd2 has identical amino acid sequences with VIPase and an i41SL 1-2 catalytic antibody light chain, both of which possess peptidase activity. Four out of the 14 mAbs illustrated another germline family VkappaIA, within which gene bb1.1 had high homology with BV04-01 light chain mAb, which hydrolyses ssDNA. Interestingly, our mAbs showed DNA-hydrolytic activity at an optimum pH of 4-5, which is a typical pattern of autoimmune diseases in which autoantibodies hydrolyze supercoiled plasmid DNA. This is the first evidence ever that CMV-CP could stimulate catalytic antibodies, which have an identical sequence homology with autoantibodies. Furthermore, the CMV-CP-specific mAbs will be important for isolating antibodies specific to the CPs of bacteria, viruses, cancer cells, etc. that could be used for medical therapy.
