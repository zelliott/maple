Coronary stenosis was induced in rats to determine whether chronic coronary artery constriction resulted in impairment of cardiac pump performance, alterations in alpha 1-adrenoreceptor signal transduction, and inadequate myocardial hypertrophy, and these parameters were examined 6 mo later. A 50% reduction in coronary diameter was associated with an elevation in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, whereas left ventricular peak systolic pressure, rate of pressure rise and decay were reduced. The hypertrophic response was modest, since statistically significant increases of 11% and 23% in left and right ventricular weights were measured. Radioligand binding documented an 18% and a 38% statistically significant reduction in alpha 1-adrenoreceptor density of the left and right myocardium, respectively. ADP ribosylation of the 41-kDa substrate by pertussis toxin showed a 16% significant decrease of this parameter in the left myocardium. Moreover, a 29% decrease in norepinephrine stimulated phosphoinositol turnover was seen in myocytes, and this change was statistically significant. The depressed generation of intracellular second messengers linked to the alpha 1-adrenoreceptors was found in conjunction with a 19% significant reduction in myocardial norepinephrine content. In conclusion, the long-term effects of coronary stenosis involve impaired transduction of adrenergic signals, which, in combination with constraints on myocardial growth, may participate in the onset of ventricular dysfunction in this model.
