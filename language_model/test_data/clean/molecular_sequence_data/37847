Ribosomal protein L5 is part of the 60 S ribosomal subunit and localizes in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, accumulating particularly in the nucleoli. L5 is known to bind specifically to 5 S rRNA and is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport of this rRNA. Here, we report a detailed analysis of the domain organization of the human ribosomal protein L5. We show that a signal that mediates nuclear import and nucleolar localization maps to amino acids 21-37 within the 297-amino acid L5 protein. Furthermore, carboxyl-terminal residues at positions 255-297 serve as an additional nuclear/nucleolar targeting signal. Domains involved in 5 S rRNA binding are located at both the amino terminus and the carboxyl terminus of L5. Microinjection studies in somatic cells demonstrate that a nuclear export signal (NES) that maps to amino acids 101-111 resides in the central region of L5. This NES is characterized by a pronounced clustering of critical leucine residues, which creates a peptide motif not previously observed in other leucine-rich NESs. Finally, we present a refined model of the multidomain structure of human ribosomal protein L5.
