Recombinant live oral vaccines expressing pathogen-derived antigens offer a unique set of attractive properties. Among these are the simplicity of administration, the capacity to induce mucosal and systemic immunity, and the advantage of permitting genetic manipulation for optimal antigen presentation. In this study, the benefit of having a heterologous antigen expressed on the surface of a live vector rather than intracellularly was evaluated. Accordingly, the immune response of mice immunized with a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine strain expressing the Escherichia coli 987P fimbrial antigen on its surface (Fas(+)) was compared with the expression in the periplasmic compartment (Fas(-)). Orally immunized BALB/c mice showed that 987P fimbriated Salmonella serovar Typhimurium CS3263 (aroA asd) with pCS151 (fas(+) asd(+)) elicited a significantly higher level of 987P-specific systemic immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal IgA than serovar Typhimurium CS3263 with pCS152 (fasD mutant, asd(+)) expressing 987P periplasmic antigen. Further studies were aimed at determining whether the 987P fimbriae expressed by serovar Typhimurium chi4550 (cya crp asd) could be used as carriers of foreign epitopes. For this, the vaccine strain was genetically engineered to express chimeric fimbriae carrying the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) C (379-388) and A (521-531) epitopes of the spike protein inserted into the 987P major fimbrial subunit FasA. BALB/c mice administered orally serovar Typhimurium chi4550 expressing the chimeric fimbriae from the tet promoter in pCS154 (fas(+) asd(+)) produced systemic antibodies against both fimbria and the TGEV C epitope but not against the TGEV A epitope. To improve the immunogenicity of the chimeric fimbriae, the in vivo inducible nirB promoter was inserted into pCS154, upstream of the fas genes, to create pCS155. In comparison with the previously used vaccine, BALB/c mice immunized orally with serovar Typhimurium chi4550/pCS155 demonstrated significantly higher levels of serum IgG and mucosal IgA against 987P fimbria. Moreover, mucosal IgA against the TGEV C epitope was only detected with serovar Typhimurium chi4550/pCS155. The induced antibodies also recognized the epitopes in the context of the full-length TGEV spike protein. Hence, immune responses to heterologous chimeric fimbriae on Salmonella vaccine vectors can be optimized by using promoters known to be activated in vivo.
