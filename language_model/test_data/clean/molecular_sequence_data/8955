Two co-infecting novel vitiviruses from Actinidia chinensis were identified from mechanically inoculated Nicotiana occidentalis. Both virus genomes were sequenced and share 64% nucleotide identity. Their overall structure is typical of vitiviruses, with five open reading frames (ORFs) and a polyadenylated 3' end. Open reading frame 4 (ORF4) encodes the coat protein, the most conserved gene of the vitiviruses, in which they share 75% amino acid identity, 61-68% with grapevine virus B, 55-59% with grapevine virus A, and 37-42% with grapevine virus E. Based on the molecular criteria for species demarcation in the family Betaflexiviridae, these are two novel viruses, tentatively named Actinidia virus A and Actinidia virus B.
