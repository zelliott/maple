To describe the recombination features of human enterovirus 71 strain Guangzhou09 isolated in Guangzhou in 2009, the complete nucleotide sequences of Guangzhou09 were analyzed by various of bioinformatics software. Phylogenetic analysis based on P1, P2 and P3 regions indicated that recombination occurred between EV71 and CVA4. Phylogenetic, similarity plot and bootscan analysis further revealed the recombination between EV71 genotype C strain Shanghai-FJ713317 and CVA4 strain HQ728260 at region 2B was close to the nucleotide position 4 027. This represents the first evidence for intertypic recombination between EV71 subtype C4 and CVA4 in Guangzhou.
