The mouse TSH receptor ectodomain (mTSHR-ecd) was amplified from murine thyroid complementary DNA and ligated into the pAcGP67B insect cell vector, and the nucleotide sequence was confirmed. Employing a baculovirus-insect cell system, the mTSHR-ecd (amino acids 22-415) was expressed as a fusion protein with the gp67 insect cell signal sequence at the NH2-terminus and a C-terminal six-histidine tag. Protein expression was assessed by Western blot using a murine monoclonal antibody (recognizing amino acids 22-35) and a rabbit antipeptide antibody (recognizing amino acids 397-415). These antibodies detected two principal species of mTSHR-ecd, one glycosylated (66 kDa) and one nonglycosylated (52 kDa), in cell lysates of infected insect cells. More than 10% of these species were present in a water-soluble (cytosolic) fraction. This fraction was then used to purify, under native conditions, 100-microg amounts of mTSHR-ecd using nickel-nitrilo-triacetic (Ni-NTA) resin chromatography. The purified cytosolic mTSHR-ecd migrated as a homogeneous 66-kDa band visible on Coomassie blue-stained gels and was confirmed by Western blotting. We also purified the mTSHR-ecd from total cell lysates under denaturing conditions, followed by "in vitro" refolding on the Ni-NTA column. Under these conditions, milligram amounts of soluble mTSHR-ecd were obtained. This material consisted primarily of the 66-kDa glycosylated form, but in addition contained four or five lower molecular mass, partially glycosylated intermediates and the 52-kDa nonglycosylated form. Deglycosylation with either endoglycosidase F or H, reduced all mTSHR-ecd glycosylated species to a 52-kDa nonglycosylated form. Both the cytosolic and refolded mTSHR-ecd preparations inhibited the binding of [125I]TSH to the full-length human TSHR expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells in a dose-dependent manner, with similar affinities. The affinity of such interactions was 3 orders of magnitude less than observed with native porcine TSHR and was further reduced by unfolding the mTSHR-ecd preparations. The cytosolic and refolded mTSHR-ecd were also recognized by hTSHR autoantibodies in the serum of patients with hyperthyroid Graves' disease. Such autoantibody binding to mTSHR-ecd was also markedly reduced by unfolding the antigen. These results demonstrated the successful production of large quantities of well characterized, biologically active, mTSHR-ecd antigen. In addition, the data showed that although the ectodomain of the mTSHR bound TSH, intact holoreceptor may be required for high affinity ligand binding. Whether the transmembrane region is required for direct ligand binding, as seen for other G protein-linked receptors, or whether it is needed to stabilize the ligand binding to the ectodomain and maintain a correctly folded state, remains unclear.
