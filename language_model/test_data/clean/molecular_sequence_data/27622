Escherichia coli 5S RNA labeled with 15N at N3 of the uridines was isolated from the S phi-187 uracil auxotroph grown on a minimal medium supplemented with [3-15N]uracil. 1H-15N multiple quantum filtered and 2D chemical shift correlated spectra gave resonances for the uridine imino 1H-15N units whose protons were exchanging slowly with solvent. Peaks with 1H/15N shifts at 11.6/154.8, 11.7/155.0, 11.8/155.5, 12.1/155.0, and 12.2/155.0 ppm were assigned to GU interactions. Two labile high-field AU resonances at 12.6/156.8 and 12.8/157.3 ppm typical of AU pairs in a shielded environment at the end of a helix were seen. Intense AU signals were also found at 13.4/158.5 and 13.6/159.2 ppm where 1H-15N units in normal Watson-Crick pairs resonate. 1H resonances at 10.6 and 13.8 ppm were too weak, presumably because of exchange with water, to give peaks in chemical shift correlated spectra. 1H chemical shifts suggest that the resonance at 13.8 ppm represents a labile AU pair, while the resonance at 10.6 ppm is typical of a tertiary interaction between U and a tightly bound water or a phosphate residue. The NMR data are consistent with proposed secondary structures for 5S RNA.
