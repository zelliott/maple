Using the technique of DD-PCR (differential display-polymerase chain reaction) we isolated a novel gene (D2-2) that is overexpressed in glioblastoma multiforme tissue (GMT) as compared to normal brain tissue (NBT). D2-2 is also highly expressed in recurrent glioma, colon tumor metastatic to brain, breast tumors, prostate tumors and a prostate tumor cell line (LNCaP). Northern blot analysis showed that D2-2 is highly expressed in several tumor cell lines (MOLT lymphoblastic leukemia, SW480 colorectal adrenocarcinoma, A549 lung carcinoma, HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia, S3 HeLa cells, K-562 chronic myelogeneous leukemia and G361 melanoma) as compared to NBT. Additionally, D2-2 is very highly expressed in cell lines derived from glioblastomas, grade IV astrocytomas, normal human fetal astrocytes (NHFA) and glioma. D2-2 is moderately expressed in neuroblastoma, neuroectodermal and medulloblastoma tumor cell lines. D2-2 expression is localized to the frontal lobe, occipital lobe and the cerebellum in the normal brain. Normal tissues such as thyroid, stomach, adrenal cortex, small intestine and pancreas show high expression of D2-2. We also show that D2-2 is expressed 28-fold higher in fetal brain (20 weeks) than in adult brain. Sequence analysis of a 2.0-kb fragment for D2-2 shows no homology to known sequences in the data base.
