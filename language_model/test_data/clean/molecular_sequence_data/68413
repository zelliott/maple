Bovine tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.2) deprived of Zn2+ by chelation with the phosphonate analog of Ap4A hydrolyzed ATP(GTP) to ADP(GDP) although its ability to form tryptophanyl adenylate was impaired. This hydrolytic activity is stimulated by Mg2+ and Mn2+ ions and inhibited by Zn2+. Monoclonal antibody Am1 against the N-terminal domain of the enzyme completely abolished ATP(GTP)ase activity. The core peptide generated after proteolytic splitting of the N-domain lacks this activity. We suggest that the nucleotide binding site(s) different from ATP sites involved in aminoacylation reaction reside(s) at the N-terminal domain(s) of the enzyme.
