Phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) has long been known as a key enzyme involved in both glycerolipid biosynthesis and cellular signal transduction. The cDNA cloning of a plasma membrane-bound type 2 PAP has revealed the existence of a novel glycoprotein with six transmembrane domains. The type 2 PAP now represents an enzyme family consisting of Drosophila Wunen and rat Dri 42, which participate in germ cell migration and epithelial differentiation, respectively. Such novel functions of the type 2 PAP suggest the unexpected importance of lipids and/or their metabolic enzymes.
