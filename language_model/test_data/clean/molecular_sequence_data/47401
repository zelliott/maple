Anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC) is a ubiquitin ligase which specifically targets mitotic regulatory factors such as Pds1/Cut2 and cyclin B. Identification of the subunits of multiprotein complex APC in several species revealed the highly conserved composition of APC from yeast to human. It has been reported, however, that vertebrate APC is composed of at least eight subunits, APC1 to APC8, while budding yeast APC is constituted of at least 12 components, Apc1 to Apc13. It has not yet been clearly understood whether additional components found in budding yeast, Apc9 to Apc13, are actually composed of mammalian APC. Here we isolated and characterized human APC10/Doc1, and found that APC10/Doc1 binds to APC core subunits throughout the cell cycle. Further, it was found that APC10/Doc1 is localized in centrosomes and mitotic spindles throughout mitosis, while it is also localized in kinetochores from prophase to anaphase and in midbody in telophase and cytokinesis. These results strongly support the notion that human APC10/Doc1 may be one of the APC core subunits rather than the transiently associated regulatory factor.
