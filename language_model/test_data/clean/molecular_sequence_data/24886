To clone drug resistance-related genes of lung adenocarcinoma.

The difference in gene expression between A549 and A549DDP was identified by mRNA differential display technique. Genes differentially expressed were cloned and confirmed by Northern blot.

Four cDNA fragments of differentially expressed genes were obtained and sequenced. Of the 4 cDNA fragments, 2 (A1 and D1) did not show sequence homology with the existing genes in the GeneBank, one (A2) was 89% homologous with interleukin 1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) gene, and the other (D2) was identical to mouse musculus 45s pre-rRNA (MM45srRNA) gene. Both cDNA fragments A1 and A2 were expressed in A549 but not or barely expressed in A549DDP, while fragments D1 and D2 were expressed in A549DDP but not in A549.

Four differentially expressed gene fragments between lung adenocarcinoma cell line and its cisplatin-resistant counterpart were identified by mRNA differential display technique. It remains to be studied whether the newly identified gene fragments and those showing sequence homology to ICE and MM45srRNA are indeed positively or negatively related to drug resistance.
