Calnexin is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that binds transiently to a wide array of newly synthesized membrane and secretory proteins. It also exhibits prolonged binding to misfolded or incompletely folded proteins. Recent studies have demonstrated that calnexin functions as a molecular chaperone to facilitate the folding and assembly of proteins in the ER. It is also a component of the quality control system that prevents proteins from progressing along the secretory pathway until they have acquired proper tertiary or quaternary structure. Most proteins that are translocated into the ER are glycosylated at Asn residues, and calnexin's interactions are almost exclusively restricted to proteins that possess this posttranslational modification. The preference for glycoproteins resides in calnexin's ability to function as a lectin with specificity for the Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide, an early intermediate in the processing of Asn-linked oligosaccharides. Calnexin also has the capacity to bind to polypeptide segments of unfolded glycoproteins. Available evidence suggests that calnexin utilizes its lectin property during initial capture of a newly synthesized glycoprotein and that subsequent association (and chaperone function) is mediated through polypeptide interactions. Unlike other molecular chaperones that are soluble proteins, calnexin is an intrinsic component of the ER membrane. Its unique ability to capture unfolded glycoproteins through their large oligosaccharide moieties may have evolved as a means to overcome accessibility problems imposed by being constrained within a lipid bilayer.
