Serum collected in a time-course mode during the pregnancy of a group of heifers was analyzed by 2-DE under various experimental conditions to optimize resolution of all protein spots. Changes in the levels of some components were detected during the last phase of pregnancy and early postpartum. These included a decrease of alpha2-HS-glycoprotein, an increase of alpha1-antichymotrypsin and, with a much larger and more abrupt variation, of orosomucoid and haptoglobin. These findings associate the weeks preceding calving with an acute-phase reaction. Analysis of individual animal's sera by 1-DE demonstrated a higher level of orosomucoid in the sera of cows developing postpartum endometritis during the 2 wk after calving (i.e., in the course of the infection) but a lower level during the 2 wk before calving. This observation could represent an important tool for the prepartum detection of animals prone to develop postpartum endometritis and lead to a more accurate peripartum management of those animals.
