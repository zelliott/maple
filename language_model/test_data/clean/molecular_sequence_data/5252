The paramyxovirus hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein exhibits neuraminidase activity and has an active site functionally similar to that in influenza neuraminidases. Earlier work identified conserved amino acids among HN sequences and proposed similarity between HN and influenza neuraminidase sequences. In this work we identify the three-dimensional fold and develop a more detailed model for the HN protein, in the process we examine a variety of protein structure prediction methods. We use the known structures of viral and bacterial neuraminidases as controls in testing the success of protein structure prediction and modeling methods, including knowledge-based threading, discrete three-dimensional environmental profiles, hidden Markov models, neural network secondary structure prediction, pattern matching, and hydropathy plots. The results from threading show that the HN protein sequence has a 6 beta-sheet propellor fold and enable us to assign the locations of the individual beta-strands. The three-dimensional environmental profile and hidden Markov model methods were not successful in this work. The model developed in this work helps to understand better the biological function of the HN protein and design inhibitors of the enzyme and serves as an assessment of some protein structure prediction methods, especially after the x-ray crystallographic solution of its structure.
