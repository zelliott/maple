Development-controlled resistance and resistance specificity frequently restrict the application of a disease resistance (R) gene in crop breeding programs. Xa3/Xa26 and Xa21, encoding leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-kinase type plasma membrane proteins, mediate race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes bacterial blight, one of the most devastating rice diseases. Plants carrying Xa3/Xa26 and plants carrying Xa21 have different resistance spectra and the functions of the two R genes are regulated by developmental stage. Four chimeric genes encoding proteins consisting of different parts of XA3/XA26 and XA21 were constructed by domain swapping and transformed into a susceptible rice variety. The resistance spectra and development-regulated resistance of the transgenic plants carrying Xa3/Xa26, Xa21, or chimeric gene to different Xoo strains were analyzed in the same genetic background. The results suggest that the gradually increased expression of Xa3/Xa26 and Xa21 plays an important role in the progressively enhanced Xoo resistance during rice development. In addition, the LRR domains of XA3/XA26 and XA21 are important determinants of race-specific recognition during rice-Xoo interaction, but juxtamembrane regions of the two R proteins also appear to contribute to resistance specificity.
