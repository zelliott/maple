Molecular methods are being used to enforce wildlife conservation laws by identifying the species or the geographic origin of an unknown sample. However, the promising use of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this field is still widely unexplored. In the present work, we have developed a reliable and easy method based on single-base extension technology for the scoring of 3 SNPs in the epsilon-globin gene that successfully identifies the primate infraorder a sample belongs to. Since primates are of high conservation concern and different infraorders are distributed in specific parts of the world, this method will serve for an initial potentially automated screening of the taxonomy and geographic origin of an unknown primate sample arriving at customs.
