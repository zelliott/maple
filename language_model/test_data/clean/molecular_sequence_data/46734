The Mdm2 oncoprotein mediates p53 degradation at cytoplasmic proteasomes and is the principal regulator for maintaining low, often undetectable levels of p53 in unstressed cells. However, a subset of human tumors including neuroblastoma constitutively harbor high levels of wild type p53 protein localized to the cytoplasm. Here we show that the abnormal p53 accumulation in such cells is due to a profound resistance to Mdm2-mediated degradation. Overexpression of Mdm2 in neuroblastoma (NB)(1) cell lines failed to decrease the high steady state levels of endogenous p53. Moreover, exogenous p53, when introduced into these cells, was also resistant to Mdm2-directed degradation. This resistance is not due to a lack of Mdm2 expression in NB cells or a lack of p53-Mdm2 interaction, nor is it due to a deficiency in the ubiquitination state of p53 or proteasome dysfunction. Instead, Mdm2-resistant p53 from NB cells is associated with covalent modification of p53 and masking of the modification-sensitive PAb 421 epitope. This system provides evidence for an important level of regulation of Mdm2-directed p53 destruction in vivo that is linked to p53 modification.
