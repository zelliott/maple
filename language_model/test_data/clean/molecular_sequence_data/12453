Electrophysiological experiments have indicated that a fraction of the major auxin-binding protein (ABP1) of maize (Zea mays L.) might be a receptor on the outer surface of the plasma membrane. The predominant location of ABP1 is in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in accord with its C-terminal KDEL retention signal. Little is known about the biology of the protein in vivo or the rate at which it might pass to the cell surface. We have examined the turnover of ABP1 by in vivo labelling of maize coleoptile sections. After different chase times, ABP1 was immunoprecipitated from detergent-solubilised membrane preparations. Two polypeptides coprecipitated with ABP1. Neither was recognised by any ABP1 antibodies nor by monoclonals to ER retention sequences. The possible significance of these coprecipitating polypeptides is discussed. In addition, we have used a monoclonal antibody to precipitate HDEL proteins from the same membrane preparations. Two dimensional electrophoresis and N-terminal sequencing showed that the major HDEL protein precipitated was a member of the heat-shock-protein 70 family, a homologue of BiP (immunoglobulin-binding protein). We have investigated the turnover of this BiP homologue for comparison with ABP1 and found that both had extended lifetimes, with half-lives greater than 24 h. Use of cordycepin to inhibit transcription indicated that ABP1 mRNA was also long-lived. Synthesis of ABP1 was strongly reduced by heat stress, was reduced a little in response to dithiothreitol and was not markedly changed by tunicamycin. In contrast, BiP synthesis increased markedly in response to tunicamycin and dithiothreitol and increased a little after heat stress.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
