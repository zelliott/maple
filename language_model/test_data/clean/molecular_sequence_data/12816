Vitelline membrane outer layer protein I (VMO-I) tightly bound to ovomucin fibrils of hen's egg yolk membrane was characterized in terms of its amino acid sequence and structural stability. The deduced sequence of VMO-I using the conventional sequencing method is: RTREYTSVITVPNGGHWGKWGIRQFCHSGYANGFALKVEPSQFGRDDTALNGIRLRCLD- GSVIESLVGKWGTWTSFLVCPTGYLVSFSLRSEKSQGGGDDTAANNIQFRCSDEAVLVGD- DLSWGRFGPWSKRCKICGLQTKVESPQGLRDDTALNNVRFFCCK. Thus, VMO-I is composed of 163 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 17,979. The sequence confirms the cDNA sequence of VMO-I we recently determined and does not show any significant similarity to proteins compiled in the NBRF database. Two of the four disulfide bonds found in VMO-I were estimated to lie between Cys26 and Cys57 and between Cys79 and Cys110. The sequence analyses show that VMO-I contains three 53-residue internal repeats that contain distinctive regions of turns flanked by beta-sheets consistent with the recent finding that the molecule contains a new beta-fold motif, the beta-prism. The molecular characteristics of VMO-I in solution were examined by CD spectroscopy in the far and near ultraviolet regions, NMR spectroscopy, and high sensitive differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). CD spectra in the far UV region at room temperature were similar to that assigned to a random coil, while in the near UV region, small positive peaks were observed. The ellipticity in both regions decreased on raising the temperature. Proton NMR experiments showed the native structure unfolds to unordered conformations at 70 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
