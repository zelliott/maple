The effects of the intraduodenal administration of a low dose of CR-1505 for 3-7 days on the gene expression of cholecystokinin (CCK), plasma CCK concentration, and CCK content in the intestinal mucosa were examined in rats. The simultaneous changes of protein and enzyme content in the pancreas were also determined. CR-1505 was infused continuously into the duodenum at a dose of 3 mg/kg per day, calculated to correspond to a dose of 150-200 mg/day in humans. Seven days after the administration of CR-1505, a liquid meal (4.5 kcal/3 ml) was introduced into the stomach and changes in the intestinal CCK content and plasma CCK concentration were examined. The level of CCK mRNA in the intestine was significantly higher in rats treated with CR-1505 than in control rats. The plasma CCK concentration, the CCK content of the intestinal mucosa, and the composition of pancreatic enzymes did not significantly differ in rats treated with CR-1505 and the untreated controls. In control rats, the administration of the liquid meal increased the plasma CCK concentration and significantly decreased the intestinal CCK content in water extracts, but did not affect the amount extracts in acid whereas the ingestion of the meal did not cause any significant changes in rats treated with CR-1505. These findings indicate that a low dose of CR-1505 stimulates the gene expression of CCK without enhancing CCK release or exerting an effect on the pancreas.
