GTP binding protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) cDNA was cloned from the hearts of Syrian hamsters. The hamster GRK5 cDNA contained 1770 nucleotides encoding 590 amino acids, and the nucleotide sequence had 89.6% homology to the human homologue. An inbred cardiomyopathic hamster strain, J2N-k, was used to investigate the alteration of GRK5 mRNA expression in the setting of congestive heart failure. M-mode echocardiography revealed significant dilatation of the left ventricle and a decrease of left ventricular contractility in 20-week-old J2N-k hamsters compared with age-matched control hamsters, J2N-n. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that GRK5 mRNA expression in the hearts of J2N-k was significantly higher than in those of J2N-n (J2N-k 60.3 +/- 13.3, J2N-n 25.8 +/- 17.2 arbitrary units, p < 0.005, n = 6 in each group). These results suggest that an enhanced GRK5 expression might play a role in the reduced responsiveness to catecholamines in failing hearts via beta-adrenergic receptor phosphorylation.
