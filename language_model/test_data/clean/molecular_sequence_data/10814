The question whether immune pressure exerted by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can influence the long-term evolution of genetically stable viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has generated considerable scientific interest, primarily due to its important implications for the overall biology of the virus. While arguing for a role of CTLs in the evolution of viruses, it is important to differentiate between genetic variation in virus and immune recognition of these variant virus by CTLs. To assess the role of genetic selection in the long-term evolution of EBV, we have analyzed a large panel of type 1 EBV isolates from African, Southeast Asian, Papua-New Guinean (PNG), and Australian Caucasian individuals. Seven different regions of the EBV genome, which include nine CTL epitopes restricted through a range of HLA class I alleles, were sequenced and compared. Although numerous nucleotide changes were identified within these isolates, comparison of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions in the CTL epitope indicated that the genetic variation was generated mostly independently of immune selection pressure. Surprisingly, an inverse correlation between genetic variation within certain CTL epitopes and the frequency distribution of HLA alleles that present the CTL epitopes was seen, suggesting that the evolutionary pressures on the CTL epitopes of the virus may be toward their conservation rather than their inactivation. Furthermore, molecular evolutionary genetic analysis of nucleotide sequences revealed that viral isolates from PNG are evolving as a lineage distinct from isolates from African, Southeast Asian, and Australian Caucasian individuals.
