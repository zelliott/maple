Amoebae belonging to the genus Acanthamoeba are potentially pathogenic to humans, causing mainly amoebic keratitis. Pathogenic ability of the 15 known Acanthamoeba genotypes is under investigation. We report that four out of five cases of amoebic keratitis studied in Greece, present T4 sequence type, while the remaining one presents T5 sequence type (Acanthamoeba lenticulata), which is the second most frequent genotype found among environmental samples. Thus, it is confirmed, for the first time to our knowledge, that A. lenticulata can cause keratitis. However the reason that it is under represented in clinical samples compared to environmental ones is unknown.
