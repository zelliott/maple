The migration of lymphocytes from the bloodstream into the secondary lymphoid organs, which is necessary for a successful immune response, occurs primarily within postcapillary venules that are characterized by high-walled endothelial cells. Lymphocyte adhesion to and extravasation at these sites is associated with the expression of specific lymphoid receptors for this specialized venule endothelium. We report here the molecular cloning from a baboon lymphoid cell line of a cDNA that encodes an adhesion receptor for HEV. The 362-amino acid protein encoded by this cDNA is not present in any of the data bases examined. The mature protein, resulting from the cleavage of a putative 20-amino acid signal peptide, has a calculated molecular mass of only 37 kDa, indicating that the 90-kDa cell surface protein is highly modified. The 342 amino acids, which lack any repeated sequences of significant length, encompass an extracellular domain (250 amino acids), a putative transmembrane domain (20 amino acids), and a cytoplasmic domain (72 amino acids).
