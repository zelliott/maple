Two novel tyrosine kinase cDNAs were obtained from murine mast cells. These kinases, Emb and Emt, constitute a novel tyrosine kinase subfamily which may also include Tec, a kinase preferentially expressed in liver, and Dsrc28, a fruit fly kinase. Both lack hydrophobic stretches characteristic of the transmembrane domains found in growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and carboxyl-terminal, negative regulatory tyrosine residue found in Src family kinases. In addition to the Src homology region 2 (SH2) and SH3 domains characteristic of the Src family kinases and other signaling molecules, Emb and Emt share a similar amino-terminal domain comprised mainly of two repeat segments. The emb 2.7-kb transcript was expressed in mast cells, myeloid cells and B lymphocytes while the emt 4.6-kb mRNA in mast cells, myeloid cells and T lymphocytes. The evidence for in vitro tyrosine kinase activity of Emb and Emt proteins is also provided.
