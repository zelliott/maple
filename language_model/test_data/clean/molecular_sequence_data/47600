Bacteriophage PM2 was isolated from the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Chile in the late 1960s. It was a new virus type, later classified as Corticoviridae, and also the first bacterial virus for which it was demonstrated that lipids are part of the virion structure. Here we report the determination and analysis of the 10, 079-bp circular dsDNA genome sequence. Noteworthy discoveries are the replication initiation system, which is related to the rolling circle mechanism described for phages such as &phi;X174 and P2, and a 1.2-kb sequence that is similar to the maintenance region of a plasmid found in a marine Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain A28.
