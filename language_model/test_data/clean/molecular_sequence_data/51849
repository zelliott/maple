Peptide tyrosine tyrosine/pancreatic polypeptide (PYY/PP)- and C-terminal gastrin/cholecystokinin (G/CCK)-immunoreactive cells were investigated in the intestine of the lizard Podarcis hispanica, using immunocytochemistry with light and electron microscopy. Immunolabeling of consecutive semithin sections revealed coexistence of PYY/PP- and C-terminal G/CCK-like substances in some cells, while in others only PYY/PP or G/CCK immunoreactivity was found. Appropriate absorption controls excluded cross-reactivity between the antisera used. Ultrastructurally G/CCK+, PYY/PP+ cells were similar to G/CCK+, PYY/PP- cells but different from PYY/PP+, G/CCK- cells. Although virtually nothing is known concerning the physiological effects of these peptides in reptiles, their colocalization in the same cells in the intestine of Podarcis hispanica suggests a close relationship between them in the regulation of the digestive process.
