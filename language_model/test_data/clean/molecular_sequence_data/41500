Screening of bacteria from Sambhar lake, an extreme hypersaline environment of India, led to the isolation of 93 haloalkaliphilic bacteria growing optimally in media with 2-25 % salt and 6-12 pH. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, 93 isolates were further categorized into 32 groups, with each group representing a different taxa belonging to 3 phyla (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria). Majority of the isolates (53.12 %) showed similarity with phylum Firmicutes which was followed by Proteobacteria (40.63 %) and Actinobacteria (6.25 %). The isolates belonging to 32 representative groups were further evaluated for the production of extracellular enzymes viz. amylase, cellulase, protease and xylanase, plant growth promoting attributes and BIOLOG™ substrate usage. Among all the isolates, xylanase producing isolates were in maximum (68 %) as compared to protease (56 %), cellulase (40 %), and amylase (37 %) producing strains. Similarly, among plant growth promoting activities, ammonia producing isolates were highest (56 %) when compared to those producing ACC deaminase (53 %), IAA (50 %), hydrogen cyanide (28 %), siderophore (21 %) and solubilizing P (34 %). Isolates showing enzymatic and PGP activities could be further utilized for promoting plant growth in saline affected area.
