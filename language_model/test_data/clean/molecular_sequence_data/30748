A simple and efficient method for synthesizing radioactively labeled single-stranded DNA hybridization probes with Thermus aquaticus (Taq) DNA polymerase is described. This is done in a "run-off" polymerization with repeated cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension. It leads to high yields of a single-stranded DNA of defined length (up to 5000 nt), which is labeled to a high specific activity (1.3 x 10(8) cpm/micrograms DNA). These hybridization probes are equally sensitive as nick-translated DNA probes, but strand specific. This was tested by slot blot hybridization with in vitro-transcribed target RNAs and by Northern blotting. The use of single-stranded DNA hybridization probes combines the benefits of DNA stability and single-strand RNA probes.
