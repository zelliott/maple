Murine interleukin-5 (IL-5) is known to play an essential role in Ig production of B cells and proliferation and differentiation of eosinophils. Here, we have isolated cDNA clones encoding a murine IL-5 receptor by expression screening of a library prepared from a murine IL-5 dependent early B cell line. A cDNA library was expressed in COS7 cells and screened by panning with the use of anti-IL-5 receptor monoclonal antibodies. The deduced amino acid sequence analysis demonstrates that the receptor is a glycoprotein of 415 amino acids (Mr 45,284), including an N-terminal hydrophobic region (17 amino acids), a glycosylated extracellular domain (322 amino acids), a single transmembrane segment (22 amino acids) and a cytoplasmic tail (54 amino acids). COS7 cells transfected with the cDNA expressed a 60 kd protein that bound IL-5 with a single class of affinity (KD = 2-10 nM). FDC-P1 cells transfected with the cDNA for murine IL-5 receptor showed the expression of IL-5 binding sites with both low (KD = 6 nM) and high affinity (KD = 30 pM) and acquired responsiveness to IL-5 for proliferation, although parental FDC-P1 cells did not show any detectable IL-5 binding. In addition, several cDNA clones encoding soluble forms of the IL-5 receptor were isolated. Northern blot analysis showed that two species of mRNAs (5.0 kb and 5.8 kb) were detected in cell lines that display binding sites for murine IL-5. Homology search for the amino acid sequence of the IL-5 receptor reveals that the IL-5 receptor contains a common motif of a cytokine receptor family that is recently identified.
