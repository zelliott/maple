The beta subunit of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) plays an important role in IgE-mediated allergic reactions as an amplifier for cell surface expression and signal transduction of FcepsilonRI. FcepsilonRIbeta is presumed to be one of the genes linked with atopic diseases. However, the validity of the associations previously found between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FcepsilonRIbeta and atopic diseases is questionable. In the present study, we found correlation between the SNP of FcepsilonRIbeta at +6960A/G, resulting in a Glu237Gly amino acid substitution, and the cell surface expression level of FcepsilonRI on blood basophils, although it has been shown that the Glu237Gly mutation itself does not affect the surface expression or function of FcepsilonRI. We additionally found four SNPs in the promoter region of FcepsilonRIbeta, among which -426T/C and -654C/T were tightly linked with +6960A/G. Reporter plasmids carrying the -426C and -654T promoter displayed higher transcriptional activity than those carrying the -426T and -654C promoter. We found that transcription factor YY1 preferentially bound and transactivated the -654T promoter. Furthermore, expression of FcepsilonRI beta-chain mRNA in basophils from individuals who have the minor heterozygous genotype was significantly higher than that of the major homozygous genotype. These results suggest that the SNPs in the FcepsilonRIbeta promoter are causally linked with atopy via regulation of FcepsilonRI expression.
