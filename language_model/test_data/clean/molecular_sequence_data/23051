The three-dimensional (3-D) structure of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) Vpr/Vpx was predicted by homology modeling based on the NMR structure of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpr. The three proteins similarly have three major amphipathic alpha-helices. In contrast to HIV-1 Vpr, Vpr/Vpx of HIV-2 have a long N-terminal loop and clustered prolines in the second half of the C-terminal loop. HIV-2 Vpx uniquely contains a long region between the second and third major helices, and bears several glycines in the first half of the C-terminal loop. Instead of the glycines, there is a group of hydrophilic amino acids and arginines in the corresponding regions of the two Vprs. To compare the cytopathogenic potentials of HIV-1 Vpr and HIV-2 Vpr/Vpx, we examined the production of luciferase as a marker of cell damage. We further analyzed the characteristics of cells transduced with vpr/vpx genes driven by an inducible promoter. The results obtained clearly show that structurally similar, but distinct, HIV Vpr/Vpx proteins are detrimental to target cells.
