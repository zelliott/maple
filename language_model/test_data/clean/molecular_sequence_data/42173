Fusion proteins are generated in some solid tumors and hematological neoplasias by inter- or intrachromosome translocations. These proteins are believed to play a causal role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Fusion proteins, therefore, can be considered tumor-specific/transformation-related molecules. The targeting of such structures could lead in the future to significant progress in the therapeutic index of anti-cancer treatment, by allowing the selective destruction of neoplastic cells. In this article, the author reviews the different oncogenic fusion molecules so far known, the mechanism(s) by which they are generated and the available information regarding their immunogenicity, and analyzes their potential use as future targets for a specific immune response.
