The isolation and characterization of ferredoxin-NADP+ -oxidoreductase from Anabaena variabilis, a nitrogen-fixing, filamentous cyanobacterium, is described. Purified enzyme was obtained in four steps with a 55% yield and 300-fold purification utilizing chromatographic separations on DEAE-cellulose and Cibacron Blue-Sepharose columns. The enzyme is quite similar but not identical to the spinach enzyme as judged by isoelectric focusing, molecular weight determination, and amino acid composition. N-terminal sequence analysis allowed identification of 28 of the first 33 residues. Alignment with the corresponding sequences from spinach and Spirulina FNR preparations was possible. A higher degree of homology was found with the Spirulina enzyme than with the spinach enzyme. Small differences with the spinach enzyme were also shown by absorption and circular dichroism spectral measurements. Oxidation-reduction potential measurements of the bound FAD coenzyme show an Em = -320 mV at pH 7 for the two-electron process. Complex formation between the reductase and ferredoxin from the same organism was observed by difference absorption spectroscopy with a Kd = 4 microM. Similar Kd and difference absorption properties were observed on complex formation with spinach ferredoxin.
