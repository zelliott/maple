We have characterized 33 isolates of Borrelia burgdorferi from northern Illinois (32 isolates) and Wisconsin (1 isolate) representing the largest series of midwestern isolates investigated to date. The techniques used for molecular analysis of strains included (i) genospecies typing with species-specific PCR primers, (ii) plasmid profiling by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of total genomic DNA, (iii) large-restriction-fragment pattern (LRFP) analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of MluI-digested genomic DNA (J. Belfaiza, D. Postic, E. Bellenger, G. Baranton, and I. Saint Girons, J. Clin. Microbiol. 31:2873-2877, 1993), (iv) sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of total proteins, (v) microsequencing of high-performance liquid chromatography-purified peptides derived from proteins showing high levels of expression, (vi) amino acid composition analysis of proteins, and (vii) immunological analysis of proteins with a polyclonal antiserum of human origin. Five reference strains as well as two atypical tick isolates from California (DN127) and New York (25015) were included for comparison. All of the Illinois and Wisconsin isolates were typed as B. burgdorferi sensu stricto with genospecies-specific PCR primers. The isolates were found to be heterogeneous with regard to their plasmid and protein profiles. One isolate from Illinois possessed two large-molecular-size plasmids instead of the usual 49-kb plasmid. Fragment patterns resulting from MluI digestion of genomic DNA from the 33 isolates and strains DN127 and 25015 were separable into six distinct LRFPs, five of which have not previously been described. Strain 25015 and an isolate from Illinois (CT39) shared an unusual LRFP that is not typical of other B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains, suggesting that they may represent a fifth species of B. burgdorferi sensu lato. Five of the 33 isolates and strains DN127 and 25015 showed high-level expression of proteins with molecular masses of approximately 22 kDa. Investigation of these proteins by microsequencing of individual peptides and total amino acid composition analysis indicated that the 22-kDa proteins expressed by the seven strains were polymorphic OspC proteins. By using a polyclonal serum of human origin, expression of OspC could be detected in all 33 Illinois and Wisconsin isolates.
