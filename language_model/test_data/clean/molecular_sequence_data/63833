In this study we characterize two proteins encoded by the two smallest genomic segments of the piscine orthomyxovirus infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV). Both proteins, encoded by the un-spliced ORF from genomic segment 7 (s7ORF1) and the larger ORF from segment 8 (s8ORF2), are involved in modulation of the type I interferon (IFN) response. The data suggests that the s7ORF1 protein is collinearly encoded, non-structural, contains no nuclear localisation signals, localises mainly to the cytoplasmic perinuclear area and does not bind single- or double-stranded RNA. On the other hand, genomic segment 8 uses a bicistronic coding strategy and the encoded s8ORF2 protein is a structural component of the viral particle. This protein contains two nuclear localisation signals, has a predominantly nuclear localisation, binds both double-stranded RNA and poly-A tailed single-stranded RNA, but not double-stranded DNA. In poly I:C stimulated salmon cells both ISAV proteins independently down-regulate the type I IFN promoter activity. Thus, ISAV counteracts the type I IFN response by the action of at least two of its gene products, rather than just one, as appears to be the case for other known members of the Orthomyxoviridae.
