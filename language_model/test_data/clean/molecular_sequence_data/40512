Designed polypeptides with controllable folding properties are utilized as supramolecular templates for fabrication of ordered nanoscale molecular and fibrous assemblies of LCPs. The properties of the LCPs as well as the three dimensional conformation of the polypeptide-scaffold determine how the polymers are arranged in the supramolecular construct, which highly affects the properties of the hybrid material. The ability to control the polypeptide conformation and assembly into fibers provides a promising route for tuning the optical properties of LCPs and for fabrication of complex functional supramolecules with well defined structural properties.
