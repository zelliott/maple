A 1189 base-pair long DNA fragment, VS1, was isolated from a Campylobacter jejuni CIP 70.2 cosmid library and was found to contain regions specific for this bacterial species. For detection and identification of C. jejuni, two oligonucleotides derived from the VS1 sequence were used as primers in polymerase chain reaction tests on genomic DNAs from 38 campylobacter and from 10 non-Campylobacter strains. A specific, 358 base-pair long DNA fragment was amplified only when C. jejuni DNA was used as a target. The detection limit of the amplification reaction was as low as 1.86 fg DNA, which is the equivalent of one C. jejuni genome.
