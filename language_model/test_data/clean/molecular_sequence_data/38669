We have identified a novel human gene product, hMOF, which exhibits significant similarity to the Drosophila dosage compensation regulator, MOF. A recombinant C-terminal portion of hMOF has histone acetyltransferase activity directed toward histones H3, H2A and H4, a specificity characteristic of other MYST family histone acetyltransferases. Based on hMOF's chromodomain, we discuss possible interactions with other proteins.
