Phosphatidate phosphatase plays a major role in the synthesis of phospholipids and triacylglycerols in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Membrane- and cytosolic-associated forms of the enzyme have been isolated and characterized. These enzymes are Mg2+-dependent and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive. The expression of a membrane-associated form of phosphatidate phosphatase is regulated by growth phase and inositol supplementation, whereas enzyme activity is regulated by lipids, nucleotides, and by phosphorylation. Phosphatidate phosphatase is coordinately regulated with other phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes including phosphatidylserine synthase. Diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase is a novel enzyme of phospholipid metabolism which is present in S. cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, and mammalian cells. This enzyme possesses a phosphatidate phosphatase activity which is Mg2+-independent and N-ethylmaleimide-insensitive and is distinct from the Mg2+-dependent and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive form of phosphatidate phosphatase. Genes encoding for diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase have been isolated from S. cerevisiae and E. coli. The deduced protein sequences of these genes show homology to the sequence of the mouse PAP2 (Mg2+-independent and N-ethylmaleimide-insensitive phosphatidate phosphatase) protein, especially in a novel phosphatase sequence motif. Rat liver PAP2 displays diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase activity.
