The broad-host-range, multicopy plasmid R1162 is efficiently mobilized during conjugation by the self-transmissible plasmid R751. The relaxosome, a complex of plasmid DNA and R1162-encoded proteins, forms at the origin of transfer (oriT) and is required for mobilization. Transfer is initiated by strand- and site-specific nicking of the DNA within this structure. We show by probing with potassium permanganate that oriT DNA is locally melted within the relaxosome, in the region from the inverted repeat to the site that is nicked. Mutations in this region of oriT, and in genes encoding the protein components of the relaxosome, affect both nicking and melting of the DNA. The nicking protein in the relaxosome is MobA, which also ligates the transferred linear, single strand at the termination of a round of transfer. We propose that there is an underlying similarity in the substrates for these two MobA-dependent, DNA-processing reactions. We also show that MobA has an additional role in transfer, beyond the nicking and resealing of oriT DNA.
