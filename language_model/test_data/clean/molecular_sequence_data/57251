To obtain a molecular basis for the similarities and dissimilarities in the functional, chemical, and biochemical properties between beta-casein and the other caseins, a predicted three-dimensional model is presented. The predicted structure was assembled using molecular modeling techniques, as well as secondary structural prediction algorithms, in conjunction with global secondary structural information from Raman spectroscopy. To add validity to this model, the structure was refined using energy minimization techniques to diminish the likelihood of structural overlaps and energetically unfavorable van der Waals contacts arising from the large number of proline residues present in the beta-casein sequence. The refined model overall showed a loosely packed, asymmetrical structure with an axial ratio of 2:1. Hydrophobic side chains were uniformly dispersed over one end (C terminal) and the center surface of the structure; the other end (N terminal) was hydrophilic. The hydrophobic section also possessed a large loop through which water could easily travel. Such a suprasurfactant structure could account for the micellar type of hydrophobically driven self-association exhibited by beta-casein. Other chemical and biochemical data are in good agreement with the refined structure.
