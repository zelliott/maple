The DNA sequence of a 6794 bp fragment located at about 100 kb from the right telomere of chromosome II from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been determined. Sequence analysis reveals five open reading frames. One is the ARO4 gene encoding the 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase. Another presents strong homology with the S5 ribosomal protein from bacteria. The open reading frame YBR1705 shows significant homology with dUTPase, suggesting for the first time the existence of such an enzyme in S. cerevisiae.
