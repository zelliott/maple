Protease inhibitors play important roles in the parasitic nematodes' survival within their host, in the development and reproduction of the parasites. The present study described the isolation, identification, and characterization of a novel member of the Ascaris family of serine protease inhibitors, designated AduTIL-1, from the human hookworm Ancylostoma duodenale. AduTIL-1 is composed of a signal sequence and two trypsin inhibitor-like (TIL) domains, which showed the highest similarity with OdmCRP, a putative serine protease inhibitor with two TIL domains in Oesophagostomum dentatum. Each TIL domain of the AduTIL-1 was expressed in Escherichia coli, and their inhibitory activities against serine proteases from animals and human were characterized, respectively. Both of the two TIL domains inhibited human neutrophil elastase and pancreatic trypsin, but different in effectiveness. Although the first TIL domain of AduTIL-1 inhibited bovine pancreatic chymotrypsin (Ki=18.0 nM), both of the two domains showed no inhibitory activity against the human pancreatic chymotrypsin. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that AduTIL-1 was localized in esophagus, intestine, and cuticular surface of the adult worms. These results suggested that AduTIL-1 may be involved in the survival of A. duodenale in host by targeting related digestive enzymes and neutrophil elastase.
