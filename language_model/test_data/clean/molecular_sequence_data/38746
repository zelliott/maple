Comparative nucleotide sequencing was carried out on dengue type 2 virus (DEN-2) strains isolated from patients in Northeast Thailand during the epidemic season in 1993. The patients exhibited different clinical manifestations ranging from dengue fever (DF) to dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The results classified 19 DEN-2 strains into 3 subtypes according to nonsynonymous amino acid replacements. The strain isolated from a DSS patient eliciting secondary serological response belonged to subtype I, whereas 13 strains isolated from DHF patients with secondary response and 2 strains from DF patients with primary response belonged to subtype II. On the other hand, 3 strains isolated from DF cases evoking either primary or secondary response belonged to subtype III. These results suggest that subtype III virus infection could result in clinically milder manifestation irrespective of the serological response compared with subtype I or II viruses. The RNA secondary structure predicted for the 3' noncoding region showed 4 different structures (A, B, C, and D). The result also indicates that different subtypes of DEN-2 serotypes are circulating in a single epidemic in Thailand.
