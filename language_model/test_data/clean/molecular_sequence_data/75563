We recently reported that the purified leukoagglutinin (designated MAL) from the seeds of the leguminous plant Maackia amurensis is a potent leukoagglutinin for the mouse lymphoma cell line BW5147 (Wang, W.-C., and Cummings, R. D. (1987) Anal. Biochem. 161,80). We and others have shown that this lectin is a weak hemagglutinin of human erythrocytes (Kawaguchi, T., Matsumoto, I., and Osawa, T. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 2786). We now report that leukoagglutination by MAL is inhibited by low concentrations of 2,3-sialyllactose (NeuAc alpha 2,3Gal beta 1,4Glc), but it is not inhibited by either 2,6-sialyllactose (NeuAc alpha 2,6Gal beta-1,4Glc), lactose, or free NeuAc. To further study the carbohydrate-binding specificity of this lectin, we investigated the interactions of immobilized MAL with glycopeptides prepared from the mouse lymphoma cell line BW5147 and from purified glycoproteins. We found that immobilized MAL interacts with high affinity with complex-type tri- and tetraantennary Asn-linked oligosaccharides containing outer sialic acid residues linked alpha 2,3 to penultimate galactose residues. Glycopeptides containing sialic acid linked only alpha 2,6 to penultimate galactose did not interact detectably with the immobilized lectin. Our analyses indicate that the interactions of complex-type Asn-linked chains with the lectin are dependent on sialic acid linkages and are not dependent on either the branching pattern of the mannose residues or the presence of poly-N-acetyllactosamine sequences.
