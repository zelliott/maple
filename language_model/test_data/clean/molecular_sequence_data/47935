Methyl farnesoate, the crustacean juvenoid, is synthesized and secreted from the mandibular organs of crustaceans under the negative control of the sinus gland-derived mandibular organ-inhibiting hormone (MO-IH). Previously we isolated and sequenced two isoforms, MO-IH-1 and MO-IH-2, differing by just one amino acid, from sinus glands of the edible crab, Cancer pagurus. We now report the isolation of cDNAs encoding MO-IH-1 and MO-IH-2 by a combination of reverse-transcriptase-mediated PCR in conjunction with 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends ('RACE'). Full-length clones of MO-IH-1 and MO-IH-2 encoded a 34-residue putative signal peptide and the mature 78-residue MO-IH sequences. Northern blot analysis of various tissues showed that MO-IH expression is confined to the X-organ (a cluster of perikarya within the eye). Southern blot analysis indicated that there are approx. 10 copies of the gene for MO-IH in C. pagurus. Additional Southern blotting experiments detected MO-IH-hybridizing bands in another Cancer species, C. antennarius. In support of this, an HPLC-radioimmunoassay analysis of sinus gland extracts of C. antennarius and C. magister also revealed MO-IH-like immunoreactivity.
