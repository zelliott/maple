An overview of the links between the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis and psychiatric disorders is presented. The current treatments are outlined, indicating that they are insufficient to meet the needs of those that suffer from these affective disorders. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the generation of new therapeutics, in particular, against new targets. The association of the corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) and the HPA axis indicates that CRF antagonists should be beneficial as potential therapeutics.
