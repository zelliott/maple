Gnathostoma lamothei n. sp., inhabiting the stomach of Procyon lotor hernandezii Wagler, 1831, in Tlacotalpan, Veracruz State, and Rio Sapo, Oaxaca, Mexico, is described. This new species differs from all other congeners by having the posterior half of the body surface covered by rows of tiny round bosses instead of spines, or lacking ornamentations. Sequences of the ITS2 of the ribosomal DNA of G. lamothei n. sp. are compared with sequences of other species of the genus recorded in Mexico; they show a wide divergence (<50%) with Gnathostoma binucleatum Almeyda-Artigas, 1991, and Gnathostoma turgidum Stossich, 1902, and high similarity with Gnathostoma sp. I sequence (99.2%). On the basis of morphometric traits and sequences, previous records of Gnathostoma sp. I (=Gnathostoma procyonis of Almeyda-Artigas et al., 1994, not Chandler, 1942, and Gnathostoma neoprocyonis nomen nudem) in Mexico are referred to as the new species.
