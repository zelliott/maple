The secretion of numerous proteins during vegetative growth of Myxococcus xanthus, and the multicellular development cycle induced upon starvation of these bacteria, are partially interrelated in so far as mutants impaired in extracellular protein production are unable to undergo development. We have cloned and sequenced a gene in which a Tn5 insertion leads to a decrease in the production of most, if not all, extracellular proteins, and prevents development and sporulation. The deduced protein is homologous to the putative ubiquinone-binding subunit of bacterial and mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductases (complex I). This is the first example of the presence of this complex in a bacterium from subclass delta of the proteobacteria. This gene is expressed during growth and during early development. As its disruption by Tn5 does not impair growth of the mutant strain, we assume the presence of a second alternative NADH oxidoreductase, and suggest that the phenotypic alterations caused by the mutation are due to a decrease in the proton-motive force.
