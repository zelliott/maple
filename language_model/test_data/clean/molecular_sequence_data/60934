To investigate the molecular mechanism of resistance to pyrethroids in the southern cattle tick, Boophilus microplus, we have obtained and sequenced a partial para-homologous sodium channel cDNA from susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant tick strains. A point mutation that results in an amino acid change from Phe to Ile was identified in the highly conserved domain IIIS6 of the homologous sodium channel from ticks that are highly resistant to pyrethroid acaricides. This mutation is at a location different from those reported in the same gene in pyrethroid-resistant insects.
