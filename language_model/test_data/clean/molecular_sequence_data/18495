The obligate marine actinobacterium Salinispora arenicola was successfully cultured from temperate sediments of the Pacific Ocean (Tosa Bay, offshore Kochi Prefecture, Japan) with the highest latitude of 33Â°N ever reported for this genus. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the Tosa Bay strains are of the same phylotype as the type strain S. arenicola NBRC105043. However, sequence analysis of their 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer (ITS) revealed novel sequence variations. In total, five new ITS sequences were discovered and further phylogenetic analyses using gyrase B and rifamycin ketosynthase (KS) domain sequences supported the phylogenetic diversity of the novel Salinispora isolates. Screening of secondary metabolite genes in these strains revealed the presence of KS1 domain sequences previously reported in S. arenicola strains isolated from the Sea of Cortez, the Bahamas and the Red Sea. Moreover, salinosporamide biosynthetic genes, which are highly homologous to those of Bahamas-endemic S. tropica, were detected in several Tosa Bay isolates, making this report the first detection of salinosporamide genes in S. arenicola. The results of this study provide evidence of a much wider geographical distribution and secondary metabolism diversity in this genus than previously projected.
