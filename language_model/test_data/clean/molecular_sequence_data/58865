The phylogenetic relationships between major slime mould groups and the identification of their unicellular relatives has been a subject of controversy for many years. Traditionally, it has been assumed that two slime mould groups, the acrasids and the dictyostelids were related by virtue of their cellular slime mould habit; a view still endorsed by at least one current classification scheme. However, a decade ago, on the basis of detailed ultrastructural resemblances it was proposed that acrasids of the family Acrasidae were not relatives of other slime moulds but instead related to a group of mostly free-living unicellular amoebae, the Schizopyrenida. The class Heterolobosea was created to contain these organisms and has since figured in many discussions of protist evolution. We sought to test the validity of Heterolobosea by characterizing homologs of the highly conserved glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from an acrasid, Acrasis rosea; a dictyostelid, Dictyostelium discoideum; and the schizopyrenid Naegleria andersoni. Phylogenetic analysis of these and other GAPDH sequences, using maximum parsimony, neighbour-joining distance and maximum likelihood methods strongly supports the Heterolobosea hypothesis and discredits the concept of a cellular slime mould grouping. Moreover, all of our analyses place Dictyostelium discoideum as a relatively recently originating lineage, most closely related to the Metazoa, similar to other recently published phylogenies of protein-coding genes. However, GAPDH phylogenies do not show robust branching orders for most of the relationships between major groups. We propose that several of the incongruencies observed between GAPDH and other molecular phylogenies are artifacts resulting from substitutional saturation of this enzyme.
