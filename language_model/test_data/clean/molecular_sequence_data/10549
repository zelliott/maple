Activation of protein kinase A (PKA) at discrete intracellular sites facilitates oogenesis and development in Drosophila. Thus, PKA-anchor protein complexes may be involved in controlling these crucial biological processes. Evaluation of this proposition requires knowledge of PKA binding/targeting proteins in the fly. We now report the discovery and characterization of cDNAs encoding a novel, Drosophila A kinase anchor protein, DAKAP550. DAKAP550 is a large (>2300 amino acids) acidic protein that is maximally expressed in anterior tissues. It binds regulatory subunits (RII) of both mammalian and Drosophila PKAII isoforms. The tethering region of DAKAP550 includes two proximal, but non-contiguous RII-binding sites (B1 and B2). The B1 domain (residues 1406-1425) binds RII approximately 20-fold more avidly than B2 (amino acids 1350-1369). Affinity-purified anti-DAKAP550 IgGs were exploited to demonstrate that the anchor protein is expressed in many cells in nearly all tissues throughout the lifespan of the fly. However, DAKAP550 is highly enriched and asymmetrically positioned in subpopulations of neurons and in apical portions of cells in gut and trachea. The combination of RII (PKAII) binding activity with differential expression and polarized localization is consistent with a role for DAKAP550 in creating target loci for the reception of signals carried by cAMP. The DAKAP550 gene was mapped to the 4F1.2 region of the X chromosome; flies that carry a deletion for this portion of the X chromosome lack DAKAP550 protein.
