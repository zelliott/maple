Fourty eight recombinant plasmids containing CA repeats were isolated from human chromosome 8q24.1 band-specific pUC19 library. Among them, inserted DNA fragments from 12 plasmids were sequenced, and one new highly polymorphic (CA)n microsatellite was obtained (coding: D8S7F). It contained 11 alleles. The estimated heterozygosity reached 0.84 and 0.83 among Chinese Han Nationality people and American Anglo-Saxons respectively. It was assigned to chromosome 8 by using a human-rodent hybrid cell panel.
