The complete coding sequence of the porcine           IBP4 gene was isolated using RT-PCR. Sequence           analysis showed that the porcine IBP4 gene encodes           a protein of 259 amino acids which shares high homology           with the insulin-like growth factor binding           protein 4 (IBP4) of eight species: cattle (97 %), goat           (97 %), chimpanzee (97 %), human (96 %), giant           panda (96 %), sheep (95 %), Sumatran orangutan           (95 %) and rabbit (93 %). This gene is structured in           four exons and three introns as revealed by computer-           assisted analysis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed           that the porcine IBP4 gene has a close genetic relationship           with the IBP4 gene of cattle. Polymorphism           analysis indicated that there was an A/G substitution           in the position of 134 bp of exon 2 and this mutation           did not alter the encoded amino acids of the porcine           IBP4 gene. PCR-Hha I-RFLP revealed that eight pig           breeds displayed obvious genotype and allele frequency           differences at this polymorphic locus.           Association of this SNP with litter size traits was assessed           in Large White (N = 100) and Landrace (N = 100) populations,            and the results demonstrated that           this polymorphic locus was significantly associated           with the litter size of the first parity in Large White           sows and Landrace sows (P <0.05). These data serve           as a foundation for further insight into this novel           porcine gene.
