The enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) plays a critical role in the production of deoxynucleoside-5'-triphosphates (dNTPs), the building blocks for DNA synthesis and replication. The levels of the cellular dNTPs are tightly controlled, in large part through allosteric control of RNR. One important reason for controlling the dNTPs relates to their ability to affect the fidelity of DNA replication and, hence, the cellular mutation rate. We have previously isolated a set of mutants of Escherichia coli RNR that are characterized by altered dNTP pools and increased mutation rates (mutator mutants). Here, we show that one particular set of RNR mutants, carrying alterations at the enzyme's allosteric specificity site, is characterized by relatively modest dNTP pool deviations but exceptionally strong mutator phenotypes, when measured in a mutational forward assay (>1,000-fold increases). We provide evidence indicating that this high mutability is due to a saturation of the DNA mismatch repair system, leading to hypermutability and error catastrophe. The results indicate that, surprisingly, even modest deviations of the cellular dNTP pools, particularly when the pool deviations promote particular types of replication errors, can have dramatic consequences for mutation rates.
