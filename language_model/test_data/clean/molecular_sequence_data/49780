DNA plasmid vectors were constructed with inducible rainbow trout promoters to take the place of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter in DNA vaccines for fish. DNA fragments containing the promoter regions upstream of the rainbow trout Mx1 and interferon regulatory factor 1A (IRF1A) genes were obtained and their nucleotide sequences were determined. Vectors containing the G gene of IHNV linked to the trout promoters were found to be very effective as vaccines in rainbow trout. In addition, we demonstrated that the IRF1A promoter is transcriptionally active in mouse cells NIH-3T3 suggesting that this fish promoter might be used for mammalian DNA vaccine development as well.
