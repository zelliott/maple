H3N2 swine influenza viruses (SIV) were first detected in Asia shortly after the 1968 pandemic emerged in humans. Subsequently, human H3N2 viruses have sporadically reappeared in swine. In Thailand, a human-like H3N2 SIV was reported in 1978 although the genetic sequence of this virus is unknown. In this study, we undertook cross sectional syndromic surveillance in pigs in four provinces in Thailand. Seven genetically similar H3N2 viruses were isolated. A representative, A/SW/Thailand/KU5.1/04, was fully sequenced and shown to contain genes from human-like influenza viruses and North American and European SIV. The results restate that transmission of influenza A virus among human and swine populations is common and that genes from both American and Eurasian SIV lineages cocirculate in Thailand.
