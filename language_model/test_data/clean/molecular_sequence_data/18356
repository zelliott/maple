A differential library enriched in rapidly evolving human genomic sequences was obtained by phenol-enhanced hybridization of human genomic DNA with an excess of chimpanzee DNA. A DNA fragment 110 bp in length that did not hybridize to either chimpanzee or other primate DNA was identified in this library. It was shown to be a substantially diverged member of the human beta satellite family of tandem repeats. The genomic sequences homologous to the fragment were located on the short arms of human acrocentric chromosomes by in situ hybridization. The human-specific fragment failed to hybridize with RNA from different human tissues. The human-specific fragment exhibits a remarkable level of DNA polymorphism in humans and may be used in the identification of human tissue samples, in the selection of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids containing human acrocentric chromosomes, and in the mapping of these chromosomes.
