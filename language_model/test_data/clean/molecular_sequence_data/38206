We report here on the cloning and characterization of a new theta-class glutathione-S-transferase (GST) gene, gst-3, from Drosophila melanogaster. Its sequence is distinct from previously characterized Drosophila GST genes, and Southern blotting shows no other closely related genes in the genome. In-situ hybridization localizes the gene to chromosome 2 (55D), near gst-2 (53F), and clearly separate from the gst-D cluster at 87B. The gene is intronless and appears to possess conventional 5' TATA, Cap and 3' polyadenylation signals. A single transcript, approximately 1kb in size, appears to be expressed at high levels in all developmental stages examined. When this gene is overexpressed using various upstream GAL4 driver systems, no striking phenotypes are observed; however, we detect bristle morphology defects in some progeny. The gst-3 gene does not appear to be essential, based upon our observation that mutant flies homozygous for an EP element insertion 5' to the TATA box produce little or no detectable gst-3 mRNA; these flies are viable and fertile at 25 and 29 degrees C. Nevertheless, the gst-3 gene appears to be evolutionarily conserved in other Drosophila species, suggesting that it may be functionally important.
