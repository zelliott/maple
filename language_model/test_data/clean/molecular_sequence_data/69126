Human T-cell lymphoma/leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) causes adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy. Specific regions within the outer envelope proteins of other retroviruses, e.g., human immunodeficiency virus type 1, are highly immunogenic and, because of the selective pressure of the host immune system, quite variable. Mutations in the external envelope protein gene of murine retroviruses and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 influence cellular tropism and disease pathogenesis. By contrast, no disease-specific viral mutations have been identified in HTLV-I-infected patients. However, all isolates studied thus far have originated from leukemic cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytes from patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and, therefore, may not truly reflect tissue-associated variation. The midregion of the HTLV-I gp46 external envelope glycoprotein (amino acids 190-209) induces an antibody response in 90% of infected individuals, and a hexapeptide in this region (amino acids 191-196) elicits antibodies in rabbits which inhibit syncytia formation and infection of target lymphocytes. Because of the above, we expected the neutralizing domain of the gp46 env gene of HTLV-I to possess disease or organ-associated mutations selected by the infected host's immune system. Hence, we amplified, cloned, and sequenced HTLV-I DNA directly from in vivo central nervous system, spleen, and kidney specimens, and a leukemic cell line from a patient (M. J.) with both HTLV-I-associated myelopathy and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma to discern the possibility of tissue- and/or disease-specific variants. In addition, we sequenced several HTLV-I isolates from different regions of the world, including Papua New Guinea, Bellona, and Liberia, and compared them to other previously published HTLV-I and related retroviral sequences. The 239-base pair sequence corresponding to amino acids 178 to 256 in gp46 displayed minor tissue-specific variation in clones derived from central nervous system tissues from patient M. J., but overall was highly conserved at both the DNA and amino acid levels. Variation was observed in this region among the other HTLV-I, simian T-cell lymphoma virus type I, and HTLV-II isolates in a pattern that was consistent with their known phylogenetic relationship. No consistent disease-related changes were observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
