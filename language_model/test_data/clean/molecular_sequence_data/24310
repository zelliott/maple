csp, a gene encoding a protein with high sequence identity to trypsinlike serine protease and CUB domains, was identified from a cDNA library from the olfactory organ (antennular lateral flagellum) of the spiny lobster Panulirus argus. The full-length cDNA sequence of csp is 1801 bp, encoding a protein of 50.25 kD, with three domains: signal peptide, trypsinlike serine protease, and CUB (named for a class of compounds including Complement subcomponents Clr/Cls, Uegf, and Bone morphogenic protein-1). RT-PCR, Northern blots, and immunoblots showed that csp is predominantly expressed in the lateral flagellum and eyestalk. Immunocytochemistry showed that Csp is present in olfactory (aesthetasc) sensilla around auxiliary cells (glia that surround the inner dendrites of olfactory receptor neurons, ORNs) and ORN outer dendrites. We propose that Csp is expressed and secreted by auxiliary cells, associates with ORN cell membranes or extracellular matrix via the CUB domain, and has trypsinlike activity. In the eyestalk, Csp is associated with cells surrounding axons between neuropils of the eyestalk ganglia. Possible functions in the olfactory organ and eyestalk are discussed. To our knowledge, this is the first report from any olfactory system of a gene encoding a protein with serine protease and CUB domains.
