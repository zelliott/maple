The coronavirus replicase gene encodes one or two papain-like proteases (termed PL1pro and PL2pro) implicated in the N-terminal processing of the replicase polyprotein and thus contributing to the formation of the viral replicase complex that mediates genome replication. Using consensus fold recognition with the 3D-JURY meta-predictor followed by model building and refinement, we developed a structural model for the single PLpro present in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SCoV) genome, based on significant structural relationships to the catalytic core domain of HAUSP, a ubiquitin-specific protease (USP). By combining the SCoV PLpro model with comparative sequence analyses we show that all currently known coronaviral PLpros can be classified into two groups according to their binding site architectures. One group includes all PL2pros and some of the PL1pros, which are characterized by a restricted USP-like binding site. This group is designated the R-group. The remaining PL1pros from some of the coronaviruses form the other group, featuring a more open papain-like binding site, and is referred to as the O-group. This two-group, binding site-based classification is consistent with experimental data accumulated to date for the specificity of PLpro-mediated polyprotein processing and PLpro inhibition. It also provides an independent evaluation of the similarity-based annotation of PLpro-mediated cleavage sites, as well as a basis for comparison with previous groupings based on phylogenetic analyses.
