Despite the importance of polyploidy in the evolution of plants, patterns of molecular evolution and genomic interactions following polyploidy are not well understood. Nuclear ribosomal DNA is particularly complex with respect to these genomic interactions. The composition of nrDNA tandem arrays is influenced by intra- and interlocus concerted evolution and their expression is characterized by patterns such as nucleolar dominance. To understand these complex interactions it is important to study them in diverse natural polyploid systems. In this study we use direct sequencing to isolate and characterize nrDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) homeologues from multiple accessions of six different races in the Glycine tomentella allopolyploid complex. The results indicate that in most allopolyploid accessions both homeologous nrDNA repeats are present, but that there are significant biases in copy number toward one homeologue, possibly resulting from interlocus concerted evolution. The predominant homeologue often differs between races and between accessions within a race. A phylogenetic analysis of ITS sequences provides evidence for multiple origins in several of the polyploid races. This evidence for diverse patterns of nrDNA molecular evolution and multiple origins of polyploid races will provide a useful system for future studies of natural variation in patterns of nrDNA expression.
