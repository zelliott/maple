In cyanobacteria, nutrient deficiency-induced phycobilisome degradation is controlled by the NblA gene. Red algae also have an NblA-related gene, Ycf18, in their chloroplast genomes. To elucidate the role of Ycf18, the expression pattern of Ycf18 in a red alga, Porphyra yezoensis, was investigated. Ycf18 expression was low in nitrate medium, but was greatly promoted in ammonium medium. Nitrogen starvation caused bleaching, but did not affect the expression of Ycf18. The responses of Ycf18 to nitrogen-starvation and the supply of ammonium were distinct from those of NblA, suggesting that Ycf18 has a role other than the regulation of phycobilisome degradation.
