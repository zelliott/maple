Northern blot analysis of rat RNA from cell lines and isolated organs with a specific rat cDNA probe detected two GTP cyclohydrolase I mRNA species of approx. 1.4 and 3.6 kb. The ratio between these two species varies between 0.6 and 2.4 in different rat organs. Using primers derived from highly conserved regions in the rat and Escherichia coli cDNA sequences a human GTP cyclohydrolase I probe was obtained by means of reverse transcription and PCR (polymerase chain reaction). The human PCR product consisting of 555 bp was cloned and sequenced. It shows a 92% identity with the published sequence of the rat gene. The analysis of various human cell lines with this specific probe shows only one species of GTP cyclohydrolase I mRNA with an approximate size of 3.6 kb.
