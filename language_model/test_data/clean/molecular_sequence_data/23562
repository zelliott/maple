We have recently shown that stimulation of endothelial cells with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces dissociation of caveolin-1 from the VEGFR-2 receptor, followed by Src family kinase-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein (Labrecque, L., Royal, I., Surprenant, D. S., Patterson, C., Gingras, D., and Beliveau, R. (2003) Mol. Biol. Cell 14, 334-347). In this study, we provide evidence that the VEGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 induces interaction of the protein with the membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). This interaction requires the phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on tyrosine 14 by members of the Src family of protein kinases, such as Src and Fyn, because it is completely abolished by expression of a catalytically inactive Src mutant or by site-directed mutagenesis of tyrosine 14 of caveolin-1. Most interestingly, the association of MT1-MMP with phosphorylated caveolin-1 induced the recruitment of Src and a concomitant inhibition of the kinase activity of the enzyme, suggesting that this complex may be involved in the negative regulation of Src activity. The association of MT1-MMP with phosphorylated caveolin-1 occurs in caveolae membranes and involves the cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP because it was markedly reduced by mutation of Cys574 and Val582 residues of the cytoplasmic tail of the enzyme. Most interestingly, the reduction of the interaction between MT1-MMP and caveolin-1 by using these mutants also decreases MT1-MMP-dependent cell locomotion. Overall these results indicate that MT1-MMP associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin-1 and that this complex may play an important role in MT1-MMP regulation and function.
