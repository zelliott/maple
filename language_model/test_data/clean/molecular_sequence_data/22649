The family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters consists of several transmembrane proteins that use ATP hydrolysis as an energy source for the transport of a variety of substances through cellular membranes. Two members of this family, ABCG5 and ABCG8, are implicated in the intestinal absorption and biliar excretion of sterols. Cholesterol content in milk is highly variable among species, breeds, and individuals of the same species, but a potential application of these genes in lipid homeostasis in the mammary gland has never been addressed. In the present work, expression of ABCG5 and ABCG8 in the bovine was demonstrated for the first time and characterized by quantitative PCR. The entire coding region and promoter area were sequenced and screened for motifs involved in lipid homeostasis. Both ABCG5 and ABCG8 presented a high level of length and sequence identity with other mammalian species. In the intergenic promoter region, 2 GATA boxes, a liver receptor homolog-1 response element, and a nuclear factor-kappaB response element, important factors in other lipid regulatory processes, were identified. As expected, high expression levels of both ABCG5 and ABCG8 were present in liver and digestive tract samples, and interestingly, in the mammary gland, opening new avenues for further investigation about their potential role in lipid trafficking and excretion during lactation.
