The insertion of the blood retrotransposon into the untranslated region of exon 7 of the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-encoding gene (Gpdh) in Drosophila melanogaster induces a GPDH isozyme-GPDH-4-and alters the pattern of expression of the three normal isozymes-GPDH-1 to GPDH-3. The process of transcript terminus formation inside the retrotransposon insertion reduces the level of the Gpdh transcript that contains exon 8 and increases the level of the transcript that contains exons 1-7. The induced GPDH-4 isozyme is a translation product of the three transcripts that contain fragments of the blood retrotransposon. The mechanism of mutagenesis by the blood insertion is postulated to involve the pause or termination of transcription within the blood sequence, which in turn is caused by the interference of a DNA-binding protein with the RNA polymerase. Thus, we show the formation of a new functional GPDH protein by the insertion of a transposable element and discuss the evolutionary significance of this phenomenon.
