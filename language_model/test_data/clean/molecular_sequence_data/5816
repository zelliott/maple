Renal juxtaglomerular (JG) cells are specialized myoepithelioid cells located in the afferent arteriole at the entrance to the glomerulus. Their main function and distinctive feature is the synthesis and release of renin, the key hormone-enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system that regulates arterial blood pressure. Despite their relevance to health and disease, not much is known about factors that confer and/or maintain JG cell identity. To identify genes uniquely expressed in JG cells, we used a cell culture model and RNA differential display. JG cells cultured for 2 days express renin and renin mRNA, but after 10 days in culture they no longer contain or release renin and renin mRNA is reduced 700-fold. We report one cDNA differentially expressed in the 2-day JG cell culture that detects a 2.6-kb mRNA expressed at higher levels in newborn than adult kidney. Screening a 2-day culture JG cell cDNA library yielded clones representing differentially spliced transcripts. These cDNAs encode one unique protein (Zis) containing zinc fingers and domains characteristic of splicing factors and RNA binding proteins. Northern blot analysis confirmed Zis mRNA expression in differentiated JG cells, and identified an additional unique 1.5-kb transcript. The Zis transcripts are developmentally regulated in kidney and a number of other organs. The features of the Zis protein and its organ distribution suggest a possible role in regulation of transcription and/or splicing, both important steps for controlling developmentally expressed genes.
