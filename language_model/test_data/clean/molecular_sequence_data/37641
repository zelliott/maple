Arabidopsis plants have a system to specifically restrict the long-distance movement of tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) without involving either hypersensitive cell death or systemic acquired resistance. At least two dominant genes, RTM1 and RTM2, are necessary for this restriction. Through a series of coinfection experiments with heterologous viruses, the RTM1/RTM2-mediated restriction was shown to be highly specific for TEV. The RTM2 gene was isolated by a map-based cloning strategy. Isolation of RTM2 was confirmed by transgenic complementation and sequence analysis of wild-type and mutant alleles. The RTM2 gene product is a multidomain protein containing an N-terminal region with high similarity to plant small heat shock proteins (HSPs). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the RTM2 small HSP-like domain is evolutionarily distinct from each of the five known classes of plant small HSPs. Unlike most other plant genes encoding small HSPs, expression of the RTM2 gene was not induced by high temperature and did not contribute to thermotolerance of seedlings. The RTM2 gene product was also shown to contain a large C-terminal region with multiple repeating sequences.
