Random amplification of polymorphic DNA and inter-repeat polymerase chain reaction (IR-PCR) were compared with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis as methods for DNA typing of Candida albicans. Forty-seven strains of Candida albicans isolated from the oral cavities of five AIDS patients undergoing fluconazole therapy were analyzed. There was an excellent correspondence between the DNA types obtained by both PCR-based techniques and by RFLP. With the exception of one patient who was infected with three DNA types of Candida albicans during a five-year observation period, the patients each harboured only one major strain, which became progressively less susceptible to fluconazole. Each DNA type was unique to a patient. The data suggest that these typing methods are suitable for investigating the epidemiology of oropharyngeal candidiasis in this patient group.
