The results of this study clearly demonstrates the utility of novel non-ionic liposomal systems in facilitating transfer of GHRP-6 into and across deeper strata of skin following topical application. These findings indicate that it may be possible to deliver therapeutic doses of a wide variety of peptides to local skin tissue via topical application. The results also suggest the possibility of controlled enhancement of skin penetration or metered polypeptide deposition through appropriate choice of liposomal lipid components. The pronounced enhancement of GHRP-6 and mannitol transport from emulsions containing the nonionic lipids suggests a promising delivery system for hydrophilic drugs in general.
