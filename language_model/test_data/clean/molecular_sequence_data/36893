Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) has been used as a three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) method to correlate the affinities of several antagonists towards CCK-A receptors with their steric and electrostatic fields. In this publication, we describe, for the first time, a field-fit operation as an alignment technique. These results could serve as a guide for the design of new non-peptide antagonists.
