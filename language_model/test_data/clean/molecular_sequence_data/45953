Positional cloning of two recessive mutations of the mouse that cause polysyndactyly (dan and mdig-Chr 2) confirmed that the gene encoding MEGF7/LRP4, a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family, plays an essential role in the process of digit differentiation. Pathologies observed in the mutant mice provide insight into understanding the function(s) of LRP4 as a negative regulator of the Wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathway and may help identify the genetic basis for common human disorders with similar phenotypes.
