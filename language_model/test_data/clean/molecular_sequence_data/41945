We have isolated and sequenced one intergenic region and a small part of the flanking regions (18S and 26S rRNA coding regions) of the rRNA-encoding genes (rDNA) from the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. This region is about 3.8 Kb long. Northern blot hybridizations and S1 mapping experiments demonstrated the presence of a partially processed 21S rRNA precursor while has the same 5' terminus as the 32S primary precursor, also in developmental stages characterized by a low rate of rRNA synthesis.
