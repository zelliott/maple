The gene family encoding the small subunit (SSU) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase in the monocot Lemna gibba contains approximately twelve members. We have isolated six of these genes from a genomic library, and sequenced five of the coding regions. The transit peptide nucleotide sequences are conserved, but less highly than the mature polypeptide coding sequence. The mature polypeptide amino acid sequences are identical to each other and to the sequence deduced from a cDNA clone derived from a seventh gene. Each of the five fully characterized genomic sequences contains a single intron in precisely the same position as the second intron of several dicots. The intron sequences differ in length and are less conserved than the coding sequences. The 3'-untranslated regions of the different genes have been sequenced and used to prepare gene-specific probes. These probes have been used to study the expression levels of individual rbcS sequences. Expression of six of the seven genes can be detected in total RNA isolated from plants grown in continuous light. The levels of RNA encoded by each expressed gene are regulated by the action of phytochrome, but there is variability in the amount of expression of each RNA.
