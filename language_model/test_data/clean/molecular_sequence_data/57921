We have compared the effects of a number of different oligonucleotides on the growth and morphology of normal finite life span and immortally transformed human mammary epithelial cells. The oligonucleotide sequences chosen initially for study were based on that of the NB-1 gene, which encodes a calmodulin-like protein of unknown function. We found that certain thioated oligonucleotides 15-20 residues in length altered the morphology and decreased the growth rate of the normal cells in a concentration-dependent manner. These effects were rapid, occurring within 24-48 h of oligonucleotide addition. The effects, which occurred without an accompanying detectable decrease in the levels of NB-1 mRNA or protein, were most pronounced in the normal epithelial cells, less apparent in the immortalized epithelial cells, and unobserved in normal breast fibroblasts. Identical sequences having mixed phosphodiester and phosphorothioate backbones, or phosphodiester backbones alone, had little or no effect on normal epithelial cell morphology or growth. Two out of seven additional thioated oligonucleotides which were not complementary to NB-1 mRNA, also affected normal epithelial cell morphology and growth when used at similar concentrations (10 microM). Taken together, the observed effects on normal epithelial cells indicate that certain thioated oligonucleotides may have pharmacological consequences that do not depend on strict complementarity of their sequences to known mRNAs.
