A family of novel potentially mobile DNA elements called integrons, has recently been described (H. W. Stokes and R. M. Hall, 1989, Mol. Microbiol. 3, 1669-1683). The integrons present in the plasmids pDGO100 and pSa are unusual in that they include a duplication of the sulI gene which is located in one of the two conserved segments that make up these elements. In order to define the nature of the duplication in pDGO100, we have sequenced the sulI gene region located between the aadB and the dhfr genes of pDGO100. This region includes the first 1355 bases of the 2026-base 3'-conserved segment present in the integrons of Tn21, R46 and R388, and the sequence identity in pDGO100 ceases 24 bases beyond the end of the sulI gene. This position corresponds to the center of a 59-base element, a remnant of which is located at the end of sulI. This finding suggests that the 59-base element may have been involved in the event which gave rise to the partial duplication.
