We have isolated and characterised two overlapping lambda EMBL3 clones carrying sequences of the gene for the murine U1RNA-associated 70-kDa protein. The two clones cover around 23 kb of the 70-kDa protein gene including its 3' end. Southern blot hybridisation revealed the existence of a single copy of the 70-kDa protein gene in the mouse genome. The 23-kb-long portion of the 70-kDa protein gene is divided into eight exons. While most of the exons are quite small and are widely scattered throughout the DNA sequence, the last one consists of about 830 bp and encodes 226 amino acids of the 70-kDa protein, including the C-terminus. The predicted amino acid sequence of the region of the 70-kDa protein encoded by the genomic clones reveals high conservation of structure when it is compared with the sequence of the human 70-kDa protein. Interestingly, all deletions, additions and substitutions are localised exclusively within the C-terminus of the protein, accounting for a 5'-3' polarity with respect to protein conservation. Moreover, the analysis of the genomic sequences predicts the existence of multiple subclasses of mRNAs that may arise by alternative pre-mRNA splicing. A 72-bp alternative exon harboring an in-frame termination codon was also found in the mouse 70-kDa gene and shows, surprisingly, 100% nucleotide identity to its human counterpart.
