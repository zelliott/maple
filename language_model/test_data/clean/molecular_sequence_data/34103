Scleractinian corals are of particular interest due to their ability to establish an intracellular mutualistic symbiosis with phototrophic dinoflagellates and to deposit high rates of calcium carbonate in their skeleton. Carbonic anhydrases have been shown to play a crucial role in both processes. In this study, we report the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel α-CA in the coral Stylophora pistillata. This enzyme shares homologies with the human isoform CA II and is referred to as STPCA-2. STPCA-2 is 35.2 kDa and possesses all key amino acids for catalytic activity. With a ratio between catalytic and Michaelis constants (k(cat)/K(m)) of 8.3.10(7) M(-1)  s(-1) is considered as highly active. Owing to its intracellular localisation in the oral endoderm and in the aboral tissue, we propose that STPCA-2 is involved in pH regulation and/or inorganic carbon delivery to symbiont and calcification.
