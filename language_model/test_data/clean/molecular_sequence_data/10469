The genetic linkages of the murine ocular retardation mutation with the Chx10 gene and the murine small eye mutation with the Pax-6 gene has demonstrated the importance of Paired class homeobox genes in the development of the mammalian retina. Previously, we identified a Paired-class homeobox gene, Vsx-1, whose expression in the adult goldfish retina is restricted to the inner nuclear layer (INL) and to postmitotic, differentiating progenitor cells in the growth zone at the retinal peripheral margin, where neurogenesis continues throughout life. Here, we report the molecular cloning and expression pattern of a new Paired class homeobox gene, Vsx-2, in the adult goldfish retina. Like Vsx-1, Vsx-2 expression is highly restricted to the retina in the adult goldfish and overlaps with Vsx-1 expression in the mature INL. At the peripheral margin, Vsx-2 is expressed in mitotically active neuronal progenitors and is downregulated as these cells become postmitotic and begin to differentiate. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of Vsx-2, Vsx-1, Chx10, and C. elegans ceh-10 reveal a conserved homeodomain and a unique domain termed the CVC domain. The similarities of the Vsx-2, Vsx-1, and Chx10 expression patterns suggest that genes containing the CVC domain have conserved functions during retinal development in vertebrates.
