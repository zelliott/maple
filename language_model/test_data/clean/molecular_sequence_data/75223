The nucleotide sequence of a Plasmodium falciparum actin gene has been established. The gene codes for a protein of 376 amino acids and is not interrupted by introns. The nucleotide sequence reveals an extreme bias in codon usage. Not less than 85% of the codons possess an A or T at the third position. As has been found for the actins in other unicellular eukaryotes, P. falciparum actin is related both to vertebrate cytoplasmic and vertebrate muscle specific actins. However, the malarial actin is one of the most alpha-like actins hitherto found in lower eukaryotes.
