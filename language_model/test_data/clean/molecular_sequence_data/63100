As the largest class of disease resistance R genes, the genes encoding nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeat proteins ("NBS-LRR genes") play a critical role in defending plants from a multitude of pathogens and pests. The diversity of NBS-LRR genes was examined in the Populus trichocarpa draft genome sequence. The NBS class of genes in this perennial tree is large and diverse, comprised of approximately 400 genes, at least twice the complement of Arabidopsis. The NBS family can be divided into multiple subfamilies with distinct domain organizations. It includes 119 Coiled-Coil-NBS-LRR genes, 64 TIR-NBS-LRR genes, 34 BED-finger-NBS-LRR, and both truncated and unusual NBS- and NBS-LRR-containing genes. The transcripts of only 34 NBS-LRR genes were detected in rust-infected and non-infected leaves using a whole-genome oligoarray. None showed an altered expression two days post inoculation.
