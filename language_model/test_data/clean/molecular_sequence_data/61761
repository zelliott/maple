The RCK gene was cloned on the basis of the t(11;14)(q23;q32) chromosome translocation observed in human B-cell lymphoma cell line RC-K8. This gene was found to be overexpressed in various kinds of tumours. The gene product, rck/p54, consisting of 472 amino-acid residues with molecular weight 53.2 kDa, belongs to the family of DEAD-box RNA helicases. Its ATP-dependent RNA-unwinding activity toward c-myc RNA molecules in vitro has recently been demonstrated. In the present study, limited proteolysis experiments of rck/p54 were used to truncate the N-terminal domain (residues 1-288; 31.8 kDa) of rck/p54, leading to successful crystallization of Nc-rck/p54, i.e. the N-terminal core domain (residues 70-288; 24.5 kDa) of rck/p54. Crystals of Nc-rck/p54 were grown to a size suitable for X-ray structure analysis using polyethylene glycol 3350 as the precipitant. The crystal belongs to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 65.5, b = 73.1, c = 84.8 A, and diffracts X-rays to beyond 2.0 A resolution.
