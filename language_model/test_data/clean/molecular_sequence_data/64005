Adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) requires sialic acid on host cells to bind and infect. Other parvoviruses, including Aleutian mink disease parvovirus (ADV), canine parvovirus (CPV), minute virus of mice, and bovine parvovirus, also bind sialic acid. Hence, structural homology may explain this functional homology. The amino acids required for CPV sialic acid binding map to a site at the icosahedral twofold axes of the capsid. In contrast to AAV5, AAV2 does not bind sialic acid, but rather binds heparan sulfate proteoglycans at its threefold axes of symmetry. To explore the structure-function relationships among parvoviruses with respect to cell receptor attachment, we determined the structure of AAV5 by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and image reconstruction at a resolution of 16 A. Surface features common to some parvoviruses, namely depressions encircling the fivefold axes and protrusions at or surrounding the threefold axes, are preserved in the AAV5 capsid. However, even though there were some similarities, a comparison of the AAV5 structure with those of ADV and CPV failed to reveal a feature which could account for the sialic acid binding phenotype common to all three viruses. In contrast, the overall surface topologies of AAV5 and AAV2 are similar. A pseudo-atomic model generated for AAV5 based on the crystal structure of AAV2 and constrained by the AAV5 cryo-EM envelope revealed differences only in surface loop regions. Surprisingly, the surface topologies of AAV5 and AAV2 are remarkably similar to that of ADV despite only exhibiting approximately 20% identity in amino acid sequences. Thus, capsid surface features are shared among parvoviruses and may not be unique to their replication phenotypes, i.e., whether they require a helper or are autonomous. Furthermore, specific surface features alone do not explain the variability in carbohydrate requirements for host cell receptor interactions among parvoviruses.
