Bacillus circulans, a soil bacterium, produced an exocellular polysaccharide of high viscosity. On the basis of the results of methylation analysis, mild acid hydrolysis, and 1D and 2D 1H-NMR spectroscopy, it was concluded that the polysaccharide has a basic repeating unit composed of beta-L-rhamnopyranose, alpha-D-mannopyranose, alpha-D-galactopyranose, and alpha-D-glucopyranuronic acid with the following structure.
