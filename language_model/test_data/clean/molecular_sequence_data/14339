Studies focusing on the targeting of RNAs that encode rice storage proteins, prolamines and glutelins to specific sub-domains of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as well as mis-localization studies of other storage protein RNAs, indicate a close relationship between the ER site of RNA translation and the final site of protein deposition in the endomembrane system in developing rice endosperm. In addition to prolamine and glutelin, rice accumulates smaller amounts of α-globulins, which are deposited together with glutelin in the protein storage vacuole (PSV). In situ RT-PCR analysis revealed that α-globulin RNAs are not distributed to the cisternal ER as expected for a PSV-localized protein, but instead are targeted to the protein body-ER (PB-ER) by a regulated process requiring cis-sorting sequences. Sequence alignments with putative maize δ-zein cis-localization elements identified several candidate regulatory sequences that may be responsible for PB-ER targeting. Immunocytochemical analysis confirmed the presence of α-globulin on the periphery of the prolamine protein bodies and packaging in Golgi-associated dense vesicles, as well as deposition and storage within peripheral regions of the PSV. Mis-targeting of α-globulin RNAs to the cisternal ER dramatically alters the spatial arrangement of α-globulin and glutelin within the PSV, with the accompanying presence of numerous small α-globulin particles in the cytoplasm. These results indicate that α-globulin RNA targeting to the PB-ER sub-domain is essential for efficient transport of α-globulins to the PSV and its spatial arrangement in the PSV. Such RNA localization prevents potential deleterious protein-protein interactions, in addition to performing a role in protein targeting.
