Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-strand RNA virus that frequently causes persistent infection associated with severe liver disease. HCV nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is essential for viral replication. Here, the kinase Raf-1 was identified as a novel cellular binding partner of NS5A, binding to the C-terminal domain of NS5A. Raf-1 colocalizes with NS5A in the HCV replication complex. The interaction of NS5A with Raf-1 results in increased Raf-1 phosphorylation at serine 338. Integrity of Raf-1 is crucial for HCV replication: inhibition of Raf-1 by the small-molecule inhibitor BAY43-9006 or downregulation of Raf-1 by siRNA attenuates viral replication.
