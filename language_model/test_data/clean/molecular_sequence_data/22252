PilF is a requisite protein involved in the type 4 pilus biogenesis system from the Gram-negative human pathogenic bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We determined the PilF structure at a 2.2A resolution; this includes six tandem tetratrico peptide repeat (TPR) units forming right-handed superhelix. PilF structure was similar to the heat shock protein organizing protein, which interacts with the C-terminal peptide of Hsp90 and Hsp70 via a concave Asn ladder in the inner groove of TPR superhelix. After simulated screening, the C-terminal pentapeptides of PilG, PilU, PilY, and PilZ proved to be a likely candidate binding to PilF, which are ones of 25 necessary components involved in the type 4 pilus biogenesis system. We proposed that PilF would be critical as a bridgehead in protein-protein interaction and thereby, PilF may bind a necessary molecule in type 4 pilus biogenesis system such as PilG, PilU, PilY, and PilZ.
