Structural shifts associated with functional dynamics in a bacterial community may provide clues for identifying the most valuable members in an ecosystem. A laboratory-scale denitrifying reactor was adapted from use of non-efficient seeding sludge and was utilized to degrade quinoline and remove the chemical oxygen demand. Stable removal efficiencies were achieved after an adaptation period of six weeks. Both denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiling of the 16S rRNA gene V3 region and comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequence clone libraries (LIBSHUFF analysis) demonstrated that microbial communities in the denitrifying reactor and seeding sludge were significantly distinct. The percentage of the clones affiliated with the genera Thauera and Azoarcus was 74% in the denitrifying reactor and 4% in the seeding sludge. Real-time quantitative PCR also indicated that species of the genera Thauera and Azoarcus increased in abundance by about one order of magnitude during the period of adaptation. The greater abundance of Thauera and Azoarcus in association with higher efficiency after adaptation suggested that these phylotypes might play an important role for quinoline and chemical oxygen demand removal under denitrifying conditions.
