Schistosomes have a complex life cycle which alternates between two hosts and includes two short-lived water-born forms. Cercariae are the larval forms of schistosomes responsible for infection of the vertebrate hosts. The infection is initiated when the cercariae penetrate host skin. During penetration, cercariae will undergo profound changes and release excretory/secretory products to adapt to the new environment and to escape from host's immune attack. Part of these events should be determined, to some degree, by the activation of certain genes in the cercariae. In this study, we performed cDNA microarray analysis to monitor the profile of the genes actively expressed in Schistosoma japonicum cercariae. Microarray analysis showed that 76 of 3840 cDNA clones were expressed more than 20-fold in cercariae compared to adult worms. After cluster analysis, 19 non-redundant expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were obtained, 4 of which represented functionally annotated genes, 14 of which represented functionally un-characterized genes, and 1 of which represented a novel gene sequence. The full-length cDNA of the second most abundant EST, Sj20H8, was cloned and preliminarily characterized. Although the precise biological role of all cercarial actively expressed transcripts identified in this investigation awaits further functional analysis, our findings may offer insight into novel control strategies or help to develop potential vaccine candidates against schistosomiasis.
