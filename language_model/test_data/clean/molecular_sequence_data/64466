Two fruit-bodies of Terfezia boudieri Chatin, each exhibiting a mixture of two ITS -RFLP profiles, were found in the Negev desert of Israel. A mycelial culture obtained from glebal out-growth maintained the double profile, as did proliferating cultures established using single hyphae isolated from the original cultures. The main difference between the two ITS variants lies in a 21 bp deletion in the smaller variant. The question whether both variants are contained within a single nucleus or occupy different nuclei sharing the same cytoplasm is discussed.
