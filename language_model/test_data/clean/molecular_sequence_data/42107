We have previously shown that the receptors mediating the renal and systemic vasoconstrictor effects of endothelin-1 (ET-1) are of two distinct endothelin receptor subtypes. Here, we evaluate the effect of PD 145065, a nonselective endothelin receptor antagonist, on the renal vasoconstrictor effects of ET-1 in the rat kidney. ET-1 induced concentration-dependent increases in perfusion pressure in the isolated perfused kidney of the rat. The ETA receptor-selective antagonists BQ-123 (10 microM) and FR 139317 (10 microM) lowered the ET-1-induced rise in perfusion pressure by 57% and 61%, respectively, at 3 x 10(-10) M ET-1. By comparison, the ET-1-induced vasoconstriction was fully antagonized (96% inhibition) by PD 145065 (10 microM). In the anesthetized rat, ET-1 produced a dose-dependent increase in mean arterial pressure, which was attenuated by PD 145065. The initial depressor response to ET-1 was completely blocked by PD 145065, as were the reduction in renal blood flow and increase in renal vascular resistance induced by ET-1. These results suggest that both the ETA and a non-ETA receptor subtype play an important role in mediating the vasoconstrictor effects of ET-1 in the rat kidney.
