The lonepair triloop (LPTL) is an RNA structural motif that contains a single ("lone") base-pair capped by a hairpin loop containing three nucleotides. The two nucleotides immediately outside of this motif (5' and 3' to the lonepair) are not base-paired to one another, restricting the length of this helix to a single base-pair. Four examples of this motif, along with three tentative examples, were initially identified in the 16S and 23S rRNAs with covariation analysis. An evaluation of the recently determined crystal structures of the Thermus thermophilus 30S and Haloarcula marismortui 50S ribosomal subunits revealed the authenticity for all of these proposed interactions and identified 16 more LPTLs in the 5S, 16S and 23S rRNAs. This motif is found in the T loop in the tRNA crystal structures. The lonepairs are positioned, in nearly all examples, immediately 3' to a regular secondary structure helix and are stabilized by coaxial stacking onto this flanking helix. In all but two cases, the nucleotides in the triloop are involved in a tertiary interaction with another section of the rRNA, establishing an overall three-dimensional function for this motif. Of these 24 examples, 14 occur in multi-stem loops, seven in hairpin loops and three in internal loops. While the most common lonepair, U:A, occurs in ten of the 24 LPTLs, the remaining 14 LPTLs contain seven different base-pair types. Only a few of these lonepairs adopt the standard Watson-Crick base-pair conformations, while the majority of the base-pairs have non-standard conformations. While the general three-dimensional conformation is similar for all examples of this motif, characteristic differences lead to several subtypes present in different structural environments. At least one triloop nucleotide in 22 of the 24 LPTLs in the rRNAs and tRNAs forms a tertiary interaction with another part of the RNA. When a LPTL containing the GNR or UYR triloop sequence forms a tertiary interaction with the first (and second) triloop nucleotide, it recruits a fourth nucleotide to mediate stacking and mimic the tetraloop conformation. Approximately half of the LPTL motifs are in close association with proteins. The majority of these LPTLs are positioned at sites in rRNAs that are conserved in the three phylogenetic domains; a few of these occur in regions of the rRNA associated with ribosomal function, including the presumed site of peptidyl transferase activity in the 23S rRNA.
