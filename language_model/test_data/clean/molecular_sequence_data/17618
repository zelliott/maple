A set of chimaeric precursors which contain the same leader sequences but different passenger proteins has been analyzed for the site of protease cleavage following import into yeast mitochondria. Each precursor comprises the leader of Neurospora crassa subunit 9 of mitochondrial ATP synthase fused to subunit 8 or 9 of the corresponding yeast enzyme. Precursors containing the first five residues of mature N. crassa subunit 9 interposed between the leader and the yeast passenger protein were cleaved at the natural site of the N. crassa subunit 9 precursor. Direct fusions without interposed sequences were cleaved at novel sites. Cleavage occurred between the 3rd and 4th residues of yeast subunit 8, but for yeast subunit 9, cleavage occurred within the leader, 8 residues upstream of the passenger protein.
