A fourth pathotype of Pea seedborne mosaic virus, a member of the genus Potyvirus, was identified by analysis of the infection profile on a panel of Pisum sativum lines. The new pathotype, designated P-3, was able to overcome resistance specified by the sbm-1 resistance gene but could not overcome resistance specified by the sbm-2 resistance gene. This infection profile distinguished P-3 from previously described pathotypes, P-1, P-2, and P-4. Analysis of chimeric viruses demonstrated that properties of the P3-6k1- and viral genome-linked protein (VPg)-coding regions accounted for the infection profile of the new pathotype.
