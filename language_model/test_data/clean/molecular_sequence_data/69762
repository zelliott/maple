We isolated cDNA for dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase from a human fibroblast cDNA library in lambda gt11. The cDNA revealed that the human dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase lacked a sequence motif of an E3 and/or E1 binding site. This suggests that the human dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase possesses a unique structure consisting of two domains in contrast with the dihydrolipoamide acyltransferases of other alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes. In addition, we found that the human dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase gene is located on chromosome 14 at q24.2-q24.3 and that a sequence related to the dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase gene is located on chromosome 1 at p31. Interestingly, the gene for the dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase of the branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex is also located on chromosome 1p31 (Zneimer et al. (1991) Genomics 10, 740-747).
