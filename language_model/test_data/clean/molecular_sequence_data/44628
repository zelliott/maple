This review highlights significant recent advances in the molecular genetics of white-rot fungi and identifies areas where information remains sketchy. The development of critical experimental tools such as genetic mapping techniques is described. A major portion of the text focuses on the structure, genomic organization and transcriptional regulation of the genes encoding peroxidases, laccases and glyoxal oxidase. Finally, recent efforts on heterologous expression of lignin-degrading enzymes are discussed.
