In some male pigs, there is an increased production of the testicular 16 androstene steroids which end up being concentrated in fatty tissue. When the meat is cooked, a disagreeable odor/flavor is produced, a phenomenon known as "boar taint." All boars selected for food production are castrated even though only ca 10% of boars may be "tainted." This has a high economic cost because castrated pigs convert food into meat less efficiently, the meat is fatter, and there is an increased mortality due to the castration procedure. Recent data has implicated an increased level of cytochrome b5 in the testes with the increased synthesis of the 16-androstene steroids. As an initial step in analyzing this process, we used 5' and 3' RACE PCR procedures to isolate, clone and sequence the cDNAs for the membrane-bound and soluble forms of porcine cytochrome b5.
