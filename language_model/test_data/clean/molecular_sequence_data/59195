We describe an Escherichia coli plasmid, pIJ2581, that can be used for the efficient construction of stable gene disruptants and of gene deletions in Streptomyces. Integration of pIJ2581 derivatives carrying chromosomal sequences is achieved by selecting for plasmid-encoded thiostrepton resistance, while plasmid excision is secured by counter-selection of the pIJ2581 glkA gene, which confers sensitivity to 2-deoxyglucose.
