We have developed an array of seven deoxyribozyme-based molecular logic gates that behaves as a full adder in a single solution, with three oligonucleotides as inputs and two independent fluorogenic cleavage reactions as carry and sum outputs. The sum output consisted of four new deoxyribozyme-based logic gates: an ANDAND gate and three ANDNOTANDNOT gates. These gates required the design of a generic three-input deoxyribozyme-based logic gate that can use any three-way combination of activating or inactivating inputs. This generic gate design utilizes an additional inverting element that hybridizes to convert YES logic into NOT logic and vice versa. The system represents the first solution-phase, single test tube, enzymatic full adder and shows the complexity of control over molecular scale events that can be achieved with deoxyribozyme-based logic gates. Similar systems could be applied to control autonomous therapeutic and diagnostic devices.
