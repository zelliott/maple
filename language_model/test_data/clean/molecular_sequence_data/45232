4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), a racemic mixture of 4R- and 4S-enantiomers, is a major product of lipid peroxidation and is believed to be largely responsible for the cytopathological effects observed during oxidative stress. HNE reacts with histidine to form a stable HNE-histidine Michael addition-type adduct possessing three chiral centers in the cyclic hemiacetal structure. We have previously raised the mAbs, anti-R mAb 310 and anti-S mAb S412, that enantioselectively recognized the R-HNE-histidine and R-HNE-histidine adducts, respectively, and demonstrated the presence of both epitopes in vivo. In the present study, to further investigate the anti-HNE immune response, we analyzed the variable genes and primary structure of these Abs and found that the sequence of R310 was highly homologous to anti-DNA autoantibodies, the hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus. An x-ray crystallographic analysis of the R310 Fab fragment showed that the R-HNE-histidine adduct binds to a hydrophobic pocket in the antigen-binding site. Despite the structural identity to the anti-DNA autoantibodies, however, R310 showed only a slight crossreactivity with the native double-stranded DNA, whereas the Ab immunoreactivity was dramatically enhanced by the treatment of the DNA with 4-oxo-2-nonenal (ONE), an analog of HNE. Moreover, the 7-(2-oxo-heptyl)-substituted 1,N2-etheno-type ONE-2'-deoxynucleoside adducts were identified as alternative epitopes of R310. Molecular mimicry between the R-HNE-histidine configurational isomers and the ONE-DNA base adducts is proposed for the dual crossreactivity.
