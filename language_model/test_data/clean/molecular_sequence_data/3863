Genome sequencing revealed that the Corynebacterium glutamicum genome contained, besides gltA, two additional citrate synthase homologous genes (prpC) located in two different prpDBC gene clusters, which were designated prpD1B1C1 and prpD2B2C2. The coding regions of the two gene clusters as well as the predicted gene products showed sequence identities of about 70 to 80%. Significant sequence similarities were found also to the prpBCDE operons of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, which are known to encode enzymes of the propionate-degrading 2-methylcitrate pathway. Homologous and heterologous overexpression of the C. glutamicum prpC1 and prpC2 genes revealed that their gene products were active as citrate synthases and 2-methylcitrate synthases. Growth tests showed that C. glutamicum used propionate as a single or partial carbon source, although the beginning of the exponential growth phase was strongly delayed by propionate for up to 7 days. Compared to growth on acetate, the specific 2-methylcitrate synthase activity increased about 50-fold when propionate was provided as the sole carbon source, suggesting that in C. glutamicum the oxidation of propionate to pyruvate occurred via the 2-methylcitrate pathway. Additionally, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis experiments combined with mass spectrometry showed strong induction of the expression of the C. glutamicum prpD2B2C2 genes by propionate as an additional carbon source. Mutational analyses revealed that only the prpD2B2C2 genes were essential for the growth of C. glutamicum on propionate as a sole carbon source, while the function of the prpD1B1C1 genes remains obscure.
