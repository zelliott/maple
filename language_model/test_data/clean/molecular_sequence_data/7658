D6S265 is a polymorphic dinucleotide repeat, mapped within 70 kb centromeric of HLA-A, on chromosome 6p21.3. While genotyping families for genetic linkage analysis, allele non-amplification resulting in apparent non-Mendelian inheritance was observed at the D6S265 locus in 15 individuals, on chromosomes carrying the HLA-A25 and HLA-A26 antigens. The D6S265 locus was sequenced in a variant individual homozygous for allele non-amplification, and in a non-HLA-A25/-A26 individual, homozygous for D6S265 allele 1. Five base changes were identified in the reverse primer binding region of the variant individual, effectively preventing annealing of the 3' primer to the template.
