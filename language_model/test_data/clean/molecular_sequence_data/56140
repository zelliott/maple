To examine the prevalence of infection by human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) among seronegative subjects, healthy subjects on Tsushima Island, Japan, where the infection is endemic, were evaluated. A total of 209 healthy adults were examined for HTLV-I provirus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as well as for anti-HTLV-I antibodies by the particle agglutination (PA) method, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by immunofluorescence analysis (IF). A total of 76 subjects were positive and 133 were negative for the provirus, showing a close correlation with the results of 3 assays for anti-HTLV-I serum antibodies. None of the seronegative subjects reacted positively on PCR analysis. These observations indicate that seronegative HTLV-I carriers are rare in an area of Japan in which this viral infection is endemic.
