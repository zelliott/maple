An unusually large number of regulatory or targeting proteins that bind to the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1 have been recently reported. This can be explained by their possession of a common protein motif that interacts with a binding site on protein phosphatase-1. The existence of such a motif was established by the panning of a random peptide library in which peptide sequences are displayed on the Escherichia coli bacterial flagellin protein for bacteria that bound to protein phosphatase-1. There were 79 isolates containing 46 unique sequences with the conserved motif VXF or VXW, where X was most frequently His or Arg. In addition, this sequence was commonly preceded by 2-5 basic residues and followed by 1 acidic residue. This study demonstrates that binding to protein phosphatase-1 can be conferred to a protein by the presentation of a peptide motif on a surface loop. This binding motif is found in a number of protein phosphatase-1-binding proteins.
