The class II MHC homolog HLA-DM catalyzes exchange of peptides bound to class II MHC proteins, and is an important component of the Ag presentation machinery. The mechanism of HLA-DM-mediated catalysis is largely obscure. HLA-DM catalyzes exchange of peptides of varying sequence, suggesting that a peptide sequence-independent component of the MHC-peptide interaction could be involved in the catalytic process. Twelve conserved hydrogen bonds between the peptide backbone and the MHC are a prominent sequence-independent feature of the MHC-peptide interaction. To evaluate the relative importance of these hydrogen bonds toward HLA-DM action, we prepared peptide variants that lacked the ability to form one or more of the hydrogen bonds as a result of backbone amide N-methylation or truncation, and tested their ability to be exchanged by HLA-DM. We found that disruption of hydrogen bonds involving HLA-DR1 residues alpha51-53, a short extended segment at the N terminus of the alpha subunit helical region, led to heightened HLA-DM catalytic efficacy. We propose that those bonds are disrupted in the MHC conformation recognized by HLA-DM to allow structural transitions in that area during DM-assisted peptide release. These results suggest that peptides or compounds that bind MHC but cannot form these interactions would be preferentially edited out by HLA-DM.
