Protein interacting with C kinase (PICK1) is well conserved throughout evolution and plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity by regulating the trafficking and posttranslational modification of its interacting proteins. PICK1 contains a single PSD95/DlgA/Zo-1 (PDZ) protein-protein interaction domain, which is promiscuous and shown to interact with over 60 proteins, most of which play roles in neuronal function. Several reports have suggested the role of PICK1 in disorders such as epilepsy, pain, brain trauma and stroke, drug abuse and dependence, schizophrenia and psychosis. Importantly, lead compounds that block PICK1 interactions are also now becoming available. Here, a new modeling approach was developed to investigate binding affinities of PDZ interactions. Using these methods, the binding affinities of all major PICK1 interacting proteins are reported and the effects of PICK1 mutations on these interactions are described. These modeling methods have important implications in defining the binding properties of proteins interacting with PICK1 as well as the general structural requirements of PDZ interactions. The study also provides modeling methods to support in the drug design of ligands for PDZ domains, which may further aid in development of the family of PDZ domains as a drug target.
