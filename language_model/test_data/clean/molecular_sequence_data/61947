Identifying the fold class of a protein sequence of unknown structure is a fundamental problem in modern biology. We apply a supervised learning algorithm to the classification of protein sequences with low sequence identity from a library of 174 structural classes created with the Combinatorial Extension structural alignment methodology. A class of rules is considered that assigns test sequences to structural classes based on the closest match of an amino acid index profile of the test sequence to a profile centroid for each class. A mathematical optimization procedure is applied to determine an amino acid index of maximal structural discriminatory power by maximizing the ratio of between-class to within-class profile variation. The optimal index is computed as the solution to a generalized eigenvalue problem, and its performance for fold classification is compared to that of other published indices. The optimal index has significantly more structural discriminatory power than all currently known indices, including average surrounding hydrophobicity, which it most closely resembles. It demonstrates >70% classification accuracy over all folds and nearly 100% accuracy on several folds with distinctive conserved structural features. Finally, there is a compelling universality to the optimal index in that it does not appear to depend strongly on the specific structural classes used in its computation.
