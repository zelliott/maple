The mitogenic action of endothelins (ETs) 1 and 3 was studied on C6 rat glioma cells in serum-free culture conditions. In order to characterize the ET receptor subtype involved in this effect, BQ-123, and ETA receptor selective antagonist was used. Our results confirmed that both ET-1 and ET-3 are mitogenic peptides for C6 cells and demonstrated for the first time that the ETA receptor antagonist BQ-123 inhibits the proliferative effect of both ET-1 and ET-3 in this cellular system, providing evidence of an atypical ET receptor on C6 cells.
