The primary structure of rat heart muscle fatty acid-binding protein was investigated by liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry. The protein was digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and the resulting peptides were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The masses of the protonated molecular ions (MH+) of the tryptic, chymotryptic, and S. aureus protease peptides were determined by liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis using 20-500 pmol of material. From the tryptic digest, two peptides with MH+ 1036 and 861 were initially found that did not match the published primary sequence (Sacchettini, J. C., Meininger, T. A., Lowe, J. B., Gordon, J. I., and Banaszak, L. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5428-5430). The amino acid sequences of these two peptides were determined by a combination of mass spectrometry, B/E-linked scanning, and high performance tandem mass spectrometric techniques to be: (Formula: see text). These new data require that corrections be made to the previously published sequence, involving residues 1-4 and 51-52. The corrected amino sequence for rat m-FABP reveals greater homology with myelin P2, mouse adipocyte p422 protein, and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein than was previously demonstrated.
