Analysis of nuclear Overhauser enhancements in two-dimensional NMR spectra of the complex of lac repressor headpiece with a 14 base pair lac operator fragment shows that the second helix of the headpiece binds in the major groove of DNA, as has been suggested. The orientation of this helix is approximately 180 degrees different from the proposed models and from that found in the X-ray structure of the 434 repressor-operator complex. The model of the lac headpiece-operator complex provides a good explanation for a large amount of biochemical, genetic and physical data.
