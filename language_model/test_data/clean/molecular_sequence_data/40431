To obtain the cDNA sequence encoding fibrinolytic enzyme from Eupolyphaga sinensis and express it in prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression system.

The primers were designed according to the cDNA of other animals'fibrinolytic enzyme. The cDNA sequence was cloned by RT-PCR and 3 RACE.

Sequence analysis revealed that the length of the cDNA fragment was 672 bp and encoded a protein of 224 amino acid residues, the N end amino acid sequence residues was IVGG in accordance with other fibrinolytic enzyme. The cDNA sequence was expressed in E. coli, inactive protein was obtained. While expressed in Pichia pastoris, recombinant protein had fibrinolytic activity.

The cDNA sequence of fibrinolytic enzyme from E. sinensis Walker was cloned and expressed for the first time and it proved a good basis for further functional study of the enzyme.
