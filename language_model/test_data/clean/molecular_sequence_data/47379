Previous studies have shown that the production of extracellular enzymes (pectate lyase [Pel], polygalacturonase [Peh], cellulase [Cel], and protease [Prt]) and harpin(Ecc) (the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction) in Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora is regulated by RsmA, an RNA-binding protein, and rsmB, a regulatory RNA (Rsm stands for regulator of secondary metabolites) (Y. Liu et al., Mol. Microbiol. 29:219-234, 1998). We have cloned and characterized a novel regulatory gene, rsmC, that activates RsmA production and represses extracellular enzyme and harpin(Ecc) production, rsmB transcription, and virulence in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora. In an rsmC knockout mutant of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora Ecc71 carrying the chromosomal copy of the wild-type rsmA(+) allele, the basal levels of Pel, Peh, Cel, Prt, and harpin(Ecc) as well as the amounts of rsmB, pel-1, peh-1, celV, and hrpN(Ecc) transcripts are high, whereas the levels of rsmA transcripts and RsmA protein are low. Furthermore, the expression of an rsmA-lacZ gene fusion is lower in the RsmC(-) mutant than in the RsmC(+) parent. Conversely, the expression of an rsmB-lacZ operon fusion is higher in the RsmC(-) mutant than in the RsmC(+) parent. These observations establish that RsmC negatively regulates rsmB transcription but positively affects RsmA production. Indeed, comparative studies with an RsmC(-) mutant, an RsmA(-) mutant, and an RsmA(-) RsmC(-) double mutant have revealed that the negative effects on exoprotein production and virulence are due to the cumulative regulatory effects of RsmC on rsmA and rsmB. Exoprotein production by the RsmC(-) mutant is partially dependent on the quorum sensing signal, N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone. Southern blot data and analysis of PCR products disclosed the presence of rsmC sequences in E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, E. carotovora subsp. betavasculorum, and E. carotovora subsp. carotovora. These findings collectively support the idea that rsmA and rsmB expression in these plant pathogenic Erwinia species is controlled by RsmC or a functional homolog of RsmC.
