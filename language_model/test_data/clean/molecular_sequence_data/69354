Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) exists as a large number of distinct strains differing in biological properties and with different distributions in citrus producing countries. Strategies such as eradication or cross protection, aimed at controlling severe variants of the pathogen, require procedures to identify virus strains accurately and reliably. To fill the need for a rapid, reproducible assay, we have investigated the use of restriction analysis of the CTV coat protein gene amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The primers 5' ATG GAC GAC GAA ACA AAG 3' and 5' TCA ACG TGT GTT GAA TTT 3' amplified a DNA copy of the CTV coat protein gene (approx. 670 base pairs) when used in a reverse transcriptase PCR assay. Amplifications were carried out using dsRNA prepared from field and indicator plants, or from single-stranded RNA prepared from crude PEG precipitates of intact virions. All 51 CTV isolates tested produced an amplified product of the same size, regardless of country of origin or biological properties. Digestion of the amplified coat protein genes with the restriction enzymes Hinf1 or Rsa1 revealed sequence variation in the PCR products. Hinf1 provided the best discrimination between strains, defining seven Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) groups, some of which circumscribed sets of isolates with similar biological properties. Limited analysis of field isolates using this method showed that individual trees could contain mixtures of CTV strains, as assessed by the recovery of several RFLP types from individual reactions. Single aphid transmissions of isolates usually, but not always, generated apparently pure single strains judged by the recovery of single RFLP groups.
