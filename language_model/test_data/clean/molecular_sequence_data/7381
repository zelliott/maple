The pH 6 antigen of Yersinia pestis is a virulence protein whose gene, psaA, is positively regulated at the transcriptional level by low pH, mammalian temperature, and an upstream locus, psaE. Low pH appears to be required for initial psaA transcription, although increased temperature is necessary for full expression of the gene. In addition, psaA is monocistronic and its transcript has a relatively long 5' nontranslated region.
