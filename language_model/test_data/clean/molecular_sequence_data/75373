Cowpox virus, in contrast to vaccinia virus, can multiply in Chinese hamster ovary cells. To study the genetic basis for this difference in host range, recombinants between vaccinia and cowpox viruses were isolated and their DNA restriction patterns were examined. The ability to multiply in Chinese hamster ovary cells could be correlated with the conservation of cowpox virus sequences mapping at the left end of the genome. This was further demonstrated by marker rescue of the host range phenotype with restricted cowpox virus DNA. Marker rescue with cloned restriction fragments of decreasing size enabled the fine localization of the host range function to a 2.3-kilobase-pair fragment. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that the fragment encoded a single major polypeptide of approximately 77,000 daltons. It is suggested that the role of the host range gene from cowpox virus is to prevent the early and extensive shutoff of protein synthesis that normally occurs in Chinese hamster ovary cells infected by vaccinia virus.
