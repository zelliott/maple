Antibodies to both the C-terminal and the N-terminal regions of the 34 kd serine-threonine specific protein kinase, p34cdc2, were used to study the distribution of this protein in dividing cells and isolated chromosomes of the Indian muntjac. p34cdc2 was found to be present throughout the cytoplasm of dividing cells. In addition, a portion of cellular p34cdc2 was localized to the centrosome, kinetochore, and intercellular bridge and along kinetochore-to-pole microtubules during cell division. Tubulin-denuded metaphase kinetochores retained their association with p34cdc2. The detection of p34cdc2 within a variety of domains of the mitotic apparatus, in addition to the previous reported association with the centrosome [Bailly et al., EMBO J. 8:3985-3995, 1989; Raibowol et al., Cell 57:393-401, 1989] suggests that p34cdc2 may play a role in events associated with anaphases A and B as well as with the transition between interphase and mitosis.
