Two potent integrase inhibitors (IN-Is), raltegravir (RAL, MK-0518) and elvitegravir (EGV, GS-9137), have been shown to be potent inhibitors for HIV-1 and resistance mutations have been identified in HIV-1 clinical trials. In this study, sequences from 11 HIV-2 patients were examined for IN polymorphisms. The primary mutations associated with RAL and EGV resistance were not detected despite the genetic variability among clinical isolates. Our study provides basic information on genotypic susceptibility of HIV-2 to RAL and EGV and supports the suggestion that RAL and EGV could be considered as a new therapeutic option for treating HIV-2-infected patients.
