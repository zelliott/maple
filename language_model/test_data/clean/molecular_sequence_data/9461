In a search for specific molecular markers for population analysis of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) intergenic spacer (IGS) 1 region (rDNA-IGS1, between the 28S and the 5S rDNA genes) was amplified, cloned, and sequenced. It was found to exhibit multiple bands and length polymorphism. Surprisingly, single isolates were found to possess between three to five different IGS1 haplotypes. Bands were cloned and sequenced, and two highly variable regions (α and β) were found between conserved regions, with repeat units interspersed in both types of regions. There were 14 different repeat units, and these were sometimes grouped further into four combinations of repeat units, with a few individual nucleotides (A or C) inserted between the repeats. Among three geographically dispersed isolates, the variable region α was divided into eight types, and the variable region β was divided into two types based on repeat units. Most of the 14 repeat units were shared by the variable and the conserved regions. Among the three isolates, there were a total of 12 IGS1 haplotypes, but some of these were shared between isolates such that there were only eight unique haplotypes. The occurrence of multiple haplotypes within single isolates may be useful for analyzing the population structure, tracking the origin of annual epidemics and providing insights into evolutionary biology of this pathogen.
