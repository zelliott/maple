The catalytic domain of rice (Oryza sativa japonica) granule bound starch synthase I (OsGBSSI-CD) was overexpressed and the three-dimensional structures of the ligand-free and ADP-bound forms were determined. The structures were similar to those reported for bacterial and archaeal glycogen synthases, which belong to glycosyltransferase family 5. They had Rossmann fold N- and C-domains connected by canonical two-hinge peptides, and an interdomain disulfide bond that appears to be conserved in the Poaceae plant family. The presence of three covalent linkages might explain why both OsGBSSI-CD structures adopted only the closed domain arrangement.
