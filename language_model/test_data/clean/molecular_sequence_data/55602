The gene encoding protein p32, the most abundant and immunogenic protein induced by African swine fever virus at early times of infection, has been mapped in the EcoRI C' fragment of the genome of the Vero cell-adapted virus strain BA71V. Sequencing analysis has shown the existence of an open reading frame, named C'204L, encoding 204 amino acids. The protein is phosphorylated in serine residues located in the 115 N-terminal amino acids and was phosphorylated when expressed in cells infected with a vaccinia virus recombinant. Protein p32 is not glycosylated in spite of the presence of two putative N-glycosylation sites in the deduced amino acid sequence of the polypeptide. Immunofluorescence experiments have shown that the protein is localized in the cytoplasm of infected cells and not in the plasma membrane. In addition, the protein has been found in the soluble fraction and not in microsomes from BA71V-infected Vero cells. Low levels of the protein have been detected in the medium from infected swine macrophages, which probably corresponds to nonspecific release of cytoplasmic proteins. The protein encoded by other virus isolates shows different electrophoretic mobilities, indicating variability of p32.
