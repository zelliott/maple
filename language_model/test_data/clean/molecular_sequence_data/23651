To determine if occupancy of interfacial pockets in oligomeric proteins by volatile anesthetic molecules can allosterically regulate oligomerization equilibria, variants of a three-helix bundle peptide able to form higher oligomers were studied with analytical ultracentrifugation, hydrogen exchange and modeling. Halothane shifted the oligomerization equilibria towards the oligomer only in a mutation predicted to create sufficient volume in the hexameric pocket. Other mutations at this residue, predicted to create a too small or too polar pocket, were unaffected by halothane. Inhaled anesthetic modulation of oligomerization interactions is a novel and potentially generalizable biophysical basis for some anesthetic actions.
