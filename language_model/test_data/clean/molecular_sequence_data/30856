Streptomyces griseolus ATCC 11796 contains two inducible, herbicide-metabolizing cytochromes P-450 previously designated P-450SU1 and P-450SU2 (P-450CVA1 and P-450CVB1, respectively, using nomenclature of Nebert et al. [D. W. Nebert, M. Adesnik, M. J. Coon, R. W. Estabrook, F. J. Gonzalez, F. P. Guengerich, I. C. Gunsalus, E. F. Johnson, B. Kemper, W. Levin, I. R. Phillips, R. Sato, and M. R. Waterman, DNA 6:1-11, 1987]). Using antibodies directed against cytochrome P-450SU1, its N-terminal amino acid sequence, and amino acid composition, we cloned the suaC gene encoding cytochrome P-450SU1. Similar information about the cytochrome P-450SU2 protein confirmed that a gene cloned by cross-hybridization to the suaC gene was the subC gene encoding cytochrome P-450SU2. The suaC and subC genes were expressed in Escherichia coli, DNA for both genes was sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequences were compared with that of the well-characterized cytochrome P-450CAM from Pseudomonas putida. Both cytochromes P-450SU1 and P-450SU2 contain several regions of strong similarity with the amino acid sequence of P-450CAM, primarily in regions of the protein responsible for attachment and coordination of the heme prosthetic group.
