Microsatellites, also called simple sequence repeats (SSRs), have yielded an important class of DNA markers most notable for mapping mammalian genomes. To study the occurrence of microsatellites and their inheritance in maize, a search was made of 280 maize GenBank sequences. Six SSRs were chosen and unique flanking primers were designed for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Eight different maize inbreds were studied with these six primer pairs and a mean of 3.5 polymorphic patterns occurred within the expected size range. For five of these putative microsatellites, the segregation in a maize restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping population was analyzed. Four of the microsatellites cosegregated with the Adh1, Gpc1, Pdk1, and Tpi genes from which the primer sequences were derived. The fifth primer pair (MZEGPA1) showed segregating polymorphisms, but the products were larger than expected. To verify the existence of the original SSRs in the segregating PCR products, a CT primer, containing a CT SSR and an arbitrary leader sequence, was used to reamplify these products. The four microsatellites that cosegregated with the original gene were reamplified as anticipated, whereas a suspicious 230-bp product obtained when using the MZEGPA1 primers could not be reamplified. Based on these results it is concluded that microsatellites can be a valuable tool for maize mapping.
