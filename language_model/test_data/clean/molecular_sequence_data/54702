Fragrance in soybean is due to the presence of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP). BADH2 gene coding for betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase has been identified as the candidate gene responsible for fragrance in rice (Oryza sativa L.). In this study, using the RIL population derived from fragrant soybean cultivar "Kaori" and non-fragrant soybean cultivar "Chiang Mai 60" (CM60), STS markers designed from BADH2 homolog were found associating with 2AP production. Genetic mapping demonstrated that QTL position of fragrance and 2AP production coincides with the position of GmBADH2 (Glycine max betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 2). Sequence comparison of GmBADH2 between Kaori and non-fragrant soybeans revealed non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 10. Nucleotide substitution of G to A in the exon results in an amino acid change of glycine (GGC; G) to aspartic acid (GAC; D) in Kaori. The amino acid substitution changes the conserved EGCRLGPIVS motif of GmBADH2, which is essential for functional activity of GmBADH2 protein, to EGCRLDPIVS motif, suggesting that the SNP in GmBADH2 is responsible for the fragrance in Kaori. Five single nucleotide-amplified polymorphism (SNAP) markers which are PCR-based allele specific SNP markers were developed for fragrance based on the SNP in GmBADH2. Two markers specific to A allele produced a band in only Kaori, while three markers specific to G alleles produced a band in only CM60. The simple PCR-based allele specific SNAP markers developed in the present study are useful in marker-assisted breeding of fragrant soybean.
