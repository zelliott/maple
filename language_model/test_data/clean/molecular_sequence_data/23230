From Bacillus megaterium, a genomic region was isolated and structurally characterized which strongly resembles the Bacillus subtilis competence locus comE encoding proteins involved in DNA uptake. Functionality of the B. megaterium comEA gene was proven by complementing a DNA-receptor mutant of B. subtilis. This finding provides first evidence for a latent ability of B. megaterium to develop natural competence, although such physiological state has not as yet been identified in this organism.
