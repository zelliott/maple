Liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha), also referred to as nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 3 is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, and has recently been shown to act as a master transcription factor governing hepatic lipogenesis in mammals. Liver X receptor alpha directly regulates both the expression of other lipogenic transcription factors and the expression of lipogenic enzymes, thereby enhancing hepatic fatty acid synthesis (FASN). In birds, like in humans, fatty acid synthesis primarily occurs in the liver. Whether LXRalpha is involved in hepatic regulation of lipogenic genes remained to be investigated in this species. Here we show that fatty acid synthase and the expression of other lipogenic genes (sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 and steroyl coenzyme A desaturase 1) are induced in chicken hepatoma cells in response to a pharmacological liver X receptor agonist, T0901317. A detailed analysis of the chicken FASN promoter revealed a functional liver X response element. These data define the chicken FASN gene as a direct target of LXRalpha and further expand the role of LXRalpha as a regulator of lipid metabolism in this species.
