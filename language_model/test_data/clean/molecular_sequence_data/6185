Mouse apolipoprotein B mRNA editing protein gene has been isolated and characterized. The amino acid sequences deduced from the exonic sequences of the gene showed 90, 70 and 68% identity to those of rat, human and rabbit, respectively. RNA blotting experiments demonstrated high expression in small intestine especially in the jejunum as a major 2.4 kb mRNA species. mRNA in other tissues including the liver is smaller in amounts and larger in size (3.1 kb) than the intestinal mRNA. The gene spans 12 kb and contains 5 exons and 4 introns. Sequencing of the 5'-flanking region revealed that a canonical TATA box is absent and the consensus recognition sequences for several transcription factors have been identified.
