Very little is known about rhizobia that form nodules on Thermopsis spp. We report the isolation of a Mesorhizobium huakuii strain with a unique nodA gene that form nodules on Thermopsis lupinoides in Kamtchatka, Russia. The isolate did not form nodules on Thermopsis chinensis or Thermopsis caroliniana, which suggests it may be host specific.
