We have developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based procedure to facilitate the selection of recombinant clones. The insert to be cloned is ligated to an antibiotic resistance marker. The ligation product is amplified by PCR, followed by standard cloning procedure into a bacterial vector. The selection for the antibiotic resistance coded by the PCR product ensures 100% insertion frequency, eliminating the screening of the transformants.
