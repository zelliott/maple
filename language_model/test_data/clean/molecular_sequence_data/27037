Virological failure of first-line antiretroviral therapy based on lopinavir boosted with ritonavir (lopinavir/r) has rarely been associated with resistance in protease. We identified a new genotypic resistance pathway in 3 patients who experienced failure of first-line lopinavir/r treatment.

Viral protease and the C-term part of Gag were sequenced. The observed mutations were introduced in a reference strain to investigate impact on protease inhibitor susceptibility and replication capacity.

A detailed longitudinal analysis demonstrated the selection of the M46I+L76V protease mutations in all 3 patients. The L76V conferred a solitary 3.5-fold increase in one-half the maximal inhibitory concentration to lopinavir but severely hampered viral replication. Addition of M46I, which did not confer any lopinavir resistance on its own, had a dual effect. It partly compensated for the loss in replication capacity and increased the one-half maximal inhibitory concentration to above the lower clinical cutoff (11-fold). Analysis of a large clinical database (>180,000 human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] sequences) demonstrated a significant association (Spearman rho, 0.93) between the increased presence of L76V in clinical samples (0.5% in 2000 to 3.4% in 2006) and lopinavir prescription over time.

The HIV protease substitution L76V, in combination with M46I, confers clinically relevant levels of lopinavir resistance and represents a novel resistance pathway to first-line lopinavir/r therapy.
