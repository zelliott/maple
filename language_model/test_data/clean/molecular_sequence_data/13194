We have constructed simian virus 40 minireplicons containing uniquely placed cis,syn-thymine dimers (T <> T) for the analysis of leading- and lagging-strand bypass replication. Assaying for replication in a human cell-free extract through the analysis of full-size labeled product molecules and restriction fragments spanning the T <> T site resulted in the following findings: (i) The primary site of synthesis blockage with T <> T in either the leading or lagging strand was one nucleotide before the lesion. (ii) Replicative bypass of T <> T was detected in both leading and lagging strands. The efficiency of synthesis past T <> T was 22% for leading-strand T <> T and 13% for lagging-strand T <> T. (iii) The lagging-strand T <> T resulted in blocked retrograde synthesis with the replication fork proceeding past the lesion, resulting in daughter molecules containing small gaps (form II' DNA). (iv) With T <> T in the leading-strand template, both the leading and lagging strands were blocked, representing a stalled replication fork. Uncoupling of the concerted synthesis of the two strands of the replication fork was observed, resulting in preferential elongation of the undamaged lagging strand. These data support a model of selective reinitiation downstream from the lesion on lagging strands due to Okazaki synthesis, with no reinitiation close to the damage site on leading strands [Meneghini, R. & Hanawalt, P.C.
