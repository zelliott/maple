In the present study, we used an expression cloning strategy to identify transcription factors that bind specifically to a limited region of the inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) promoter and regulate transcription. Murine thyrotroph embryonic factor (mTEF) was isolated and was shown to bind to a site located at nucleotides -117 to -108 from the transcriptional start site. Transient expression of reporter constructs containing either a consensus TEFRE or the icerTEF binding site demonstrated that TEF-dependent transcription correlated with relative binding affinities, i.e. the consensus TEFRE bound TEF more tightly and was more responsive to TEF than the icerTEFRE. Because the icerTEFRE overlapped a cAMP response element, the responsiveness of these sequences to either cAMP or Ca(2+) was tested. Although TEF expression had no effect on the cAMP-regulated transcriptional response of the ICER promoter, TEF did confer calcium responsiveness to these sequences. Calcium also modestly increased the TEF-mediated transcription from a consensus TEFRE. Additional studies using Ca(2+)-activated kinases indicate that Ca(2+)/TEF/TEFRE-regulated transcription may be mediated through Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK) IV. Moreover, studies with the icerTEFRE in a CaMK IV-deficient cell line demonstrated that these cells were transcriptionally unresponsive to thapsigargin; however, responsiveness was restored by co-expression of the active CaMK IV. These studies are the first to demonstrate that TEF is a calcium-responsive transcription factor, and they suggest that there are two classes of TEF-regulated genes. One class, represented by a consensus TEFRE, is regulated by TEF in the resting cell; the second class, represented by icerTEFRE, is regulated by TEF in the calcium-activated cell.
