Histone H3 mRNAs were found in polyA(+) fractions of total RNA prepared from alfalfa plants, calli and somatic embryos. The sequence analysis of cDNAs revealed the presence of a polyA tail on independent alfalfa H3 mRNAs. A highly conserved sequence motif AAUGAAA identified about 20bp upstream from the 3' ends of the alfalfa H3 cDNAs was suggested to be one of the possible regulatory elements in the 3' end formation and polyadenylation. Three out of the four analysed H3 cDNAs have more than 97% homology with a genomic clone and encode the same protein. While the fourth represents a minor species with only 78.8% homology to the coding region of the genomic clone and encodes a H3 histone with four amino acid replacements. On the basis of compilation analysis we suggest a consensus sequence for plant H3 histones which differs from that of animal's by four amino acid changes.
