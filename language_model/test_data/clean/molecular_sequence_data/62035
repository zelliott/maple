Purified cathepsin L from carp, Cyprinus carpio, consists of a 28 kDa single-chain form that is different from the 24 and 5 kDa mammalian two-chain form. We cloned cathepsin L from carp hepatopancreas. The sequence consisted of a 1490 bp cDNA and a 1014 bp open reading frame, encoding a deduced protein of 337 amino acids that is likely processed to an active enzyme (single-chain form) with 222 amino acids. Its similarity to other types of vertebrate cathepsin L is less than 69%. Mammalian cathepsin L is further processed to a two-chain form, but possibly this is not the case with carp cathepsin L: the P1 site where cleavage occurred in the two-chain form of mammalian cathepsin L contains a serine, while carp cathepsin L processes a valine. Therefore, carp cathepsin L may have a different mechanism of action from mammalian cathepsin L.
