The KEM1 gene is involved in nuclear fusion during conjugation, and chromosome transmission and spindle pole body duplication/or separation during mitotic cell division in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. KEM1 was also independently identified as DST2, SEP1, XRN1 and RAR5 on the basis of DNA strand transferase or exoribonuclease activity in vitro or mutations affecting plasmid stability. To understand the various functions suggested for KEM1 and to identify other genes with functions similar or related to those of KEM1, we have characterized the ROK1 gene which was isolated as a high-copy-number plasmid suppressor of the kem1 null mutation. Sequence analysis of the smallest subclone with the suppression activity revealed an open reading frame of 564 amino acids. The ROK1 aa sequence contains highly conserved domains found in the DEAD protein family of ATP-dependent RNA helicases. ROK1 is essential for viability and is closely linked to KEM1 on chromosome VII.
