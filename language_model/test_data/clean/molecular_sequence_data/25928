The Bacillus subtilis nprE gene lacking its own promoter sequence was inserted in the lactococcal expression vector pMG36e. Upon introduction of the recombinant plasmid into Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strain MG1363, neutral protease activity could be visualized by the appearance of large clearing zones around colonies grown on milk agar plates. By measuring the activities of the neutral protease and the intracellular enzyme lactate dehydrogenase in culture supernatants and cell fractions, it was demonstrated that the neutral protease was actively secreted into the growth medium. This was corroborated by using the Western blot (immunoblot) technique, which showed the presence of the mature form of the neutral protease in the culture supernatant. On the basis of these results, it is concluded that the B. subtilis neutral protease gene was expressed in L. lactis and that the gene product was secreted into the growth medium and was apparently correctly processed to produced a biologically active protein. The secretion of this particular enzyme may be helpful in achieving accelerated cheese ripening.
