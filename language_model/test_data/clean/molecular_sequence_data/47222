The present article reviews the literature relative to VIP- and PHI-containing nerve fibers in the pineal gland of mammals. The article summarizes data on the presence and distribution of the two peptides in the brain of mammals, their role in neuronal metabolism, and the significance and origin of VIPergic and PHIergic cerebrovascular nerve fibers. Special emphasis is placed on VIP- and PHI-containing nerves in the pineal gland. The morphology of the fibers, the nature of the innervation, and the distribution of immunoreactive nerves within the pineal gland are examined. The review discusses the nature of the classical and "central" innervation of the pineal gland. The possible site of origin of pinealopetal VIPergic and PHIergic fibers is investigated, with special reference to ganglia of the head, and particularly to the pterygopalatine, otic, and trigeminal ganglia. The nature of VIP (and PHI) receptors is examined with reference to the most recent acquisitions in the field. Based on the data, a role for VIP (and PHI) in pineal metabolism is discussed.
