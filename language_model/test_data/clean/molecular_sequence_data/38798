Two mouse genes, Mit1/Lb9 and Copg2, linked to Peg1/Mest on mouse chromosome 6, were identified to be imprinted maternally and paternally, respectively. Mit1/Lb9 encoding untranslated transcripts resides within the intron 20 of Copg2. The gene is maternally imprinted in adult mouse brain, partially imprinted in other tissues. Copg240 kb genomic region, being expressed ubiquitously in mouse tissues with a partial imprinting pattern in embryos, neonates, and adult brain in contrast to maternally imprinted human COPG2. In addition, we identified an antisense transcript of Copg2, Copg2AS, which overlaps 3'-UTRs of Copg2 and Peg1/Mest. The Copg2AS transcript is maternally imprinted in embryos, neonates, and adult tissues.
