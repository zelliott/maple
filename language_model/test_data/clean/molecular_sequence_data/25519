Several repetitive DNA families were identified in Entamoeba histolytica DNA digested with Sau3AI. Characterisation of one of these repetitive DNA families showed the presence of multiple copies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) core consensus sequences. The E. histolytica ARS consensus sequences allowed a yeast-integrating plasmid, YIP5, to replicate autonomously in S. cerevisiae. A 'bent DNA' fragment was located in one member of this E. histolytica repetitive DNA family.
