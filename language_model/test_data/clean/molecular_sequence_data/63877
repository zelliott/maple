Previous linkage analyses of intracranial aneurysm (IA) have proposed several genetic susceptibility loci; however, some loci remain contradictory. The objective of this study was to confirm these loci in a Japanese population using allelic and haplotype association analyses. We set high-density single nucleotide polymorphism markers in previously suggested IA loci and conducted an association analysis in 29 cases and 35 controls from a small community in Akita, Japan. Genotyping was carried out using the GeneChip 10 K mapping array, and the association analysis was performed using GeneSpring GT2 software. The result was confirmed in a replication cohort consisting of 237 cases and 253 controls from all over Japan. Only one variant, rs767603, at chromosome 14q23, was significantly associated with IA, both in allelic analysis (p=0.00017, Bonferroni-corrected p=0.021) and haplotype analysis (p=0.00178, Bonferroni-corrected p=0.048). This association was confirmed in the replication cohort (p=0.0046 for allelic association, p=0.0060 for haplotype association). Our findings confirm 14q23 to be a susceptibility locus for intracranial aneurysm.
