The primary sequences of seventeen essential and seventeen regulatory myosin light chains were analyzed and compared, using algorithms based on the different structural properties of their amino acid residues. This process allowed estimation of the structural homology between the proteins studied, and improved the prediction of their mean secondary structure and functionally important segments or residues. On the basis of the crystal structure of troponin C, a model of the myosin essential light chain with a fairly compact form is proposed. The possible sites of interaction between myosin light and heavy chains from rabbit skeletal muscle were also investigated by a complementarity method adapted to helix-rich proteins. Segments 139-149 and 65-75 in the essential light chain and segments 27-37, 67-77 and 97-107 in the regulatory light chain are suggested to constitute some of these sites, as most of them were found to have the features of surface-seeking helices.
