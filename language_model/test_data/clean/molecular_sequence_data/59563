The allelic variation of the hypervariable locus from 3'-untranslated region of apolipoprotein B gene in healthy volunteers from different regions of Ukraine was analysed. Among 396 DNA samples studied, 13 allelic variants were identified with the number of repeats ranging from 29 to 53. The frequency of alleles varied from 0.0013 to 0.3575 with the mean heterozygosity index 77.9%. The investigation of the genetic differences between 4 populations of different regions of Ukraine has been performed. A high level of the polymorphism and a heterozygosity index of APOB locus allow to recommend this polymorphic system as an informative marker for study of genetic structure population and to forensic medical analysis.
