DNA amplification fingerprinting (DAF) is a strategy for genetic typing and mapping that uses one or more very short (> or = 5 nt) arbitrary oligonucleotides to direct the enzymatic amplification of discrete portions of a DNA template resulting in a spectrum of products characteristic of the DNA starting material. Polymorphisms from simple banding patterns are useful as genetic markers while more complex and informative patterns are suitable for DNA fingerprinting. The use of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining can adequately resolve the spectrum of DAF products into detailed and reproducible patterns.
