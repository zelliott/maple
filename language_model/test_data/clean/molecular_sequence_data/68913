Genetic deficiency of adenosine deaminase (ADA) results in varying degrees of immunodeficiency, including neonatal onset severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA- SCID) and milder, later onset immunodeficiency. We have determined the molecular basis of disease in a child from a consanguineous mating with ADA- SCID of clinically and biochemically reduced severity, diagnosed at 15 months of age and characterized by retention of more immunologic function than is typical of the fulminant neonatal onset type. The course was notable for an early predominance of bacterial infections and eosinophilia. In contrast to its absence in most ADA- SCIDs, residual ADA activity (1-2% of normal) could be detected in EBV-transformed B cells. Consistent with the increased residual ADA, excretion of the substrate deoxyadenosine and accumulation of the toxic metabolite deoxyATP were less than seen in ADA- SCID patients with fulminant disease. Sequence analysis of cDNA revealed a G853C transversion, predicting a substitution of proline for arginine at codon 253 (Arg253Pro). The parents were heterozygous and the child was homozygous for the mutation, as shown by sequence analysis of amplified genomic DNA. Transient expression of mutant cDNA in Cos cells revealed an electrophoretically abnormal, more negatively charged ADA with 1-2% of normal activity. These observations are consistent with replacement of positively charged arginine by proline, the lower accumulation of toxic metabolites, and the milder phenotype. By contrast, transient expression of a Gly216Arg mutant cDNA, associated, when homozygous, with neonatal onset ADA-SCID, did not reveal ADA activity. Mutations such as Arg253Pro, which retain residual activity of monomeric ADA, should be dominant for ameliorating the phenotype in patients carrying two different allelic mutations. Identification of additional similar mutations may be significant in evaluating the goals for and efficacy of current trials of gene and gene product replacement.
