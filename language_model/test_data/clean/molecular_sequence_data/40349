A new moderately halophilic, strictly aerobic, Gram-negative bacterium, strain SX15(T), was isolated from hypersaline surface sediment of the southern arm of Great Salt Lake (Utah, USA). The strain grew on a number of carbohydrates and carbohydrate polymers such as xylan, starch, carboxymethyl cellulose and galactomannan. The strain grew at salinities ranging from 2 to 22% NaCl (w/v). Optimal growth occurred in the presence of 7-11% NaCl (w/v) at a temperature of 35°C and a pH of 6.7-8.2. Major whole-cell fatty acids were C16:0 (30.5%), C18:0 (14.8%), C18:1ω7c (13.1%) and C12:0 (7.8%). The G+C content of the DNA was 60 ± 0.5 mol%. By 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain SX15(T) was shown to be affiliated to members of the gammaproteobacterial genus Marinimicrobium with pair wise identity values of 92.9-94.6%. The pheno- and genotypic properties suggest that strain SX15(T) represents a novel species of the genus Marinimicrobium for which the name Marinimicrobium haloxylanilyticum is proposed. The type strain is SX15(T) (= DSM 23100(T) = CCUG 59572(T)).
