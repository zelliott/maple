Group A rotavirus (RVA) is one of the main causes of neonatal calf diarrhea worldwide. RVA strains affecting Argentinean cattle mainly possess combinations of the G6, G10, P[5] and P[11] genotypes. To determine RVA diversity among Argentinean cattle, representative bovine RVA strains detected in diarrheic calves were selected from a survey conducted during 1997-2009. The survey covered the main livestock regions of the country from dairy and beef herds. Different phylogenetic approaches were used to investigate the genetic evolution of RVA strains belonging to the prevalent genotypes. The nucleotide phylogenetic tree showed that all genotypes studied could be divided into several lineages. Argentinean bovine RVA strains were distributed across multiple lineages and most of them were distinct from the lineage containing the vaccine strains. Only the aminoacid phylogenetic tree of G6 RVA strains maintained the same lineages as observed at the nucleotide level, whereas a different clustering pattern was observed for the aminoacid phylogenetic trees of G10, P[5] and P[11] suggesting that the strains are more closely related at the aminoacid level than G6 strains. Association between P[5] and G6(IV), prevalent in beef herd, and between P[11] and G6(III) or G10 (VI and V), prevalent in dairy herds, were found. In addition, Argentinean G6(III), G10, P[5] and P[11] bovine RVA strains grouped together with human strains, highlighting their potential for zoonotic transmission. Phylogenetic studies of RVA circulating in animals raised for consumption and in close contact with humans, such as cattle, contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiology of the RVA infection and evolution.
