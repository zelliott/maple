Discovered by Bridges in the 1930s, lethal (2) giant larvae was the first of more than 27 recessive oncogenes identified in Drosophila, which provides an excellent model to study neoplastic mechanisms due to the fact that homologs of human oncogenes and tumor suppressors have been isolated and most of the complexes and associated pathways are conserved. This review explores the potential of neoplastic studies in Drosophila to help understand the genomic mechanisms of neoplastic development in vertebrates and invertebrates. Starting from neoplasms and genetic mutations, the article introduces the reader to one of the possibilities that the studies on neoplastic mechanisms of oncogenes in Drosophila can provide a great understanding of the developmental progression in both vertebrates and invertebrates.
