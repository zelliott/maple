Three point mutations on the Np(b) allele of the purine nucleoside phosphorylase locus in the mouse have been recovered by male germ cell mutagenesis. The mutants were backcrossed, 12-14 generations, and are designated in increasing order of severity of enzyme deficiency and phenotype: B6-NPE, Met-87 --> Lys; B6-NPF, Ala-228 --> Thr; and B6-NPG, Trp-16 --> Arg. A marked decline in total cell numbers per thymus occurs between 2 and 3 months for the more severe B6-NPF and B6-NPG mutants (35% and 52%, respectively) and by 8 months for the less severe B6-NPE mutation. The thymocyte population is thereafter characterized by a 3- or 8-fold expanded precursor, CD4-CD8- double-negative population and 15% or 55% reduced CD4+CD8+ double-positive cells for the B6-NPF and B6-NPG strains, respectively. Spleen lymphocyte Thy-1+ cells are reduced by 50% and spleen lymphocyte response to T cell mitogen and interleukin 2 is reduced by 80%. Increases of thymocyte dGTP pools of 5- and 2.5-fold for B6-NPF and B6-NPG mutants, respectively, are observed. The purine nucleoside phosphorylase-deficient mouse exhibits age-dependent progressive perturbations in thymocyte differentiation, reduced numbers of thymocytes, and reduced splenic T cell numbers and response. The progressive T cell deficit is similar to the human disorder.
