A comparative proteome analysis was initiated to systematically investigate the physiological response of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) to infection with Ralstonia solanacearum, causal agent of bacterial wilt. Plants of the susceptible tomato recombinant inbred line NHG3 and the resistant NHG13 were either infected or not infected with R. solanacearum and subsequently used for proteome analysis. Two-dimensional isoelectric focussing/sodium dodecyl-sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D IEF/SDS-PAGE) allowed the separation of about 650-690 protein spots per analysis. Twelve proteins were of differential abundance in susceptible plants in response to bacterial infection, while no differences were observed in the resistant genotype. LC-MS/MS analysis of these spots revealed 12 proteins, six of which were annotated as plant and six as bacterial proteins. Among the plant proteins, two represent pathogenesis related (PR) proteins, one stress response protein, one enzyme of carbohydrate and energy metabolism, and one hypothetical protein. A constitutive difference between resistant and susceptible lines was not found.
