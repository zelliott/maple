Two new species of the fungal genus Trichoderma, Trichoderma compactum and Trichoderma yunnanense, isolated from rhizosphere of tobacco in Yunnan Province, China are described based on morphological characters and phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide sequences. Our DNA sequences included the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the rDNA cluster (ITS1 and ITS2), and partial sequences of the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1) and a fragment of the gene coding for endochitinase 42 (ech42). The analyses show that T. compactum belongs to the Harzianum clade, and T. yunnanense belongs to the Hamatum clade.
