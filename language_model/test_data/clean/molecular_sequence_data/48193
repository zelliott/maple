Mice and rats were found to possess class II alcohol dehydrogenases with novel enzymatic and structural properties. A cDNA was isolated from mouse liver and the encoded alcohol dehydrogenase showed high identity (93.1%) with the rat class II alcohol dehydrogenase which stands in contrast to the pronounced overall variability of the class II line. The two heterologously expressed rodent class II enzymes exhibited over 100-fold lower catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) for oxidation of alcohols as compared with other alcohol dehydrogenases and were not saturated with ethanol. Hydride transfer limited the rate of octanol oxidation as indicated by a deuterium isotope effect of 4.8. The mutation P47H improved hydride transfer and turnover rates were increased to the same level as for the human class II enzyme. Michaelis constants for alcohols and aldehydes were decreased while they were increased for the coenzyme. The rodent class II enzymes catalyzed reduction of p-benzoquinone with about the same maximal turnover as for the human form. This activity was not affected by the P47H mutation while a S182T mutation increased the K(m) value for benzoquinone 10-fold. omega-Hydroxy fatty acids were catalyzed extremely slow but functioned as potent inhibitors by binding to the enzyme-NAD(+) complex. All these data indicate that the mammalian class II alcohol dehydrogenase line is divided into two structurally and functionally distinct subgroups.
