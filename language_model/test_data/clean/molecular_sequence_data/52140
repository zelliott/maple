The regulation of the narK gene in Escherichia coli was studied by constructing narK-lacZ gene and operon fusions and analyzing their expression in various mutant strains in response to changes in cell growth conditions. Expression of narK-lacZ was induced 110-fold by a shift to anaerobic growth and a further 8-fold by the presence of nitrate. The fnr gene product mediates this anaerobic response, while nitrate control is mediated by the narL, narX, and narQ gene products. The narX and narQ gene products were shown to sense nitrate independently of one another and could each activate narK expression in a NarL-dependent manner. We provide the first evidence that NarL and FNR interact to ensure optimal expression of narK. IHF and Fis proteins are also required for full activation of narK expression, and their roles in DNA bending are discussed. Finally, the availability of molybdate and iron ions is necessary for optimal narK expression, whereas the availability of nitrite is not. Although the role of the narK gene product in cell metabolism remains uncertain, the pattern of narK gene expression is consistent with a proposed role of NarK in nitrate uptake by the cell for nitrate-linked electron transport.
