Human papillomavirus type 1 (HPV-1) causes plantar warts. On the basis of previously mapped mRNAs and sequence homologies of HPV-1 to other papillomaviruses, we designed oligonucleotide primers and employed the polymerase chain reaction to recover HPV-1 cDNAs from plantar warts. Seven spliced RNA species were characterized, including three not previously detected, and the coding potentials of each were deduced. The most abundant viral mRNA encodes an E1i--E4 protein. One new species is predicted to encode the full-length E2 protein, and another can, theoretically, encode the E2-C or E1-M proteins, three products that regulate mRNA transcription and DNA replication. One RNA species originating from a novel HPV promoter in the upstream regulatory region has the potential to encode the minor capsid protein L2. A newly recognized E5a open reading frame (ORF) is contained in all mRNAs that are polyadenylated at the E-region poly(A) site and also in a putative L2 mRNA. Three distinct species, two of which are derived from the upstream regulatory region promoter, have the potential to encode the L1 protein; the third species also contains the entire coding region of the E1i--E4 protein 5' to the L1 ORF. Both the E1i--E4 mRNA and the potentially bicistronic L1 mRNA are derived from a promoter located in the E7 ORF. We uncovered no evidence of alternatively spliced mRNAs that could account for the multiple, abundant E4 proteins in plantar warts, suggesting that posttranslational modification is mainly responsible for the observed protein heterogeneity.
