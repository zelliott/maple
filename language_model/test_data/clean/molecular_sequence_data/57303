The data on the synthesis of RNA-fragments with endoribonuclease activity were reviewed. In the framework of the hammerhead model refined by Haselof and Gerlach the contribution of certain nucleotides or functional groups in ribozyme catalytic activity and the role of double helices are considered in detail. The design of ribozymes with a certain specificity including the ribozymes with antiviral activity also are discussed.
