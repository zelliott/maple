Using a mouse prostate reconstitution (MPR) model system, strain-specific responses to the ras and myc oncogenes were investigated. When ras + myc were introduced into both the mesenchymal and epithelial compartments of the urogenital sinus, poorly differentiated prostate cancer was produced at a high frequency (> 90%) in inbred C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, under similar conditions, inbred BALB/c MPRs formed benign prostatic hyperplasia that converted to cancer at a low frequency (< 10%). Restricting the oncogenes to the mesenchymal or epithelial compartments revealed that oncogene activities were more pronounced in the mesenchyme of C57BL/6 mice and resulted in elevated transforming growth factor-beta 1 expression along with a severe desmoplastic reaction. Heterologous MPRs composed of BALB/c mesenchyme and C57BL/6 epithelium or vice versa demonstrated that intrinsic properties of BALB/c mesenchyme can arrest the progression of ras + myc-initiated C57BL/6 epithelium from benign hyperplasia to malignant carcinoma.
