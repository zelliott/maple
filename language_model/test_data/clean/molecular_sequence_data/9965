Endonuclease G (Endo G) is a nuclease of prokaryotic lineage found in the mitochondria of vertebrates that has been suggested to play a role in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication. We have isolated and sequenced the entire mouse endo G gene, determined the limits of the mRNA, and mapped the promoter region. The coding sequence of the single copy gene is interrupted by two introns and analysis of the transcripts does not support a model by which more than one Endo G isoform could be produced by alternative splicing. We have also characterized a full-length human Endo G cDNA and comparison at the protein level of the human, bovine, and murine nucleases indicates a high degree of conservation except in the respective mitochondrial targeting signals. Endo G is ubiquitously expressed and the steady-state levels of its mRNA vary by a factor greater than seven between different tissues. The relationship between the mtDNA copy number and Endo G mRNA levels is not strictly proportional but tissues richer in mtDNA have higher amounts of the mRNA and vice versa.
