CGP, a copolymer of aspartate and arginine, serves as a storage compound for nitrogen, carbon and energy in many cyanobacteria. Analysis of available genome sequences from prokaryotes identified ORFs putatively encoding proteins of high similarity to known cyanophycin synthetases and cyanophycinases from cyanobacteria in various strains of bacteria belonging to different phylogenetic taxa and not closely related to cyanobacteria. Genes of CGP metabolism occur in a wide range of bacteria exhibiting diverse metabolic capabilities, including aerobic and anaerobic respiration, fermentation, phototrophy and chemolithoautotrophy. This study identified different groups of cyanophycin synthetases and cyanophycinases, respectively, and proposes a collective terminology for the putative genes and enzymes of cyanophycin metabolism. Among 570 different microbial strains, whose genomes have been partially or completely sequenced and are publicly accessible, we identified 44 prokaryotes which possess a cyanophycin synthetase and are putatively able to synthesize CGP. From these, 31 prokaryotes harbor also a cyanophycinase enabling them to degrade CGP to dipeptides. From the latter, 24 strains possess in addition a dipeptidase necessary to hydrolyze beta-Asp-Arg dipeptides, thereby enabling them to completely utilize CGP. Therefore, CGP seems to have a much wider distribution among prokaryotes than previously recognized. Genes putatively encoding cyanophycin synthetase homologues were not identified in the genomes of Eukarya and Archaea and are therefore obviously only occurring in Eubacteria. In addition, the outcome of this detailed in silico analysis proposes to distinguish 10 different groups of cyanophycin synthetases.
