The hematopoietic growth factors, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), have been cloned, produced in bacteria and yeast, and approved for clinical use in the treatment of neutropenia. Both factors stimulate the proliferation and maturation of neutrophil progenitors and enhance the effector functions of mature cells by interaction with specific receptors on the cell surface. Serum levels of G-CSF correlate inversely with the neutrophil count, suggesting that G-CSF may be the normal homeostatic regulator of the neutrophil count, while GM-CSF is generally undetectable in the serum and appears under normal physiologic conditions to act locally at inflammatory sites. Phase I and II clinical trials with these factors demonstrated minimal toxicity for G-CSF and mild to moderate dose-dependent toxicity for GM-CSF. Recent clinical trials, including double-blind, randomized studies, support a role for these growth factors in the treatment of chronic neutropenias, such as Kostmann's syndrome, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), aplastic anemia, and myelodysplasia, as well as in acute neutropenias, such as cyclic neutropenia, chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, and bone marrow transplantation.
