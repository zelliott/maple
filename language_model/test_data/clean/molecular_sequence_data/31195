We have determined the DNA sequences in the J2-C2 intron of the T cell receptor (TCR) beta gene and analyzed nuclear proteins binding to this region. Previously, we identified two tissue-specific DNase I hypersensitive regions, potential regulatory regions, in the J-C intron. The DNA sequence of the J2-C2 intron revealed that both DNase I hypersensitive regions have similar DNA sequences, suggesting that these regions are evolutionarily conserved. We have also identified tissue-specific nuclear-protein binding regions downstream of the DNase hypersensitive regions. Although transcriptional enhancer activity was not observed in the hypersensitive regions or the adjacent protein binding regions in the J-C intron, our findings suggest that the TCR-beta J-C intron may contain some other type of regulatory element.
