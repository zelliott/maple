The biological functions of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I and II are modulated by a family of IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) in complex IGF-dependent and IGF-independent pathways. For further understanding of the actions of IGFs, some of these binding proteins have been cloned and characterized. We report the molecular cloning of IGFBP-3 cDNA for zebrafish. The tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific expression of IGFBP-3 and the hormonal regulation of its expression have also been determined by comparative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Zebrafish IGFBP-3 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 879 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 293 amino acid residues. Results of this analysis revealed high levels of IGFBP-3 messenger RNA in ovary and fin tissue. Expression of IGFBP-3 mRNA was throughout the entire embryonic development, with the highest level of expression observed at 36 hours after the onset of development. Elevated levels of expression of IGFBP-3 were observed 24 hours after injection with IGF-I and 48 hours with IGF-II or insulin. These results suggest that the expression of IGFBP3 gene might be modulated by IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin.
