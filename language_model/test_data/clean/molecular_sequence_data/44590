The relative importance of secondary structure interactions versus tertiary interactions for stabilising and guiding the folding process is a matter for discussion. Phenomenological models of protein folding assign an important role to local contacts in protein folding and stability. On the other hand, simplistic lattice simulations find that secondary structure is mainly the product of protein compaction and that optimisation of folding speed seems to require small contributions of local contacts to the stability of the folded state. To examine the extent to which secondary structure propensities influence protein folding and stability, we have designed mutations that introduce a strong non-native helical propensity in the first 19 residues of the alpha-spectrin SH3 domain. The mutant proteins have the same three-dimensional structure as the wild-type, but they are less stable and have less co-operative folding transitions. There seems to be a relationship between the non-native helical propensity and the compaction of the denatured state. This suggests that in the denatured ensemble under native conditions there is a significant proportion of compact structures with non-native secondary structures. Our results demonstrate that non-local interactions can overcome strong non-native secondary structure propensities and, more important, that optimisation of folding speed and co-operativity requires the latter to be relatively small.
