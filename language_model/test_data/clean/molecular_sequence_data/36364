Cleavage of a single-stranded DNA fragment by complementary oligonucleotides conjugated to bleomycin A5 has been investigated. The conjugates efficiently cleave the DNA at the GT sequences near the oligonucleotide binding site. The temperature dependence of the reaction and the composition of the degradation products indicate that the oligonucleotide-linked bleomycin attacks the available double-stranded DNA regions within the oligonucleotide-DNA duplex and in the hairpin DNA region in the vicinity of the carrier oligonucleotide binding site.
