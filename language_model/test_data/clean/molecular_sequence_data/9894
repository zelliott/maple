Recent biochemical evidence indicates that protein kinase C (PKC) and G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are involved in olfactory signal termination and desensitization. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to investigate the expression of PKC and GRK genes in olfactory tissue and in isolated olfactory receptor neurons from channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). Sequence analysis of cloned PKC PCR products showed that the alpha, beta, delta, epsilon, and theta isotypes were expressed in olfactory tissue. Sequence analysis of PCR products obtained from isolated olfactory receptor neurons showed that PKC beta and PKC delta were expressed in the receptor cells. A 600-bp GRK PCR product was obtained from isolated olfactory neurons that shared 86% and 92% amino acid sequence identity to the mammalian beta-adrenergic receptor kinase gene products beta ARK1 and beta ARK2, respectively. Go6976, a specific inhibitor of calcium-regulated PKC activity, completely inhibited odorant-stimulated PKC activity in isolated olfactory cilia. This result suggested that odorant-stimulated PKC activity is mediated by the calcium-sensitive PKC beta isotype. Taken together, these results are consistent with the conclusion that PKC beta and beta ARK mediate odorant receptor phosphorylation and olfactory signal termination.
