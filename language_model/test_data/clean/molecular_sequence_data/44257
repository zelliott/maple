A potentially important cross-talk characteristic of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is to inhibit platelet-derived growth factor-induced intracellular calcium rise (Baffy, G., Sharma, K., Shi, W., Ziyadeh, F. N., and Williamson, J. R. (1995) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 210, 378-383) in murine mesangial cells. The present study examined the possible basis for this effect by evaluating the regulation of the type I inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) by TGF-beta. TGF-beta1 down-regulates IP3R protein expression by >90% with maximal and half-maximal effects after 8 and 2 h, respectively. TGF-beta1 also decreased IP3R mRNA expression by 59% after 1 h. Phosphorylation of the IP3R was also demonstrated as early as 15 min after TGF-beta1 exposure. Back phosphorylation assays of IP3R from TGF-beta1-treated mesangial cells with protein kinase A (PKA), indicated that TGF-beta1-induced phosphorylation of the IP3R occurs at similar sites as for PKA. In vitro kinase assays using the known IP3R peptide substrates for PKA, RPSGRRESLTSFGNP and ARRDSVLAAS, demonstrated that TGF-beta1 induces phosphorylation of both peptides (158 and 123% of control values, respectively). TGF-beta1-induced phosphorylation was prevented by the addition of the PKA inhibitor peptide in the in vitro kinase assay. It is proposed that TGF-beta-mediated effects on the IP3R may be an important characteristic of its ability to modulate the response of cells to factors that employ IP3R-mediated calcium release.
