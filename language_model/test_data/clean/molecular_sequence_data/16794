Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and p53 control distinct sets of downstream genes; however, these two antioncogenic transcription factors converge to regulate p21 gene expression and to inhibit tumor formation. Here we investigate the mechanism by which IRF-1 and p53 synergize at the p21 promoter and show that stimulation of p21 transcription by IRF-1 does not require its DNA-binding activity but relies on the ability of IRF-1 to bind the coactivator p300 and to stimulate p53-dependent transcription by an allosteric mechanism. Deletion of the p300-binding sites in IRF-1 eliminates the ability of IRF-1 to stimulate p53 acetylation and associated p53 activity. Complementing this, small peptides derived from the IRF-1-p300 interface can bind to p300, stabilize the binding of p300 to DNA-bound p53, stimulate p53 acetylation in trans, and up-regulate p53-dependent activity from the p21 promoter. The nonacetylatable p53 mutant (p53-6KR) cannot be stimulated by IRF-1, further suggesting that p53 acetylation is the mechanism whereby IRF-1 modifies p53 activity. These data expand the core p300-p53 protein LXXLL and PXXP interface by including an IRF-1-p300 interface as an allosteric modifier of DNA-dependent acetylation of p53 at the p21 promoter.
