The complete nucleotide sequence of the ssRNA genome of a Chinese GPV isolate of barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) was determined. It comprised 5673 nucleotides, and the deduced genome organization resembled that of members of the genus Polerovirus. It was most closely related to cereal yellow dwarf virus-RPV (77% nt identity over the entire genome; coat protein amino acid identity 79%). The GPV isolate also differs in vector specificity from other BYDV strains. Biological properties, phylogenetic analyses and detailed sequence comparisons suggest that GPV should be considered a member of a new species within the genus, and the name Wheat yellow dwarf virus-GPV is proposed.
