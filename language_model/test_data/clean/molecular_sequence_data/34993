Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) is the causal agent of bacterial leaf streak, a devastating disease in rice. Xoc uses a type III secretion (T3S) system, which is encoded by the hrp-hrc-hpa (hypersensitive response and pathogenicity, hrp-conserved and hrp-associated) genes, to inject repertoires of T3S effectors (T3Es) into plant cells. Many of the hrp-hrc-hpa genes have roles in pathogenesis, but the role of hrpE3, which shows homology to hpaE in X. campestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv), is poorly understood. In this study, hrpE3 was shown to be transcribed independent of the hrpD operon, and its expression was dependent on a promoter within hpaB. The expression of hrpE3 was positively regulated by HrpG and HrpX, a finding probably caused by an imperfect plant-inducible promoter (PIP) box (TTCGT-N16 -TTCGA) in the hrpE3 promoter. The secretion of HrpE3 was dependent on T3S, and subcellular localization of HrpE3 was cytoplasmic and nuclear in plant cells. A mutation in hrpE3 reduced the virulence of Xoc by decreasing disease lesion length and bacterial growth in planta. Full virulence was restored to the mutant when Xoc hrpE3, but not Xcv hpaE, was expressed in trans. The differences in transcription, secretion via the T3S system and bacterial virulence in plants were attributed to N-terminal amino acid differences between Xoc HrpE3 and Xcv HpaE. Collectively, the results demonstrate that hrpE3 encodes a T3E protein which is delivered into the plant cell through the T3S system, localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus, and is required for full virulence in rice.
