Galactosyltransferase and alphalactalbumin-like activities have been reported to be present in the post-testicular fluids of the male reproductive tract. In the lactating mammary gland, these activities constitute the lactose synthetase complex. Kinetic parameters and acceptor specificities previously reported, along with recent amino acid sequence analysis argue against the mammary gland and epididymal activities being products of the same gene. In this paper we present cell-free translation of rat epididymal mRNA and Northern blot analysis of epididymal mRNA hybridized with authentic rat alpha-lactalbumin cDNA supporting this lack of identity and describe the differential synthesis and secretion of the androgen-regulated 18 kDa component of the so-called rat epididymal alphalactalbumin-like complex along the length of the epididymis. We conclude that although the 18 kDa component of the so-called epididymal alphalactalbumin moiety (E alpha LA) is capable, in common with a number of unrelated molecules, of modifying galactosyltransferase acceptor specificity in vitro, there is no primary structural similarity between it and authentic rat mammary alphalactalbumin. In view of the fact that the activity of E alpha LA is 1/100th that of authentic milk alphalactalbumin, we suggest that it may not be of physiological importance and that modification of galactosyltransferase activity may not be the function of the 18 kDa molecule.
