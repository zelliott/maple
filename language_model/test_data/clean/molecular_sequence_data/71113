We have isolated a human cDNA for the signaling adapter molecule FRS-2/suc1-associated neurotrophic factor target and shown that it is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation. Importantly, we demonstrate that the phosphotyrosine binding domain of FRS-2 directly binds the Trk receptors at the same phosphotyrosine residue that binds the signaling adapter Shc, suggesting a model in which competitive binding between FRS-2 and Shc regulates differentiation versus proliferation. Consistent with this model, FRS-2 binds Grb-2, Crk, the SH2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatase SH-PTP-2, the cyclin-dependent kinase substrate p13(suc1), and the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of Src, providing a functional link between TrkA, cell cycle, and multiple NGF signaling effectors. Importantly, overexpression of FRS-2 in cells expressing an NGF nonresponsive TrkA receptor mutant reconstitutes the ability of NGF to stop cell cycle progression and to stimulate neuronal differentiation.
