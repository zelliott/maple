The genes and molecular machines that allow for a thermoalkaliphilic lifestyle have not been defined. To address this goal, we report on the improved high-quality draft genome sequence of Caldalkalibacillus thermarum strain TA2.A1, an obligately aerobic bacterium that grows optimally at pH 9.5 and 65 to 70Â°C on a wide variety of carbon and energy sources.
