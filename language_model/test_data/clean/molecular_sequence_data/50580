Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes are candidates for susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). The association of IDDM with particular DR and DQ alleles has been reported in all populations studied, but its association with HLA-DP alleles has been controversial. To address this question we analyzed 19 DPB1 and 2 DPA1 alleles and their associations in well-characterized Sudanese (an admixture of Arab and Black) IDDM patients (n = 71) and ethnically matched controls (n = 86) using polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific oligonucleotide (PCR-SSO) typing. There were no significant differences between the patient and control groups in the DPB1 frequencies. DPB1*0201, *0401 and DPA1*01 were the most frequent alleles in both IDDM patients and control subjects. Significant positive and negative associations between DPB1 and DPA1 alleles were detected in both groups. A novel DPB1 allele included in DPB1*1701 was identified.
