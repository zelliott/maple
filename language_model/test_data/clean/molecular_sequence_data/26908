LinA from Sphingobium japonicum UT26 catalyzes two steps of dehydrochlorination from gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH) to 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-TCDN) via gamma-pentachlorocyclohexene (gamma-PCCH). LinA was crystallized by the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method using PEG 3350 as the precipitant. The crystals belonged to space group P4(1) or P4(3), with unit-cell parameters a = b = 68.9, c = 101.9 A, and diffracted X-rays to 2.25 A resolution. The crystal contained three molecules in the asymmetric unit.
