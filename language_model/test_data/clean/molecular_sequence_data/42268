Human pro-urokinase (pro-UK) gene was engineered for expression in mammalian cells. The stability of recombinant pro-UKs produced by two kinds of cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and human lymphoblastoid Namalwa KJM-1 cells, were compared. The pro-UK expressed in CHO cells in serum-free medium was degraded by cysteine endopeptidase secreted by CHO cells. This endopeptidase was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzonate (PCMB) and leupeptin more efficiently than by aprotinin. On the other hand, the pro-UK expressed in Namalwa KJM-1 cells was not degraded, resulting in the stable production of pro-UK at a rate of 2-3 micrograms/10(6) cells/day by use of a gene amplification method with dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in serum-free medium. Thus, Namalwa KJM-1 cells showed the desired characteristics as a host cell for the production of recombinant proteins. The stability of recombinant proteins in heterologous systems may vary depending on the host cells.
