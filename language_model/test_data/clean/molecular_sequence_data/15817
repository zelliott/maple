A cDNA library from bovine mammary gland mRNA was constructed in pBR322 and screened by hybrid-selected translation and immunoscreening. Several beta-lactoglobulin clones were identified and sequenced. All clones contained cDNA fragments corresponding to the 3' region of beta-lactoglobulin mRNA. The 3' non-translated region of beta-lactoglobulin mRNA consists of 187 nucleotides; the polyadenylation signal AATAAA occurs 17 nucleotides before the poly(A) tail. The amino-acid sequence predicted from the 3' coding region corresponds completely to the previously determined amino-acid sequence of beta-lactoglobulin.
