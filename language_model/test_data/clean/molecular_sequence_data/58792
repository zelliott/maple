Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is a secretory glycoprotein produced by T cells in response to antigenic or mitogenic stimuli. We studied the kinetics of the synthesis, N-glycosylation, and secretion of IFN-gamma in human CD8+ T lymphocytes stimulated via T-cell receptor. Highly elevated IFN-gamma mRNA levels were found as early as 1 h after stimulation. Maximal IFN-gamma protein synthesis was observed 2-4 h after induction and appeared to correlate to steady-state IFN-gamma mRNA levels. As analyzed by pulse/chase experiments, the secretion of IFN-gamma from T cells was very rapid, the secretion half-time being approximately 20-25 min. Inhibition of N-glycosylation by tunicamycin dramatically reduced the expression of IFN-gamma, but did not block its secretion. Natural IFN-gamma is heterogeneously glycosylated and doubly, singly, and unglycosylated forms exist. Experiments performed in a cell-free translation/glycosylation system with mutated IFN-gamma constructs lacking either one of the potential glycosylation sites suggested that Asn25 is more efficiently glycosylated than Asn97. Site-specific oligosaccharide analysis of natural IFN-gamma by glycosidase treatment followed by matrix-assisted-laser-desorption-ionization mass spectrometry revealed considerable variation in the carbohydrate structures, with more than 30 different forms. The glycans at Asn25 consisted of fucosylated, mainly complex-type oligosaccharides, whereas the glycans at Asn97 were more heterogeneous, with hybrid and high-mannose structures. Our results emphasize the essential role of N-linked glycans in the biology of IFN-gamma and show that there is a considerable heterogeneity in the individual sugar chains of this important human cytokine.
