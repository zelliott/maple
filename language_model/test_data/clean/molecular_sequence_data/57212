A series of monoclonal antibodies against p51/p66 human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) were prepared by immunizing mice with the native enzyme immobilized on nitrocellulose. One of these antibodies, designated 1E8, was found to inhibit both RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent polymerase activities of RT but had no effect on the RNase H activity of the enzyme. This inhibition was noncompetitive with respect to primer/template and competitive with respect to deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP). The extent of 1E8 inhibition of RT polymerase activity decreased with increasing concentrations of dNTP in the incubation but was not affected by changes in primer/template concentration. 1E8 bound equally well in solution to both free RT and to the RT-primer/template complex. However, binding to the latter was significantly reduced by the addition of increasing concentrations of dNTP. The ability of dNTP to inhibit the interaction of 1E8 with the RT-primer/template complex was dependent on the identity of the homopolymeric primer/template used; only that dNTP complementary to the template was effective in this respect. 1E8 bound to the p51/p66 reverse transcriptase heterodimer in solution and reacted with both p51 and p66 subunits of reverse transcriptase on Western blots. The antibody is therefore presumed to recognize a linear surface epitope on the enzyme. 1E8 was found to specifically recognize a peptide with the sequence KKDSTKWRK. This sequence corresponds to residues 65-73 of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, a region identified as highly antigenic by several computer algorithms. Two mutations within this sequence have been identified with resistance to 3'-azido,3'-deoxythymidine. We conclude that residues 65-73 of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase may be at or near the polymerase active site of the enzyme, and may form part of the deoxynucleoside triphosphate binding domain of the enzyme.
