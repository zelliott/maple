The glycogen-binding (G) subunit of protein phosphatase-1G is phosphorylated stoichiometrically by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), and with a greater catalytic efficiency than glycogen synthase, but only after prior phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (A-kinase) at site 1. The residues phosphorylated are the first two serines in the sequence AIFKPGFSPQPSRRGS-, while the C-terminal serine (site 1) is one of the two residues phosphorylated by A-kinase. These findings demonstrate that (i) the G subunit undergoes multisite phosphorylation in vitro; (ii) phosphorylation by GSK3 requires the presence of a C-terminal phosphoserine residue; (iii) GSK3 can synergise with protein kinases other than casein kinase-2.
