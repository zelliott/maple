We present an evolutionary analysis of 13 species of Sarcocystis, including 4 newly sequenced species with ruminants as their intermediate host, based on complete small subunit rDNA sequences. Those species with ruminants as their intermediate host form a well-supported clade, and there are at least two major clades within this group, one containing those species forming microcysts and with dogs as their definitive host and the other containing those species forming macrocysts and with cats as their definitive host. Those species with nonruminants as their intermediate host form the paraphyletic sister group to these clades. Most of the species have considerable genotypic differences (differing in more than 100 nucleotide positions), except for S. buffalonis and S. hirsuta. There is a large suite of genotypic differences indicating that those species infecting ruminant and nonruminant hosts have had very different evolutionary histories, and similarly for the felid- and canid-infecting species. Furthermore, the rDNA sequences that represent the different structural regions of the rRNA molecule have very different genotypic behavior within Sarcocystis. The evolution of these regions should be functionally constrained, and their differences can be explained in terms of the importance of the nucleotide sequences to their functions.
