Sera collected from 46 swine farms in Zhejiang province were evaluated for the presence of antibodies to PCV2 using an indirect-fluorescent antibody procedure. In addition PCV2 isolated from superficial inguinal lymph node samples collected from 40-to 90-day-old pigs with clinical signs of post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) using the PK-15 cell line were sequenced and compared. Overall seroprevalence of PCV2 antibody averaged 58.34% for all samples. Breakdown of serology by groups was as follows: 59.38% for sows, 57.41% for post-weaning piglets, 44.83% for Landrace sows and 64.28% for Landrace piglets. The seroprevalence of Landrace sows was higher than that of Yorkshire and Duroc sows, but non-significant (p > 0.05). Serological analysis also showed that seroprevalence of PCV2 antibody was a negative correlation to that of PRRSV antibody. The complete genomes of five PCV2 isolates identified in the herds with PMWS consisted of 1767nt, containing the 11 potential ORFs. Genome of the virus isolates shared 93.8% to 99.8% identity with PCV2 reference strains from GenBank, 76.6% to 77.9% identity with PCV1. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that there were two subgenotypes within PCV2: subgenotype I (1767 nt) and subgenotype II (1768 nt).
