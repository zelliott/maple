Recently a novel family of putative nitric oxide synthases, with AtNOS1, the plant member implicated in NO production, has been described. Here we present experimental evidence that a mammalian ortholog of AtNOS1 protein functions in the cellular context of mitochondria. The expression data suggest that a candidate for mammalian mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase contributes to multiple physiological processes during embryogenesis, which may include roles in liver haematopoesis and bone development.
