Three half ATP-binding cassette transporters (ALDP, ALDR, PMP70) are known to be present in the human peroxisome membrane. Mutations in the gene encoding ALDP cause X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy; the role of ALDR and PMP70 in human disease is unclear. We report the cloning and characterization of a fourth human gene encoding a peroxisomal half ABC transporter. The gene, designated P70R, maps to chromosome 14q24, encodes a 73 kDa transporter most similar to PMP70, and is expressed in all human tissues examined. Because half ABC transporters heterodimerize to form functional transporters, the identification of a fourth member of this family in the peroxisome membrane has implications for our understanding of mammalian peroxisomes and the genetic disorders of peroxisomal function.
