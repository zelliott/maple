The venoms of the Naja species are known to be cytotoxic. This toxicity has been attributed to the presence of small nonenzymatic polypeptides of 60 amino acid residues, designated as cardiotoxins or cytotoxins. We investigated the cytotoxic potency of Naja nigricollis venom fractions and isolated another type of cytotoxic component which is even more potent than cardiotoxins. This cytotoxic compound, which was designated as nigexine, was purified to homogeneity and its amino acid sequence was determined. Nigexine is a basic phospholipase A2 consisting of a single chain of 118 amino acids. A detailed investigation of the cytotoxic effects on epithelial FL cells, C-13T neuroblastoma cells, and promyelocytic leukemia HL 60 cells revealed that nigexine not only altered cell viability but also prevented cell proliferation. This is a property that was specific to nigexine since other phospholipases A2 from various sources had no detectable cytotoxic activity. The cytotoxic activity of nigexine was not dependent on the presence of divalent cations, unlike its enzymatic activity. In particular, the cytotoxic activity of nigexine was identical in the presence or absence of either 2 mM Ca2+ or Sr2+, or 6 mM EDTA. We also present evidence based on chemical modifications that cytotoxic activity was not correlated with enzymatic activity. Thus, modification with parabromophenacyl bromide totally abolished the enzymatic activity of nigexine, which nevertheless retained 6-20% of the cytotoxicity of native nigexine. Conversely, treatment with cyanogen bromide gave a compound that retained 7% of the enzymatic activity of the parent molecule but was devoid of detectable cytotoxicity.
