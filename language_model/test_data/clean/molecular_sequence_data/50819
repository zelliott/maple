The super induction of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT), has been implicated in the cytotoxic response of human solid tumors to the bis(ethyl)polyamines. The SSAT response is a phenotype specific response and is modulated at the level of increased steady-state mRNA levels and enzyme protein. The human genomic region (4,095 bases) containing the coding sequence of SSAT has been cloned and localized to the Xp22.1 region. Primer extension analysis indicates the transcription of SSAT starts 179 bases upstream from the translational start site and appears to be under the control of a "TATA-less" promoter. The availability of this human clone will facilitate the direct functional examination of the SSAT gene.
