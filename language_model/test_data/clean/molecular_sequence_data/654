Protein arginine methylation is found in many nucleic acid binding proteins affecting numerous cellular functions. In this study we identified methylarginine-containing proteins in HeLa cell extracts by two-dimensional electrophoresis and immunoblotting with a methylarginine-specific antibody. Protein spots with matched protein stain and blotting signals were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The identities of 12 protein spots as 11 different proteins were suggested. Known methylarginine-containing proteins such as hnRNP A2/B1, hnRNP A1, hnRNP G and FUS were identified, indicating the feasibility of our approach. However, four highly abundant metabolic enzymes that might co-electrophorese with methylarginine-containing proteins were also identified. Other nucleic acid binding proteins hnRNP M, hnRNP I and NonO protein were identified. Recombinant hnRNP M and a peptide with the RGG sequence in hnRNP M could be further methylated in vitro. The immunoblotting results of immunoprecipitated hnRNP I and NonO protein are consistent with arginine methylation in both proteins. In this study we identified methylarginine-containing proteins in HeLa cells through proteomic approaches and the method is fast and robust for further applications.
