We have molecularly cloned and sequenced the mouse alpha-2-macroglobulin receptor cDNA. The cDNA contained 14849 bases with one large open reading frame of 4545 codons which is one more than in the corresponding human cDNA. Comparison of the predicted mouse and human receptor proteins revealed the very conserved nature of this receptor with an overall amino acid identity of more than 97%. A dramatic example of this is the presence of 331 cysteine residues predicted in the mouse protein, of which 327 are positionally conserved relative to human.
