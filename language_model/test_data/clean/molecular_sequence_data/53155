Although ftsE and ftsX are not universally present in bacteria, they are present in various Neisseria species as determined by Southern hybridization. The ftsE and ftsX genes of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng) CH811 were cloned, sequenced and were shown to be co-transcribed from two promoters (P(E)1 and P(E)2) which were identified upstream of ftsE(Ng) by primer extension. Sequence analysis of FtsE(Ng) and alignment with other FtsE indicated that it contained the conserved motifs of ABC domains while sequence alignment of FtsX(Ng) with other published FtsX sequences predicted that they all contain four transmembrane segments and a conserved motif (Leu-hydrophobic aa-Gly-Ala/Gly) which may prove to be important for FtsX function. The viability of ftsE(Ng) and ftsX(Ng) mutants that were constructed by insertional inactivation indicated that these genes are not essential. The role of FtsE and FtsX is controversial. Analysis of ftsE(Ng) and ftsX(Ng) mutants by transmission electron microscopy showed that both exhibited morphological abnormalities indicative of defective division sites and in some cases aberrant condensation of DNA.
