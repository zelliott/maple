The mRNA differential display method was applied to identify banana genes that were regulated by salicylic acid (SA) during chilling stress. Eighteen cDNA fragments induced by SA during chilling stress were retracted. Seven of them were affirmed by reverse Northern hybridization to be significantly induced. Two most differential fragments (G and A) of them were cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that clone G fragment had 92% homology to partial cDNA sequences of two cold-related genes in soybean (Glycine max) and clone A did not show any identity to previously reported sequences in GenBank database.
