Although the induction of antibodies and T cells by synthetic peptides representing defined antigenic determinants is a routine laboratory procedure, their use as vaccines has not yet been generally realised. There are a number of reasons for this and paramount is the limitation of valency which affects not only immunogenicity, but also the coverage of the antigenic universe. This paper is a review of our own work in which we have assembled synthetic peptides into multivalent artificial proteins and then examined their immunological properties.
