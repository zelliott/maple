Two apyrases having different substrate specificity, MP67 and MpAPY2, are present in Mimosa pudica. The substrate specificity of MP67 is quite high against ADP, and is distinct from any other apyrase. This might be attributed to the nucleotide binding motif (DXG) in apyrase conserved region 1. We performed a single amino acid substitution at position X in the motif. The ratio of the velocity of ATP/ADP hydrolysis was higher (approximately 1) for the S63A-MP67 mutant than for wild type-MP67 (0.19). Binding affinity for ADP of A75S-MpAPY2 mutant was increased to a level higher than that of the wild type MpAPY2. Thus, the residue at position X in the DXG motif plays an important role in determining nucleotide preference.
