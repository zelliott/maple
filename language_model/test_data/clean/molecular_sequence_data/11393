Apolipoprotein E (apoE) polymorphism and its influence on plasma lipids, lipoproteins, lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] and apolipoproteins was studied in 536 (270 males and 266 females) healthy Chinese in Singapore. From analysis of variance with age and BMI as covariates, apoE genotype was found to exert a significant influence on plasma total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apoB in females. Its effect in males was marginally significant only on LDL-C. In both sexes, plasma TC, LDL-C and apoB were lower in those who were E2-3 than in those who were E3-3. There was no significant difference in log-transformed Lp(a) level between the apoE genotypes after adjusting for the confounding effect of LDL-C in addition to age and BMI. The percentage variance (R2 x 100) of the lipid traits explained by apoE polymorphism in the females was 4.94% for plasma TC, 5.85% for LDL-C and 4.25% for apoB. We conclude that: 1) epsilon 2 allele had a lowering effect on plasma TC, LDL-C and apoB; 2) apoE polymorphism did not have any significant influence on Lp(a) concentration; and 3) the effect of apoE polymorphism on plasma TC, LDL-C and apoB was gender-specific, with a stronger influence in females than in males.
