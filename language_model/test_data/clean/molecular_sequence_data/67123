One hundred and two faecal samples were collected from calves diagnosed with rotavirus infection, in the southern region of Ireland, from 2002 to 2004. Ninety one percent (n=93) were confirmed positive for rotavirus, using latex agglutination and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. Determination of the G- and P-types was carried out using nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (nRT-PCR). G6 was the most prevalent genotype, accounting for 80.6% (75/93), G10 accounted for 6.5% (6/93) and G6G10 mixed types accounted for 9.7% (9/93) of the collection. Rotavirus in three of the samples (3.2%) could not be characterised with any of the five G-specific primers used in this study. A subset of the positive samples (n=54) was examined for their P-type specificities, P[5] and P[11] accounted for 77.8% (42/54), and 9.3% (5/54), respectively. One P[1] genotype (1.9%) was found in the collection. P[5] and P[11] mixed genotypes accounted for 11% (6/54) of the study. The genotypes corresponded to the UK-like strain (G6P[5]) 57.4%, KN4-like strain (G6[P11]) 7.4%, B223-like strain (G10P[11]) and NCDV-like strain (G6P[1]) 1.9% each. The unusual combination of G10P[5] accounted for 7.4%, with mixed infections G6+G10P[5] and G6P[5]+P[11] representing 13% and 11%, respectively. This is the first time that the G- and P-types of bovine rotaviruses (BRVs) have been determined in Ireland, and this study contributes to a better understanding of the epidemiology of such viruses circulating in Ireland.
