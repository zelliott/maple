Differential screening of a subtracted cDNA library led to the detection of two distinct but homologous mouse cDNA, called CTLA-2 alpha and CTLA-2 beta. The corresponding transcripts have a tissue distribution restricted to T lymphocytes, where they are inducible upon activation, and to mast cells. The open-frame regions of both cDNA encode proteins homologous to cysteine proteinase precursors, remarkably, however, only to the proregion of these. The ctla-2 alpha and ctla-2 beta genes both map to the C1 band of mouse chromosome 13. Sequence comparisons suggest that the proregion of an ancestor proteinase gene evolved to the ctla-2 genes by successive duplications, first to autonomy, then to amplification. These results raise the question of the possible role of cysteine proteinase proregions, of cysteine proteinases themselves and of inhibitors thereof in activated T lymphocytes; from a different point of view, they also show that some protease proregions may have evolved as autonomous modules.
