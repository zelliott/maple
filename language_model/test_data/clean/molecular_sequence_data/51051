We prepared a novel rat mAb specific for CD45 molecules bearing the epitope coded for by the alternative exon 6 of the murine CD45 gene (CD45RC). Together with available mAbs to alternative exon 4- and 5-dependent epitopes (CD45RA and CD45RB respectively), we found that the three alternative exons show differential expressions on murine lymphocytes. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that although B cells were homogeneously CD45RA+B+C+, the CD4+ T cells clearly included two populations, CD45RA-B+C- and CD45RA-B+C+. The CD8+ T cells were separated into CD45RA-B+C+ and CD45RA+B+C+ populations. Such features of epitope expression on the cell surface correlate well with message levels of corresponding alternative exons. In the CD4+ T cells, messages of alternative exons were associated with either one or two exon forms of the CD45 transcript. In CD8+ T cells, there were transcripts with one, two, or three alternative exons. When stimulated by an immobilized CD3 mAb, the CD45RC+CD4+ T cell subset preferentially secreted IL-2 and CD45RC-CD4+ T cells produced IL-4. Upon stimulation with concanavalin A, CD45RC-CD4+ T cells converted to CD45RC+ cells, and the level of CD45RC expression on the CD45RC+CD4+ T cell subset was up-regulated. These changes were unidirectional and irreversible. Therefore, differential expression of CD45RC probably delineates the functional heterogeneity of murine CD4+ T cells that is associated with the stages of CD4+ T cell maturation or activation.
