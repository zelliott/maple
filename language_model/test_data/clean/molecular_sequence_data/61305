The human OZF gene (ZNF146), located in chromosome band 19q13.1, is amplified and overexpressed in pancreatic carcinomas. It encodes a protein consisting solely of ten Krüppel zinc finger motifs. We report here the isolation and the characterization of the murine OZF cDNA (Zfp146). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences between murine, human and bovine cDNAs revealed a strong identity (95%). A closely related gene, Zfp260, was also isolated and characterized. It encodes a putative protein consisting of three vestigial zinc finger motifs followed by ten Krüppel zinc fingers sharing 79% identity and no gap insertion with the Zfp146 zinc fingers. In vitro transcription/translation of both genes led to synthesis of proteins of the predicted size. Co-expression was observed at the mRNA level in eight adult mouse tissues. Two-color FISH revealed co-localization of both genes on mouse chromosome 7 (band B1-B3). The co-expression and co-localization of Zfp146 and Zfp260 together with the close similarity of their zinc finger domains, suggests that both participate in the same regulatory pathway.
