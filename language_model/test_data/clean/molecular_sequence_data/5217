Species-specific repeated DNAs are important for identifying genomic components of hybrid organisms in plant breeding and in taxonomic studies, and we have previously described the HRS60 and GRS families of highly repetitive DNA sequences in tobacco. Here we describe a new family of highly repetitive DNA sequences termed NTRS (SspI family) that we have isolated from Nicotiana tomentosiformis (Goodspeed) and characterized and that is specific for the genomes of several species of the subgenus Tabacum. In situ hybridization showed that NTRS sequences are present in three pairs of chromosomes of N. tomentosiformis, six pairs of chromosomes of N. kawakamii, and only one pair of chromosomes of N. tabacum at an intercalary site. The NTRS family is not present in the N. otophora genome. The majority of NTRS sequences appeared to be organized in tandem arrays in which local DNA structures sensitive to single strand-specific chemical probes, potassium permanganate, and osmium tetroxide complexed with pyridine revealed a periodicity of 220 bp, equal to the length of the repeat unit. The inner cytosine in CCGG and CC(A/T)GG sequences of the NTRS family is frequently methylated. Cloned and sequenced NTRS monomeric units are 212-219 bp in length and show 83.5%-95% mutual homology. They exhibit properties characteristic for molecules that possess stable intrinsic curvature, but there are differences among individual monomers in the degree of curvature. NTRS sequences like HRS60 and GRS sequences, were found to specify nucleosome positions.
