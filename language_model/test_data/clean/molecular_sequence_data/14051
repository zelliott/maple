The activity of haemagglutinins in plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum was measured under different culture conditions. The activity was markedly increased when the plasmodia were incubated in a non-nutrient salt medium. During starvation, significant amounts of haemagglutinins were found in the slime layer on the surface of the plasmodia. An increase in activity was not observed in the presence of actinomycin D or cycloheximide. Under starvation conditions, plasmodia are known to differentiate into either sclerotia (spherules) or fruiting bodies. Acceleration of haemagglutinin synthesis, however, was not always observed during spherulation and fruiting-body formation. Attempts to detect endogenous glycoconjugates that bind to the haemagglutinins were unsuccessful but we found that the haemagglutinins could bind to acidic polysaccharides produced by Escherichia coli K12. The bacterial glycoconjugates were purified and partially characterized. They contained N-acetylhexosamine residues which appeared to be important for binding with the haemagglutinins. It is possible that the haemagglutinins play a physiological role in the interaction with these organisms.
