Tachykinin is one of the most well-known bioactive peptides found in vertebrates, and tachykinin-related peptides have also been isolated from various invertebrate species. Urechistachykinin I (Leu-Arg-Gln-Ser-Gln-Phe-Val-Gly-Ser-Arg-NH(2)) and II (Ala-Ala-Gly-Met-Gly-Phe-Phe-Gly-Ala-Arg-NH(2)) were purified from the ventral nerve cords of echiuroid worm, Urechis unicinctus. In the present study, we described the characterization of a novel cDNA encoding the urechistachykinin precursor. Amino acid sequence analysis of the deduced polypeptide revealed that the urechistachykinin precursor included seven structurally related peptides, unlike mammalian tachykinin precursors which encode only one or two tachykinin peptides. This is the first identification of an invertebrate tachykinin-related peptide cDNA.
