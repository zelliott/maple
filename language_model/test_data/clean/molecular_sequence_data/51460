Four malto-oligosaccharides (dp 2-5), each with a 4,6-O-ethylidene group on the glucosyl unit at the non-reducing terminus, were synthesised and used to prove that the maltose-binding protein (MBP) of E. coli is a closed-groove binder. alpha-D-Glucosylation of 3-azibutyl 1-thio-alpha-D-(6-3H)glucopyranoside yielded a 3H-labelled, photolabile 1-thiomaltoside derivative that was used to chemically modify the binding site of MBP. The 3H-labelled peptide containing 83% of the total radioactivity, which was isolated after tryptic cleavage of the modified MBP and sequenced, is part of the closed end of the MBP groove.
