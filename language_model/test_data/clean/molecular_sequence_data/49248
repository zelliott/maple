Progressive rod-cone degeneration (prcd) is a canine retinal disease that maps to the centromeric end of CFA9 in a region of synteny with the distal part of HSA17q. As such, prcd has been postulated as the only animal model of RP17, a human retinitis pigmentosa locus that maps to 17q22. In an effort to establish more detailed regions of synteny between dog CFA9 and the HSA17q-ter region, we created a robust gene-enriched CFA9-RH08(3000) map with 34 gene-based markers and 12 microsatellites, with the highest resolution and number of markers for the centromeric end of CFA9. Furthermore, we built an approximately 1.5-Mb physical map containing both GRB2 and GALK1, genes so far identified by meiotic linkage analysis as being closest to the prcd locus, and generated about 1.2 Mb low-pass (3.2x) canine sequence. Canine to human comparative sequence analysis identified 49 transcripts that had been previously mapped to the HSA17q25 region. The generated low-pass canine sequence was annotated with a working draft of human sequence from HSA17q25, and we used this scaffold to order and orient the canine sequence against human. This order and orientation are preliminary, as high-throughput genomic sequencing of HSA17q-ter has not been fully completed.
