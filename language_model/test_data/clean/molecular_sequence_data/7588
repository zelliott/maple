Several dominant T-cell receptors of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones specific for FBL-3 tumor antigen were clonally amplified in mixed lymphocyte tumor cell cultures derived from an individual immune mouse. Every CTL clone analyzed had a common specificity for a single epitope in the precursor to cell membrane-associated nonstructural gag-encoded protein, Pr75gag, which can be minimally identified by nine amino acid residues, SIVLCCLCL. This epitope is located within the hydrophobic signal sequence motif that mediates translocation of the protein into the endoplasmic reticulum. These novel observations suggest that expression of Pr75gag in FBL-3 tumor cells led to the amplification of CTLs which recognize the signal sequence of the nonstructural gag-encoded glycoprotein precursor.
