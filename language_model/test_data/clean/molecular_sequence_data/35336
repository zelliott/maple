Human parechoviruses (HPeVs) have recently been recognized as important viral pathogens causing sepsis-like illness and meningitis in children, but the data on these infections in Korea is limited. Klassevirus is emerging as a novel etiologic agent of acute gastroenteritis, but its role in meningitis remains unclear.

To understand the epidemiology of HPeVs and klassevirus in sepsis-like illness and meningitis through the detection and typing of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples.

One hundred and eighty-three CSF samples collected from 183 patients ranging in the age group 1 day to 15 years were tested by using a RT-PCR assay for HPeV, EV and klassevirus. Amplification products of the VP3/VP1 and 3D region of the HPeV, and VP1 region of the EV were sequenced to identify the type.

A total of 12 HPeV positive samples (6.5%) were detected from 183 CSF samples and all the samples were typed as HPeV-3. EVs were detected in 39 patients (21.3%) in which echovirus 25 and CVA6 were frequently detected, but mixed infection of HPeV-3 and EV was not observed. Klassevirus was not detected in the study population. Most of the HPeV-3 positive patients were under 3 months of age. HPeV-3 infection was detected mostly in the summer season. The VP3/VP1 gene of the 12 Korean strains clustered most closely to the Japan strain (AB759192) and the 3D gene of the Korean strains also clustered to the Japan strain, which showed no evidence of recombination.

To our knowledge, this is the first report on the detection of HPeV-3 from CSF samples in Korea, which suggests the necessity of routine screening for this virus in young infants with sepsis-like illness and meningitis.
