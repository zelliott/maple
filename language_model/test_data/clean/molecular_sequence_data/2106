The 21-kbp mitochondrial chromosome of the stp-ruv strain of Neurospora crassa undergoes regional amplification yielding plasmid-like supercoiled circles varying in size from subunit length to very high multimers. A comparison of the base sequence of the five plasmids studied, with the region of the chromosome from which they were derived, indicated that the amplified chromosomal segments were determined by a recombination-excision process near or within two structurally distinctive regions. One of these, consisting of nearly uninterrupted strings of Cs and Gs straddling tandem PstI site direct repeats, could form an extended hairpin loop with only a few mismatches. It was found at or near the 5' exchange point of all of the plasmids. An extended 35-bp sequence containing 17-bp direct repeats was the primary 3' site of exchange. Base sequence changes were found in the vicinity of exchange points. Most notable of these was a G insertion and T to C transition within a section of the 5' region likely to form a hairpin loop, suggesting the involvement of a mismatch repair-like mechanism in the recombination process. The sequence, TATATAGACATATA, was identified as a likely candidate for the site of replication initiation. A nearly identical sequence was found common to all of the corresponding plasmids of Podospora anserina and was reported near the presumed replication origin of the Drosophila yakuba mitochondrial chromosome. A search of GenBank revealed a remarkable association of the consensus sequence, TATATAGAXATATA, with the plus strand of organelle DNA.
