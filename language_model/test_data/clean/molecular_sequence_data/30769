Lysine vasopressin- and oxytocin-encoding mRNAs have been analysed in the developing hypothalamus of the pig. The two hormone-encoding mRNAs were first detectable on fetal day 49 by Northern blot analysis. Whereas RNase mapping revealed identical transcripts throughout the developmental stages studied, Northern blots showed that the early transcripts appeared to be shorter (by 100-200 nucleotides) and more heterogeneous in size than those of later stages. This developmentally related length polymorphism was shown to be due to different poly(A) lengths and was abolished by removal of the poly(A) tails with RNase H. These results indicate that maturation of neurones in the developing porcine hypothalamus is accompanied by an increase in length of the poly(A) tail of vasopressin and oxytocin mRNAs.
