Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a pleiotropic lymphokine which plays an important role in the immune system by regulating proliferation and differentiation of a wide variety of lymphoid and myeloid cells. These biological effects are manifested via binding of IL-4 to specific membrane-associated high affinity receptors. While the IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) cDNA expresses high affinity binding sites when transfected in COS7 cells, its intracellular domain lacks consensus motifs for known signal transducing molecules such as a tyrosine kinase. In this study, we use a DNA deletion approach to explore the mechanism of signal transduction utilized by the human IL-4R cDNA expressed in a murine pro-B cell line, Ba/F3 cells. Using this system, we have identified the critical region of the cytoplasmic domain of human IL-4R for human IL-4-induced transduction of a growth signal in these cells. Our data indicate that the critical region for signal transduction is located between amino acid residues 433-473 numbering from the carboxyl terminus. This region is highly conserved between mouse and human IL-4R but lacks homology with other cytokine receptors. Our studies additionally demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain is not essential for forming high affinity IL-4-binding sites nor for ligand internalization.
