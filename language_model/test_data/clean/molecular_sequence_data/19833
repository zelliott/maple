To explore the method of synthesizing the A beta(1-15) multiple antigen peptide (MAP) vaccine and to identify its quality and the immunological activity.

MAP A beta(1-15) was synthesized by indirect conjugation and analyzed by RP-HPLC,SDA-PAGE and amino acid analysis. Then, C57BL/6 mice were immunized with synthesized MAP A beta(1-15). The specific anti-A beta antibody in the sera of the immunized mice was identified by ELSA.

There was a high and wide peak wave in the RP-HPLC chromatogram. The 8 protein bands identified by SDA-PAGE was identical with 1 to 8 branch of MAP A beta(1-15). The amino acid sequence of synthesized MAP A beta(1-15) was almost similar with the standard. High titer of anti A beta antibody was obtained in the C57BL/6 mice immunized with MAP A beta(1-15).

MAP A beta(1-15) could be synthesized successfully by indirect conjugation and the synthesized MAP A beta(1-15) had satisfactory immune activity. But the purification of the synthesized complex remained to be a problem.
