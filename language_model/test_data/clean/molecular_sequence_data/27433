The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a member of the genus Alphavirus that is transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes. In 2005 and 2006, the Indian Ocean island of La RÃ©union was hit with an unprecedented CHIKV fever outbreak that infected 300 000 people. In the present study, we describe the evaluation of real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (RT-NASBA) for the detection of CHIKV in clinical samples. A co-extracted and co-amplified chimerical CHIKV RNA sequence was used as an internal control to eliminate false-negative results. The detection threshold of the assay was determined from quantified CHIKV-positive plasma, and estimated to be 200 copies per NASBA reaction. The specificity of the assay was determined using blast analyses and non-cross-reactivity using an O'nyong-nyong virus culture and 250 CHIKV RT-PCR-negative plasma samples. A 100 % specificity was found and no invalid result was obtained, showing the good quality of the nucleic acid extraction. The assay was then evaluated using 252 CHIKV-positive RT-PCR plasma samples. The samples were all tested positive, including those with low viral load. This evaluation showed that the RT-NASBA is a rapid (5 h from sample nucleic acid extraction to detection), sensitive, specific and reliable method for the routine diagnosis of CHIKV in clinical samples.
