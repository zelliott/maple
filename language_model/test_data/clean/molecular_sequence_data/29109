Methodologies for rapidly identifying cellular protein interactions resulting in posttranslational modification of one of the partners are lacking. Here, we select for substrates of the v-abl tyrosine kinase from two protein display libraries in which the protein is covalently linked to its encoding mRNA. Successive selection cycles from a randomized peptide library identified a consensus sequence closely matching that previously reported for the v-abl tyrosine kinase. Selections from a proteomic library derived from cellular mRNA identified several novel targets of v-abl, including a new member of a class of SH2 domain-containing adaptor proteins. Upon modification, several of the substrates obtained in these selections were found to be effective inhibitors of v-abl kinase activity in vitro. These experiments establish a novel method for identifying the substrates of tyrosine kinases from synthetic and cellular protein libraries.
