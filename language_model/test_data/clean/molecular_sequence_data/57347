Recent studies on nerve growth factor have revealed important new insights into the structure, function and evolution of this prototypical neurotrophic factor. Some of its features are (1) it has a unique three-dimensional fold that has since been found in two other growth factors, (2) it uses the trk proto-oncogene product, which has a tyrosine kinase, as a receptor and (3) it shares homology with at least three other factors, now collectively called neurotrophins, which have a spectrum of target cells.
