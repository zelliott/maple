Autonomous parvoviruses exert lytic and cytostatic effects believed to contribute to their antineoplastic activity. Studies with inducible clones have demonstrated a direct involvement of parvovirus nonstructural proteins (NS) in oncolysis. Human and rat fibroblasts have been stably transfected with MVM(p) (minute virus of mice prototype strain) NS genes cloned under the control of a hormone-inducible promoter. Dexamethasone-induced synthesis of the NS proteins in sensitive transformed cells results in cell killing within a few days. From these sensitive cell lines have been isolated some NS-resistant clones that also prove resistant to MVM(p) infection, suggesting that cell factors modulate NS cytotoxicity. We have previously reported that factors involved in cell cycle regulation may contribute to this modulation, since NS toxicity requires cell proliferation and correlates with a cell cycle perturbation leading to an arrest in phase S/G2. In addition to its role in cytotoxicity, NS1 can regulate transcription driven by parvovirus and nonparvovirus promoters. Since phosphorylation is a critical event in controlling the activity of many proteins, notably transcription factors and cell cycle-regulated proteins, we have examined the effect of NS1 on the synthesis and phosphorylation of cell proteins. Our results indicate that NS1 interferes, within 7 h of induction, with phosphorylation of a protein of about 14 kDa (p14). Cell synchronization has enabled us to show that phosphorylation of this protein occurs in early S phase and is prevented when NS1 is induced. This early effect of NS1 on p14 phosphorylation may be directly linked to cytotoxicity and is probably related to the previously reported inhibition of cell DNA synthesis. Late in the induction period (24 h), NS1 also alters the synthesis of a 50-kDa protein and a 35-kDa protein (p50 and p35, respectively). Microsequencing of p35 reveals sequence homology with beta-tubulin. These effects of NS1, observed only in NS1-sensitive cell lines, may be related to the protein's cytotoxicity.
