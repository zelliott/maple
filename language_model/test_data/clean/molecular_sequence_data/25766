We present here experimental evidence that three-arm branched DNA molecules form an asymmetric structure in the presence of Mg2+. Electrophoretic mobility and chemical and enzymatic footprinting experiments on a three-arm branched DNA molecule formed from three 16-mer strands are described. The electrophoretic mobilities of three species of a three-arm junction in which pairs of arms are extended are found to differ in the presence of Mg2+: one combination of elongated arms migrates significantly faster than the other two. This effect is eliminated in the absence of Mg2+, leading us to suggest that the three-arm DNA junction forms an asymmetric structure due to preferential stacking of two of the arms at the junction in the presence of Mg2+. The pattern of self-protection of each 16-mer strand of the core complex exposed to Fe(II).EDTA and DNase I scission is unique, consistent with formation of an asymmetric structure in the presence of Mg2+. We conclude that three-arm junctions resemble four-arm junctions in showing preferential stacking effects at the branch site. Comparison of the scission patterns of linear duplexes and the branched trimer by the reactive probes methidiumpropyl-EDTA.Fe(II) [MPE.Fe(II)] and Cu(I)-[o-phenanthroline]2 [(OP)2CuI] further indicates that the branch point represents a site of enhanced binding for drugs, as it does in the four-arm case. Reaction with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), a purine-specific probe sensitive to conformation, is enhanced at the branch site, consistent with loosening of base pairing or unpairing at this point.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
