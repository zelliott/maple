The Escherichia coli transcription factor NusA and the bacteriophage lambda antiterminator Q proteins were expressed as inducible glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The fusion proteins were purified under nondenaturing conditions by affinity chromatography on glutathione agarose. Thrombin cleavage of the glutathione agarose-bound fusion proteins yielded homogeneously pure NusAN+15 (5 mg/g cells) and almost homogeneously pure QN+13 protein (0.7 mg/g cells), where N+x indicates the presence of x additional amino acids at the N-terminus of the protein. The purified NusAN+15 exhibited the same activities as wildtype NusA in enhancement of transcriptional pausing, enhancement of termination at Rho-independent terminators, and enhancement of Q-mediated antitermination in vitro. The QN+13 protein exhibited both anti-pausing and antitermination activities in Q-mediated transcription antitermination. However, the antitermination activity of QN+13 was lost gradually during storage if the thrombin used for cleavage of the GST fusion protein was not removed. This was due to cleavage by thrombin after Arg22 within the Q protein itself, at a noncanonical thrombin cleavage site, so the truncated protein (QN+22) lacked the first 22 amino acids at the N-terminus of Q. The expression vectors described here can be used to rapidly produce large quantities of these proteins, and the truncated Q protein can be used to evaluate the requirement for the N-terminus of Q in antitermination, anti-pausing, interactions with the DNA template (qut site), and interaction with RNA polymerase itself.
