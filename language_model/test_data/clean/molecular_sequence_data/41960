The cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) gene encodes a family of transcriptional regulators that bind to promoter sequences activated by increased intracellular cAMP levels. Both activators and repressors are generated by alternative splicing and alternative translational initiation. During the development of male germ cells, there is a switch in the transcripts generated by CREM. Specifically, from the prophase of meiosis, there is an increase in the CREM tau activator transcript. Here we present results showing that expression of the CREM activator protein is restricted to postmeiotic germ cells. We show that CREM tau is efficiently phosphorylated at a serine residue at position 117 by the protein kinase-A endogenous to germ cells, indicating that it constitutes a natural target of the adenylyl cyclase pathway during spermatogenesis. Phosphorylation of serine-117 turns CREM tau into a powerful activator. The rise in CREM tau protein coincides with the transcriptional activation of several genes. We show that CREM tau efficiently binds to CREs present in the promoters of these genes, suggesting that they could constitute down-stream targets of CREM. We have analyzed in more detail the regulation of one of these genes, the male germ cell-specific RT7. The RT7 promoter is cAMP inducible and activated by CREM tau in transfection assays. The RT7 promoter is efficiently transcribed in vitro with nuclear extracts from seminiferous tubules. CREM-specific antibodies block RT7 in vitro transcription, implicating a role for CREM tau in a cascade of transcriptional events during spermatogenesis.
