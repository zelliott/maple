BmBKTx1 is a 31-amino acid peptide identified from the venom of the Chinese scorpion Buthus martensi Karsch, blocking high-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels. Sequence homology analysis indicates that BmBKTx1 is a new subfamily of short-chain alpha-KTx toxins of the potassium channel, which we term alpha-KTx19. Synthetic BmBKTx1 was prepared by using solid-phase peptide synthesis. Two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy techniques were used to determine the solution structure of BmBKTx1. The results show that the BmBKTx1 forms a typical cysteine-stabilized alpha/beta scaffold adopted by most short-chain scorpion toxins. The structure of BmBKTx1 consists of a two-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet (residues 20-29) and an alpha-helix (residues 5-15). The three-dimensional structure of BmBKTx1 was also compared with those of two function-related scorpion toxins, charybdotoxin (ChTx) and BmTx1, and their structural and functional implications are discussed.
