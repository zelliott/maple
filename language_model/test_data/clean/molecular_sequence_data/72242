Five cDNAs (pDidact2-pDidact6), representing different actin genes, were isolated from a Diphyllobothrium dendriticum cDNA library, and the DNA as well as the putative amino acid sequences were determined. The corresponding Didact2 and Didact4 genes code for peptides 376 amino acids long, with molecular weights 41,772 and 41,744 Da, respectively, while the deduced Didact3 protein is 377 amino acids long and weighs 41,912 Da. The pDidact5 and -6 cDNAs lack nucleotides corresponding to three to six amino acids at the amino-terminus. Two of the five cDNAs contain the conventional AATAAA as the putative polyadenylation signal, one has the common variant ATTAAA, whereas the hexanucleotide AATAGA is found 15 and 18 nucleotides, respectively, upstream of the poly(A) site in two of the cDNAs. Phylogenetic studies including 102 actin protein sequences revealed that there are at least four different types of cestode actins. In this study three of these types were found to be expressed in the adult D. dendriticum tapeworm. Structurally the cestode actin groupings differ from each other to an extent seen only among the metazoan actins between the vertebrate muscle and cytoplasmic isoforms. In the phylogenetic trees constructed, cestode actins were seen to map to two different regions, one on the border of the metazoan actins and the other within this group. It is, however, difficult to say whether the cestode actins branched off early in the metazoan evolution or if this position in the phylogenetic tree only reflects upon differences in evolutionary rate.
