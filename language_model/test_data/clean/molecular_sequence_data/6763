The expression and localization of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 were investigated in human prostatic tissues with or without benign hyperplasia. Using a polymerase chain reaction method, we were able to demonstrate that prostatic tissues with benign hyperplasia expressed a significantly higher level of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 mRNA than normal prostatic tissues (P < 0.01 by Anova). Western blot analysis using an antiserum against the receptor gave 2 bands with molecular weights of about 140 kDa and 80 kDa; these correspond to the expected sizes of the long and secreted forms of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, respectively. An immunohistochemical study using the same antiserum further demonstrated that the immunoreactive staining occurred mainly in the basal cells of the glandular epithelium and occasionally in the stromal cells. These results suggest that fibroblast growth factors may influence, at least in part, the proliferation of the epithelial cells seen in benign hyperplasia of human prostate.
