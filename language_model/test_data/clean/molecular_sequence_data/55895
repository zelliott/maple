Changes in cAMP levels are often associated with the modulation of neuronal function. The CREM gene encodes both antagonists and activators of the cAMP-dependent transcriptional response by alternative splicing. CREM transcripts in rat brain show a characteristic pattern of expression, being specific for the inner layer of the cerebral cortex, anterior thalamus, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. Strikingly, the CREM transcripts correspond to the antagonist isoforms in these areas, suggesting a down-regulatory role for CREM in brain; in contrast, the expression of CREM tau and CREB activators is more diffuse and generalized. In the supraoptic nucleus, CREM expression is induced after osmotic stimulus. Importantly, this demonstrates physiological inducibility of CREM, which is novel within the CRE/ATF family.
