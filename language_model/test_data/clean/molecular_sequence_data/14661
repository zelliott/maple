Kytococcus shroeteri is a rare cause of prosthetic valve endocarditis. Here, we report what is believed to be the first case of K. schroeteri endocarditis to be treated successfully by daptomycin and review the published literature of K. schroeteri endocarditis. There are no published daptomycin susceptibility data for Kytococcus and additional work was carried out on six other isolates stored at the Laboratory of HealthCare Associated Infections (LHCAI), Health Protection Agency (HPA) Centre for Infections, Colindale, London.
