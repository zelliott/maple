The segmented double-stranded RNA genome of Choristoneura fumiferana cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (CfCPV) was extracted, polyadenylated, reverse-transcribed into cDNA and cloned. The cDNA clones that hybridized to the smallest genomic segment (segment 10) were identified, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. Genome segment 10 of CfCPV was found to be 1171 nucleotides in length with a single open reading frame in one strand capable of coding a predicted protein of 258 residues (Mr of 29,795), consistent with an apparent Mr of 30.5 kDa determined by SDS-PAGE of purified polyhedrin. Comparison of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the polyhedrin gene of CfCPV with those of other CPVs and with several nuclear polyhedrosis viruses revealed no particular homology. Analysis of the hydrophilic profiles and predicted secondary structures of Bombyx mori (BmCPV), Euxoa scandens (EsCPV) and CfCPV indicated the presence of seven similar regions located at the amino terminus of the polyhedrin polypeptide of the three viruses. The expression of the cloned CfCPV polyhedrin gene in Escherichia coli demonstrated that this polyhedrin has the property of self-assembly, since the production of crystal-like occlusion with a well-defined crystalline lattice structure was observed.
