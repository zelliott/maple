In order to explore the structure--function relationship of the Escherichia coli asparagine synthetase A it was necessary to devise a system for overexpression of the gene and purification of the gene product. The E. coli asparagine synthetase A structural gene was fused to the 3' end of the human carbonic anhydrase II structural gene and overexpressed in E. coli. The gene product, a 66 kDa fusion protein, which exhibited asparagine synthetase activity, was purified in a single step by affinity chromatography and used as the antigen for the production of monoclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibodies were screened by ELISA. Colonies were chosen which were positive for purified fusion protein and negative for purified human carbonic anhydrase II. The E. coli asparagine synthetase A gene was then overexpressed and the gene product was used without purification for the final screen. The antibodies selected were used for immunoaffinity chromatography to purify the recombinant overexpressed E. coli asparagine synthetase A. Thus, a procedure is now available so that asparagine synthetase A can be purified to homogeneity in a single step.
