Availability of nucleosome positioning pattern(s) is crucial for chromatin studies. The matrix form of the pattern has been recently derived (I. Gabdank, D. Barash, E. N. Trifonov. J Biomol Struct Dyn 26, 403-412 (2009), and E. N. Trifonov. J Biomol Struct Dyn 27, 741-746 (2010)). In its simplified linear form it is described by the motif CGRAAATTTYCG. Oligonucleotide components of the motif (say, triplets GRA, RAA, AAA, etc.) would be expected to appear in eukaryotic sequences more frequently. In this work we attempted the reconstruction of the bendability patterns for 13 genomes by a novel approach-extension of highest frequency trinucleotides. The consensus of the patterns reconstructed on the basis of trinucleotide frequencies in 13 eukaryotic genomes is derived: CRAAAATTTTYG. It conforms to the earlier established sequence motif. The reconstruction, thus, attests to the universality of the nucleosome DNA bendability pattern.
