We have identified sequences in the 5' flanking region of the murine c-myc gene's P1 and P2 transcription initiation sites which form specific complexes with nuclear factors of murine and human origin and are also required for normal P1 and P2 usage. Four nuclear factor binding sites were identified within 400 bp 5' of P1 (5'Mf, 5'Mg1, 5'Mg2, and 5'Mg3) and two others within 100 bp 5' of P2 (ME1a1 and ME1a2). The Sp1 transcription factor bound to 5'Mg1 and 5'Mg3 with high affinity and with low affinity to 5'Mg2, ME1a1 and ME1a2 which also bound with high affinity to other factors in crude nuclear extracts. Deletion mutagenesis of sequences 5' of the P1 initiation site revealed that 109 bp encompassing 5'Mg3 and a TATA sequence were sufficient for P1 usage. The ME1a1 binding site 5' of P2 was necessary for maximal P2 activity and the loss of this sequence resulted in enhanced P1 usage. These findings demonstrate that the P1 and P2 initiation sites are independently regulated and that the ME1a1 binding site plays a central role in the normal usage of the c-myc promoters.
