Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) contribute to liver homeostasis and are released into plasma after liver injury. This study investigates the hepatic expression of key GST enzyme subtypes after burn injury.

Mice were subjected to an 18% total body surface area burn. Expression of mGSTalpha3 and mGSTmu1 was analyzed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blots on liver preparations from burned and control mice. GST catalytic activity was measured by conjugation assays.

: In burned animals, mGSTalpha3 mRNA was only reduced at 1 day, whereas mGSTmu1 mRNA decreased at 1 day and at 3 days after injury. Total mGSTmu protein levels decreased at the same time points, whereas total mGSTalpha protein levels did not change. Also, by 3 days, total GST conjugation activity was reduced by 25% (p=0.05).

Reduced expression of specific alpha and mu GST enzymes after burns correlates functionally with reduced GST activity. Altered GST expression may contribute to liver damage after systemic injury.
