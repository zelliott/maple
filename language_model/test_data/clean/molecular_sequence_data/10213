Bleomycin hydrolase (BH) is the only known eukaryotic enzyme that inactivates the widely used antineoplastic agent bleomycin (BLM) and is a primary candidate gene for protection against lethal BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis and for BLM resistance in tumors. Human BH was found to exist as a single gene that was mapped to chromosome 17 using National Institute of General Medical Sciences human/rodent hybrid mapping panels and localized to 17q11.1-11.2 by linkage analysis using the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain reference database. The human BH gene consisted of 11 exons ranging in size from 69-198 bp separated by introns of approximately 1 kb, reflecting the archetypal genomic structure of the cysteine protease family. A polymorphic site was identified in the eleventh exon at bp 1450 encoding either valine or isoleucine. These findings provide essential tools required to define the role of BH in BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis and BLM resistance in tumors.
