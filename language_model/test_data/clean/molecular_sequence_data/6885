We identified a homozygous deletion in a pancreatic carcinoma (DPC) that localized to a 1-cM region at chromosome 13q12.3, which lay within the 6-cM locus of familial breast cancer susceptibility (BRCA-2). Here we present a physical map of the region, consisting of YAC, PAC, and cosmid contigs. The YAC contig comprises 16 clones that together span the entire BRCA2 region. The PAC contig comprises 22 clones that together span the DPC region. Seventy cosmid clones were localized within and near the DPC region. Thirty-five sequence-tagged sites were defined and localized within the map. The map indicates the size of the DPC region to be near 250 kb, and provides mapped and cloned resources for the search for the putative tumor suppressor gene(s) in the region.
