Mouse adenovirus type 1 (MAV-1) genomic DNA from 8.9 to 13.7 map units was sequenced and the early region 1 (E1) transcription map was determined by S1 nuclease, primer extension, and Northern analyses, and cDNA sequencing. The E1 transcription map of MAV-1 had marked dissimilarities from the conserved transcription maps of primate adenovirus E1s. One major E1A and two E1B mRNAs were identified in overlapping transcription units. The single E1A mRNA was composed of three exons; the last exon was coincident with the last exon of the E1B mRNAs. While human adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) utilizes alternate splice donors for the first E1A mRNA exon, MAV-1 does not. Thus, no protein is predicted that would correspond to the Ad2 243 amino acid protein, although MAV-1 can encode a protein similar to the Ad2 289 amino acid protein (A. O. Ball, M. E. Williams, and K. R. Spindler, 1988, J. Virol. 62, 3947-3957). Two spliced E1B mRNAs differed from each other in an intron near the 5' end of the smaller E1B mRNA. This smaller mRNA could encode only the 55K E1B protein, while the larger mRNA could encode both the 21K and 55K E1B proteins.
