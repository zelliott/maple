Solid-phase methods can be used for direct cloning of in vitro-amplified genomic DNA with high efficiency, without the need for restriction enzymes or ligase. Single-stranded DNA fragments are generated by magnetic separation and are simply mixed with single-stranded vector to form gap-duplex molecules that can be readily transformed. This strategy, in combination with direct solid-phase DNA sequencing, was used to analyze individual alleles in the human apolipoprotein E locus.
