Atomic absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that highly purified RNA polymerase II from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae binds seven zinc ions. This number agrees with the number of potential zinc-binding sites among the 12 different subunits of the enzyme and with our observation that the ninth largest subunit alone is able to bind two zinc ions. The zinc-binding motif in the largest subunit of the enzyme was investigated using mutagenic analysis. Altering any one of the six conserved residues in the zinc-binding motif conferred either a lethal or conditional phenotype, and zinc blot analysis indicated that mutant forms of the domain had a 2-fold reduction in zinc affinity. Mutations in the zinc-binding domain reduced RNA polymerase II activity in cell-free extracts, even though protein blot analysis indicated that the mutant subunit was present in excess of wild-type levels. Purification of one mutant RNA polymerase revealed a subunit profile that was wild-type like with the exception of two subunits not required for core enzyme activity (Rpb4p and Rpb7p), which were missing. Core activity of the mutant enzyme was reduced 20-fold. We conclude that mutations in the zinc-binding domain can reduce core activity without altering the association of any of the subunits required for this activity.
