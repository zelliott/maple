Genomic clones encompassing the entire human elastin gene, including 11 kilobases flanking the ATG translation initiation codon, have been obtained and characterized by restriction enzyme analysis and extensive DNA sequencing. These analyses demonstrated that functionally distinct hydrophobic and cross-linking domains of the protein are segregated into separate exons throughout the gene. All exons are multiples of three nucleotides, and exon:intron borders always split codons in the same way which permits cassette-like alternative splicing. The 5'-flanking region lacks a canonical TATA sequence, is G + C-rich, and contains several SP1 binding sites and an AP2 binding site. Primer extension and S1 nuclease protection experiments indicate that transcription is initiated at multiple sites in the gene.
