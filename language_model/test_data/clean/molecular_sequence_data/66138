The tailspike protein P22 recognizes an octasaccharide derived from the O-antigen polysaccharide of Salmonella enteritidis in a shallow groove and molecular docking successfully identifies this binding region on the protein surface. Analysis by 2D (1)H,(1)H-T-ROESY and transferred NOESY NMR experiments indicate that the bound octasaccharide ligand has a conformation similar to that observed in solution. The results from a saturation transfer difference NMR experiment show that a large number of protons in the octasaccharide are in close contact with the protein as a result of binding. A comparison of the crystal structure of the complex and a molecular dynamics simulation of the octasaccharide with explicit water molecules suggest that only minor conformational changes are needed upon binding to the tailspike protein.
