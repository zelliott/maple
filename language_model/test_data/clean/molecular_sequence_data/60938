NF-YA, B, and C comprise the heterotrimeric transcription factor known as nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) or CCAAT-binding protein (CBF). NF-Y binds many CCAAT and Y box (an inverted CCAAT box, ATTGG) elements. Mutations of these elements that disrupt the binding of NF-Y result in decreased transcription from various tissue-specific and inducible promoters. We employed a yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human liver cDNA library in an effort to isolate proteins that interact with NF-Y and that may play a role in tissue-specific or hormone-inducible promoter activity. Using a fragment of the NF-YA subunit as bait we isolated a cDNA that encodes most of the open reading frame of the human zinc fingers and homeobox 1 (ZHX1) protein. The complete open reading frame was subsequently isolated and found to encode a protein of 873 amino acids that contains two zinc fingers and five homeodomain motifs. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)(+) RNA isolated from various tissues revealed two major ZHX1 transcripts of about 4.5 and 5 kilobases. Both transcripts were expressed ubiquitously, although the 5-kilobase transcript is of greater abundance in most tissues examined. The human ZHX1 gene is located on chromosome 8q, between markers CHCL.GATA50B06 and CHLC. GATA7G07.
