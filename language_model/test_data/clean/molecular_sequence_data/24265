The reversible inhibition of calcineurin (CaN), which is the only Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein Ser/Thr phosphatase, is thought to be a key functional event for most cyclosporin A (CsA)- and tacrolimus (FK506)-mediated biological effects. In addition to CaN inhibition, however, CsA and FK506 have multiple biochemical effects because of their action in a gain-of-function model that requires prior binding to immunophilic proteins. We screened a small molecule library for direct inhibitors of CaN using CaN-mediated dephosphorylation of (33)P-labeled 19-residue phosphopeptide substrate (RII phosphopeptide) as an assay and found the polyphenolic aldehyde gossypol to be a novel CaN inhibitor. Unlike CsA and FK506, gossypol does not require a matchmaker protein for reversible CaN inhibition with an IC(50) value of 15 microm. Gossypolone, a gossypol analog, showed improved inhibition of both RII phosphopeptide and p-nitrophenyl phosphate dephosphorylation with an IC(50) of 9 and 6 microm, respectively. In contrast, apogossypol hexaacetate was inactive. Gossypol acts noncompetitively, interfering with the binding site for the cyclophilin 18.CsA complex in CaN. In contrast to CsA and FK506, gossypol does not inactivate the peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerase activity of immunophilins. Similar to CsA and FK506, T cell receptor signaling induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin is inhibited by gossypol in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrated by the inhibition of nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) c1 translocation from the cytosol into the nucleus and suppression of NFAT-luciferase reporter gene activity.
