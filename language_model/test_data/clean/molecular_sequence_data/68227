Long Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats, showing spontaneous hereditary hepatitis and hepatic carcinoma, were found to possess autoimmune antibodies to liver microsomal proteins, particularly to proteins with the molecular weight of 56kD and 55kD. The antibodies occurred in association with acute lethal hepatitis in the LEC rats in our previous study. Two-dimensional immunoblot analysis of the antigenic proteins revealed that the 56kDa and 55kDa proteins showed 4.2 and 4.0 pI values and were estimated to be protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and calreticulin, respectively, from NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. These proteins were further identified by immunoblot analyses using purified proteins and specific antibodies. PDI was a major autoimmune antigenic protein.
