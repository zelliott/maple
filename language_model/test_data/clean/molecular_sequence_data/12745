N-(2-Deoxy-beta-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-N-3-(2R-hydroxyisobutyric acid)urea (alpha-R-hydroxy-beta-ureidoisobutyric acid, 8) was site specifically incorporated into a series of oligonucleotides via the ammonolysis of biopolymers containing 5R-thymidine C5-hydrate (3). alpha-R-hydroxy-beta-ureidoisobutyric acid (8) inhibits snake venom phosphodiesterase, lambda exonuclease and Klenow (exo-) fragment. Kinetic measurements for insertion of nucleotides opposite 8 by Klenow (exo-) fragment indicate that this lesion is instructive.
