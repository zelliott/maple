Streptococcus salivarius is a prevalent commensal species of the oropharyngeal tract. S. salivarius strain K12 is an isolate from the saliva of a healthy child, used as an oral probiotic. Here, we report its genome sequence, i.e., the full sequence of the 190-kb megaplasmid pSsal-K12 and a high-quality draft 2.2-Gb chromosomal sequence.
