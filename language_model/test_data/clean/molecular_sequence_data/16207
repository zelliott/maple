Homopyrimidine oligodeoxynucleotides recognize the major groove of the DNA double helix at homopurine.homopyrimidine sequences by forming local triple helices. The oligonucleotide is bound parallel to the homopurine strand of the duplex. This binding can be revealed by a footprinting technique using copper-phenanthroline as a cleaving reagent. Oligonucleotide binding in the major groove prevents cleavage by copper-phenanthroline. The cleavage patterns on opposite strands of the duplex at the boundaries of the triple helix are asymmetric. They are shifted to the 3'-side, indicating that the copper-phenanthroline chelate binds in the minor groove of the duplex structure. Binding of the chelate at the junction between the triple and the double helix is not perturbed on the 5'-side of the bound homopyrimidine oligonucleotide. In contrast, a strong enhancement of cleavage is observed on the purine-containing strand at the triplex-duplex junction on the 3'-side of the homopyrimidine oligonucleotide.
