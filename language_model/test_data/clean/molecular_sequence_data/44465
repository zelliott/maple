In Leuconostoc oenos, a malolactic bacterium, the synthesis of a stress protein called LO18 with an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa was greatly induced after heat (42 degrees C), acid (pH 3) or ethanolic (12% (v/v)) shocks. Moreover, the LO18 protein synthesis was induced in stationary growth phase and was detected for a long time (30 h) during this growth phase. Significant identity was found between the N-terminal parts of the LO18 protein and the Hsp18 from Clostridium acetobutylicum suggesting that LO18 protein belongs to the family of small heat shock proteins conserved in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
