Toxoplasmosis is a chronic infection that affects approximately 30% of the human population and is caused by Toxoplasma gondii. Determination of the three dimensional structure of PNP from T. gondii could provide new insights into the purine binding site and sub-strate binding, and could be used for future rational design of new drugs against toxoplasmosis. This work describes the molecular model for three dimensional structure of PNP from T.gondii using, as a template, PNP from Plasmodium falciparum. Molecular dynamics showed that this model is stable during a trajectory of 3 ns.
