The nucleotide sequence and N-, C-terminal amino acid sequences of alpha,beta-subunit of glutaryl 7-ACA acylase C130 from Pseudomonas sp. 130 were determined. The alignment of the acylase C130 with the other acylases shows that it has high homology with the acylases from Pseudomonas sp. GK16 and C427, but low homology with the others. There is large difference in the N-terminal of alpha-subunit, while the N-terminal of beta-subunit has significant conservation.
