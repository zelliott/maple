Screening of a porcine bone marrow cDNA library with a PCR-derived probe from rabbit LPS-binding protein CAP18 led to the discovery of two closely related clones. The longer, full-length cDNA clone encodes a 228 amino acid residue protein similar to the family of antibacterial/LPS-binding cationic peptides. In contrast to other hitherto discovered precursors of Pro/Arg-rich peptides from this family, they have a novel, unique structure of the C-terminal region of 100 amino acid residues with a repeating sequence of ten residues (FPPPNXPGPR, where X = V or F). These precursors could represent a part of the antibacterial peptide repertoire of porcine bone marrow.
