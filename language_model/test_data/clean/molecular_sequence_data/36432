We attempted to screen a series of Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor-like (SIL) proteins among several Streptomyces strains by using a highly sensitive assay system established by us. Of six randomly tested strains, four were found to produce SIL inhibitors as their major secreted proteins, suggesting that they might be distributed in a high frequency among this genus. Three inhibitors exhibited inhibition of both subtilisin BPN' and trypsin. Comparison of the amino terminal sequences of these isolated proteins with those of other reported SIL inhibitors revealed that the beta 1- and beta 2-sheets in SSI were highly conserved.
