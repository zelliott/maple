Anthrose is the upstream terminal unit of the tetrasaccharide side chain from a major glycoprotein of Bacillus anthracis exosporium and is part of important antigenic determinants. A novel entry to anthrose-containing antigens and precursors is described. The synthetic route, starting from D(+)-fucose, makes use of intermediates featuring a cyclic sulfite or sulfate function which serves successively as a protecting and a leaving group.
