Type I and II receptors for the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) are transmembrane serine/threonine kinases that are essential for TGF-beta signaling. However, little is known about their in vivo substrates or signal transduction pathways. To determine the substrate specificity of these kinases, we developed combinatorial peptide libraries synthesized on a hydrophilic matrix that is easily accessible to proteins in aqueous solutions. When we subjected these libraries to phosphorylation by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, we obtained the optimal peptide sequence RRXS (I/L/V), in perfect agreement with the substrate sequence deduced from mutagenesis and crystal structure analyses. By using the same libraries, we showed that the optimal substrate peptide for both the type I and II TGF-beta receptors was KKKKKK(S/T)XXX. Since the two kinases are thought to play different roles in intracellular signal transduction, it was a surprise to find that they have almost identical substrate specificity. Our method is direct, sensitive, and simple and provides information about the kinase specificity for all the amino acid residues at each position.
