We cloned cDNA encoding chicken HIRA, a homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptional corepressors Hir1p and Hir2p, possessing seven WD dipeptide motifs and a LXXLL motif in its N-terminal and C-terminal regions, respectively. It binds to CAF-1p48, HDAC-1 and 2, but not to CAF-1p60, p46 polypeptide and HDAC-3. The immunoprecipitation experiment involving truncated and missense mutants of HIRA and CAF-1p48 revealed not only that even one of seven WD dipeptide motifs in the N-terminal half of HIRA are necessary for the interaction with CAF-1p48, but also that those of CAF-1p48 are necessary for the interaction with HIRA. These findings indicate that the proper propeller structures of both HIRA and CAF-1p48 are necessary for their in vitro interaction. The immunoprecipitation experiment involving truncated and missense mutants of HIRA and HDAC-2 revealed that the LXXLL motif in the C-terminal half of HIRA and a C-terminal region of HDAC-2 are necessary for their in vitro interaction. Moreover, the WD dipeptide motifs and LXXLL motif of HIRA are essential for the interaction with CAF-1p48 and HDAC-2 in vivo. Taken together, these results indicate that HIRA should participate differentially in a number of DNA-utilizing processes through interactions of its distinct regions with these proteins.
