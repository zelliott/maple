The ecmA and ecmB genes of Dictyostelium encode related extracellular matrix proteins and both are induced by DIF, the stalk cell-specific morphogen. The ecmA gene is expressed throughout the prestalk region of the migrating slug but only later, at culmination, do the prestalk cells express the ecmB gene. Expression of the ecmB gene is induced at the entrance to the stalk tube and we have identified two, apparently redundant, promoter elements that control this process. They act as repressors, preventing transcription in the tip of the migrating slug and the apical papilla of the culminant. They have a semi-palindromic consensus sequence TTGnCAA, where n is in one case 2 and in the other 4 bp. Either element alone is able to repress ecmB promoter activity in prestalk cells. Introduction of a single repressor element into the promoter of the ecmA gene changes its expression pattern to resemble that of the ecmB gene. Mutant elements, where n is altered, cause repression during the slug stage but allow premature ecmB expression during culmination; suggesting that the effective strength of the inductive signal may increase during culmination. Inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in prestalk cells blocks both stalk cell maturation and ecmB gene expression. We show that the block to gene expression correlates precisely with the presence of a functional repressor element and this is consistent with the notion that expression of the ecmB gene is controlled by a PKA-dependent release from transcriptional repression.
