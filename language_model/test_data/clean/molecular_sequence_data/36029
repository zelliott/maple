We have analyzed the genomic structure of the human WT1 gene, one of the recessive oncogenes for Wilms' tumor at chromosome 11p13. By analyses of three cosmids covering the WT1 gene as well as products generated by polymerase chain reaction, cleavage sites for 10 restriction enzymes were mapped in a region of about 80 kb, and the positions of 10 exons were defined. We also mapped two polymorphic sites for TaqI. Our genomic map will be useful to analyze DNA abnormalities sometimes found in the tumors, as well as loss of heterozygosity.
