This study expands the phylogenetic diversity of Epsilonproteobacteria using the 16S rRNA gene framework. Of the 73 lineages defined by sequence similarities at or greater than 99%, most were found at only one site. In contrast, eight lineages were retrieved from sites spanning geographic distances from 1,000 to >10,000 km.
