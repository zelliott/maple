The mitochondrial genome of Trypanosoma brucei does not encode any identifiable tRNAs. Instead, mitochondrial tRNAs are synthesized in the nucleus and subsequently imported into mitochondria. In order to analyse the signals which target the tRNAs into the mitochondria, an in vivo import system has been developed: tRNA variants were expressed episomally and their import into mitochondria assessed by purification and nuclease treatment of the mitochondrial fraction. Three tRNA genes were tested in this system: (i) a mutated version of the trypanosomal tRNA(Tyr); (ii) a cytosolic tRNA(His) of yeast; and (iii) a human cytosolic tRNA(Lys). The tRNAs were expressed in their own genomic context, or containing various lengths of the 5'-flanking sequence of the trypanosomal tRNA(Tyr) gene. In all cases efficient import of each of the tRNAs was observed. We independently confirmed the mitochondrial import of the yeast tRNA(His), since in organello [alpha-32P]ATP-labelling of the 3'-end of the tRNA was inhibited by carboxyatractyloside, a highly specific inhibitor of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator. Import of heterologous tRNAs in their own genomic contexts supports the conclusion that no specific targeting signals are necessary to import tRNAs into mitochondria of T. brucei, but rather that the tRNA structure itself is sufficient to specify import.
