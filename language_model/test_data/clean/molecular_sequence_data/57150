Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a potent mitogen for parenchymal liver cells, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells and may play an important role in liver regeneration following hepatic injury. HGF is homologous to plasminogen and is first synthesized and secreted as an inactive single-chain precursor and then activated to a heterodimeric form by endoproteolytic processing. Recently, a novel serine protease responsible for this processing (HGF activator) has been purified from fetal bovine serum (Shimomura, T., Ochiai, M., Kondo, J., and Morimoto, Y. (1992) Cytotechnology 8, 219-229). In this study, we purified HGF activator from human serum and determined its partial amino acid sequence. Based on the amino acid sequence, we have molecularly cloned the cDNA for human HGF activator. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA revealed that HGF activator is derived from the COOH-terminal half region of a precursor protein of 655 amino acids and that the precursor consists of multiple putative domains homologous to those observed in blood coagulation factor XII. These domains may be involved in the conversion of the precursor to the active form of HGF activator.
