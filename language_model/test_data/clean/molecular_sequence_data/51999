We have analyzed DNA from 13 bovine reference pedigrees using primers specific for microsatellite markers derived from the 21-steroid hydroxylase (CYP21) and prolactin (PRL) genes and the leukocyte antigen (BOLA DRBP1) pseudogene. Linkage was demonstrated between PRL and BOLA DRBP1 (theta = 0.05; Z = 19.6), cyp21 and PRL (theta = 0.13; Z = 6.8), and BOLA DRBP1 and CYP21 (theta = 0.17; Z = 10.4). These results suggest an order BOLA DRBP1-PRL-CYP21, although in a multilocus analysis the alternative order PRL-BOLA DRBP1-CYP21 was also possible. The data confirm and extend the previously established syntenic relationship between these markers on bovine chromosome 23 and provide points of anchorage for further linkage studies in the reference pedigrees described.
