AL-amyloidosis is one of the most common amyloidoses and can be found in a localized and a systemic form. The precursor protein is an immunoglobulin light chain which as AL-protein in both localized and systemic AL-amyloidosis shows the same pattern of fragmentation and changes of primary structure. In this work it is shown that that there is a difference between localized and systemic amyloidosis in respect to accompanying giant cells which constantly are found associated with amyloid deposits in localized AL-amyloidosis. In addition, giant cells were found together with amyloid deposits in lymph nodes of some cases of systemic AL-amyloidosis. Based on these findings and electron microscopic studies, it is discussed whether the giant cells actively participate in amyloid fibril formation by uptake and modification of the precursor protein or the giant cells are part of a foreign body reaction. Included in this work are two new cases of localized lung (lambda I) and ureteric (kappa I) AL-amyloidosis.
