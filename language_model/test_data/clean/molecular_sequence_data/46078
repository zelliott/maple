Seven-helix transmembrane proteins, including the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), mediate a broad range of fundamental cellular activities through binding to a wide range of ligands. Understanding the structural basis for the ligand-binding selectivity of these proteins is of significance to their structure-based drug design. Comparison analysis of proteins' ligand-binding sites provides a useful way to study their structure-activity relationships. Various computational methods have been developed for the binding-site comparison of soluble proteins. In this work, we applied this approach to the analysis of the primary ligand-binding sites of 92 seven-helix transmembrane proteins. Results of the studies confirmed that the binding site of bacterial rhodopsins is indeed different from all GPCRs. In the latter group, further comparison of the binding sites indicated a group of residues that could be responsible for ligand-binding selectivity and important for structure-based drug design. Furthermore, unexpected binding-site dissimilarities were observed among adrenergic and adenosine receptors, suggesting that the percentage of the overall sequence identity between a target protein and a template protein alone is not sufficient for selecting the best template for homology modeling of seven-helix membrane proteins. These results provided novel insight into the structural basis of ligand-binding selectivity of seven-helix membrane proteins and are of practical use to the computational modeling of these proteins.
