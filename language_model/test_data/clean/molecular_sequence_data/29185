Chimpanzee immunoglobulins are virtually identical to human immunoglobulins and may have clinically useful applications. Four chimpanzee monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the hepatitis A virus (HAV) capsid were isolated from a combinatorial cDNA library of gamma1/kappa antibody genes using phage display. Competition assays indicated that three of the MAbs recognized the same or overlapping epitopes, whereas the fourth recognized a different, nonoverlapping epitope on the HAV capsid. All four MAbs neutralized the homologous HAV strain, HM-175, in a radioimmunofocus assay and two of the four MAbs neutralized a heterologous simian HAV strain, AGM-27. From these data, we conclude that the MAbs must recognize at least three epitopes on the HAV capsid. Furthermore, competition assays performed with neutralizing murine MAbs suggested that three of the chimpanzee MAbs recognized epitopes on the HAV capsid which have not been defined previously.
