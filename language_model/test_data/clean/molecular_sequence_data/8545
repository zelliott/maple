Bacterial chemotaxis receptor modifying enzymes from Salmonella typhimurium have been crystallized using microseeding techniques. The crystals of the S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase, CheR, belong to the monoclinic space group P21 with cell constants a = 55.1 A, b = 48.1 A, c = 63.1 A, beta = 112.3 degrees. The crystals of the catalytic domain of the methylesterase, CheB, belong to the trigonal space group P3(2)21 or P3(1)21 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 63.4 A, c = 86.8 A. Both crystals contain one molecule per asymmetric unit and have calculated Matthews' volumes of 2.4 A3/Da.
