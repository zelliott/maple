Thermal stress in soybean seedlings causes the activation of pre-existing heat shock transcription factor proteins (HSFs). Activation results in the induction of DNA binding activity which leads to the transcription of heat shock genes. From a soybean cDNA library we have isolated cDNA clones corresponding to six HSF genes. Two HSF genes are expressed constitutively at the transcriptional level, and the remaining four are heat-inducible. Two of the heat inducible genes are also responsive to cadmium stress. Comparative analysis of HSF sequences indicated higher conservation of the DNA binding domain among plant HSFs than those from yeast or other higher eukaryotes. The putative plant HSF oligomerization domain contains hydrophobic heptapeptide repeats characteristic of coiled coils and seems to exist in two structural variants. The carboxy-terminal domains are reduced in size and the C-terminal heptad repeat is degenerate.
