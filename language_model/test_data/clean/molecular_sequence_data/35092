Enterovirus 87 (EV87) is a new member of species Human Enterovirus B. So far, only the genome sequence of the prototype strain from Bangladesh is available. Here, we report the genome sequence of EV87 strain LY02/SD/CHN/2000 isolated from an acute flaccid paralysis case in Shandong Province, China, in 2000. It has a genome of 7423 nucleotides. Compared with the prototype strain, it had 80.3% nucleotide and 95.5% amino acid similarity in the VP1 coding region and 82.8% complete genome similarity, reflecting distant genetic relationship between them. Phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of recombination with other serotypes in the P2 and P3 coding regions.
