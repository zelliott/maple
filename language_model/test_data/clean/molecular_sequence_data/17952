The identification of a cDNA (MR19) corresponding to a maize alpha-tubulin and homologous genomic clones (MG19/6 and MG19/14) is described. The cDNA has been isolated by differential screening of a cDNA maize root library. We have found two alpha-tubulin genes in a tandem arrangement in the genomic clones, separated by approximately 1.5 kbp. One of the genes (gene I) contains an identical nucleotide sequence which corresponds to the cDNA clone. The two deduced proteins from DNA sequences are very similar (only two conservative replacements in 451 amino acids) and they share a high homology as compared with the published alpha-tubulin sequences from other systems and in particular with the Arabidopsis thaliana and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii sequences reported. The structure of both genes is also very similar; it includes two introns, of 1.7 kbp and 0.8 kbp respectively, in each gene and only one intron placed at a homologous position in relation to Arabidopsis thaliana genes. By using specific 3' probes it appears that both genes are preferentially expressed in the radicular system of the plant. The alpha-tubulin gene family of Zea mays seems to be represented by at least 3 or 4 members.
