The mechanism of the internucleotide condensation and side-reactions in H-phosphonate approach has been investigated with the help of NMR-spectroscopy. On the basis of the results obtained a modification minimizing side-reactions in the course of the nucleotide component preactivation has been developed. It includes the use of acetonitrile--quinoline (4:1) mixture as the solvent in coupling reactions. The efficiency of the method is illustrated by the synthesis of oligodeoxynucleotides.
