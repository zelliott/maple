Myasthenia gravis (MG) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune MG (EAMG), are T cell-dependent diseases mediated by antibodies against acetylcholine receptor (AChR) on skeletal muscle. Most of the antibodies are directed toward conformation-dependent epitopes on the AChR, whereas T cells recognize denatured AChR. In search of T cell epitopes in EAMG, we tested 24 synthetic peptides covering 62% of the alpha-subunit sequence of Torpedo californica electric organ AChR in the T cell proliferation assay with lymph node cells from rats immunized with AChR. In Lewis rats, 2 of these peptides, [Tyr 100]alpha 100-116 and [Gly 89, Tyr 90]alpha 73-90, strongly stimulated T cells and, of these, [Tyr 100]alpha 100-116 was much more potent; 4 other peptides were weakly mitogenic and 18 were ineffective. None of the 24 synthetic peptides alone stimulated anti-AChR production and, when added to cultures along with AChR, [Tyr 100]alpha 100-116 and [Gly 89, Tyr 90]alpha 73-90 suppressed antibody production. Of twelve cloned T cell lines specific to AChR, 4 responded to [Tyr 100]alpha 100-116, indicating the importance of the epitope in alpha 101-116 in Lewis rats. In three other strains of rats whose responses to AChR and its subunits were similar to those in the Lewis rat, neither [Tyr 100]alpha 100-116 nor [Gly 89, Tyr 90]alpha 73-90 was stimulatory. Instead, completely different sets of peptides stimulated their T cells. When peptides were used as immunogens, each strain (except Lewis rats) responded only to the peptides that stimulated AChR-immune T cells from the same strain. Genetically restricted T cell recognition of AChR peptides in rats suggests that T cells from MG patients with different major histocompatibility haplotypes may recognize different AChR peptides.
