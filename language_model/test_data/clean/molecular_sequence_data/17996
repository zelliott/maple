Oligonucleotides with 1-pyrenylmethyl substituent at the designated sugar residue were synthesized by using 5'-dimethoxytrityl 2'-(1-pyrenylmethyl)uridine 3'-phosphorobisdiethylamidite 1. It was shown that the pyrene-oligonucleotides have enhanced affinity in binding to the complementary polynucleotide sequence. The fluorescence yield and life time of the pyrene-oligonucleotide was drastically enhanced when bound by the complementary polynucleotide.
