The nucleotide sequences of the core upstream and precore regions (371 nucleotide length, nt. 1604-1974) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) were analysed sequentially in three subjects who were positive serologically for anti-HBe and had acute clinical exacerbation after immunosuppressive treatment. These patients were asymptomatic HBV carriers before therapy. The results revealed that the mutant with an 8-bp deletion (nt. 1768-1775) located in the basic core promoter region was dominant in the asymptomatic HBV carrier phase in two of three subjects. After exacerbation, however, such mutant clones possessing 8-bp deletion disappeared or decreased in number and were replaced by the clones possessing a precore stop codon mutation G to A (nt. 1896) or by the clones possessing additional contiguous point mutations A to T (nt. 1762) and G to A (nt. 1764) and a new point mutation C to T (nt. 1653). Possible relationships between acute exacerbation of liver function accompanied by mutation and the transition of the dominant clones were discussed.
