Tit-tyrants of the genus Anairetes presently consist of six species; five inhabit various regions along the Andean cordillera of South America and one is endemic to the Juan Fernandez Islands off the coast of Chile. Data from mtDNA ND2 and Cyt b sequences were used to construct a phylogeny for all Anairetes species as well as Uromyias agilis, a closely related genus, and Stigmatura as an outgroup, to determine their relationships and history of radiation in South America. Results strongly supported the following paired relationships: A. nigrocristatus-A. reguloides, A. flavirostris-A. alpinus, and A. parulus-A. fernandezianus. This dataset, however, could not resolve basal nodes; therefore relationships among these pairs remains obscure. Moreover the genus Uromyias, controversially separated on morphological criteria from Anairetes, fell within the Anairetes clade, although its exact position could not be ascertained with confidence. The molecular data indicate that this group probably radiated within the past 2 million years, concomitant with highly accentuated cycles of global climatic change. Certain high altitude areas within the Andes may have been stable during global climatic changes and may have served as refugia during the Plio-Pleistocene.
