Two genes encoding sterol carrier protein-2 like proteins are identified from fourth instar cDNAs of the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. The predicted AeSCP-2like1 (AeSCP-2L1) and AeSCP-2like2 (AeSCP-2L2) proteins are small, acidic and lacking the peroxisomal targeting sequence at the C-termini. Purified recombinant AeSCP-2L1 and -2L2 bind to cholesterol with a Kd of 5.4 x 10(-6) M and 2.6 x 10(-6) M, respectively. The Kd values of AeSCP-2L1 and -2L2 to palmitic acid are 3.7 x 10(-7) M and 2.6 x 10(-7) M, respectively. Both genes are expressed predominantly in gut tissues. The transcripts of the AeSCP-2L1 gene are only detected in larval stages, whereas AeSCP-2L2 is expressed in larval and adult stages. AeSCP-2L2 transcription increases within 5 h after a bloodmeal and stays at high levels during vitellogenesis. In in vitro larval gut tissue cultures, AeSCP-2L1 transcripts were increased in the presence of juvenile hormone III, whereas AeSCP-2L2 mRNA levels increased in the presence 20-hydroxylecdysone. The results suggest that transcription of AeSCP-2L1 and -2L2 genes are regulated differently through the mosquito life cycle.
