The transcription factors controlling the complex genetic response to ischemia and their modes of regulation are poorly understood. We found that ATF-2 and c-Jun DNA binding activity is markedly enhanced in post-ischemic kidney or in LLC-PK1 renal tubular epithelial cells exposed to reversible ATP depletion. After 40 min of renal ischemia followed by reperfusion for as little as 5 min, binding of ATF-2 and c-Jun, but not ATF-3 or CREB (cAMP response element binding protein), to oligonucleotides containing either an ATF/cAMP response element (ATF/CRE) or the jun2TRE from the c-jun promoter, was significantly increased. Binding to jun2TRE and ATF/CRE oligonucleotides occurred with an identical time course. In contrast, nuclear protein binding to an oligonucleotide containing a canonical AP-1 element was not detected until 40 min of reperfusion, and although c-Jun was present in the complex, ATF-2 was not. Incubating nuclear extracts from reperfused kidney with protein phosphatase 2A markedly reduced binding to both the ATF/CRE and jun2TRE oligonucleotides, compatible with regulation by an ATF-2 kinase. An ATF-2 kinase, which phosphorylated both the transactivation and DNA binding domains of ATF-2, was activated by reversible ATP depletion. This kinase coeluted on Mono Q column chromatography with a c-Jun amino-terminal kinase and with the peak of stress-activated protein kinase, but not p38, immunoreactivity. In conclusion, DNA binding activity of ATF-2 directed at both ATF/CRE and jun2TRE motifs is modulated in response to the extreme cellular stress of ischemia and reperfusion or reversible ATP depletion. Phosphorylation-dependent activation of the DNA binding activity of ATF-2, which appears to be regulated by the stress-activated protein kinases, may play an important role in the earliest stages of the genetic response to ischemia/reperfusion by targeting ATF-2 and c-Jun to specific promoters, including the c-jun promoter and those containing ATF/CREs.
