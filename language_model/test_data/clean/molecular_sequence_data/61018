The isoprenoid metabolic pathway is mainly regulated at the level of conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) to mevalonate, catalyzed by HMG CoA reductase. As estrogens are known to influence cholesterol metabolism, we have explored the potential regulation of the HMG CoA reductase gene promoter by estrogens. The promoter contains an estrogen-responsive element-like sequence at position -93 (termed Red-ERE), which differs from the ERE consensus by one mismatch in each half of the palindrome. A Red-ERE oligonucleotide specifically bound estrogen receptor in vitro and conferred receptor-dependent estrogen responsiveness to a heterologous promoter in all cell lines tested. However, expression of a reporter driven by the rat HMG CoA reductase promoter was induced by estrogen treatment after transient transfection into the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 cells but not in hepatic cell lines expressing estrogen receptor. Estrogen induction in MCF-7 cells was dependent on the Red-ERE and was strongly inhibited by the antiestrogen ICI 164,384. A functional cAMP-responsive element is located immediately upstream of the Red-ERE, but cAMP and estrogens inhibit each other in terms of transactivation of the promoter. Similarly, induction by estrogens was inhibited by micromolar concentrations of cholesterol, likely acting via changes in occupancy of the sterol-responsive element located 70 bp upstream of the Red-ERE. Thus, within its natural context, Red-ERE is able to mediate hormonal regulation of the HMG CoA reductase gene in tissues that respond to estrogens with enhanced cell proliferation, while it is not operative in liver cells. We postulate that this tissue-specific regulation of HMG CoA reductase by estrogens could partially explain the protective effect of estrogens against heart disease.
