Granulins are a family of cysteine rich polypeptides some of which have growth modulatory activity. We showed previously that the granulins are encoded within the same precursor consisting of seven granulin domains arranged in tandem. Here we report the chromosomal location and structural organization of the protein coding region of the granulin gene. The granulin gene was assigned to chromosome 17 using DNA from human-hamster somatic cell hybrids. The protein-coding region of the granulin gene was shown to comprise 12 exons covering about 3700 bp. Each tandem granulin repeat is encoded by two non-equivalent exons, a configuration unique to the granulins that would permit the formation of hybrid granulin-like proteins by alternate splicing.
