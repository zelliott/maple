Clostridium thermocellum produces a great number of extracellular cellulases which are free or cellulosome-bound. The nucleotide sequence of a gene cluster containing the genes celI, celN and cseP was determined from C. thermocellum strain F7. Gene products Cel9I and Cel9N are structurally related enzymes having a glycosyl hydrolase family 9 and a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM3c), but show characteristic differences: Cel9I is a non-cellulosomal protein with an additional CBM (CBM3b), whereas Cel9N contains a cellulosomal dockerin module and no additional CBM. Although Cel9I is a processive endoglucanase, Cel9N is non-processive. Both enzymes hydrolyse phosphoric acid swollen cellulose, but the products of hydrolysis are different. The CseP protein encoded in the gene cluster is the first component attached to the cellulosomal scaffoldin for which no catalytic activity could be detected. It was shown to be present in the cellulosome. Its sequence is homologous to the spore-coat assembly protein CotH of Bacillus subtilis, suggesting a structural role of CseP in the cellulosome.
