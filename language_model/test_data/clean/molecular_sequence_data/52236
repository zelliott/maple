An 18-kDa hemagglutinin which possesses the property of inducing both aggregation of amebocytes and agglutination of erythrocytes has been isolated from Limulus polyphemus amebocytes and purified by ion exchange chromatography. This nonglycosylated, single chain polypeptide with an M(r) of 18,506 and isoelectric point of 8.3 is stored exclusively in the large secretory granules of amebocytes. Based on the partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of 63 residues, DNA probes have been synthesized for screening a pBR322 cDNA library constructed from Limulus amebocytes. The cDNA coding for this protein reveals the presence of a 19-residue signal peptide preceding the 153-residue open reading frame. Northern blot analysis indicates the presence of a single mRNA species. The primary structure derived from the corresponding cDNA sequence reveals an internal homology consisting of two consensus sequences, Val-Asn-Asp/Ser-Trp-Asp and Glu-Asp-Arg-Arg-Trp. The formation of 5 disulfide bonds between 10 half-cysteines divides the molecule into three looped domains each containing the Glu-Asp-Arg-Arg-Trp repeating unit. One of the novel features of this protein is that it shares 37% identity with a 22-kDa mammalian extracellular matrix protein isolated from fetal bovine skin (Neame, P.J., Choi, H.U., and Rosenberg, L.C. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5474-5479). The two proteins exhibit a similar pattern of looped domains, each domain containing a homologous consensus sequence (i.e. Glu-Asp-Arg-Arg-Trp). The overall structure of both proteins seems to be highly related, with the exception of an N-terminal tyrosine-rich region present only in the mammalian extracellular matrix protein. The functional properties of the two proteins are similar in that the Limulus 18-kDa protein agglutinates horse erythrocytes and aggregates Limulus amebocytes, and the mammalian 22-kDa protein is an effective adhesion promoter for dermal fibroblasts. On the basis of these unique properties, the newly characterized hemagglutinin has been termed Limulus 18K agglutination-aggregation factor (18K-LAF).
