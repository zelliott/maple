Two bacterial strains were isolated from greenhouse soils of Daejeon and Yangpyeong regions in Korea. The strains, designated GH1-9T and GH19-3T, were Gram-negative and aerobic, with rod-shaped cells. Their DNA G+C contents were 61.7 and 67.3 mol%, respectively. The major fatty acids of strain GH1-9T were iso-C16 : 0, iso-C15 : 0, iso-C14 : 0, iso-C17 : 1omega9c and iso-C11 : 0 3-OH and the major components of strain GH19-3T were iso-C16 : 0, iso-C15 : 0, C16 : 1omega7c alcohol, iso-C17 : 1omega9c and iso-C11 : 0 3-OH. None of the species of the genus Lysobacter with validly published names showed 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of more than 97 % with respect to the novel isolates. The closest sequence similarity of strain GH1-9T was with Lysobacter concretion is DSM 16239T (96.4 %), whereas strain GH19-3T showed the highest sequence similarity with Lysobacter enzymogenes DSM 2043T (96.6 %). Polyphasic taxonomic studies indicated that the two strains should be classified as representing novel members of the genus Lysobacter. The names Lysobacter daejeonensis sp. nov. and Lysobacter yangpyeongensis sp. nov. are proposed, with strains GH1-9T (=KACC 11406T=DSM 17634T) and GH19-3T (=KACC 11407T=DSM 17635T), respectively, as the type strains.
