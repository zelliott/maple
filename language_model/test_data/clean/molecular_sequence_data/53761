The human and nonhuman primate ABO blood group gene shows relatively large numbers of nucleotide differences around the exon 7 region. In this study we determined intron 6 sequences for 9 alleles of common chimpanzee and for 3 alleles of bonobo to estimate nucleotide diversities among them. Sequence length polymorphisms are observed in this region as a repeat appears one to five times. From a phylogenetic network of intron 6 sequences of ABO blood group genes for humans, common chimpanzee, and bonobo, parallel substitutions and/or some kinds of convergent events are predicted in the chimpanzee lineage. We also estimated nucleotide diversities for common chimpanzee and bonobo ABO blood group genes; these values were 0.219% and 0.208%, respectively.
