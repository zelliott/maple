The development of an effective vaccine is recognised as a necessary adjunct to the control of schistosomiasis japonica, a disease affecting several million people in China and the Philippines. Currently, recombinant Schistosoma japonicum molecules are considered most suitable for large scale vaccine production and a number of genes encoding vaccine candidate polypeptides have been cloned and expressed (see Waine et al., 1993a). One of the molecules providing most promise as a vaccine target is paramyosin (Butterworth, 1992), a major structural protein of thick filaments in the muscle of most invertebrates; paramyosin genes have now been cloned from a range of parasitic helminths, including schistosomes (Limberger and McReynolds, 1990; Laclette et al., 1991; Dahmen et al., 1993; Landa et al., 1993; MÃ¼hlschlegel et al., 1993, Nara et al., 1994). The cloning and nucleotide sequence of S. Japonicum paramyosin is described.
