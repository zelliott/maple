The Bacillus subtilis ureABC operon encodes homologs of the three subunits of urease enzymes of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Disruption of ureC prevented utilization of urea as a nitrogen source and resulted in a partial growth defect in minimal medium containing limiting amounts of arginine or allantoin as the sole nitrogen source.
