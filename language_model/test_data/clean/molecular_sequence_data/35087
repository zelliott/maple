pDB2011, a multidrug resistance plasmid isolated from the foodborne Listeria innocua strain TTS-2011 was sequenced and characterized. Sequence analysis revealed that pDB2011 had a length of 7641 bp and contained seven coding DNA sequences of which two were annotated as replication proteins, one as a recombination/mobilization protein and one as a transposase. Furthermore, pDB2011 harbored the trimethoprim, spectinomycin and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance genes dfrD, spc and erm(A), respectively. However, pDB2011 was only associated with trimethoprim and spectinomycin resistance phenotypes and not with phenotypic resistance to erythromycin. A region of the plasmid encoding the resistance genes spc and erm(A) plus the transposase was highly similar to Staphylococcus aureus transposon Tn554. The dfrD gene was 100% identical to dfrD found in a number of Listeria monocytogenes isolates. Additionally, assessment of the potential host range of pDB2011 revealed that the plasmid was able to replicate in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 as well as in Escherichia coli MC1061 and DH5Î±. This study reports the first multidrug resistance plasmid in L. innocua. A large potential for dissemination of pDB2011 is indicated by its host range of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
