DNA from archival Papanicolaou stained smears was successfully amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to see if it could be used for retrospective genome studies such as detection of the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV) and changes in p53 gene expression. DNA was isolated and purified by treatment with proteinase K, phenol/chloroform, and isoamyl alcohol. Segments of the human beta actin and TGF beta 1 gene were amplified by PCR. Of all stains used in the preparation of Papanicolaou smears, only eosin was detectable as a greenish band in ethidium bromide treated DNA gels under ultraviolet illumination.
