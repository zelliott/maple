The sarafotoxins SRTX-a, b and c from the venom of the snake Atractaspis engaddensis are 21-amino acid peptides that affect the cardiovascular system. They are strong vasoconstrictors, the potency of which may be in correlation with their primary structure: SRTX-a, which differs from SRTX-b in a single amino acid residue (Asn instead of Tyr), shows about half of its maximal vasoconstriction, while SRTX-c, which differs in 3 additional residues is a very weak vasoconstrictor and, at high doses, shows vasodilatory effects. Sequential application of the three isotoxins result in a summated response.
