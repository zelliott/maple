By direct sequencing of cosmids using primers designed from the known cDNA sequence, we identified 19 exons in the human MET proto-oncogene, and sequenced the corresponding 5' and 3' exon-intron junctions. By homology search in the database of the Washington University Genome Sequence Center (GSC), we identified one additional exon. These 20 exons, together with a previously reported exon, bring the total exon number of MET to 21. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify each exon and adjacent intronic sequences to permit examination of each exon for mutations. By restriction mapping, we assembled a 110 kb genomic contig that covered almost the entire MET proto-oncogene. This information is relevant for the screening of recently reported mutations of the MET gene which cause hereditary papillary renal carcinomas and for the search for additional mutations of the same gene which may play a role in the pathogenesis of common human carcinomas including carcinomas of the breast, ovary and pancreas.
