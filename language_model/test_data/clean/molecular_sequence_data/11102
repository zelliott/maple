We have isolated from an American lobster (Homarus americanus) olfactory organ cDNA library a clone, lobG alphaS, with >70% identity to mammalian and arthropod G alphaS sequences. In genomic Southern blots, a fragment of lobG alphaS detected only one band, suggesting the lobsters have a single G alphaS gene. In brain and olfactory organ, lobG alphaS mRNA was expressed predominantly in neurons, including many of the neuronal cell body clusters of the brain. G alphaS protein was also expressed broadly, appearing on western blots as a band of 51.8 kDa in brain, eyestalk, pereiopod, dactyl, tail muscle, olfactory organ, and aesthetasc hairs. These results suggest that lobG alphaS plays a role in a wide variety of signal transduction events. Its presence in the olfactory aesthetasc hairs, which are almost pure preparations of the outer dendrites of the olfactory receptor neurons, and the expression of lobG alphaS mRNA in the olfactory receptor neurons of the olfactory organ indicate that lobG alphaS may mediate olfactory transduction. That virtually all ORNs express lobG alphaS mRNA equally predicts that hyperpolarizing odor responses mediated by cyclic AMP are a property of all lobster olfactory receptor neurons.
