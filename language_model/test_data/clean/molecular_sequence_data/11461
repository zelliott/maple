Genetic defects of coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPO) lead to hereditary coproporphyria, an inherited autosomal dominant porphyria. The recent cloning of human cDNAs and of the gene encoding CPO permits deducing the primary structure of the CPO protein and elucidating the molecular basis of HC in some families.
