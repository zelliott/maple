A portion of the cDNA reported as a novel cDNA encoding the Drosophila melanogaster homolog of the bovine 14-3-3 protein by Swanson and Ganguly [Gene 113 (1992) 183-190] already exists in the database. It was originally reported as an alternative 5' end of the D. melanogaster homolog of the epidermal growth factor receptor (DER). Schejter and Shilo [Cell 56 (1989) 1093-1164] later reported that this finding was due to a cloning artifact that joined the 14-3-3 cDNA onto the DER cDNA.
