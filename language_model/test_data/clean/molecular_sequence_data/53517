A new Pseudomonas species, for which the name Pseudomonas plecoglossicida is proposed, was isolated from cultured ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) with bacterial haemorrhagic ascites. The causative agent was similar to Pseudomonas putida biovar A in its phenotypic characteristics and on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, but it reduced nitrate to nitrite. Furthermore, it was distinguished phenotypically from Pseudomonas putida biovar A by utilization of D-malate, L-(+)-tartrate, m-tartrate and nicotinate. The levels of DNA-DNA hybridization between the isolate strain FPC 951T and other reference strains of Pseudomonas species, including Pseudomonas putida, were less than 50%. The G+C content of the DNA of FPC 951T was 62.8 mol%. Strain FPC 951T (= ATCC 700383T) is designated the type strain of the new species.
