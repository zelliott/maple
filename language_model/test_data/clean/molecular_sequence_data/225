DNA methylation is an important biochemical epigenetic determinant of gene expression in cells and therefore actively involved in gene regulation, chromosomal conformation, and protein activity. Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) play a major role in the methylation of proteins that have an arginine residue, catalyzing both the asymmetric dimethylation of arginine (aDMA) and symmetric dimethylation of arginine (sDMA). PRMT5, a type II PRMT which catalyzes sDMA, has been shown to have a pivotal role in pole plasm assembly and germ cell development in Drosophila and also to be an associate factor of Blimp1 for germ cell development in mouse. Here, we report a homolog of prmt5 identified in medaka, Oryzias latipes, which was detected in the brain, gill, muscle, heart, liver, spleen, intestine, testis and ovary of adult fish by reverse transcriptase-PCR. The expression of prmt5 in the gonads is restricted to oocytes of the ovary, spermatogonia, and spermatocytes of testis. The prmt5 transcripts were detected as early as the one-cell stage and in all the tissues of embryos during embryogenesis. In summary, prmt5 is a maternal determinant factor of embryogenesis of medaka, possibly playing an important role in oogenesis and spermatogenesis in adult medaka.
