As a central component of innate immunity, complement activation is a critical mechanism of containment and clearance of microbial pathogens in advance of the development of acquired immunity. Several pathogens restrict complement activation through the acquisition of host proteins that regulate complement activation or through the production of their own complement regulatory molecules (M. K. Liszewski, M. K. Leung, R. Hauhart, R. M. Buller, P. Bertram, X. Wang, A. M. Rosengard, G. J. Kotwal, and J. P. Atkinson, J. Immunol. 176:3725-3734, 2006; J. Lubinski, L. Wang, D. Mastellos, A. Sahu, J. D. Lambris, and H. M. Friedman, J. Exp. Med. 190:1637-1646, 1999). The infectious stage of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi produces a surface-anchored complement regulatory protein (CRP) that functions to inhibit alternative and classical pathway complement activation (K. A. Norris, B. Bradt, N. R. Cooper, and M. So, J. Immunol. 147:2240-2247, 1991). This study addresses the genomic complexity of the T. cruzi CRP and its relationship to the T. cruzi supergene family comprising active trans-sialidase (TS) and TS-like proteins. The TS superfamily consists of several functionally distinct subfamilies that share a characteristic sialidase domain at their amino termini. These TS families include active TS, adhesions, CRPs, and proteins of unknown functions (G. A. Cross and G. B. Takle, Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 47:385-411, 1993). A sequence comparison search of GenBank using BLASTP revealed several full-length paralogs of CRP. These proteins share significant homology at their amino termini and a strong spatial conservation of cysteine residues. Alternative pathway complement regulation was confirmed for CRP paralogs with 58% (low) and 83% (high) identity to AAB49414. CRPs are functionally similar to the microbial and mammalian proteins that regulate complement activation. Sequence alignment of mammalian complement control proteins to CRP showed that these sequences are distinct, supporting a convergent evolutionary pathway. Finally, we show that a clonal line of T. cruzi expresses multiple unique copies of CRP that are differentially recognized by patient sera.
