cDNAs encoding human interleukin 6 (hIL-6) and its variants lacking the N-terminal Pro and Pro-Val-Pro-Pro, respectively, were expressed in Bacillus brevis by using the signal peptide fusion approach. The presence of Pro at the N-terminus of the mature protein hindered the action of the Bacillus brevis signal peptidase. hIL-6 lacking the N-terminal Pro-Val-Pro-Pro was most efficiently secreted in a biologically active form and accumulated in the culture medium to a level of 200 mg per liter, which is the highest level reported for the bacterial secretion of hIL-6.
