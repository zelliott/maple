Sera were analysed for levels of IgA- and IgG-class and IgA-subclass antibodies against tetanus toxoid and synthesized, tetanus-toxoid, beta-chain peptides. Forty-five peptides, deduced from the amino-acid sequence of the tetanus-toxoid beta-chain, were synthesized, in order to analyse epitope-binding of antibodies. Monoclonal, human, anti-tetanus antibodies were used to evaluate the synthesized peptides. Five synthesized peptides, bound by high, medium or low levels of IgA antibodies, were selected for the quantification of IgA1 and IgA2 antibodies. A set of chimeric, IgA-subclass antibodies with NP-specificity were used to quantify the antigen-specific IgA-subclass antibodies in a novel assay. Antibodies against the synthesized peptides were predominantly of IgA1 subclass.
