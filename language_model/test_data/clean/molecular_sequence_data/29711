In fission yeast, nutrient starvation induces physiological, biochemical, and morphological changes that enable survival. Collectively these changes are referred to as stationary phase. We have used a green fluorescent protein random insertional mutagenesis system to isolate two novel stress-response proteins required in stationary phase. Ish1 is a nuclear envelope protein that is present throughout the cell cycle and whose expression is increased in response to stresses such as glucose and nitrogen starvation, as well as osmotic stress. Expression of Ish1 is regulated by the Spc1 MAPK pathway through the Atf1 transcription factor. Although overexpression of Ish1 is lethal, cells lacking ish1 exhibit reduced viability in stationary phase. Bis1 is a novel interacting partner of Ish1. Bis1 is the Schizosaccharomyces pombe member of the ES2 nuclear protein family found in Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens, and Arabidopsis thaliana. Overexpression of Bis1 results in a cell elongation phenotype, whereas bis1(-) cells exhibit a reduced viability in stationary phase similar to that seen in ish1(-) cells.
