A physical and functional map of Aspergillus tubingensis mtDNA type 2b was constructed and compared to Aspergillus niger typeI a mtDNA. The gene content and order, as well as the patterns of restriction sites, were similar. Two unidentified ORFs and several repeat elements were found in the region between the ndhl and ndh4 genes on both mtDNAs. The sizes of the A. niger and A. tubingensis mtDNAs were 31.23 and 33.06 kb. respectively, the difference was principally attributed to the altered intron content of their coxl genes.
