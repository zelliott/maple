Protein synthesis in mouse embryo fibroblastic (NIH-L1) cells was stimulated by addition of fibronectin (FN) to the culture medium as a soluble factor. This stimulatory activity of FN appeared only when the cells were cultured over their saturated density. A hexapeptide (GRGDSP) containing the RGDS cell attachment site of FN could not prevent the stimulation of protein synthesis. Moreover, activity of the stimulatory FN was not affected by inclusion of cytochalasin B, which is known to release FN from cell surface by disorganizing actin cytoarchitecture. These results suggest that the signaling of change in protein synthesis rate by FN may be distinct from signaling involving cell attachment and spreading.
