Spontaneous and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT)-induced mutation spectra were determined at the hisD3052 allele of Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, YG1021 (nitroreductase-overproducing) and YG1024 (O-acetyltransferase-overproducing). In TA98, 55% (11/20) of the spontaneous reversions and 95% (19/20) of reversions in TNT-treated plates were deletions of two bases at the same site (-2 hotspot deletions), whereas the respective figures were 65% (13/20) and 80% (16/20) in YG1021, and 75% (15/20) and 95% (19/20) in YG1024. Other mutations observed in the TNT treatment were complex frameshifts consisting of either a -2 hotspot deletion and a base substitution, or a +1 addition and base substitution at the stop codon. In addition, different kinds of deletions were recovered in the spontaneous spectra. The elevated enzymatic activities of strains, YG1021 and YG1024, resulting in enhanced mutagenicity of TNT, did not seem to have an effect on the spectrum of TNT-induced mutations. However, the YG strains, which also have a higher spontaneous revertant yield than the parental strain TA98, seemed to differ from TA98 in their spontaneous spectra. The increase consisted of revertants containing the -2 hotspot deletion, possibly indicating elevated activation of exogenous or endogenous premutagens by the higher enzyme activities of the YG strains.
