Synthesis of dihydroceramide is catalyzed by a family of (dihydro)ceramide synthases (CerS), first identified in yeast as longevity-assurance genes. Six members (CerS1-6; Lass1-6) of this gene family have been identified in mammals. We examined expression of CerS genes during postnatal development in mouse brain by means of Northern blot analysis, real-time RT-PCR, and in situ-hybridization. In situ-hybridization experiments showed that CerS1 was the predominant CerS in neurons throughout the brain. This observation is in line with the high levels of C18:0-ceramide in neurons and the substrate specificity of CerS1. A similar distribution, but lower expression levels, were found for CerS4 and CerS6. Only low or undetectable amounts of CerS1, CerS4 and CerS6 were, however, present in white matter. In contrast, CerS5 mRNA was detected in most cells within gray and white matter of all brain regions, suggesting ubiquitous expression of this palmitoyl-CoA specific CerS. Expression of CerS2 was transiently increased during the period of active myelination. Furthermore, expression of CerS2 was specifically localized to white matter tracts of the brain. Furthermore, CerS2 was the predominant CerS in Schwann cells of sciatic nerves. These data suggest that CerS2 is important for the synthesis of dihydroceramide used for synthesis of myelin sphingolipids.
