It has been established that the precise positioning of nucleosomes on genomic DNA can be achieved, at least for a minority of them, through sequence-dependent processes. However, to what extent DNA sequences play a role in the positioning of the major part of nucleosomes is still debated. The aim of the present study is to examine to what extent long-range correlations (LRC) are related to the presence of nucleosomes. Using the wavelet transform technique, we perform a comparative analysis of the DNA text and of the corresponding bending profiles generated with curvature tables based on nucleosome positioning data. The exploration of a number of eukaryotic and bacterial genomes through the optics of the so-called "wavelet transform microscope" reveals a characteristic scale of 100-200 bp that separates two regimes of different LRC. Here, we focus on the existence of LRC in the small-scale regime (10-200 bp) which are actually observed in eukaryotic genomes, in contrast to their absence in eubacterial genomes. Analysis of viral DNA genomes shows that, like their host's genomes, eukaryotic viruses present LRC but eubacterial viruses do not. There is one exception for genomes of poxviruses (Vaccinia and Melamoplus sanguinipes) which do not replicate in the cell nucleus and do not exhibit LRC. No small-scale LRC are detected in the genomes of all examined RNA viruses, with the exception of retroviruses. These results together with the observation of LRC between particular sequence motifs known to participate in the formation of nucleosomes (e.g. AA dinucleotides) strongly suggest that the 10-200 bp LRC are a signature of the sequence-dependence of nucleosome positioning. Finally, we discuss possible interpretations of these LRC in terms of the physical mechanisms that might govern the positioning and the dynamics of the nucleosomes along the DNA chain through cooperative processes.
