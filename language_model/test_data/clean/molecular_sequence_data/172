Glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) produces gamma-aminobutyric acid, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in adult mammalian brain. Previous experiments, performed in brain, showed that GAD65 gene possesses two TATA-less promoters, although the significance is unknown. Here, by rapid amplification of cDNA ends method, two distinct GAD65 mRNA isoforms transcribed from two independent clusters of transcription start sites were identified in post-natal rat testis. RT-PCR results revealed that the two mRNA isoforms had distinct expression patterns during post-natal testis maturation, suggesting that GAD65 gene expression was regulated by alternative promoters at the transcription level. By using GAD65-specific antibodies, western blotting analysis showed that the 58-kDa GAD65, N-terminal 69 amino acids truncated form of full-length GAD65 protein, was developmentally expressed during post-natal testis maturation, suggesting that GAD65 gene expression in testis may also be regulated by post-translational processing. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that GAD65 protein was presented in Leydig cells of Day 1 testis, primary spermatocytes and spermatids of postnatal of Day 90 testis. The above results suggested that GAD65 gene expression is dynamically regulated at multiple levels during post-natal testis maturation.
