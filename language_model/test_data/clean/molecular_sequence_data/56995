A specific 1542-bp DNA fragment was amplified from Mycoplasma fermentans (incognitus strain) using a unique 23-nucleotide (nt) synthetic deoxyribonucleotide (oligo) (5'-TCCAAAAAGTCCGGAATTTGGGG) as the primer pair in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The 23-nt sequence is part of the 29-bp terminal inverted repeat (IR) which forms the left potential stem-and-loop (s&l) structure of the previously identified M. fermentans insertion-sequence(IS)-like genetic element [Hu et al., Gene 93 (1990) 67-72]. The amplified DNA was cloned and sequenced. A pair of 27-bp IR containing the 23-nt synthetic oligo was identified at both termini. Between the IR, there are four potential open reading frames (ORFs) which are arranged adjacent to each other in the order, ORF-1, ORF-2, ORF-3 and ORF-4, with parts of ORF-1 and ORF-2 overlapping. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequences of ORF-2, ORF-3 and ORF-4 are 34 to 60% identical to the translation initiation factor IF3 (encoded by the infC gene), ribosomal proteins L35 (rpmI gene) and L20 (rplT gene) of Escherichia coli and Bacillus stearothermophilus, respectively. In bacteria, the infC-rpmI-rplT genes are organized to function as an operon. There are multiple sites with promoter-like sequences identified upstream from the putative infC gene in the mycoplasma closely resembling the gene arrangement in the bacterial operon. All three genes of ORF-2, ORF-3 and ORF-4 are preceded individually by a strong appropriately spaced (7 and 10 bp) putative Shine-Dalgarno sequence (5'-AAGGA).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
