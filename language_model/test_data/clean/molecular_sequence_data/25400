Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based DNA amplification has replaced many time-consuming protocols in molecular biology. Here we describe a simple strategy to quickly select deletion mutants based on PCR methodology which then can be confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. A forward PCR primer is designed in such a way to recognize only the wild type sequences in the amplification reaction and thus a negative selection identifies the deletion in the samples.
