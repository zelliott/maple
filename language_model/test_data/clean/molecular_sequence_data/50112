The nucleotide sequence of exons 2 and 3 of B*4408 has been confirmed. This allele has now been found in five, apparently unrelated, north-western European Caucasoid subjects, residing in Wales, on HLA haplotypes bearing: A*0201, Cw*0501 with DRB1*0401, DQA1*03, DQB1*0301 in four instances and DRB1*0701, DQA1*0201, DQB1*0202 in one instance. The unique serological reactivity of 'HLA-B44BO' was established using up to nine B*4408 subjects and was easily identified using a variety of B44 and B62 antisera. The phenotype and gene frequencies of B*4408, in a sample of 40 473 subjects residing in Wales, were 0.01235% and 0.00006, respectively.
