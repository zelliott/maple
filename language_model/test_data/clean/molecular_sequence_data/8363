The transcriptional regulation of the Streptococcus salivarius ptsH and ptsI genes coding for the general energy-coupling proteins HPr and enzyme I of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system were investigated. These genes form an operon with the gene order ptsH-ptsI. Three distinct mRNA species were detected: a 0.5 kb transcript specific for ptsH, and two long transcripts (2.2 and 2.4 kb) covering the whole pts operon. Transcription of all these mRNAs initiated at the same nucleotide located 9 bp downstream from a promoter located immediately upstream from the ptsH gene. The presence of a high-energy stem-loop structure (T0) located at the beginning of ptsI was responsible for the premature transcription termination generating the 0.5 kb ptsH-specific transcript. The long transcripts ended in the poly(U) region of two rho-independent-like terminators (T1 and T2) at the 3' end of ptsI. Studies with a 2-deoxyglucose-resistant spontaneous mutant of S. salivarius (L26) that produces an HPr-EI fusion protein suggest that the regulation of HPr and EI expression involves transcriptional as well as translational mechanisms.
