The canine-adapted Helicobacter bizzozeronii is the only nonpylori Helicobacter species isolated from human gastric biopsy tissue. Here we present the genome sequence of strain CIII-1, isolated from a 45-year-old female patient with severe gastric symptoms. This is the first genome sequence of nonpylori gastric Helicobacter isolated from human gastritis.
