The Pb99 gene is specifically expressed in pre-B cells and thymocytes and not in mature B and T cells or nonlymphoid tissues, implying that it may function in early lymphoid development. We have previously described the cloning of an incomplete cDNA for Pb99. Here we report the isolation of full-length cDNAs and genomic clones for the murine Pb99 gene and the mapping of its location to mouse chromosome 8. Sequence analyses of different Pb99 cDNA clones suggest that there may be at least three forms of the Pb99 protein generated by differential processing of the Pb99 transcript. The cDNA with the longest open reading frame encodes a putative protein that has seven hydrophobic domains similar to those of seven membrane-spanning proteins, such as the classical G protein-coupled receptors. To directly address the role of the Pb99 protein in lymphoid development, Pb99-deficient mice were generated by gene targeting, and lymphocyte development in these mice was analyzed.
