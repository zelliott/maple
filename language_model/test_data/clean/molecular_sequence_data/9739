A novel human chemokine STCP-1 (stimulated T cell chemotactic protein) was isolated from an activated macrophage cDNA library. The chemokine has four cysteines positioned in a manner that identifies STCP-1 as a member of the CC chemokine family. The amino acid sequence shows 34% identity with RANTES. The gene consists of 3 exons and 2 introns with the position of intron/exon boundaries similar to that of RANTES. The gene is expressed as a 3.4-kilobase transcript on lymph node, thymus, and Appendix. STCP-1 induces Ca2+ mobilization in a small percentage of primary activated T lymphocytes, but on repeated stimulation the percentage of T lymphocytes that respond to STCP-1 increases. The chemokine STCP-1 does not induce Ca2+ mobilization in monocytes, dendritic cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, lipopolysaccharide-activated B lymphocytes, and freshly isolated resting T lymphocytes. Similarly, STCP-1, while acting as a mild chemoattractant for primary activated T lymphocytes, is a potent chemoattractant for chronically activated T lymphocytes but has no chemoattractant activity for monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and resting T lymphocytes. As STCP-1 acts specifically on activated T lymphocytes, it may play a role in the trafficking of activated/effector T lymphocytes to inflammatory sites and other aspects of activated T lymphocyte physiology.
