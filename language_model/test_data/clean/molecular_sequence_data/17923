From a methanolic extract of leaves of Alangium platanifolium var. trilobum, benzyl alcohol xylopyranosyl(1---6)glucopyranoside, phenethyl alcohol xylopyranosyl(1----6)glucopyranoside and Z-hex-3-en-1-ol (aoba alcohol) xylopyranosyl(1----6)glucopyranoside were isolated. Their structures were determined mainly by NMR spectroscopy.
