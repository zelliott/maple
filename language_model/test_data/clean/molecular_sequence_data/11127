A 3.1 kb fragment of Bacillus stearothermophilus ATCC12980 DNA permitted growth of Escherichia coli on sucrose. The fragment encoded genes for a levansucrase (surB) and also a levanase (surC). SurB and SurC shared 97% and 43% amino acid identity with the corresponding SacB and SacC proteins of Bacillus subtilis, whose sacB and sacC genes are organised very differently.
