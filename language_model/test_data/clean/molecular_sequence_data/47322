Lactobacillus casei, Lact. paracasei and Lact. rhamnosus form a closely related taxonomic group within the heterofermentative lactobacilli. These three species are difficult to differentiate using traditional fermentation profiles. We have developed polymerase chain reaction primers which are specific for each of these species based on differences in the V1 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Sixty-three Lactobacillus isolates from cheese were identified using these primers. The 12 Lact. rhamnosus and 51 Lact. paracasei identified in this way were also differentiated using a randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primer.
