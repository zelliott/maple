An anti-verotoxin 2 (VT2) antibody immunoreactive 5-kDa polypeptide (Virp5), has been obtained through screening of the rat spinal cord cDNA library with the aid of anti-VT2 antibody. Virp5 was mainly expressed in the central nervous system, liver and kidney, and localized at glia-like cells and nerve fibers in the central nervous system, vascular endothelial cells and hepatic cells in the liver, as well as epithelial cells of distal tubules in the kidney. Intravenous administration of purified Virp5 elicited a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure. These results suggest that Virp5 commonly exists in the body, being partly playing a role in regulating the blood pressure.
