Translocation liposarcoma protein (TLS)-associated serine-arginine (TASR)-1 and -2 are two newly identified serine-arginine splicing factors. Our recent studies suggest that disruption of TASR-mediated pre-mRNA splicing is involved in the pathogenesis of human leukemia and sarcomas. The mRNA transcripts for TASR-1 and -2 share an identical sequence at the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) and in part of the coding region; however the other regions of the transcripts diverge from each other and it was not clear whether the differences resulted from alternative splicing or transcription from two distinct genes. Here we describe the assignment of both TASR cDNAs to the same 16 kb DNA segment located on chromosome 1. Despite the presence of at least three retroposed products of TASR-1 mRNA in the human genome, only the 16 kb structural TASR gene on chromosome 1 is actively transcribed. In addition, multiple polyadenylation sites and a rare U12-type intron were found within the TASR gene. Transcription initiation site of the TASR gene was determined by primer extension; analysis of the TASR promoter revealed that it lacks the TATA box but contains a GC-rich sequence. When cloned into a luciferase reporter and transfected into human cells, the TASR promoter construct generated luciferase activity that was at least 2000 fold greater than the promoterless plasmid. Northern blot analysis showed that at least five different TASR-1 and -2 transcripts are expressed in a broad range of human tissues.
