The subcellular localization of natural and engineered forms of the chicken thyroid hormone receptor (cTR alpha) is dependent on amino acids encoded in the N-terminal region. The full length receptor protein, cTR alpha-p46, was found to localize exclusively to the nucleus, whereas the N-terminally shorter variant, cTR alpha-p40, localizes to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The exclusive nuclear localization of cTR alpha-p46 is dependent on the presence of the first 11 N-terminal amino acids, but independent of the phosphorylation of the serine at position 12. Our data identify a novel role for an N-terminal domain of the full length thyroid hormone receptor.
