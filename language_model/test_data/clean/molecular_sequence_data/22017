A slightly halophilic alphaproteobacterium, designated CL-SP26T, was isolated from hypersaline water of a solar saltern located in Seosin, Korea. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed an affiliation with the genus Jannaschia. Sequence similarities between CL-SP26T and type strains of members of the genus Jannaschia were 94.9-97.2 %. Cells were rod-shaped and motile with one or more monopolar flagella. Strain CL-SP26T grew on solid media as circular red colonies. It was able to grow in 3-10 % sea salt; however, no growth occurred in media containing NaCl as the only salt. Strain CL-SP26T grew at 5-35 degrees C and pH 7-10. The major fatty acids were 18 : 1omega7c (64 %) and 18 : 0 (12.0 %). Three fatty acids, 3-OH 14 : 0/iso 16 : 1 (3.6 %), 18 : 3omega6c (2.2 %) and 10-methyl 19 : 0 (1.9 %), found in minor quantities in CL-SP26(T), are unique among Jannaschia species. The DNA G+C content was 63 mol%. According to physiological data, fatty acid composition and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, CL-SP26T was assigned to the genus Jannaschia, but could be distinguished from recognized species of the genus. Strain CL-SP26T (= KCCM 42114T = JCM 13035T) therefore represents a novel species, for which the name Jannaschia seosinensis sp. nov. is proposed.
