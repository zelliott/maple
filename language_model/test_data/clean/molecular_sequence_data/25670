We have completely assigned the extreme low-field ring-NH nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of a self-cleaving RNA in the absence of magnesium ions by experiments involving sequential Overhauser enhancements between adjacent base pairs. These assignments substantiate the hammerhead secondary folding model proposed by Symons and co-workers for this class of self-cleaving RNA [Hutchins, C. J., Rathjen, P. D., Forster, A. C., & Symons, R. H. (1986) Nucleic Acids Res. 14, 3627-3640; Forster, A. C. & Symons, R. H. (1987) Cell 49, 211-220; Kneese, P., & Symons, R. H. (1987) in Viroids and Viroid-like Pathogens (Semancick, J. S., Ed.) pp 1-47, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL]. No resonances due to tertiary base pairs could be identified in the low-field spectrum, and addition of MgCl2 to the sample did not produce additional resonances in this region of the spectrum.
