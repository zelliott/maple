Comparison of DNA sequences of the rat (Rattus norvegicus) olfactory receptor gene family revealed an unusual pattern of nucleotide substitution in the gene region encoding the second extracellular domain (E2) of the protein. In this domain, nonsynonymous nucleotide differences between members of this subfamily that caused a change in amino acid residue polarity were over four times more frequent than nonsynonymous differences that did not cause a polarity change. This nonrandom pattern of nucleotide substitution is evidence of past directional selection favoring diversification of the E2 domain among members of this subfamily. This in turn suggests that E2 may play some important role in the functions unique to each member of the olfactory receptor family, and that it may perhaps be an odorant binding domain.
