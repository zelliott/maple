Dihydroneopterin aldolase (DHNA) catalyzes both the cleavage of 7,8-dihydro-D-neopterin (DHNP) to form 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin (HP) and glycolaldehyde and the epimerization of DHNP to form 7,8-dihydro-L-monapterin (DHMP). Whether the epimerization reaction uses the same reaction intermediate as the aldol reaction or the deprotonation and reprotonation of C2' of DHNP has been investigated by NMR analysis of the reaction products in a D2O solvent. No deuteration of C2' was observed for the newly formed DHMP. This result strongly suggests that the epimerization reaction uses the same reaction intermediate as the aldol reaction. In contrast with an earlier observation, the DHNA-catalyzed reaction is reversible, which also supports a nonstereospecific retroaldol/aldol mechanism for the epimerization reaction. The binding and catalytic properties of DHNAs from both Staphylococcus aureus (SaDHNA) and Escherichia coli (EcDHNA) were determined by equilibrium binding and transient kinetic studies. A complete set of kinetic constants for both the aldol and epimerization reactions according to a unified kinetic mechanism was determined for both SaDHNA and EcDHNA. The results show that the two enzymes have significantly different binding and catalytic properties, in accordance with the significant sequence differences between them.
