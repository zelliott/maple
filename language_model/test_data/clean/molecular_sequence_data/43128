Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was found to resemble avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in its interaction with erythrocytes. Inactivation of the receptors on erythrocytes by neuraminidase treatment and restoration of receptors by reattaching N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) to cell surface components indicated that alpha 2,3-linked Neu5Ac serves as a receptor determinant for TGEV as has been reported recently for IBV. Similar to IBV, the haemagglutinating activity of TGEV is evident only after pretreatment of virus with neuraminidase indicating that inhibitors on the virion surface have to be inactivated in order to induce the HA-activity of these viruses. A model is presented to explain why the HA-activity of untreated virus is masked and how neuraminidase treatment results in the unmasking of this activity.
