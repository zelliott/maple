Recent progress in the molecular analysis of bacterial septation and chromosome partitioning suggests that these processes may involve cytoskeletal elements previously thought to be present only in eukaryotic cells. The continued biochemical and genetic analysis of key proteins, such as the tubulin-like FtsZ, should lead to further unravelling of the regulation and mechanism of bacterial cell division.
