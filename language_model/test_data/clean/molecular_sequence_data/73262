The S4 segment is an important part of the voltage sensor in voltage-gated ion channels. Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, which are members of the superfamily of voltage-gated channels, have little inherent sensitivity to voltage despite the presence of an S4 segment. We made chimeras between a voltage-independent rat olfactory channel (rolf) and the voltage-dependent ether-Ã -go-go K+ channel (eag) to determine the basis of their divergent gating properties. We found that the rolf S4 segment can support a voltage-dependent mechanism of activation in eag, suggesting that rolf has a potentially functional voltage sensor that is silent during gating. In addition, we found that the S3-S4 loop of rolf increases the relative stability of the open conformation of eag, effectively converting eag into a voltage-independent channel. A single charged residue in the loop makes a significant contribution to the relative stabilization of the open stage in eag. Our data suggest that cyclic nucleotide-gated channels such as rolf contain a voltage sensor which, in the physiological voltage range, is stabilized in an activated conformation that is permissive for pore opening.
