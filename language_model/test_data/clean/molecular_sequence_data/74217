The IMP-4 metallo-beta-lactamase, originally recognized in Acinetobacter spp. from Hong Kong, more recently appeared simultaneously in isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae from Sydney and Melbourne, Australia. The bla(IMP-4)-qacG2-aacA4-catB3 cassette array was found in isolates from both cities, but in different wider genetic contexts and on different plasmids, suggesting movement of this array by homologous recombination.
