The conformation of a cyclic decapeptide analog of a repeat sequence of elastin has been determined in the crystalline state using X-ray crystallographic techniques. Tetragonal crystals were grown from a solution of the decapeptide in water; space group P4(2)2(1)2, a = 19.439(2) & c = 13.602(1) A, with four formula units (C40H66N10O10.4H2O) per unit cell. The cyclic decapeptide in the crystal exhibits exact twofold symmetry. The asymmetric unit contains one pentapeptide and two water molecules for a total of 32 nonhydrogen atoms. The structure has been determined by the application of direct methods and refined by full-matrix least squares to an R index of 0.053 for 2272 reflections with intensities greater than 2 sigma(I). The backbone conformation of the asymmetric pentapeptide can be described as consisting of a double beta bend of Type III-I. The Type III turn has Pro (phi = -59.3 degrees, psi = -26.8 degrees) and Ala (phi = -65.9 degrees, psi = -23.1 degrees) at the corners while Type I turn has Ala (phi = -65.9 degrees, psi = -23.1 degrees) and Val (phi = -98.9 degrees, psi = 8.3 degrees) as the corner residues. The cyclic decapeptide has two such double bends linked together by Gly-Val bridges.
