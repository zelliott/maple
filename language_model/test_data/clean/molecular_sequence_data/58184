Sequences upstream of the 3'-terminal tRNA-like structure of brome mosaic virus RNAs have been predicted to fold into several stem-loop and pseudoknot structures. To elucidate the functional role of this upstream region, a series of deletions was made in cDNA clones of RNA-3, a genomic component not required for replication. These deletion mutants were transcribed in vitro and cotransfected with RNA-1 and RNA-2 into barley protoplasts. Deletion of single stem-loop structures gave progeny retaining near-wild-type accumulation levels. Constructions representing deletion of two or three stem-loops substantially lowered the accumulation of progeny RNA-3 relative to wild-type levels. RNA-3 mutants bearing deletions of longer sequences or of the entire region (delta PsKs RNA-3) replicated poorly, yielding no detectable RNA-3 or RNA-4 progeny. Levels of RNA-1 and RNA-2, in the presence of a mutant RNA-3, were found to increase relative to the accumulation observed in a complete wild-type transfection. The stability of delta PsKs RNA-3 in protoplasts was somewhat lower than that of wild-type RNA during the first 3 h postinoculation. Little difference in translatability in vitro of wild-type and RNA-3 constructs bearing deletions within the stem-loop region was observed, and Western immunoblot analysis of viral coat protein produced in transfected protoplasts showed that protein accumulation paralleled the amount of RNA-4 message produced from the various sequences evaluated. These results indicate that the RNA-3 pseudoknot region plays a minor role in translational control but contributes substantially to the overall replication of the brome mosaic virus genome.
