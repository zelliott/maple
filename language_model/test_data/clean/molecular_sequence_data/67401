Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a virulent tick-borne disease with a case fatality rate ranging from 10-50% for tick-borne transmission, and up to 80% for nosocomial transmission. Human cases have been reported in over 30 countries across Europe, Asia, and Africa. It appears to be spreading to new areas with several countries reporting their first human cases of CCHF disease within the past 10 years. We report a novel real-time RT-PCR assay designed to amplify a conserved region of the CCHF virus S segment. It is capable of detecting strains from all 7 groups of CCHF, including the AP92 strain that until recently represented a lineage of strains that were not associated with human disease. The limit of detection of the assay is 5 copies of target RNA, and the assay shows no cross-reactivity with other viruses from within the same genus, or with viruses causing similar human disease.
