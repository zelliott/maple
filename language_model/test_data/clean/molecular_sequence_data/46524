The complete nucleotide sequence of the duck minor alpha D-globin gene including the flanking regions has been determined. A unique structural feature of the alpha D-globin gene is a GC instead of the invariant GT dinucleotide at the 5' end of the second intervening sequence. The 1013 base pair long gene has otherwise all the characteristics normally attributed to a functional globin gene. Indirect evidence suggests that the alpha D-globin gene is expressed in vivo.
