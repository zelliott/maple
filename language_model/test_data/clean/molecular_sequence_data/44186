About 8 hr after the initiation of development in Dictyostelium discoideum, a few randomly scattered cells express prestalk specific genes and subsequently sort out to the top of the aggregate where they form a tip. The tip elongates and forms the anterior of the migrating slug before differentiating into a stalk which supports the ball of spores in a mature fruiting body. Using REMI mutagenesis we isolated a mutant strain, AK244, in which the initial aggregate subdivides to give a highly papillated surface. This mutant fails to form slugs and appears to have a defect in sorting of prestalk cells. The disrupted gene, tipA, encodes a novel 83-kDa protein and is preferentially expressed in PST-O cells after the cell types have sorted out. Mutant strains that lack TipA express the prestalk-specific gene ecmA at reduced levels and form very few spores. These defects cannot be overcome by developing the mutant cells in the presence of wild-type cells. Thus, TipA acts in a cell-autonomous manner at an early stage in development. Using strains carrying reporter constructs, we found that mutant cells expressing a prestalk marker remain dispersed in the aggregates. Prespore cells appear to sort such that the base is free of cells expressing cell-type-specific markers. Even after 20 hr of development, when wild-type cells are undergoing terminal differentiation, prestalk cells in tipA mutants form very small clumps, most of which fail to sort to the periphery or the tops of aggregates. The tipA gene appears to play an essential role in the sorting of the initial cell types.
