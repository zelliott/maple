The multicatalytic endopeptidase complex (20S proteasome) is a latent high-molecular-mass multisubunit proteinase. In many investigations, SDS has been used as a proteasome activator at some fixed concentration that was apparently optimal. This study examined the effects of various divalent cations on the SDS-dependent peptidase and casein degradation activities of 20S proteasome purified from Xenopus laevis oocytes at a series of SDS concentrations and the correlation between these effects and the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of SDS. Surprisingly, it was found that divalent cations such as Mg2+ markedly shifted the SDS-dependent activation profiles to a lower concentration range. Ca2+, Mn2+, Co2+, and Zn2+ also markedly reduced the optimum SDS concentration in the Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-MCA hydrolysis reaction: for example, 5 mM Co2+ reduced the optimum SDS concentration from 0.065 to 0.005%. However, in all cases examined the optimum concentrations were below the CMC. Cu2+, Hg2+, and Cd2+ strongly inhibited the SDS-dependent maximum activity without remarkably shifting the optimum SDS concentration. No correlation between the shift and the inhibition was recognized. Most interestingly, remarkable activation of casein degradation by SDS was observed only by addition of the divalent cations Mg2+, Ca2+, and Mn2+. These cations might be essential for casein degradation. The activation and inactivation ranges of SDS concentration varied with the species of substrate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
