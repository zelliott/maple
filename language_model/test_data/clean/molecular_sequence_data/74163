The majority of aphid species release an alarm pheromone with the most common component being the sesquiterpene (E)-beta-farnesene, sometimes accompanied by other sesquiterpenes or monoterpenes. The genes/enzymes involved in the production of these compounds have not been identified in aphids although some components of isoprenoid biosynthesis have been identified in other insect species. Here we report the cloning, expression and characterisation of a prenyltransferase from the aphid Myzus persicae which can act as a farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase or a geranyl pyrophosphate synthase to produce both sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes and hence could be responsible for the biosynthesis of the observed components of the alarm pheromones. In addition, the enzyme can utilise geranyl pyrophosphate to produce farnesyl pyrophosphate showing that the synthesis of the latter involves the sequential condensation of isoprenyl pyrophosphate units.
