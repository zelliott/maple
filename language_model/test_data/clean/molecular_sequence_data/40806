An open reading frame (ORF) was found in the mitochondrial genome of the Pan2-16 strain of Didymium iridis that showed high similarity to the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (nad3) gene in other organisms. So far all other typical mitochondrial genes identified in this organism require RNA editing to generate ORFs capable of directing protein synthesis. The D. iridis sequence was compared to the putative nad3 gene in the related myxomycete Physarum polycephalum, which would require editing. Based on this comparison, editing sites could be predicted for the P. polycelphalum gene that would result in the synthesis of a highly conserved ND3 protein between the two organisms. To determine the editing status of the nad3 gene in other D. iridis strains, PCR was used to amplify this region from eight other independent isolates of the A1 Central American interbreeding series. In each case a 378 base pair ORF was detected by PCR amplification and sequencing. Three patterns of sequence variation were observed; however all base substitutions were in the third codon position and silent with respect to the amino acids encoded. The distribution of the sequence variants was mapped geographically. The requirement for RNA editing in all other typical mitochondrial genes of D. iridis and P. polycephalum and the presence of RNA editing in the nad3 gene of P. polycephalum suggest that the D. iridis nad3 gene might have been edited at one time. We propose that the D. iridis nad3 gene may have lost the requirement for RNA editing by reverse transcription of an edited transcript that subsequently was inserted into the genome.
