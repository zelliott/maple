Mycoplasma synoviae (MS) species-specific primers selected from the 16S rRNA sequence were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The MS primers were MS-1 (5'-GAAGCAAAATAGTGATATCA-3') and MS-2 (5'-GTCGTCTCCGAAGTTAACAA-3'). Analysis of cultures of avian mycoplasmas using the MS PCR indicated 100% specificity and sensitivity: 55 individual isolates of MS tested PCR-positive, and 44 isolates of eight other species of avian mycoplasmas tested PCR-negative. The MS PCR will detect 100 colony-forming units of MS. Analysis of 122 flock data sets indicated a sensitivity for the MS PCR test of 82% and a specificity of 100% as determined by comparison with culture, serology (serum plate test, hemagglutination-inhibition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), epizootiology, and history.
