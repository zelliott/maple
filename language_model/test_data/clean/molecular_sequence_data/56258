A glycoprotein, with apparent molecular weight in SDS-polyacrylamide gels of 37 kDa, has been isolated from the excretory-secretory (ES) products of the adult stage of Trichostrongylus colubriformis, a parasitic nematode. This protein is the major ES product recognized in immunoblots by lymph from a naturally infected sheep. A synthetic oligonucleotide, based on peptide sequence data from a digest of the purified protein was used to successfully screen a cDNA library. A cDNA clone was isolated which encoded a presumptive protein precursor of 220 amino acids that contained a 63 amino acid region of which more than 35% of the residues were proline, three peptide sequences determined from the natural component, and three potential N-glycosylation sites, consistent with the protein being isolated from the lectin-bound fraction of the adult ES products. The presumptive, processed, amino terminus encoded by the cDNA clone was preceded by a signal-like, hydrophobic-rich region of 16 amino acids.
