Eukaryotic RNA polymerases I and III consist of multiple subunits. Each of these enzymes includes two distinct and evolutionarily conserved subunits called alpha-related subunits which are shared only by polymerases I and III. The alpha-related subunits show limited homology with the alpha-subunit of prokaryotic RNA polymerase. To gain further insight into the structure and function of alpha-related subunits, we cloned and characterized a gene from Schizosaccharomyces pombe that encodes a protein of 17 kDa which can functionally replace AC19 - an alpha-related subunit of RNA polymerases I and III of Saccharomyces cerevisiae - and was thus named rpa17+. RPA17 has 125 amino acids and shows 63% identity to AC19 over a 108-residue stretch, whereas the N-terminal regions of the two proteins are highly divergent. Disruption of rpa17+ shows that the gene is essential for cell growth. Sequence comparison with other alpha-related subunits from different species showed that RPA17 contains an 81-amino acid block that is evolutionarily conserved. Deletion analysis of the N- and C-terminal regions of RPA17 and AC19 confirms that the 81-amino acid block is important for the function of the alpha-related subunits.
