Following the complete sequence elucidation of human pancreatic stone protein (immunoreactive form PSP S1 isolated from pancreatic juice) [(1987) Eur. J. Biochem. 168, 201-207], the location of the three S-S bridges of the protein was investigated. The cystine-containing peptides, detected after the separation of the peptic or chymotryptic digests on SP-Sephadex or Sephadex G-50, were submitted to Edman degradation and/or to oxidation. The cysteic peptides after separation on SP-Sephadex or Sephadex G-50 were characterized by their amino acid compositions. The pairing of the half-cystines: Cys 3-Cys 14, Cys 31-Cys 129 and Cys 104-Cys 121 was determined. The same experiments carried out with PSP S2-5 (other immunoreactive forms) gave an identical characterization.
