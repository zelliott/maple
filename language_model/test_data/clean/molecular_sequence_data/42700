A method of positive identification of the specificity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product using internal oligonucleotide probe is introduced. The hybridization was done on the agarose gel which was dried after electrophoresis. Detection of the expression of T cell receptor a chain variable (TCR V alpha) genes on mRNA level was used as the experimental model. Twenty nine TCR V alpha gene subfamilies could be distinguished clearly in healthy human peripheral blood lymphocytes by this method. Positive identification of PCR product on dried agarose gel by internal oligonucleotide probe is relatively simple and less time consuming.
