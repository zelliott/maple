Computer system mRNA-FAST (mRNA--Function, Activity, STructure; http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/dbases/trsig/) is described. The system has been developed to analyze nucleotide sequences of mRNA and to measure their essential properties. The system compiles the data base on translation signals including nucleotide sequences of the regulatory regions with structural and experimental information on their specific activities. It also contains programs to search for local homology between mRNA and translation signals, to search for potential signals basing on analysis of the oligonucleotide dictionaries, and to model secondary RNA structure. Possible applications of the system mRNA-FAST are discussed.
