Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) has been implicated to play a key role in integrin-mediated signal transduction in cell migration. Grb7 is an Src homology (SH) 2-containing and pleckstrin homology domain-containing molecule, which shares significant homology with the Caenorhabditis elegans gene for Mig-10 involved in cell migration during embryogenesis. Here, we report that the SH2 domain of Grb7 can directly interact with FAK through Tyr-397, a major autophosphorylation site in vitro and in vivo. This interaction is cell adhesion-dependent, suggesting that the FAK-Grb7 complex is involved in integrin signaling. Using tetracycline-regulated expression system, we showed that overexpression of Grb7 enhanced cell migration toward fibronectin, whereas overexpression of its SH2 domain alone inhibited cell migration. In addition, we found that phosphorylation of FAK or p130(cas) was not affected by the expression of either Grb7 or its SH2 domain alone, suggesting that Grb7 is downstream of FAK and does not compete with Src for binding to FAK in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that the FAK-Grb7 complex plays a role in cell migration stimulated by integrin signaling through FAK.
