Conventionally, the lateral shoots of chrysanthemum are removed manually, which is time consuming and uneconomical. The development of branchless chrysanthemum will economize its commercial cultivation. To investigate the regulatory mechanism of branchlessness, we undertook cloning of Dendranthema grandiflorum Kitamura Lateral suppressor-like (DgLsL) gene for development of lateral shoot in chrysanthemum. A full-length cDNA of DgLsL gene was isolated by screening cDNA library and performing Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) PCR. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the DgLsL gene is closely related to Lateral suppressor that encodes transcriptional regulator proteins belonging to GRAS family of known transcription factor. Southern blot analysis revealed that DgLsL gene in chrysanthemum genome has one copy. DgLsL expression was apparently up-regulated by ethephon treatment. The expression patterns revealed that DgLsL transcripts were detected in all organs, but showed their highest level in stems.
