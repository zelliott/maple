L-Amino acid oxidases (LAAOs) are homodimeric flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-containing flavoproteins that catalyze the stereospecific oxidative deamination of L-amino acids to α-keto acids, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide. Unlike the D-selective counterpart, the biotechnological application of LAAOs has not been thoroughly advanced because of the difficulties in their expression as recombinant protein in prokaryotic hosts. In this work, L-aspartate oxidase from the thermophilic archea Sulfolobus tokodaii (StLASPO, specific for L-aspartate and L-asparagine only) was efficiently produced as recombinant protein in E. coli in the active form as holoenzyme. This recombinant flavoenzyme shows the classical properties of FAD-containing oxidases. Indeed, StLASPO shows distinctive features that makes it attractive for biotechnological applications: high thermal stability (it is fully stable up to 80 °C) and high temperature optimum, stable activity in a broad range of pH (7.0-10.0), weak inhibition by the product oxaloacetate and by D-aspartate, and tight binding of the FAD cofactor. This latter property significantly distinguishes StLASPO from the E. coli counterpart. StLASPO represents an appropriate novel biocatalyst for the production of D-aspartate and a well-suited protein scaffold to evolve a LAAO activity by protein engineering.
