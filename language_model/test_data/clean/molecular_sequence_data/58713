Shotgun sequencing of cDNA clones is now an established approach to gain insight into the expressed nucleotide (nt) sequences in a given cell. We analysed 100 randomly picked cDNA clones of the protozoan parasite, Entamoeba histolytica, by nt sequencing, with a view to obtain novel gene sequences not detected so far by biochemical and genetic analyses. About 56% of the analysed clones showed significant homology with other genes in the database, including a number of genes whose presence may not be suspected in E. histolytica owing to its unusual subcellular organization. The results suggest that this approach can provide important clues to understand unique biochemical mechanisms in this parasite.
