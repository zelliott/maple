Mitochondrial DNA rearrangements and deletions are a prevailing feature of filamentous fungal cultures that undergo senescence. In Neurospora spp., strains containing the Mauriceville and Varkud mitochondrial retroplasmids routinely senesce at elevated temperatures, a process that is initiated by the integration of variant forms of the plasmids into the mitochondrial genome. Here, we describe a strain that is phenotypically distinguishable from previously characterized senescent strains and show that senescence can occur in the absence of plasmid integration and associated alterations in mitochondrial DNA. The MS4416 strain contains a unique variant of the Mauriceville retroplasmid, and undergoes senescence at highly predictable frequencies at 37 degrees, 25 degrees and 18 degrees C. Decline in vegetative growth rate correlates with increased levels of the variant plasmid and alterations in the synthesis of mitochondrially encoded proteins, suggesting that plasmid over-replication interferes with mitochondrial translation. We also report the isolation of a mutant strain that escapes senescence yet still maintains high levels of the variant plasmid. Its ability to tolerate a growth-suppressive retroplasmid suggests that there are mechanisms in Neurospora which compensate for the deleterious effects that plasmid over-replication has on mitochondrial function.
