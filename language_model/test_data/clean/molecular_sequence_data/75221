The major antigens on the surface of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites are derived from a single high molecular weight polypeptide. The precursor to the major merozoite surface antigen (PMMSA) has conserved and variable antigenic determinants and varies in size in different isolates. Since the protein is a candidate for a malaria vaccine, it is important to understand the molecular basis of this variation. We present the complete sequence of the PMMSA of the Papua New Guinea isolate FC27 and the partial sequence of the West African isolate NF7. The gene consists of blocks of sequence which are either conserved or variable between different isolates. Variable sequences fall into two distinct types, indicating that the PMMSA is encoded by dimorphic alleles that undergo recombination within conserved blocks at the 5' end of the gene. Genetic exchange is not apparent within the other two-thirds of the gene in 12 isolates, suggesting strong selection against such recombinants. The most variable block located near the 5' end contains repeats that are different in independent cloned isolates. This variation presumably accounts for much of the size and antigenic variability.
