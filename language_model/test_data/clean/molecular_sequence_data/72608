A cDNA encoding solanidine glucosyltransferase (SGT) was isolated from potato. The cDNA was selected from a yeast expression library using a positive selection based on the higher toxicity of steroidal alkaloid aglycons relative to their associated glycosylated forms. The cDNA contained an open reading frame encoding a 56 kDa polypeptide with regions of similarity to previously characterized UDP-glucosyltransferases. The enzyme activity and reaction products of recombinant SGT in yeast were consistent with those observed for the endogenous enzyme from potato. SGT mRNA and protein accumulated in tubers in response to wounding. The time course for SGT mRNA accumulation paralleled that of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzymeA isoform 1 (hmg1) mRNA. Steady-state SGT mRNA levels also increased transiently upon wounding of leaves.
