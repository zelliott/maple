Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 plasma viruses from 29 entry inhibitor-naive patients were characterized for their susceptibilities to T-20, AMD3100, and RANTES. A strikingly wide range of susceptibilities to T-20 was observed that was influenced by coreceptor usage but not by the susceptibilities of the viruses to inhibitors that target the chemokine receptors or by polymorphisms in the gp41 N helix.
