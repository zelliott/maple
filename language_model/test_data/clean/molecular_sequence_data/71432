Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are linked to the dysplastic transformation of colorectal polyps and represent an early step in the development of colorectal tumors. Ninety-four percent of all mutations result in the expression of a truncated APC protein lacking the C-terminal region. The C-terminal region of the APC protein may have a tumor suppressor function as its absence appears to be linked to the development of dysplastic lesions. Recently, we discovered and characterized a protein called RP1 which binds specifically to the C-terminal region of the APC protein. We show now that RP1 and the other known members of the EB/RP family (EB1 and RP3) also bind directly to tubulin, both in vitro and in vivo. Immunohistochemical analyses reveal a distinct staining pattern during interphase as well as an association of RP1/EB1 with mitotic microtubule structures. The previously described puncta of the APC protein at the leading edge of membrane protrusions contact microtubule fibers that contain RP1 or EB1.
