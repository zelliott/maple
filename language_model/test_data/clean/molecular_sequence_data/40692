The increased prevalence of dermatomycoses along with the wide range of organisms now recognized as potential pathogens needs accurate laboratory isolation and identification of the aetiological agents. In this report three cases of foot dermatomycoses due to filamentous fungi commonly present in the environment with ubiquitous distribution are described in immunocompetent subjects. Skin and nail samples were collected, suspended in 20% KOH solution, examined under a light microscope and cultured in Mycobiotic agar and Sabouraud dextrose agar containing chloramphenicol to detect fungal growth. Phoma herbarum, Chaetomium globosum, and Microascus cinereus were isolated and identified.
