Nonpolar mutations were introduced into all 12 regions of the genome of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. In agreement with data previously reported for other picornaviruses, mutations in regions 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D totally abrogated viral RNA replication. Viruses with deletions in each of the capsid proteins retained RNA replication proficiency, although they were unable to propagate from cell to cell. As reported previously, mutations in the leader protein did not impair RNA replication or virus production in BHK-21 cells. Surprisingly, region 2A also appeared to be dispensable for the replication process. Indeed, up to 77 of the 133 amino acids of 2A could be deleted without significantly affecting RNA replication. 2A mutant viruses had only a slow cytopathic effect for BHK-21 cells and were totally avirulent for mice. As was the case for mutants lacking the leader protein, viruses with deletions in 2A propagated in BHK-21 cells, but their propagation was highly restricted in L929 cells.
