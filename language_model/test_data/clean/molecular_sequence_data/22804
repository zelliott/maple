Trafficking and proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) have been the focus of numerous investigations in the past two decades, since the identification of Abeta as the principal component of brain senile plaques and the cloning of APP cDNA. Tremendous progress has been made in the recent past toward the characterization of beta- and gamma-secretases. Here, we review the salient features of Alzheimer disease amyloidogenesis, and discuss the current knowledge on APP trafficking and amyloidogenic processing of APP in intracellular membrane compartments and microdomains.
