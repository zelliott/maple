Merozoite surface proteins of Plasmodium falciparum are one major group of antigens currently being investigated and tested as malaria vaccine candidates. Two recently described P. falciparum merozoite surface antigens, MSP4 and MSP5, are GPI-anchored proteins that each contain a single EGF-like domain and appear to have arisen by an ancient gene duplication event. The genes are found in tandem on chromosome 2 of P. falciparum and the syntenic region of the genome was identified in the rodent malarias P. chabaudi, P. yoelii and P. berghei. In these species, there is only a single gene, designated MSP4/5 encoding a single EGF-like domain similar to the EGF-like domain in both PfMSP4 and PfMSP5. Immunization of mice with PyMSP4/5 provides mice with high levels of protection against lethal challenge with blood stage P. yoelii. In this study, we show that in P. vivax, which is quite phylogenetically distant from P. falciparum, both MSP4 and MSP5 homologues can be found with their relative arrangements with respect to the surrounding genes mostly preserved. However, the gene for MSP2, found between MSP5 and adenylosuccinate lyase (ASL) in P. falciparum, is absent from P. vivax. The PvMSP4 and PvMSP5 genes have a two-exon structure and encode proteins with potential signal and GPI anchor sequences and a single EGF-like domain near the carboxyl-terminus. Rabbit antisera raised against purified recombinant proteins show that each of the antisera react with distinct proteins of 62 kDa for PvMSP4 and 86 kDa for PvMSP5 in parasite lysates. Indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA) localized PvMSP4 over the entire surface of P. vivax merozoites, as expected, whereas, the MSP5 homologue was found to be associated with an apical organellar location consistent with micronemes or over the polar prominence.
