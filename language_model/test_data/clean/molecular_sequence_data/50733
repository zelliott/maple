Swine genomic DNA segments containing repetitive sequences were isolated from a porcine genomic library using genomic DNA as a probe. Three fragments containing the repetitive sequences from two of the primary phage clones were subcloned for sequence analysis, which revealed six new PRE-1 repetitive families other than those reported earlier by Singer et al. (Nucleic Acids Research 15, 2780, 1987). The frequency of the repetitive sequences in the swine genome was estimated at 2 x 10(6) per diploid genome. Sequence analysis revealed similarities between these repetitive sequences and that of arginine-tRNA gene.
