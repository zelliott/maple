Using very high stringency hybridization conditions for the Southern blot hybridization analysis of hamster-human cell hybrid DNA, we were able to map the human cytochrome b5 gene and two of its pseudogenes (psgb(5)1 and psgb(5)2) unambiguously to chromosomes 18, 14, and 20. These localizations were confirmed and extended to 18q23, 14q31-32.1, and 20p11.2 by using a combination of nonisotopic in situ hybridization of chromosomal spreads and the polymerase chain reaction analysis of DNA samples isolated from somatic cell hybrids retaining deletions or translocations of chromosome 18.
