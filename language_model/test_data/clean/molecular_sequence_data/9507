Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) has an important protective function against viral infection. The ability of an individual to respond properly to TLR ligands may be impaired by variants located in the TLR genes. By directly PCR sequencing four exons and their flanking sequence of chicken TLR3, a total of 50 nucleotide variants were identified from five breeds. Tibetan chickens and Silkies exhibited more abundant variation sites and rare alleles. Thirty haplotypes were reconstructed, with 31 variants whose minor allelic frequency was above 5% in five breeds, which revealed four divergent clades. Chicken TLR3 was partitioned into three haplotype blocks by the htSNPer program, and six tag SNPs could be used to distinguish these 30 haplotypes. Thirty variants were located in the coding sequence of chicken TLR3, and 16 of them were non-synonymous substitutions. It is predicted that p.Ser180Gly amino substitution could form an N-myristoylation site; the p.Lys240Thr amino substitution in chicken TLR3 could result in the loss of one protein kinase C phosphorylation site. These data provide a basic understanding of chicken TLR3 sequence variation and provide haplotypic markers for disease association studies.
