The nucleotide sequence of the leftmost 2,363 base pairs of the HP1 genome, which includes the attachment site (attP) and the integration region, was determined. This sequence contained an open reading frame encoding a 337-residue polypeptide, which is a member of the integrase family of site-specific recombination proteins as judged by sequence comparison. The open reading frame was located immediately adjacent to the att site and was oriented so that initiation of translation would begin distal to the att site and end in its immediate vicinity. Expression of this DNA segment in Escherichia coli provided extracts which promoted site-specific recombination between plasmids containing cloned HP1 attP and Haemophilus influenzae attB sites. This recombination was directional, since no reaction was observed between plasmids containing attR and attL sites. The reaction was stimulated by the accessory protein integration host factor of E. coli. Evidence was also obtained that the integration host factor influenced the levels of HP1 integrase expression. The deduced amino acid sequence of HP1 integrase has remarkable similarity to that deduced for the integrase of coliphage 186.
