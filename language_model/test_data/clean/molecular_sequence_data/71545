Several transmission studies, as well as recent molecular data, have indicated that the two classes Myxosporea and Actinosporea represent different life cycle stages of Myxozoa. To evaluate the life cycles of myxozoa in catfish aquaculture systems, the small subunit (18S) ribosomal RNA gene sequences of Henneguya exilis, a myxosporean from channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus, and an actinosporean (previously designated as Aurantiactinomyxon janiszewskai) from the aquatic oligochaete Dero digitata were determined. The sequences were identical, indicating that H. exilis and the actinosporean are alternate life stages of a single species. This is the first report identifying the actinosporean stage of the genus Henneguya.
