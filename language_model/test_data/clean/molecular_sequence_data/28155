The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene for a cell-surface protein antigen (PAc) of Streptococcus mutans MT8148 (serotype c) was determined. The pac gene consisted of 4695 bp and coded for a 170773D protein. The pac gene product contained a putative 38 amino acid signal peptide, resulting in a 166817D mature protein. A potential promoter sequence and a putative Shine-Dalgarno sequence preceded the open reading frame. Two internal repeating amino acid sequences were present in the PAc. One repeating region located in the N-terminal region was rich in alanine, and the other located in the central region was rich in proline. Southern blot analysis under the less stringent condition (allowing up to 35% base mismatch) revealed that the probe covering the proline-rich region hybridized to DNA preparations from strains of Streptococcus cricetus, Streptococcus sobrinus and Streptococcus downei as well as Streptococcus mutans.
