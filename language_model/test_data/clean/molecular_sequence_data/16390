Family hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder caused by mutation in the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. It is characterized by a high concentration of low density lipoprotein (LDL), which frequently gives rise to tendon xanthenes and premature coronary artery disease. We studied a FH family ,which was diagnosed by clinical features and blood lipid tests. The Total cholesterol level of the family was 19.05 mmol/L and the LDL level was 17.06 mmol/L in the proband homozygous FH subjects, while the total cholesterol was 7.96 mmol/L and LDL was 5.55 mmol/L in the heterozygous FH subjects. DNA segments amplified with PCR were sequenced in heterozygous and homozygous FH patients. Two novel identical mutation alleles of GAG683GCG, which caused an amino acid change from Glu to Ala, were detected in Exon4 of LDL receptor gene in homozygous proband. DNA sequencing revealed that the proband's parents were heterozygotes with the same mutational alleles as the proband. These results are in coincidence with the clinical diagnoses. Moreover Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphocytes (EBV-Ls) were derived by routine virus infection transforming protocol. The cells bounded with the fluorescently conjugated LDL were measured by fluorescence flow cytometry. The ratios of functional LDLR in EBV-Ls originated from homozygous FH, heterozygous FH and normal control were 7.02%, 62.64% and 84.69%, respectively. As a result, the homozygous FH patient's LDLR had 8.29% and the heterozygous FH patient's LDLR had 73.96% of the activity of the control. It is apparent that LDL receptor activity of homozygous FH subject is significantly lower than normal control. The data from fluorescence flow cytometry analysis of EBV-Ls strongly support the clinical diagnoses and the results of DNA sequencing. In accordance with the updated version of UMD-LDLR, the mutant GAG683GCG in Exon4 of LDLR gene which we have identified is a novel mutation of the LDLR gene in human with hypercholesterolemia.
