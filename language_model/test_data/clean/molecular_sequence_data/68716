The condensation of 5'-O-protected 3'-O-(2-aminoethyl)thymidine with 1,2-dideoxy-1-thyminyl-beta-D-erythro-pentofuranuronic acid gives a T*T dimer with * representing a 3'-OCH2CH2NHC(O)-4' linkage connecting the two pentofuranosyl moieties. The incorporation of this dimer in oligonucleotide sequences show only moderately lowered Tm values when hybridized with a complementary DNA relative to the unmodified DNA duplex. Consistently, no looped-out or bubble-type structure could be detected in DNA duplexes with an internal T*T module. Moreover, the 5-atom carboxamide linker causes complete stop on DNA polymerization and on exonuclease III degradation.
