The nucleotide sequence BgIII-Pstl of the DNA fragment containing the aph gene cloned from Streptomyces rimosus P3 not producing aminoglycoside antibiotics was determined. The aph gene was shown to encode neomycin phosphotransferase differing by the substrate specificity from the enzyme encoded by the aph genes from the organisms producing aminoglycoside antibiotics. Comparison of the cloned aph VIII gene and its product with the aph genes and their products from the antibiotic-producing actinomycetes and clinical microbial strains permitted to consider it as a representative of the third group genes which are likely widely distributed in soil microorganisms not producing aminoglycoside antibiotics. The gene length was 777 nucleotide pairs at the average GC content of 67 per cent. Comparison of the nucleotide and protein sequences of the S.rimosus gene with those of the genes cloned from the aminoglycoside-producing organisms (S.fradiae and Micromonospora chalcea) revealed high homology in the 3'-end region of the genes. However, the homology percentage by DNA for the S.rimosus gene was lower than that for the genes from the other organisms on their comparison with each other: 56-67 and 82-86 per cent respectively. Comparison of the profiles of the protein hydrophilic properties revealed differences in the region of the first 110 amino acids of the gene under the investigation. The amino acid sequence contained all the highly conservative regions characteristics of aminoglycoside phosphotransferases but had several amino acid substitutes detected for the first time including those in the region responsible for the antibiotic binding.
