CD30 is present on the surfaces of malignant cells from patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and other lymphomas. The yeast two hybrid genetic screen method was used to identify molecular effectors which mediate CD30 signalling events. Clones corresponding to genes coding for TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3 molecules, postulated to be involved in signalling via the TNF and CD40 receptors, were isolated. In this report, we show that the CD30 intracellular tail contains two motifs that bind TRAFs. The more amino terminal motif, 558PHYPEQET565, binds TRAF2 and 3, while the more carboxyl terminal motif, 576MLSVEEEG583, binds TRAF1 and 2. We show that these amino acid motifs are conserved in TNFRp75 and CD40 and that sequences in these receptors homologous to TRAF-binding sequences found in CD30 can selectively bind the TRAFs in a predictable manner.
