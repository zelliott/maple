Chronic hepatitis C is a major cause of liver cirrhosis leading to chronic liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Different hepatitis C virus (HCV) proteins have been associated with resistance to interferon-alpha-based therapy. However, the exact mechanisms of virus-mediated interferon resistance are not completely understood. The importance of amino acid (aa) variations within the HCV nonstructural (NS)4B protein for replication efficiency and viral decline during the therapy is unknown. We investigated pretreatment sera from 42 patients with known outcome to interferon-based therapy. The complete NS4B gene was amplified and sequenced. Mutational analyses of predicted conformational, functional, structural and phylogenetic properties of the deduced aa sequences were performed. The complete NS4B protein was highly conserved with a median frequency of 0.015 +/- 0.009 aa exchanges (median +/- SD, 4.00 +/- 2.31). Especially within the predicted transmembranous domains of the NS4B protein, the mean number of aa variations was low (median frequency, 0.013 +/- 0.013). Neither the number of aa variations nor specific aa exchanges were correlated with HCV RNA serum concentration at baseline. A rapid initial HCV RNA decline of >/=1.5 log(10) IU/mL at week 2 of interferon-based therapy was associated with a higher frequency of nonconservative aa exchanges within the complete NS4B protein in comparison with patients with a nonrapid HCV RNA decline (median frequency, 0.011 +/- 0.005 vs 0.004 +/- 0.003, P = 0.006). Overall, the aa sequence of the NS4B protein was highly conserved, indicating an important role for replication in vivo. Amino acid variations with relevant changes of physicochemical properties may influence replication efficiency, associated with a rapid early virological response.
