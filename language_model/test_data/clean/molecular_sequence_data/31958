To study the effects of two chemical pesticides (chlorpyrifos and endosulfan), and a bio-pesticide (azadirachtin) on bacterial diversity in rhizospheric soil, a randomized pot experiment was conducted on mung bean (Vigna radiata) with recommended and higher doses of pesticides. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to analyze such effects on both resident and active bacterial communities across two time points. It was observed that higher doses of azadirachtin mimicked the effects of chlorpyrifos on bacterial diversity. Both azadirachtin and chlorpyrifos showed a dose- and time-dependent effect, which was observable only at the RNA level. Endosulfan treatments showed dissimilar profiles compared to control. Most of the bands showed high sequence similarities to known bacterial groups, including many nitrogen-fixing, phosphate-solubilizing, and plant-growth-promoting bacteria. This study indicates that pesticides display non-target effects on active microbial populations that serve important ecosystem functions, thereby emphasizing the need to critically investigate and validate the use of bio-pesticides in agriculture before accepting them as safe alternatives to chemical pesticides.
