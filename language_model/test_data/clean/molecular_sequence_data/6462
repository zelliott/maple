Psoriasis vulgaris is an inflammatory skin disease characterized by excessively increased keratinocyte proliferation. Several lines of evidence support the idea that T cells infiltrating psoriatic skin lesions play a vital role in the pathogenesis of the disease. To establish whether lesional accumulation and activation of T lymphocytes reflect a specific local immune response, the TCR beta-chain variable (V beta) region gene usage was studied in chronic psoriatic plaques, normal skin, and paired blood lymphocytes. By semiquantitative PCR, we found that overexpression of either or both V beta 2 and V beta 6 gene families characterized the TCR repertoires of normal skin and psoriatic skin lesions. However, sequence analysis of the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of these V beta gene families demonstrated a marked TCR oligoclonality only in psoriatic lesions, not in normal skin or in blood lymphocytes. The amino acid sequences of the lesional TCR clones revealed that certain conserved junctional motifs were shared by different patients. A second biopsy taken from one of the psoriasis patients 18 mo later from a different anatomical site disclosed that the same TCR clones were again dominating. These data suggest that lesional psoriatic T lymphocytes expressing the prevailing TCR V beta genes represent an oligoclonal T cell subset that expanded from a few progenitor T cells in response to Ag in the skin of psoriasis patients. They are derived from a polyclonal T cell population that, by the expression of V beta 2 or V beta 6 TCR, appears to be predisposed for homing to the skin.
