We have PCR-amplified and sequenced the immediate (841 bp) 5'-flanking region of murine p16INK4a (MTS1, CDKN2) tumor suppressor gene. Comparing to recently published 5'-flanking region of the human alpha form of p16INK4a, homologies were found in several regions of murine p16INK4a-alpha putative promoter sequence.
