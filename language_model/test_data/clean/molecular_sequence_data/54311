Bdellovibrio and like organisms (BALOs) form the group of predatory bacteria which require Gram-negative bacteria as prey. Genetic studies with Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus can be performed with vectors which are introduced into the predator via conjugation. The usefulness of the two vectors pSUP202 and pSUP404.2 as genetic tools were assessed. Both vectors were transferable into B. bacteriovorus by conjugative matings with an Escherichia coli K12 strain as donor. The transfer frequency was higher for vector pSUP404.2 (approx. 10⁻¹-10⁻⁴) as for pSUP202 (approx. 10⁻⁵-10⁻⁶). Vector pSUP202 with a pMB1 origin is unstable in the predatory bacterium, whereas pSUP404.2 is stably maintained in the absence of selective antibiotics. pSUP404.2 harbors two plasmid replicons, the p15A ori and the RSF1010 replication region The copy number of pSUP404.2 was determined by quantitative PCR in B. bacteriovorus and averages seven copies per genome. pSUP404.2 harbors two resistance genes (chloramphenicol and kanamycin) which can be used for cloning either by selection for transconjugants or by insertional inactivation.
