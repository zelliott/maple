Peptide arrays in which peptides were immobilized on cellulose membranes through photolinkers were synthesized. The peptides were subsequently detached from the arrays by ultraviolet (UV) photolysis for 3 h, and were used to search for functional peptides that inhibit the activity of α-amylase derived from human pancreatic juice. Amino acid replacement with high-molecular-size amino acids, Arg (R), Phe (F), Trp (W), or Tyr (Y), for the first and seventh residues of amylase inhibitor peptide, GHWYYRCW, as previous reported, led to enhancement of the inhibitory effect of the peptide on α-amylase. In particular, one of the resulting peptides, RHWYYRYW, showed a stronger inhibitory effect than acarbose (which is used as a hypoglycemic agent) or inhibitor peptide GHWYYRCW.
