Lambda EMBL clone containing a gene cluster coding for the translation elongation factor 1alpha, ribosomal protein S10 and tRNA(ala) was identified in a genomic library for the halophilic archaebacterium Halobacterium halobium using a PCR probe amplified by two oligonucleotide primers for conserved amino acid sequences of the elongation factor 1 alpha family. The gene coding for elongation factor EF-2 was also found 4.3kb upstream from the 5'end of the elongation factor 1 alpha by hybridization analysis using a DNA fragment specific for EF-2 from Halobacterium halobium [1]. Halobacterial and eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha homologues are very similar in sequence and in length and appear to be more closely related to each other than to the eubacterial protein.
