Mesenchymal-epithelial interactions are important in the gastric mucosal repair. However, specific factors responsible for such interactions have not been established. In the present study, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) significantly stimulated proliferation of gastric epithelial cells dose dependently and synergistically with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin. Restitution of gastric epithelial monolayers was also assessed, using a round wound restitution model. Keratinocyte growth factor facilitated the restitution of gastric epithelial cells significantly but did not have any effects on gastric fibroblasts. Keratinocyte growth factor receptor mRNA was expressed by gastric epithelial cells, indicating that these effects were elicited by the specific receptor mediated pathway. Northern blot analysis revealed the expression of KGF mRNA in gastric fibroblasts but not in gastric epithelial cells, indicating the production of KGF. These results suggest that KGF might be involved in gastric mucosal repair, through mesenchymal-epithelial interaction.
