Vitellogenesis inhibiting hormone (VIH)-mRNA in secretory cells of the eyestalk of Homarus americanus was detected by nonradioactive in situ hybridization (ISH) using two digoxigenin-tailed oligonucleotide probes deduced from the peptide sequence. Two distinct clusters of positive cells were observed in the medulla terminalis ganglionic X-organ (MGTX). Only one of them gave a strong immunoreaction after incubation with a specific polyclonal anti-VIH serum and corresponded to the conventionally described VIH producing cells. The significance of the cells reacting positively in ISH but not in immunocytochemistry (ICC) is discussed. Northern blot analysis using 32P-labeling confirms the specificity of the probes and indicates an approximate size of 2.5 kb for VIH mRNA.
