In this study, we characterized a Capsicum hypersensitive response (HR)-associated gene, SS52, which encodes a protein that contains an N-terminal C2 domain and a C-terminal XYPPX repeat. Expression analyses revealed that SS52 and its homologue in Arabidopsis were induced by infection with incompatible viruses, indicating the conserved function of this gene. SS52 was not induced by treatment with defense-related hormones, but was induced by abiotic stresses, including wounding. Overexpression of SS52 in tobacco plants suppressed the spread of HR cell death and restricted the spread of an incompatible virus from local lesions. Collectively, the results suggest that SS52 negatively regulates plant HR cell death.
