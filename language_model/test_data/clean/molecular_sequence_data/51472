Involvement of neuropeptides in the regulation of cardiac activity in a prosobranch mollusc, Rapana thomasiana, was studied physiologically as well as immunohistochemically. A catch-relaxing peptide (CARP) showed strong inhibitory effects on the heart with a lower threshold than acetylcholine. The action of CARP was in contrast to that of another neuropeptide, FMRFamide, which has previously been shown to enhance the heart beat. Benzoquinonium blocked the effects of acetylcholine and stimulation of right cardiac nerves 1 and 3 b, but not those of CARP, suggesting that the effects of nerve stimulation are mainly due to the release of acetylcholine. Immunohistochemical examinations demonstrated that FMRFamide-like and CARP-like immunoreactive neurons are distributed in the visceral ganglia. Although a neuron appeared to show weak immunoreactivity to both antisera, evidence for the coexistence of peptides in a single neuron was not exhibited. Positive immunoreactivity to FMRFamide and CARP antisera also appeared in right cardiac nerves 1 and 3. In the heart, FMRFamide- and CARP-like immunoreactive fibers were restricted to the atrium and the aortic end of the ventricle, consistent with the morphological observation of innervation. The present results suggest that FMRFamide- and CARP-like peptides are involved in regulating the heart beat.
