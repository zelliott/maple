We have purified an isoform of protein disulfide isomerase (EC 5.3.4.1) from rat liver, and raised a specific antibody against the purified protein in rabbit. Immunohistochemical studies using this antibody on rat testis sections, at both light and electron microscopic levels, showed a specific localization of the isoform of protein disulfide isomerase in the developing acrosome of the spermatids. The protein was transferred to the acrosomic vesicle from the Golgi apparatus at late Golgi phase, and remained present in the acrosome of spermatids during cap phase, acrosome phase, and maturation phase. In addition to the acrosome, the protein appeared in the nucleus of spermatids during maturation phase, and was localized in the nucleus of epididymal spermatozoa. By immunoblot analysis, almost all of the isoform of protein disulfide isomerase in the testis was found to be extractable by an isotonic buffer. On the contrary, detergent extraction was required for complete solubilization of the protein in the epididymis. These results suggest that the isoform of protein disulfide isomerase is a new intra-acrosomal soluble protein, and that the protein begins to enter the nucleus of mature spermatids in the testis and tightly binds to the nuclear components in epididymal spermatozoa.
