A cDNA coding for ik3-2 (designated as ik3-2 from an interactor-2 with cdk3) was cloned by cross-hybridization with ik3-1 and RT-PCR. Analysis of amino acid sequence indicated that ik3-2 has the C-terminal cyclin-box-like region highly homologous to that of ik3-1 (identity in amino acids: 78%). On the other hand, the remainder of ik3-2 gene is not so similar to that of ik3-1. There are several regions other than the C-terminal cyclin-box-like region that are conserved between ik3-1 and ik3-2. In vivo binding assay indicated that like ik3-1, ik3-2 binds to cdk3, cdk5, and c-abl, although ik3-2 binds to cdk3 weakly as compared with ik3-1. The C-terminal cyclin-box-like region of ik3-2 (123 amino acids) is able to be associated with cdk5. Accordingly, ik3-2 is very similar to ik3-1 concerning its molecular interaction with other molecules, suggesting that ik3-2 function in the same biological field as ik3-1. Northern blot analysis indicated that ik3-2 is expressed ubiquitously all over tissues.
