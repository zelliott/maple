Human bisphosphoglycerate mutase (GriP2 mutase) is a trifunctional enzyme which synthesizes and degrades GriP2 in red cells. Among the amino acid residues involved in its active site there are two conserved histidine residues, His10 which is phosphorylated during the catalytic process and His187 for which only speculative data have been made about the potential role during the reactions. Another amino acid residue, Arg89, had not been described as part of this active site but we have recently shown that a natural mutant Arg89-->Cys was highly thermolabile and showed severe perturbations of its enzymatic properties. To understand better the exact role of these residues, replacements of His10 by Gly (H10G) or Asp (H10D), His187 by Asn (H187N), Tyr (H187Y) or Asp (H187D) and Arg89 by Cys (R89C), Ser (R89S), Gly (R89G) or Lys (R89K) were performed by site-directed mutagenesis. The results obtained in this report show that replacement of the His10 residue completely abolished the enzymatic activities. Concerning the His187 residue, our results afford arguments that it plays an essential role in the three catalytic activities. Indeed all these activities are abolished in the two H187Y and H187D variants, whereas they are detectable though strongly diminished, for the H187N variant. In addition mutations at His187 could be distinguishable from those at His10 since the former resulted in a thermolabile enzyme, whereas no significant change in heat stability was observed for the latter. It is noteworthy that the H187N variant is protected against thermal instability by glycerate 2,3-bisphosphate (GriP2). Concerning the Arg89 mutants, R89C, R89S and R89G, the three variants showed characteristics identical to those found in the natural R89C mutant, i.e. loss of 99% of synthase activity, consistent decrease of mutase and 2-phosphoglycolate-stimulated phosphatase activities whereas the unstimulated phosphatase activity was normal. Moreover these mutants were unstable at 55 degrees C but GriP2 was able to protect them against thermal instability. In contrast, the R89K mutant was stable at 55 degrees C. Its synthase and unstimulated phosphatase activities were normal but its mutase and 2-phosphoglycolate-stimulated phosphatase activities were decreased. In addition, Km values for monophosphoglycerates were increased (3.2-fold) in the synthase but normal in mutase activities, whereas Km values for GriP2 were normal in mutase and phosphatase activities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
