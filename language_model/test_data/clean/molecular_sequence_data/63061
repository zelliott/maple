The TON_0887 gene was identified as the missing histidinol-phosphate phosphatase (HolPase) in the hyperthermophilic archaeon "Thermococcus onnurineus" NA1. The protein contained conserved motifs of the DDDD superfamily of phosphohydrolase, and the recombinantly expressed protein exhibited strong HolPase activity. In this study, we functionally assessed for the first time the monofunctional DDDD-type HolPase, which is organized in the gene cluster.
