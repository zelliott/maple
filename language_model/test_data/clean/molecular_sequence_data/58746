Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1 or aFGF), is the prototype member of the heparin-binding growth factors which are capable of angiogenesis in vivo. FGF-1 has been implicated in atherosclerosis, cancer, wound repair and inflammatory autoimmune diseases. As part of an effort to understand the role of FGF-1 in the etiopathogenesis of inflammation and cancer, we have undertaken steps to isolate and characterize the mouse Fgf-1 gene. Southern blotting and sequence analysis displayed considerable conservation within the coding and upstream untranslated regions of Fgf-1 in human, mouse, hamster, rat and bovine. By using primers derived from the 5'-untranslated exon of a rat prostate-specific Fgf-1 cDNA, a 220-bp product was amplified from mouse genomic DNA via PCR. Sequence analysis of this amplicon showed that there was 80% similarity with the corresponding region of the rat FGF-cDNA sequence. Primers designed from this amplicon and the Fgf-1 coding region were used to isolate multiple overlapping genomic clones spanning the entire mouse Fgf-1 gene. Sequencing analysis of the genomic sequence upstream from this novel 5'-untranslated exon did not reveal typical TATA, CCAAT sequences. It appears that the occurrence of multiple untranslated exons for FGF-1 is a highly conserved theme for this gene across species.
