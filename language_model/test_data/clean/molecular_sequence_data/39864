c-Phycocyanin (c-pc), a blue coloured, fluorescent protein was purified from blue-green alga, Spirulina fusiformis and its effect on fibrinolytic system in vascular endothelial cells was investigated. The c-pc consisted of two subunits, alpha and beta, whose molecular masses were 16 and 17 kDa, respectively. N-terminal sequences of both subunits were well conserved compared with other blue green algal phycobiliproteins. Fibrinolytic activity in the medium conditioned by calf pulmonary arterial endothelial cells was measured by the fibrin plate method. The c-pc increased the fibrinolytic activity in dose- and time-dependent manners. Fibrin zymographic studies indicated that c-pc-induced urokinase-type plasminogen activator in the cells. These in vitro results suggest that c-pc from S. fusiformis is a potent profibrinolytic protein in the vascular endothelial system.
