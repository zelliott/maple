Leishmania species of the subgenus Viannia are responsible for a large proportion of New World leishmaniasis. Here we report the development of a set of microsatellite markers which are able to discriminate between all species within the subgenus Viannia, including the closely related species pairs: Leishmania (V.) braziliensis and Leishmania (V.) peruviana; Leishmania (V.) panamensis and Leishmania (V.) guyanensis. Potential species hybrids were uncovered in the analysis. These markers are sufficiently polymorphic such that within-species epidemiological, population and genetic studies are theoretically possible for all species analyzed.
