A small heat shock protein (sHSP) gene from sunflower, Ha hsp17.6 G1, showed expression patterns that differ from what is known for members of this gene family. The mRNAs of this gene accumulated in seeds during late desiccation stages of zygotic embryogenesis but not in response to heat shock in vegetative tissues. The failure to respond to heat shock was independent of the developmental stage after germination and shock temperature. Nuclear run-on analyses demonstrated that transcription from the Ha hsp17.6 G1 promoter is not induced by heat shock. This agrees with the presence, in this promoter, of sequences with little similarity to heat shock elements. Our results show an evolutionary divergence, in the regulation of plant sHSP genes, which has originated stress-responsive genes and nonresponsive members within this gene family. We discuss implications for mechanisms controlling the developmental regulation of sHSP genes in plants.
