Entamoeba histolytica adheres to human colonic mucins and colonic epithelial cells via a galactose-binding adhesin. The adhesin is a heterodimeric glycoprotein composed of 170- and 35-kDa subunits. Fragments of the hgl1 gene encoding the 170-kDa subunit were expressed as recombinant fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and reacted with anti-adhesin monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) or pooled human immune sera. The MAbs tested recognize seven distinct epitopes on the 170-kDa subunit and have distinct effects on the adherence and complement-inhibitory activities of the adhesin. All seven MAbs reacted with a fusion protein containing the cysteine-rich domain of the protein. Pooled human immune sera reacted with the same cysteine-rich domain as the MAbs and also with a construct containing the first 596 amino acids. Reactivity of three MAbs with the surface of intact trophozoites confirmed that the cysteine-rich domain was located extracellularly. The location of individual epitopes was fine mapped by constructing carboxy-terminal deletions in the cysteine-rich region of the fusion protein. The locations of adherence-enhancing and -inhibiting epitopes were partially distinguished, and the epitopes where complement-inhibitory MAbs bound were demonstrated to be near the adhesin's area of sequence identity with the human complement inhibitor CD59.
