An aerobic, mesophilic bacterium, strain JA40T, was isolated from soil contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls collected from Johnston Atoll in the North Pacific Ocean. The strain formed yellow-pigmented colonies on heterotrophic media. The cells were Gram-negative, non-motile, non-sporulating rods. The strain reduced nitrite to nitrous oxide, the DNA G+C content was 64 mol% and the dominant fatty acids were 15 : 0 iso, 17 : 1 iso cis7 and 11 : 0 iso 3-OH. DNA sequencing of 1457 nt of the 16S rRNA gene established that JA40T belongs in the genus Pseudoxanthomonas within the Xanthomonadaceae branch of the Gammaproteobacteria. Strain JA40T can be differentiated from other mesophilic species in the genus on the basis of its physiological and biochemical characteristics and distinctive fatty acid profile. Thus strain JA40T (=ATCC BAA-1031T=CIP 108476T) is the type strain of a novel species of the genus Pseudoxanthomonas, for which the name Pseudoxanthomonas kalamensis sp. nov. is proposed.
