Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is a primary regulator of the initiation of blood coagulation. TFPI is internalized and degraded by HepG2 cells through the low-density-lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) but also binds another molecule present on the cell surface at approx. 10-fold the abundance of LRP [Warshawsky, Broze and Schwartz (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 91, 6664-6668]. When HepG2 cells are washed with heparin or dextran sulphate, a substance that binds TFPI is removed from the cell surface and can be detected in a slot-blot assay. Preincubation with trypsin destroys the reactivity of the TFPI-binding component in the slot-blot assay, suggesting that it is a protein. In addition, when the sulphation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is prevented by growing the HepG2 cells in the presence of 30 mM sodium chlorate, TFPI binding is unaffected, whereas the binding of bovine lipoprotein lipase, a protein known to associate with cell-surface GAGs, falls to 50% of control levels. Dextran sulphate washes of HepG2 cells grown in sodium chlorate have an equal reactivity in slot-blot experiments to that of non-treated cells, suggesting that GAGs are not totally responsible for the binding activity observed. By using the slot blot to follow binding activity and conventional protein purification techniques, a protein species that migrates at 40 kDa after reduction was identified in the HepG2 cell wash. The binding of this protein to TFPI was confirmed with immobilized TFPI. Amino acid sequence analysis identified this protein species as a proteolytic fragment of glypican-3 (also called OCI-5), a member of the glypican family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteoglycans.
