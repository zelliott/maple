The structure of integrated viral DNA in a hepatocellular carcinoma of a duck from Chi-tung county in China was analyzed. Three different clones of integrated viral DNA, lambda DHS 6-1, lambda DHS 6-2, and lambda DHE 6-2, were obtained from the neoplastic portion of the liver by molecular cloning. One of the three clones, lambda DHS 6-1, showed inverted repetition of integrated viral DNA with chromosomal flanking sequences. Another clone, lambda DHS 6-2, showed a head-to-head configuration of the core and surface gene regions of duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) DNA. The virus-chromosome junctions were often located near direct repeat 1 or 2 of DHBV DNA in three independent clones. Nucleotide sequences at the virus-virus junctions in two clones, lambda DHS 6-1 and 6-2, indicated the possible rearrangement of chromosomal DNA and recombination of viral DNA. DHBV DNA appears to be integrated into the genome of hepatocytes in a manner similar to that of human and woodchuck hepatitis viruses. Thus, the duck system may serve as a useful animal model for the study of human hepatocarcinogenesis.
