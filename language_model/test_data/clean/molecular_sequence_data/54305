Drechslerella dactyloides generates elongate ellipsoid conidia and three-celled rings. Recently, Drechslerella dactyloides CNU 091025 and CNU 091026 were isolated in Korea, which generated elongate ellipsoid, Y-shaped and reaphook-shaped conidia, three-celled rings and fishhook-shaped traps. Therefore, molecular phylogenetic analysis, morphological variability, and nematode capturing ability were tested in this study. CNU 091025 generated two-celled or three-celled Y-shaped conidia, reaphook-shaped conidia, and elongate ellipsoid conidia, 17.2, 40.9, and 41.9%, respectively. Some fishhook-shaped rings connecting together formed two-dimensional web. Both fungi showed high trap-forming and nematode-capturing ability; especially CNU 091026 captured 100% Bursaphelenchus xylophilus within 24 h after inoculation.
