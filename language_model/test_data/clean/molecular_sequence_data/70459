A 4238-bp intervening sequence within the highly conserved U11 region of the mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA gene of the fungus Cryphonectria parasitica Ep155 has been sequenced and identified to be a group-I intron. This is the largest group-I intron reported to-date for fungal mitochondrial genomes. The intron contains an 851-codon open reading frame encoding a putative, but complete, small-subunit ribosomal protein of 510 amino acids which is fused at its carboxyl terminus to a 311 amino-acid polypeptide representing a typical maturase-like protein. A short open reading frame of 83 amino acids with some similarity to maturases, but lacking a translation-initiation codon, was also noted at the 3' end of the intron. The unusual size of the intron and the arrangement of the open and truncated reading frames suggest that this segment of the mtDNA of C. parasitica has arisen by a fusion of components from two or more different introns, possibly involving the re-location of intronic genes.
