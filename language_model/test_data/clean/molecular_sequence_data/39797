AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as a sensor of cellular energy charge. Once activated it switches on catabolic pathways and switches off many ATP-consuming processes (anabolic pathways) to preserve the energy status of the cell. In order to identify new targets of AMPK action we have performed a two-hybrid screening of a human pancreas cDNA library. As a result, we have identified TRIP6 as a novel target of AMPK action. This protein belongs to the zyxin family of proteins located at the focal adhesion plaques in the plasma membrane, although they may also travel to the nucleus, where they have regulatory properties. We confirmed the physical interaction between the catalytic subunit (AMPK-alpha2) of the AMPK complex and TRIP6 in mammalian cells by two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays. We also showed that AMPK was able to phosphorylate in vitro TRIP6 at the N-terminus. Finally, we present evidence that transcriptional co-activator properties of TRIP6 were enhanced by AMPK action.
