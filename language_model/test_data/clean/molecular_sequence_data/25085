The phosphotransacetylase (PTA) (EC 2.3.1.8) catalyzes a key branch point reaction in the carbohydrate pathway of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis. In this report, we describe the cloning of the pta gene. The DNA sequence analysis revealed a 987 bp open reading frame encoding a protein with a molecular mass of 35.5 kD. These are the first studies on a PTA of an organism representative for the heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria. Unlike in most other bacteria analysed so far, in L. sanfranciscensis the pta gene is not adjacent located to the gene encoding acetate-kinase. The PTA was heterologously expressed as a biotinylated fusion protein in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. Rate dependence on all substrates followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The apparent Km values for acetylphosphate and CoA (forward reaction) were 1.3 and 0.1 mM, respectively. The apparent Vmax was 194 U/mg. The enzyme also catalyzed in vitro the reverse reaction with apparent Km values for acetylCoA and phosphate of 0.6 and 6.7 mM, respectively (Vmax of 38 U/mg). The PTA showed a wide range of temperature for optimal activity (49 degrees C to 58 degrees C). It was inactivated after 15 min at 60 degrees C. Its activity was not affected by addition of MgCl2 (10 mM) or KCl (100 mM).
