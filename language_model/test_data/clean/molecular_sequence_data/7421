Two full-length cDNA clones encoding rabbit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were isolated from a lambda gt10 rabbit spleen cDNA library and sequenced. As predicted from the open reading frame (ORF) in vitro translation of a sense orientation GAPDH cDNA clone yielded a protein product with a molecular mass of 37 kDa. Rabbit GAPDH exhibits a high degree of homology to the mouse, rat, hamster, chicken and human GAPDH on both the nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) levels.
