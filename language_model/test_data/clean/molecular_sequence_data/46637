HLA-C was shown to be a highly polymorphic gene which can be accurately typed for by sequencing methodologies. Most HLA-C sequence-based typing protocols described so far are based on analysis of sequence data of exons 2 and 3. Nonetheless, exons 1, 4 and 5 also contain nucleotide substitutions which contribute to the polymorphisms of the HLA-C locus. Ten alleles contain polymorphic positions in exons 1, 4 and 5, Cw*0701/06, Cw*1202112, Cw*15051/2, Cw*1701/02, and Cw*1801/02. Here we describe a reliable solid-phase sequence-based typing strategy for sequencing exons 1, 4 and 5, which is an extended protocol of our previous HLA-C study. A panel of 16 individuals, carrying 27 different Cw-alleles, was typed for exons 1, 4 and 5 to check the newly designed primers. No allelic dropout or preferential amplification was noticed in these individuals. The panel was also sequenced in order to check the known polymorphisms present in exons 1, 4 and 5. For exon 5 the sequences of the alleles Cw*0302, *0501 and *07011 did not correspond with the published data. In addition, exons 1, 4 and 5 were sequence-based typing typed in 28, 17 and 59 individuals, respectively. Two new alleles were detected which contain polymorphic positions outside exons 2 and 3, Cw*07012 and Cw*1703. The unknown sequence data of exons 1, 4 and 5 of the alleles Cw*02024, *0308, *1506 and *16041 were elucidated. The described high-resolution sequence-based typing protocol for sequencing exons 1, 4 and 5 will be a valuable tool to study the HLA-C locus for polymorphisms outside exons 2 and 3 and for identification of the presently known HLA-C alleles with polymorphic positions in these exons.
