The HPLC/MS system, in which a monolithic silica capillary column is directly connected to an electronspray-ionization mass spectrometer, showed superior performance at high mobile phase linear velocity. A two-dimensional (2D) HPLC/MS system was established, using an ion-exchange particle-packed capillary column at the first dimension and a monolithic silica capillary column at the second dimension. In an analysis of tryptic fragments from bovine serum albumin, an 81% sequence coverage, obtained by the 2D-HPLC/MS system, increased by 23% as compared to a 1D-HPLC/MS system. This 2D-HPLC/MS system using a monolithic silica capillary column should be useful for enhancing sequence coverage of tryptic fragments in proteomics.
