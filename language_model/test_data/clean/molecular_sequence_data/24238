Acidic and neutral glycosphingolipids were isolated from a human gastric adenocarcinoma, and binding of Helicobacter pylori to the isolated glycosphingolipids was assessed using the chromatogram binding assay. The isolated glycosphingolipids were characterized using fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and by binding of antibodies and lectins. The predominating neutral glycosphingolipids were found to migrate in the di- to tetraglycosylceramide regions as revealed by anisaldehyde staining and detection with lectins. No binding of H. pylori to these compounds was obtained. The most abundant acidic glycosphingolipids, migrating as the GM3 ganglioside and sialyl-neolactotetraosylceramide, were not recognized by the bacteria. Instead, H. pylori selectively interacted with slow-migrating, low abundant gangliosides not detected by anisaldehyde staining. Binding-active gangliosides were isolated and characterized by mass spectrometry, proton nuclear magnetic resonance, and lectin binding as sialyl-neolactohexaosylceramide (NeuAcalpha3Galbeta4GlcNAcbeta3Galbeta4GlcNAcbeta3Galbeta4Glcbeta1Cer) and sialyl-neolactooctaosylceramide (NeuAcalpha3Galbeta4GlcNAcbeta3Galbeta4GlcNAcbeta3Galbeta4GlcNAcbeta3Galbeta4Glcbeta1Cer).
