A Gram-staining-negative, yellow-pigmented bacterial strain, motile by gliding, designated HME7102(T), was isolated from lagoon water in Korea. The phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain HME7102(T) formed a distinct lineage within the genus Flavobacterium. Strain HME7102(T) was closely related to Flavobacterium cheniae NJ-26(T) (94.5 %), Flavobacterium dongtanense LW30(T) (94.4 %) and Flavobacterium gelidilacus LMG 21477(T) (94.2 %). The major fatty acids of strain HME7102(T) were iso-C15 : 0, iso-C15 : 1 G, iso-C17 : 0 3-OH and iso-C15 : 0 3-OH. The major polyamine was homospermidine and the major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, one unidentified aminolipid and two unidentified polar lipids. The DNA G+C content of strain HME7102(T) was 36.5 mol%. On the basis of the evidence presented in this study, strain HME7102(T) represents a novel species of the genus Flavobacterium, for which the name Flavobacterium jumunjinense sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is HME7102(T) ( = KCTC 23618(T) = CECT 7955(T)). Emended descriptions of F. cheniae, F. dongtanense and F. gelidilacus are also proposed.
