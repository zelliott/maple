The Indian subcontinent is considered to be the likely centre of river buffalo domestication, based on population dynamics, archaeological evidence and genetic diversity. Recent studies on mitochondrial DNA diversity have drawn useful conclusions about the domestication history of Bubalus bubalis. The conclusions of these studies are, however, incomplete, unless samples can also be analysed from Pakistan, which contains the second largest buffalo population of the world. Here, we report the results of the first study on mitochondrial D-loop sequence diversity in five breeds of Pakistani buffalo. Analysis of sequence variations in 503-bp of the D-loop region of 123 animals revealed 52 haplotypes, including 40 singletons. Multidimensional display of breed pairwise F(ST) values revealed no strong clustering of breeds. Bayesian, maximum parsimony, neighbour joining and UPGMA trees revealed a topology consistent with domestication as well as subsequent introgression of multiple maternal lineages from the wild stocks. Reduced median network analysis provided evidence of population expansion from more than one set of haplotypes. The study also confirmed that Pakistani buffalo are of the river type. The observed mitochondrial D-loop sequence diversity suggests that Pakistani areas bordering India might have contributed to the initiation of domestication of the present-day river buffalo.
