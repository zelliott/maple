N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V) is an enzyme that catalyzes beta 1-6 branching of N-acetylglucosamine on asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of cell proteins. Metastatic potential of various cancer cells has been shown to correlate with increase of GnT-V activity and concomitant beta 1-6 branching of N-acetylglucosamine. However, protein expression of GnT-V in human cancer tissue and its clinical significance have not yet been demonstrated. To clarify the possible relationship between metastasis and GnT-V in human colorectal cancer, protein expression of GnT-V was studied using surgically resected specimens. We established a monoclonal antibody against GnT-V and performed immunohistochemical analysis of 103 human colorectal cancer cases. Of 103 cases, 26 cases (25.2 %) showed specific expression of GnT-V in colorectal cancer tissues. The expression of GnT-V was significantly correlated with distant metastasis (P < 0.05, chi2 test). Overall 5-year survival rate was 52.8% for GnT-V-positive patients and 81.7% for GnT-V-negative patients (P < 0.01, Log-rank test). We showed direct evidence for the relationship between GnT-V and metastasis in human colorectal cancer. Screening of GnT-V expression in colorectal cancer may provide useful information for prognosis of postoperative patients.
