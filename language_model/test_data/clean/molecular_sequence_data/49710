Hot water epilepsy (HWE) is a benign and rare form of reflex epilepsy that occurs most commonly in humans. Bdm1 is one of the proteins whose mRNA transcript is overexpressed during HWE in a rat model. We show, by sequence analysis and fold recognition methods, that Bdm1 has strong structural similarities to alpha/beta hydrolases like the thioesterases. A three-dimensional model derived by comparative modeling methods allowed the search for catalytic residues using a flexible functional template characteristic of these enzymes. We predict that Bdm1 might be regulated by homocysteine levels by means of direct participation in degradation pathways.
