During chronic infections in cystic fibrosis, persistence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is associated with conversion into forms that are associated with conversion into forms that are characterized by a mucoid colony morphology, rough lipopolysaccharide and, paradoxically, decreased systemic virulence. The mutations underlying these changes occur in global regulators, such as alternative sigma factors and their accessory elements.
