Design and switch of catalytic activity in enzymology remains a subject of intense investigation. Here, we employ a DNAzyme-RNAzyme combination strategy for construction of a 10-23 deoxyribozyme-hammerhead ribozyme combination that targets different sites of the beta-lactamase mRNA. The 10-23 deoxyribozyme-hammerhead ribozyme combination gene was cloned into phagemid vector pBlue-scriptIIKS (+). In vitro the single-strand recombinant phagemid vector containing the combination sequence exhibited 10-23 deoxyribozyme activity, and the linear transcript displayed hammerhead ribozyme activity. In bacteria, the 10-23 deoxyribozyme-hammerhead ribozyme combination inhibited the beta-lactamase expression and repressed the growth of drug-resistant bacteria. Thus, we created a DNAzyme-RNAzyme combination strategy that provides a useful approach to design and switch of catalytic activities for nucleic acid enzymes.
