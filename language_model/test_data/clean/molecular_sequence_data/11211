Phosphodiesterase I (EC 3.1.4.1)/nucleotide pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.9) enzymes are a family of type II transmembrane proteins that catalyze the cleavage of phosphodiester and phosphosulfate bonds of a variety of molecules, including deoxynucleotides, NAD, and nucleotide sugars. The human genes for two members of this family have been cloned and designated PC-1 (PDNP1) and PD-Ialpha/autotaxin (PDNP2). We have now cloned the third member of this family from a human prostate cDNA library and designated it human phosphodiesterase-Ibeta (PD-Ibeta). The PD-Ibeta cDNA contains a 2625-bp-long open reading frame which encodes an 875-amino-acid protein. COS-7 cells transfected with an expression vector, pBK-CMV, containing PD-Ibeta cDNA had high phosphodiesterase I activity compared to the mock-transfected cells. By using in situ hybridization to human metaphase chromosomes, we have assigned the locus for the PD-Ibeta (PDNP3) gene to the q22 region of human chromosome 6.
