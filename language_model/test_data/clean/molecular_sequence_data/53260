Myelin transcription factor 2 (MYT2), a putative transcription factor found in the human central nervous system, was cloned from an expression cDNA library from human T-cells. MYT2 shares weak similarity to bacterial type I topoisomerases and shares 63% sequence identity to a replicase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides. MYT2 preferentially binds supercoiled DNA (scDNA). Incubation of MYT2 and scDNA at or above equal molar ratios generated topoisomer-like patterns that were abolished by deproteination. Thus, MYT2 appears to relax scDNA via a non-enzymatic mechanism. The banding pattern of MYT2-scDNA complexes was shown to be quantisized, saturable and sequence-independent. Microinjection of MYT2 mRNA induced G(o) growth-arrested NIH 3T3 cells to enter the S phase of the cell cycle.
