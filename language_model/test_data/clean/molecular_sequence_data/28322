We have sequenced Bs1, an insertion element isolated from a null allele of the Adh1 locus encoding alcohol dehydrogenase in maize. The Bs1 element is 3203 base pairs (bp) in length, has 302-bp identical long terminal direct repeats (LTRs), and created a 5-bp flanking direct duplication of target Adh1 DNA upon insertion. The 5' LTR is followed by a canonical primer binding site with homology to the plant initiator methionyl-tRNA, and the 3' LTR is directly preceded by a polypurine stretch like that observed in retroviruses and retrotransposons. Bs1 encodes two overlapping open reading frames specifying peptides of 740 and 168 amino acids. The longer open reading frame specifies a peptide with amino acid homology to the protease and nucleic acid binding moiety of retroviruses and retrotransposons. The deduced amino acid sequence encoded by Bs1 lacks convincing homology to the polymerase (reverse transcriptase) encoded by retroposons, despite the fact that this polymerase-encoding domain is routinely the most conserved region of any such element. The sequence and relatively small size of Bs1 suggest that this element is a deleted retrotransposon that inserted into Adh1 with the aid of a reverse transcriptase function provided in trans. In vitro transcribed Bs1 complementary RNA was translated in vitro to produce both a protein of 81 kDa representing open reading frame 1 (ORF1) and one of the 95-kDa size predicted for the frame-shifted fusion of ORF1 and ORF2. As with many other retroposons, the efficiency of translational initiation at the AUG beginning ORF1 was not noticeably affected by the presence of one or more upstream, unproductive AUGs in the complementary RNA transcript.
