Regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a family of proteins, which accelerate GTPase-activity intrinsic to the alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins and play crucial roles in the physiological control of G-protein signaling. Here, yellow grouper RGS16 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The expression level of the fusion protein was up to 30% of the total cellular protein.Western blotting analysis showed that a band with the molecular mass of about 21 Kda was detected. The purified recombinant protein was used to prepare polyclonal antibody, and antiserum obtained was highly specific with the titer of over 1:32,000. Additionally, RGS16 protein was expressed in the Tn-5B1-4 insect cells. Western blotting analysis revealed that the expressed protein had immunoreactivity.
