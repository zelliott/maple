To determine whether the growth of cardiac fibroblasts during development is modulated by the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor (IGF-1R), the expression of IGF-1, IGF-2, and IGF-1R was determined in fibroblasts from fetal and postnatal hearts. The expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and DNA polymerase-alpha was also evaluated in combination with the estimation of DNA replication. In comparison with fetal hearts, at postnatal day 21, fibroblast expression of IGF-1R mRNA, IGF-2, PCNA, and DNA polymerase-alpha was reduced by 77, 70, 80, and 86%, respectively. Moreover, IGF-1R protein decreased by 48% at 21 days. Bromodeoxyuridine labeling decreased by 88 and 89% in the left and right ventricle, respectively, at this time. Two different antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to IGF-1R reduced DNA replication by 60 and 44% in fibroblasts in culture. In addition, this intervention markedly attenuated the growth response of fibroblasts to IGF-1 or serum. In conclusion, the IGF-1R system appears to play a major role in the regulation of fibroblast growth in the heart in vivo.
