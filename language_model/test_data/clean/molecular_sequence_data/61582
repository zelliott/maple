Adeno-associated virus type 5 (AAV5) has a linear, single-stranded DNA genome of ca. 5 kb and an overlapping transcription profile featuring multiple promoters and a single intron in the center of the genome. Unlike the situation for the prototype AAV2, AAV5 RNAs transcribed from upstream promoters at map units 7 (P7) and 19 (P19), which encode the viral Rep proteins, are predominantly polyadenylated at a site within the intron [(pA)p]. RNAs generated from the AAV5 capsid gene promoter P41, which is only 78 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the intron donor, and 281 nt upstream of (pA)p, primarily readthrough (pA)p, are polyadenylated at a more distal site at the 3' end of the genome [(pA)d] and ultimately spliced. The intron contains the core sequences sufficient for polyadenylation at (pA)p, which is governed by a G/U-rich downstream element that overlaps with the intron 3' A2 splice acceptor. In addition, polyadenylation of P7- and P19-generated RNAs at (pA)p is influenced by an upstream element that lies 5' to the start of the P41 transcript. Our results also suggest that splicing and polyadenylation of P41-generated RNA can compete for the same pool of precursor pre-mRNA molecules. The cis-acting signals within the A2 3' splice site that govern polyadenylation and splicing of AAV5 RNAs must be optimized to program both (i) the levels of polyadenylation of P7- and P19-generated RNA at (pA)p required to generate the proper levels of the essential Rep proteins and (ii) the splicing of P41-generated RNAs to generate the proper ratio of capsid proteins during AAV5 infection.
