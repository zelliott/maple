Raw yolk of 1-d-old eggs was either subjected to linear electron beam irradiation at approximately 2.5 kGy dosage or not processed. Both irradiated and nonprocessed egg yolk samples were stored at -15 C after irradiation. Testing was conducted on 0, 1, 7, 15, 30, and 60 d of storage. Development of storage modulus (G') was delayed in irradiated samples after 7 d, which suggests that less structure was developed in irradiated egg yolk than in nonprocessed egg yolk during storage. Irradiated samples retained more soluble protein within the first 7 d and showed slightly improved emulsion capacity over that from nonprocessed samples. However, irradiated egg yolk was less bright than nonprocessed samples. No differences were observed in SDS-PAGE patterns of soluble proteins and delipidized low density lipoprotein (LDL). The LDL isolated from irradiated liquid egg yolk showed no difference in N-terminal amino acids compared to that of nonprocessed egg yolk, indicating no detectable cleavage of LDL. However, the denaturation temperature of irradiated samples at Day 0 shifted about 1 C lower than that of the nonprocessed sample. Results indicated that electron beam irradiation did not cause significant physical, chemical or functional changes of egg yolk, or cleavage of egg yolk protein. Therefore, electron beam irradiation could serve as a preservation method for liquid egg yolk.
