In this paper we describe a fast and mild method based on the use of a unique cation exchanger and buffers containing ethylene glycol and salt for the purification of the myelin basic protein (MBP; MW 18.5 kDa). MBP thus purified hydrolyses catalytically p-nitrophenyl acetate. This esterase activity facilitates not only the purification of MBP but also indicates that probably it is in its native state, i.e. there is a good chance that the purified molecules are structurally and chemically identical. This is a prerequisite to obtain crystals appropriate for x-ray diffraction and other studies.
