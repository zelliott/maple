The viral haemagglutinin (HA) and the viral polymerase complex determine the replication fitness of a highly virulent variant of influenza A virus strain A/PR/8/34 (designated hvPR8) and its high pathogenicity in mice. We report here that the HA of the hvPR8 differs from the HA of a low virulent strain (lvPR8) by the efficiency of receptor binding and membrane fusion. hvPR8 bound to 2,6-linked as well as 2,3-linked sialic acid-containing receptors, whereas lvPR8 bound exclusively to 2,3-linked sialic acids with high avidity. Remarkably, hvPR8 infected its target cells faster than lvPR8 and tolerated an elevated pH for efficient membrane fusion. In spite of these differences, both viruses targeted type II but not type I pneumocytes in the lung of infected mice. The HA of hvPR8 differs from that of lvPR8 by 16 aa substitutions and one insertion. Mutational analyses revealed that amino acid at HA position 190 (H3 numbering) primarily determined the specificity of receptor binding, while the insertion at position 133 influenced the avidity of receptor binding. Both amino acid positions also strongly influenced viral virulence. Furthermore, leucine at position 78 and glutamine at position 354 were critical determinants of increased fusion activity and virulence of hvPR8. Our data suggest that the HA of hvPR8 enhances virulence by mediating optimal receptor binding and membrane fusion thereby promoting rapid and efficient viral entry into host cells.
