Photoaffinity labeling with IMP was used to attach covalently this activator to its binding site of Escherichia coli carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. We now identify histidine 995 of the large enzyme subunit as the amino acid that is cross-linked with IMP. The identification was carried out by comparative peptide mapping in two chromatographic systems of peptides differentially labeled with [3H]IMP and with the labeled inhibitor [14C]UMP, followed by automated Edman degradation and radiosequence analysis. Site-directed substitution of His995 by alanine confirmed His995 to be the only amino acid in the protein forming a covalent adduct with IMP. The His995Ala mutant protein was soluble and active and exhibited normal kinetics for the activator ornithine and for the substrates in the presence of ornithine. However, the mutation selectively induced changes in the activation by IMP and the inhibition by UMP, and it abolished the photolabeling of the enzyme by IMP without affecting the photolabeling by the inhibitor UMP. Since UMP is cross-linked to Lys993 [Cervera, J., et al. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 7247-7255] only two residues upstream of the site of IMP labeling, the results provide structural evidence for earlier proposals which suggested that UMP and IMP bind in a single or overlapping site. The two residues are within the region previously proposed as the binding fold for the nucleotide effectors. In the crystal structure of the enzyme, Lys993 and His995 are exposed and line a crevice where a Pi molecule was found [Thoden, J. B., et al. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 6305-6316]. UMP and IMP appear to bind in this crevice, possibly toward the C-side of the beta-sheet in a Rossman fold. Their binding in this site is consistent with the selectivity of adduct formation of UMP with Lys993 and of IMP with His995. It is also consistent with the nonessentiality of His995 for the binding, since the interactions with other residues that line the crevice must contribute a large part of the binding energy. The lack of an effect of the mutation on the activation by ornithine is consistent with the binding of this activator in a separate site in the protein.
