A diarrhea outbreak caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has been observed in China since December 2010. We report here the complete genome sequence of PEDV strain AJ1102 isolated from a suckling piglet with acute diarrhea, which will help toward understanding the molecular and evolutionary characteristics of the epidemic PEDV in China.
