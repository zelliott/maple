DNA primase is an essential replication protein that catalyzes the synthesis of oligoribonucleotide primers. DNA primase, consisting of two subunits (p49 and p58), plays a key role in both the initiation of DNA replication and the synthesis of Okazaki fragments for lagging strand synthesis. We mapped the locations of human chromosomes of the genes coding for both subunits [p49 (PRIM1) and p58 (PRIM2)] by PCR amplification using DNAs of a panel of somatic hybrids, to chromosomes 1 and 6, respectively. The PRIM1 gene was mapped to 1q44, and two PRIM2 loci (PRIM2A and PRIM2B) were detected at 6p11.1-p12 by fluorescence in situ hybridization using several genomic DNA probes.
