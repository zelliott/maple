The amino acid sequence of rat ribosomal protein S10 was deduced from the sequence of nucleotides in a recombinant cDNA and confirmed from the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein. Ribosomal protein S10 contains 165 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 18917 Da. Hybridization of the cDNA to digests of nuclear DNA suggests that there are 17-20 copies of the S10 gene. The mRNA for the protein is about 750 nucleotides in length. Ribosomal protein S10 has several possible internal duplications; one is a tandem repeat of ten residues that is basic and contains two or three prolines.
