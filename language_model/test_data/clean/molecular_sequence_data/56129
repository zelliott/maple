A Pasteurella haemolytica-like organism, a new species of bacterium isolated from piglets with diarrhea, secretes a leukotoxin into the culture media. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis indicated that this leukotoxin cross-reacted with antileukotoxin antibody derived from cattle immunized with P. haemolytica. Five overlapping recombinant bacteriophages carrying the gene for this 105-kDa polypeptide were identified with a DNA probe containing sequences from the P. haemolytica lktCA genes from a P. haemolytica-like organism strain 5943 genomic library. Sequence analysis of a region of the cloned DNA revealed two open reading frames encoding proteins with predicted masses of 19.4 and 101.6 kDa. These genes, which we designate pllktC (P. haemolytica-like organism leukotoxin C gene) and pllktA (A gene), respectively, are similar in sequence to the RTX (repeat of toxin) toxin family. The structure of the 101.6-kDa protein derived from the DNA sequence shows three transmembrane domains in the N-terminal part of the protein, 13 glycine-rich repeat domains in the second half of the protein, and a hydrophobic C-terminal part. pllktC and pllktA are strongly homologous to P. haemolytica lktC and lktA genes. However, this leukotoxin kills both BL-3 and pig leukocytes and is not hemolytic.
