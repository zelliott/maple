Endoproteolytic cleavage of hormone and neuropeptide precursors, as well as many complex proteins, such as coagulation factors and viral glycoproteins, is a key process in the generation of bioactive polypeptides. These cleavages typically occur at the dibasic amino acid residues Lys-Arg or Arg-Arg. The enzymes responsible for the processing belong to a newly discovered family of serine proteases related to the bacterial subtilisins. These include PACE (furin), PC1/PC3, PC2 and PACE4, which have all been characterized functionally and structurally.
