Using two-dimensional (2D)-PAGE, partial protein internal sequencing, and PCR with degenerate primers, we cloned a novel cDNA named HEP21 from hen egg white. The 0.5-kb cDNA encodes a 106 amino acid protein with a cysteine spacing pattern suggesting that HEP21 is a new member of the uPAR/CD59/Ly-6/ snake neurotoxin superfamily. The closest homology of HEP21 is to mouse Ly-6C. Unlike most members of this protein family, HEP21 is not glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored but is a secreted protein, as indicated by its localization and the presence of a signal peptide in its sequence. Moreover, HEP21 appears as an original member of this protein superfamily because it is predominantly expressed in a tissue, i.e., the oviduct, and especially the magnum where the egg white components are secreted.
