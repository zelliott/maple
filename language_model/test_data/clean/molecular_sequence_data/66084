Twenty-eight strains of P(8), four of P(4) and one of P(19) rotavirus, isolated in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, during 2002-2003, were investigated by sequence analysis of the VP4 gene. Seven of the 28 P(8) rotavirus VP4 sequences clustered in the P(8)-3 lineage, or the rare, so-called OP354-like lineage. Amino-acid sequence comparison revealed that Vietnamese P(8)-3 rotaviruses were generally very similar to Malawian strains, including the prototype OP354 strain. The numerical severity scores of diarrhoeal disease caused by the Vietnamese P(8)-3 rotaviruses were statistically higher than those of diarrhoeal disease caused by rotaviruses in the more common P(8)-2 lineage. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the VP4 gene of a Vietnamese G9P(19) rotavirus isolate showed a high degree of homology with the cognate genes of other human and porcine rotaviruses, including the prototype 4F strain.
