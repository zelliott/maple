Sequencing conditions for postsource decay and collision-induced dissociation/postsource decay matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry have been optimized to elucidate the structure of polyglycylation of tubulin. This posttranslational modification involves the linkage of multiple glycine residues through the gamma-carboxyl of glutamic acid residues in the carboxyl termini of the protein. Individual alpha- and beta-tubulin polypeptides contain respectively three and four potential glycylation sites. The sample preparation we used was the thin-layer preparation of the target specimen in the presence of alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and nitrocellulose. The study of different synthetic polyglycylated peptides fragmentation (modified peptides with the linear sequence DATAEEEGEFEEEGEQ) shows that the peptides fragment regularly to form major fragments of b- and y-type ions with negligible side-chain fragmentation. The rules were applied to the structural elucidation of a Paramecium beta-tubulin hexaglycylated peptide available in the subpicomole range. Polyglycylation was identified on the last four glutamic acid residues.
