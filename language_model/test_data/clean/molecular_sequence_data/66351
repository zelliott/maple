The mtDNA of the ascomycetous wine yeast Candida zemplinina is a circularly mapping genome of 23,114 bp. It contains 35 genes coding for the seven basic subunits of oxidative phosporylation found in yeasts (the genes encoding for NADH oxidoreductase subunits are absent), the ribosomal protein Var1, two rRNAs and 25 tRNA genes. Although protein phylogenetic analysis showed a divergent mitochondrial genome, several traits appeared preserved. The conserved gene blocks between the mtDNAs of C. zemplinina and Candida glabrata were maintained and changes in gene order and putative promoters were due to restricted genome reshuffling. New heterogeneous hairpin elements were identified scattered throughout cox1 introns. The large subunit rRNA gene harboured the first group-IIB1 intron containing a putative active reverse transcriptase (RT) in mitochondrial genomes of fungi. Phylogenetic analysis of the RT protein confirmed its closer relationship to eubacterial intronic RTs, while being only distantly related to all other fungal mitochondrial group-II introns and RTs. The findings point towards an early migration event of a eubacterial group-II intron to the mitochondrial genome of C. zemplinina.
