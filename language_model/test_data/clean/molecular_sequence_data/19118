The structure, homologies, polymorphism and expression profiles of a new gene, aap1, have been studied for precisely characterizing it and defining its putative involvement in thermo-tolerance of both vegetative mycelium growth and sporophore differentiation. Sequence polymorphism was analyzed in 3 homokaryons of A. bisporus and 24 strains having different abilities for mycelial growth at temperatures above 30 째C and for producing mature fruiting bodies at 25 째C. The level of gene expression was measured by real-time PCR both in vegetative mycelium after transfer from 25 to 32 째C and in primordia and fruiting bodies produced during cultures at 17 or 25 째C. The results indicated that aap1 gene belong to a new subfamily of the yeast YAP1 homologs. It is not a dominant contributor to the thermo-tolerance of A. bisporus, but the protein it encodes may be involved as an overall stress resistance transcription factor. The way Aap1 senses redox level differs from that of AP-1-like transcription factor Yap1.
