Here we test the hypothesis that membrane-spanning β-sheets can exhibit structural plasticity in membranes due to their ability to shift hydrogen-bonding patterns. Transmembrane β-sheet forming peptides of the sequence AcWL(n), where n = 5, 6, or 7, which range from 21 to 27 Å in maximum length, were incorporated into bilayers made of phosphatidylcholine lipids with saturated acyl chains containing 14, 16, or 18 carbons, which are 36-50 Å in thickness. The effect of the peptide β-sheets on fluid- and gel-phase bilayers were studied with differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism spectroscopy. We show that AcWL₅ forms a stable, peptide-rich gel phase in all three lipids. The whole family of AcWL(n) peptides appears to form similarly stable, nonmembrane-disrupting β-sheets in all bilayer phases and thicknesses. Bilayers containing up to 20 mol % peptide, which is the maximum concentration tested, formed gel phases with melting temperatures that were equal to, or slightly higher than, the pure lipid transitions. Given the range of peptide lengths and bilayer thicknesses tested, these experiments show that the AcWL(n) family of membrane-inserted β-sheets exhibit remarkable structural plasticity in membranes.
