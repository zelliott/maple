The Bombyx mori sex determination gene Bmdsx is alternatively spliced in the male and female to produce the male- and female-specific proteins. In an effort to better understand the mechanism of the alternative splicing regulation of Bmdsx, we conducted a gel-shift assay followed by LC-MS/MS analysis to identify the putative proteins bound to the cis-element CE1+6 in the exon 4 of Bmdsx. A protein named as BmHrp28 which is homologous to the Drosophila Hrp48, a member of the hnRNPA/B family, was identified and expressed in Escherichia coli for testing RNA-protein binding in vitro. All of the results showed that BmHrp28 specifically bound to the CE1+6 RNA probe. BmHrp28 has two RNA recognition motifs at the N-terminal and a glycine-rich motif at the C-terminal. It might be one of the factors involved in the male-specific splicing of Bmdsx.
