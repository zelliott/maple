Rat microsatellite primers were used for detection of homologous DNA segments in the mouse species (Mus laboratorius, Mus musculus musculus, and Mus spretus). Twenty five (16.3%) of 153 rat primer pairs amplified specific DNA segments, when genomic DNA of mice was used as a template in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Size variation among inbred strains of mice was found for 13 DNA segments (8.5%). Eight out of the 13 polymorphic DNA segments were mapped to a particular chromosome with two sets of recombinant inbred strains, AKXL or BXD. Similarly, mouse microsatellite primers were used for detection of homologous DNA segments in rats (Rattus norvegicus). Twenty (12.0%) of 166 primer pairs amplified specific DNA segments from rat genome. Size variation among inbred strains of rats was found for seven DNA segments (4.2%). Eleven of these 20 DNA segments were mapped with a rat x mouse somatic cell hybrid clone panel and/or linkage analysis by use of backcross progeny. Our results suggest that the mapped DNA segments are really homologs between mouse and rat. These polymorphic DNA segments are useful genetic markers.
