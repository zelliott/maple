A cDNA encoding the human homolog of mouse T-cell and mast cell growth factor P40 was derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and phorbol myristate acetate. Sequence analysis of the cDNA predicted a precursor protein of 144 amino acids including a signal peptide of 18 residues, a structure identical with that of mouse P40. The homology between the mouse and human proteins is 55% with a perfect conservation of the 10 cysteine residues present in the mature polypeptide. Expression of the cDNA for human P40 in a baculovirus vector yielded a protein capable of enhancing in vitro survival of human T cell lines.
