DNA shuffling facilitated the evolution of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) variant with enhanced replication in pig-tailed macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pt mPBMC). This variant consists exclusively of HIV-1-derived sequences with the exception of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) nef. Sequences spanning the gag-protease-reverse transcriptase (gag-pro-RT) region from several HIV-1 isolates were shuffled and cloned into a parental HIV-1 backbone containing SIV nef. Neither this full-length parent nor any of the unshuffled HIV-1 isolates replicated appreciably or sustainably in pt mPBMC. Upon selection of the shuffled viral libraries by serial passaging in pt mPBMC, a species emerged which replicated at substantially higher levels (50 to 100 ng/ml p24) than any of the HIV-1 parents and most importantly, could be continuously passaged in pt mPBMC. The parental HIV-1 isolates, when selected similarly, became extinct. Analyses of full-length improved proviral clones indicate that multiple recombination events in the shuffled region and adaptive changes in the rest of the genome contributed synergistically to the improved phenotype. This improved variant may prove useful in establishing a pig-tailed macaque model of HIV-1 infection.
