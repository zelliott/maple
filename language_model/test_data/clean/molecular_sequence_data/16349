In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of a full-length cDNA clone for the hormone-inducible regulatory subunit RII beta (formerly called RII51) of type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase from a human testis cDNA library. The cloned cDNA demonstrated tissue-specific expression of RII beta mRNA in human tissues, with the highest mRNA levels in testis and ovary. The isolated human cDNA clone was 3.3 kilobases (kb) in length and contained 166 base pairs (bp) of G/C-rich 5'-noncoding sequence, an open reading frame of 1254 bp and an A/T-rich 3'-nontranslated region containing 1836 bp followed by an 89 nucleotide long poly(A)-tail. The predicted protein contains 418 amino acids including the start methionine, and the estimated mol wt of human RII beta is 53,856. The nucleotide sequence within the open reading frame and the predicted amino acid sequence of human RII beta are highly conserved compared with partial rat RII beta sequences, displaying 91% and 97% similarity, respectively. Codon preference analysis of the cloned cDNA sequence indicated that the two cAMP-binding domains and the hinge region are highly conserved through evolution, whereas the dimerization domain displayed a codon preference pattern indicative of appearance at a later stage of evolution. The isolated human cDNA detected an FSH- and cAMP-inducible mRNA of 3.2 kb in rat Sertoli cells, thus confirming that the cloned cDNA represents the hormone-inducible regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. This is the first report documenting the isolation of a full-length cDNA clone for the RII beta of cAMP-dependent protein kinase.
