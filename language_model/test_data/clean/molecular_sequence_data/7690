Chiral separation methods development using conventional techniques such as GC or HPLC requires a lot of experience, effort, and expense, due to the wide diversity of the optically active solutes and their possible chiral selectors. Capillary electrophoresis has received increased attention as an alternative technique for chiral separation due to its inherent high efficiencies and ease of methods development. However, due to the wide variety of chiral selectors available in CE, the benefits of this technique might be diminished without an appropriate methods development scheme. In this paper detailed examples are shown for fast, efficient, and predictable chiral capillary electrophoresis separation methods development based on a new and systematic theory. Optimized separations and their parameters are presented for several enantiomeric acids and bases. All the three possible cases, such as the use of low and high pH, as well as pH = pK buffer systems are thoroughly discussed.
