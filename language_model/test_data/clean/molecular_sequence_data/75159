The cDNA that encodes goat growth hormone (gGH) was isolated from a goat pituitary cDNA library. The cDNA, about 880 base pairs long, had a coding sequence, 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions and a poly(A) chain. The cDNA could encode a polypeptide of 217 amino acids. The amino acid sequence homology between gGH and the sequences of bovine GH, rat GH and human GH was 99, 83 and 66%, respectively. By Northern blot hybridization, we found that the possible gGH gene is transcribed in the goat pituitary.
