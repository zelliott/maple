To identify the GATA4 gene mutation of congenital ventricular septal defect (VSD) and study the molecular mechanism of a novel mutation.

The clinical data and blood samples from 185 unrelated subjects with congenital VSD were collected and evaluated together with 200 healthy individuals. The coding exons and the flanking intron regions of the GATA4 gene were amplified by PCR and sequenced using the di-deoxynucleotide chain termination approach. The GATA4 gene was cloned and the corresponding mutant was acquired by site directed mutagenesis. The recombinant plasmid expressing GATA4 and the reporter vector expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) driven by the promoter of atrial natrium peptide (ANP) gene were transfected into HeLa cells with Lipofectamine. The effect of mutated GATA4 gene on the transcriptional activity of encoded transcriptional factor was analyzed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR.

A novel heterozygous missense GATA4 mutation, c.191G>A was identified in 1 VSD patient. The mutation leads to glycine to glutamic acid change at amino acid residue 64 (G64E) in the GATA4 protein. Functional analysis showed that GATA4 G64E mutation decreased the transcriptional activity of GATA4 transcriptional factor.

A novel heterozygous missense GATA4 mutation, G64E, was identified in 1 VSD patient. The mutation might cause VSD by impairing the transcriptional activity of GATA4 transcriptional factor.
