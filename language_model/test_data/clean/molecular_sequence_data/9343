DNA fingerprints and end sequences from bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) from two new libraries were generated to improve the first generation integrated physical and genetic map of the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) genome. The current version of the physical map is composed of 167,989 clones of which 158,670 are assembled into contigs and 9,319 are singletons. The number of contigs was reduced from 4,173 to 3,220. End sequencing of clones from the new libraries generated a total of 11,958 high quality sequence reads. The end sequences were used to develop 238 new microsatellites of which 42 were added to the genetic map. Conserved synteny between the rainbow trout genome and model fish genomes was analyzed using 188,443 BAC end sequence (BES) reads. The fractions of BES reads with significant BLASTN hits against the zebrafish, medaka, and stickleback genomes were 8.8%, 9.7%, and 10.5%, respectively, while the fractions of significant BLASTX hits against the zebrafish, medaka, and stickleback protein databases were 6.2%, 5.8%, and 5.5%, respectively. The overall number of unique regions of conserved synteny identified through grouping of the rainbow trout BES into fingerprinting contigs was 2,259, 2,229, and 2,203 for stickleback, medaka, and zebrafish, respectively. These numbers are approximately three to five times greater than those we have previously identified using BAC paired ends. Clustering of the conserved synteny analysis results by linkage groups as derived from the integrated physical and genetic map revealed that despite the low sequence homology, large blocks of macrosynteny are conserved between chromosome arms of rainbow trout and the model fish species.
