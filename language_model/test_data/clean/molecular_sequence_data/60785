Although many individuals with malignancy develop Abs against p53, little is currently known of the structural features, V gene usage, and degree of somatic mutation of these Abs. Such information is critical to any meaningful understanding of the nature and significance of this humoral immune response to p53. We have constructed phage display libraries from six individuals with colorectal cancer and a demonstrable serum immune response against p53. Following panning with recombinant p53, a total of 43 binding Fab were identified. Four of these Abs bound with high affinity to wild-type denatured p53 (1.19 x 10-8 - 1.57 x 10-8), as determined by BIAcore analysis, and were highly specific for both recombinant and cell line-derived p53, as determined by ELISA and immunoprecipitation. Epitope mapping showed they were reactive with the N terminus of human p53 between residues 27 and 44. Sequence analysis showed that the heavy chains were derived from the VH1 gene family, and the light chains from VL4. The pattern of replacement and silent mutations in the Fab sequence indicated that negative selection had occurred in the framework regions of all the VH genes. We show that lymphocytes from individuals with cancer represent a valuable source of high affinity human Abs against p53. This approach provides an opportunity to examine the genetic structure of these naturally occurring Abs, and to draw inferences regarding the nature of the immune response that produced them. Abs identified in this way have a number of potential therapeutic applications.
