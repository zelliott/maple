Eight actinomycete strains originally isolated from soil and plant samples were studied to determine their taxonomic status. All isolates produced branching substrate mycelia, but no distinct aerial hyphae. Relatively short chains of nonmotile spores (10 to 30 spores per chain) were borne on the tips of sporophores arising directly from the agar surface. The chemotaxonomic characteristics of the isolates, with the exception of the menaquinone profile, coincided with those of members of the family Streptosporangiaceae Goodfellow, Stanton, Simpson, and Minnikin 1990. Furthermore, the results of a phylogenetic analysis performed with 5S rRNA support the conclusion that the isolates should be classified in this family. The isolates differed from members of the constituent genera of the Streptosporangiaceae in morphological characteristics and menaquinone composition. Therefore, we propose a new genus for the strains, Herbidospora. The type species and type strain are Herbidospora cretacea sp. nov. and strain K-319 (= JCM 8553), respectively.
