Interleukin-5 (IL-5) plays a central role in the growth and differentiation of eosinophils and contributes to several disease states including asthma. Accumulating evidence suggests a role for cAMP as an immunomodulator; agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels have been shown to inhibit production of cytokines predominantly produced by T helper (Th) 1 cells such as IL-2 and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). In contrast, the production of IL-5, predominantly produced by Th2 cells, is actually enhanced by these agents. In this report, we have performed transient transfection experiments with IL-5 promoter-reporter gene constructs, DNase I footprinting assays, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays to investigate the key regulatory regions necessary for activation of the IL-5 promoter by dibutyryl cAMP and phorbol esters in the mouse thymoma line EL-4. Taken together, our data demonstrate the critical importance of two sequences within the IL-5 5'-flanking region for activation by these agents in EL-4 cells: one, a highly conserved 15-base pair element present in genes expressed by Th2 cells, called the conserved lymphokine element 0 (CLE0; located between -53 and -39 in the IL-5 promoter), and the other, two overlapping binding sites for the transcription factor GATA-3 (but not GATA-4) between -70 and -59. Taken together, our data suggest that activation via the unique sequence combination GATA/CLE0 results in selective expression of the IL-5 gene in response to elevated levels of intracellular cAMP.
