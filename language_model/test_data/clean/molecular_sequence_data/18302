Acrosin is a multifunctional enzyme combining several functional properties within a single molecule: the catalytic triad of the proteinase, hydrophobic domains responsible for the special membrane-associating character of the enzyme and the carbohydrate binding sites by which the molecule can bind to the zona pellucida. Acrosin occurs in the sperm acrosome as an inactive precursor, proacrosin, with a molecular mass of 53-55 kDa. Proacrosin is activated by a single proteolytic clip between Arg23 and Val24 generating the high molecular mass acrosin. The activation of proacrosin to the biologically active enzyme which occurs concomitantly with the acrosome reaction appears to be regulated on and by the zona pellucida. It is hypothesized that alternating cycles of binding to the zona, digestion of the zona and release from the zona together with the forward motility of the spermatozoon would be required to achieve penetration.
