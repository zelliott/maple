Aspergillus nidulans hypA encodes a predicted 1474 amino acid, 161.9 kDa cytoplasmic peptide. Strains with hypA1 and hypA6 alleles are wild type at 28 degrees C but have wide, slow-growing hyphae and thick walls at 42 degrees C. hypA1 and hypA6 have identical genetic lesions. hypA1 and hypA6 restrictive phenotypes have statistically similar morphometry, and strains with either allele can conidiate at 42 degrees C. hypA deletion strains require osmotic support and have aberrant morphology, but produce viable spores at 28 degrees C. hypA has full-length orthologs in filamentous fungi and yeasts and a 200 amino acid region with similarity to sequences in plants and animals. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae hypA ortholog is TRS120, a regulatory subunit in the TRAPP II complex that mediates traffic through the Golgi equivalent. Enzyme secretion is reduced in hypA1 cells at 42 degrees C. Endomembranes and cytoplasmic actin arrays in hypA1 have weak polarity at 42 degrees C and cytoplasmic microtubules have reduced number and normal distribution.
