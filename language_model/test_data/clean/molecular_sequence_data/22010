Dynamin, a protein playing crucial roles in endocytosis, oligomerizes to form spirals around the necks of incipient vesicles and helps their scission from membranes. This oligomerization is known to be mediated by the GTPase effector domain (GED). Here we have characterized the structural features of recombinant GED using a variety of biophysical methods. Gel filtration and dynamic light scattering experiments indicate that in solution, the GED has an intrinsic tendency to oligomerize. It forms large soluble oligomers (molecular mass > 600 kDa). Interestingly, they exist in equilibrium with the monomer, the equilibrium being largely in favour of the oligomers. This equilibrium, observed for the first time for GED, may have regulatory implications for dynamin function. From the circular dichroism measurements the multimers are seen to have a high helical content. From multidimensional NMR analysis we have determined that about 30 residues in the monomeric units constituting the oligomers are flexible, and these include a 17 residue stretch near the N-terminal. This contains two short segments with helical propensities in an otherwise dynamic structure. Negatively charged SDS micelles cause dissociation of the oligomers into monomers, and interestingly, the helical characteristics of the oligomer are completely retained in the individual monomers. The segments along the chain that are likely to form helices have been predicted from five different algorithms, all of which identify two long stretches. Surface electrostatic potential calculation for these helices reveals that there is a distribution of neutral, positive and negative potentials, suggesting that both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions could be playing important roles in the oligomer core formation. A single point mutation, I697A, in one of the helices inhibited oligomerization quite substantially, indicating firstly, a special role of this residue, and secondly, a decisive, though localized, contribution of hydrophobic interaction in the association process.
