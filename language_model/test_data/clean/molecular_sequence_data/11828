Neuropeptide Y (NPY), peptide YY (PYY), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) are structurally related peptides found in all higher vertebrates. NPY is expressed exclusively in neurons, whereas PYY and PP are produced primarily in gut endocrine cells. Several receptor subtypes have been identified pharmacologically, but only the NPY/PYY receptor of subtype Y1 has been cloned. This is a heptahelix receptor that couples to G proteins. We utilized Y1 sequence information from several species to clone a novel human receptor with 43% amino acid sequence identity to human Y1 and 53% identity in the transmembrane regions. The novel receptor displays a pharmacological profile that distinguishes it from all previously described NPY family receptors. It binds PP with an affinity (Ki) of 13.8 pM, PYY with 1.44 nM, and NPY with 9.9 nM. Because these data may identify the receptor as primarily a PP receptor, we have named it PP1. In stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells the PP1 receptor inhibits forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis. Northern hybridization detected mRNA in colon, small intestine, pancreas, and prostate. As all three peptides are present in the gut through either endocrine release or innervation, all three peptides may be physiological ligands to the novel NPY family receptor PP1.
