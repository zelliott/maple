Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is an important cause of pneumonia in pigs around the world, but confirming its presence in (or absence from) pigs can be difficult. Culture for diagnosis is impractical, and seroconversion is often delayed after natural infection, limiting the use of serology. Numerous PCR assays for the detection of M. hyopneumoniae have been developed, targeting several different genes. Recently, genetic diversity among strains of M. hyopneumoniae was demonstrated. The effect of this diversity on the accuracy and sensitivity of the M. hyopneumoniae PCR assays could result in false-negative results in current PCR tests. In this study, a panel of isolates of M. hyopneumoniae, M. flocculare, M. hyorhinis, and M. hyosynoviae were tested with a number of M. hyopneumoniae-specific PCR assays. Some M. hyopneumoniae PCR assays tested did not detect all isolates of M. hyopneumoniae. To increase the efficiency of PCR testing, two new real-time PCR assays that are specific and capable of detecting all of the M. hyopneumoniae isolates used in this study were developed.
