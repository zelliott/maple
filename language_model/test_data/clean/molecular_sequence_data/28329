Using a quantitative RNA hybridization method, we have identified a third murine T-cell receptor beta-chain variable (V) region gene, V beta 9, that engenders recognition of Mls-1a gene products. V beta 9-expressing T cells are clonally deleted from the periphery of mice that carry the Mls-1a allele, and the fine specificity of V beta 9+ hybridomas suggests that V beta 6-, V beta 8.1-, and V beta 9-encoded T-cell receptors may recognize a similar antigenic epitope. Comparison of these three protein sequences identifies two residues that may be important in determining this recognition specificity.
