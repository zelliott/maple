Peptide analogues containing reversed peptide bonds between each residue along the peptide sequence (retro-inverso modification) have been analyzed for their antigenic and in vivo immunogenic properties in the MHC II and Th cell response context. Two antigenic peptides were selected for this study, namely peptide 103-115 of poliovirus VP1, which is involved in the production of Abs that neutralize the infectivity of the virus, and peptide 435-446 from the third constant region of mouse heavy chain IgG2a allopeptide gamma 2ab, which mimics a corneal Ag implicated in autoimmune keratitis. In a competition assay performed in vitro using reference hybridomas of known MHC class II restriction, both retro-inverso analogues bound (although more weakly in our test) to I-Ad and/or I-Ed class II molecules. However, in both cases, this lower affinity was apparently largely compensated in vivo, as a T cell response (with IL-2 secretion), equivalent to that obtained with the wild-type peptides, was observed following immunization of BALB/c mice with the retro-inverso analogues. Moreover, these T cells proliferated and produced IL-2 in response to the cognate peptides. It is concluded that the T cell receptors of T cells primed in vivo with the retro-inverso analogues readily cross-react with parent and retro-inverso analogue-MHC complexes. The approach of using pseudopeptides containing changes involving the backbone, and not the orientation of side chains, may thus be promising to design potent immunogens for class II-restricted T cells.
