There is now much evidence to suggest that the p53 tumour suppressor protein functions to monitor the integrity of the genome. When DNA damage is detected, p53 suppresses cell growth to allow repair or directs the cell into apoptosis. The mechanism of action of p53 is as yet unclear but recent evidence has accumulated to suggest that p53 might act by regulating gene expression. Consistent with this model, p53 can both activate and repress a number of viral and cellular promoters. p53 has also been shown to bind to the CCAAT-binding Factor and TATA-binding protein (TBP), and there is direct evidence that p53 represses in vitro transcription by preventing TBP from binding DNA. We now provide evidence that p53 can repress transcription from the SV40 promoter by disrupting DNA/protein complexes involving transcription factor Sp1.
