Cruciferin (a 12 S globulin) is the most abundant storage protein in the seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress) and other crucifers, sharing structural similarity with the cupin superfamily of proteins. Cruciferin is synthesized as a precursor in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subunit assembly is accompanied by structural rearrangements involving proteolysis and disulfide-bond formation prior to deposition in protein storage vacuoles. The A. thaliana cv. Columbia genome contains four cruciferin loci, two of which, on the basis of cDNA analysis, give rise to three alternatively spliced variants. Using MS, we confirmed the presence of four variants encoded by genes At4g28520.1, At5g44120.3, At1g03880.1 and At1g3890.1 in A. thaliana seeds. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, along with immunological detection using anti-cruciferin antiserum and antibodies against phosphorylated amino acid residues, revealed that cruciferin was the major phosphorylated protein in Arabidopsis seeds and that polymorphism far exceeded that predicted on the basis of known isoforms. The latter may be attributed, at least in part, to phosphorylation site heterogeneity. A total of 20 phosphorylation sites, comprising nine serine, eight threonine and three tyrosine residues, were identified by MS. Most of these are located on the IE (interchain disulfide-containing) face of the globulin trimer, which is involved in hexamer formation. The implications of these findings for cruciferin processing, assembly and mobilization are discussed. In addition, the protein phosphatase 2C-impaired mutant, abi1-1, was found to exhibit increased levels of cruciferin phosphorylation, suggesting either that cruciferin may be an in vivo target for this enzyme or that abi1-1 regulates the protein kinase/phosphatase system required for cruciferin phosphorylation.
