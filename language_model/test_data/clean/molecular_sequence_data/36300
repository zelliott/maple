Close relationships between the nervous system and immune systems at molecular levels have now become evident. Receptors for CDF/LIF and CNTF, i.e., factors which play important roles in the nervous system, share a close structural similarity to those for IL-6, which is a molecule acting in the immune system. Receptors for these three factors belong to a subtype of cytokine receptor family (class IB cytokine receptor). We have constructed a higher subdomain structure of the receptor for CDF/LIF based on its known primary structures. The receptor contains immunoglobulin and fibronectin-like domains, in addition to common domains of the cytokine receptor, similar to those cell surface molecules of the neural immunoglobulin gene super family. These domains appear to have similar structures to the immunoglobulin. These lines of evidence suggest that the class IB cytokine receptor was formed as a result of those fusion of the genes for a more primitive cytokine receptor IA and for the neural immunoglobulin super gene family, and that, likewise, many molecules regulating neural development and those which act in the immune system have a common evolutionary origin.
