A review is presented related to the biochemistry of lignocellulose transformation. The biodegradation of wood constituents is currently understood as a multienzymatic process with the mediation of small molecules; therefore, this review will focus on the roles of these small molecular compounds and radicals working in concert with enzymes. Wood rotting basidiomycetous fungi penetrate wood and lead to more easily metabolized, carbohydrate constituents of the complex. Having a versatile machinery of enzymes, the white rot fungi are able to attack directly the "lignin barrier." They also use a multienzyme system including so-called "feed back" type enzymes, allowing for simultaneous transformation of both lignin and cellulose. These enzymes may function separately or cooperatively.
