We designed a screen to identify starfish oocyte proteins able to bind monomeric cyclin B by affinity chromatography on a cyclin B splice variant displaying low affinity for cdc2. We identified a 15kDa protein previously described as a cdk-binding protein [Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Res. 1589 (2002) 219-231]. Cybip is encoded by a single polymorphic gene and the native protein is matured by cleaving a signal peptide. We firmly establish the fact that it is a true cyclin B-binding protein, since the recombinant protein binds recombinant cyclin B in absence of any cdk. Finally, we show that the microinjection of GST-cybip, and of anti-cybip antibody, in maturing starfish oocytes, inhibits H1 kinase and MPF inactivation, and first polar body emission.
