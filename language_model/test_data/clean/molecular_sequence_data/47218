Vitellogenesis is an important part of reproductive process in crustaceans, and the process is characterized by the synthesis and accumulation of yolk protein in the developing oocytes. The yolk proteins in crustaceans mainly consist of vitellogenin (Vg) and vitellin (Vn), which are respectively present in extra-oocyte tissues and intra-oocytes. The site and the process of yolk protein synthesis in crustaceans are still controversial. The synthesis site of Vg in a crustacean species, Macrobrachium rosenbergii, is determined by immunological and immunohistochemical techniques, and molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding the primary structure of Vn in this study. The hepatopancrease is clearly shown to be the synthesis site of Vg in this species. The length of Vg mRNA was estimated as about 6 kb from Northern blotting analysis. The partial primary structure of Vg gene is presented, and the post-translational processing are further discussed. For the first time, the partial primary structure of Vg gene and the synthesis site of Vg approached by molecular cloning in crustaceans are presented.
