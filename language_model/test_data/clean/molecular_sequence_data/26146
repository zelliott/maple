The nucleotide sequence of the aacC2 gene encoding ++aminoglycoside acetyltransferase AAC(3)-II was determined. The structural part of the 852-bp aacC2 gene encoded the protein with the molecular weight of 30.6 consisting of 286 amino acids. The promotor region and the structural part of the gene were compared with the known sequences of the aacC2 gene. Evolutionary changes in the regulatory region as well as a number of nucleotide substitutes in the structural part of the gene and amino acid substitutes in the enzyme molecule were detected.
