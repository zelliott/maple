In order to investigate whether several DNA lesions (O6-methylguanine, 8-hydroxyguanine, xanthine, an abasic site analogue and hypoxanthine) activate a c-Ha-ras gene and to determine the type of mutations induced by the DNA lesions, they were introduced into a synthetic c-Ha-ras gene by DNA cassette mutagenesis techniques. The modified genes were transfected into mouse NIH3T3 cells and the c-Ha-ras genes present in transformed cells were analysed. O6-methylguanine and xanthine induced a mutation to A, hypoxanthine induced a mutation to G. 8-hydroxyguanine and the abasic site analogue caused random mutations in the modified and adjacent positions. These results indicated that the synthetic c-Ha-ras gene is very useful for the detection of mutations caused by a DNA lesion.
