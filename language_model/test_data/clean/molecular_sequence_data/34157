In this study, we characterized the rinderpest virus (RPV) Fusan strain cattle type (B), which is the most classical isolate in Asia, by complete genomic sequence analysis and compared it with its lapinized Nakamura III (L) strain. The transversion rates of the M, F, and H genes were higher than those of other genes. In contrast, the deduced amino acid (aa) substitution rates of the P, C, and V genes were higher than those of other genes, although their transversion rates were not higher. The characteristic nucleotide (nt) or aa residues of the cattle-virulent B and Kabete 'O' strains were observed in the P/C/V, M, and L genes. According to these results, we speculate that nt/aa substitution in the P/C/V genes is one of the key determinants for the difference in the pathogenicity to cattle of the B and L strains.
