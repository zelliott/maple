ADAMTS (a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase domain with thrombospondin type 1 modules) proteins constitute a family of zinc metalloproteinases which target and process extracellular matrix proteins. We cloned and characterized a novel human ADAMTS gene, ADAMTS14, which is located on human chromosome 10q2. ADAMTS14 exhibits the characteristic multidomain structure of ADAMTS proteins including four thrombospondin modules and shows highest similarity to ADAMTS3 and ADAMTS2. By RT-PCR analysis we demonstrated that ADAMTS14 is expressed in human retina and also at low levels in adult brain, lung and placenta.
