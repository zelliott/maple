The invasive ability of Shigella spp. is correlated with the expression of several plasmid-encoded proteins, including invasion plasmid antigen C (IpaC). By characterizing the antigenic structure of IpaC with monoclonal antibodies and convalescent-phase sera, it may be possible to determine the physical location of specific epitopes as well as the involvement of epitopes in a protective immune response or the host's susceptibility to disease. By using overlapping octameric synthetic peptides, which together represent the entire IpaC protein, the precise linear sequence of four surface-exposed epitopes was defined for four IpaC monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, 17 unique peptide epitopes of IpaC were mapped by using 9-day-postinfection serum samples from 13 rhesus monkeys challenged with Shigella flexneri 2a. Each individual recognized a somewhat different array of IpaC peptide epitopes after infection with shigellae. However, the epitopes were clustered within three regions of the protein: region I (between amino acid residues 1 and 61), region II (between amino acid residues 177 and 258), and region III (between amino acid residues 298 and 307). Region II was recognized by 92% of S. flexneri-infected individuals and was considered to be a highly immunogenic region. Animals asymptomatic for shigellosis after challenge with S. flexneri recognized peptide epitopes within all three epitopic regions of IpaC, whereas symptomatic animals recognized peptides in only one or two of the epitopic regions. Antibody from monkeys challenged with S. sonnei recognized IpaC peptide epitopes which fell within and outside the three S. flexneri epitopic regions. While numerous potential epitopes exist on the IpaC protein, the identification of three regions in which epitopes are clustered suggests that these regions are significant with respect to the immune response and to subsequent pathogenesis postinfection.
