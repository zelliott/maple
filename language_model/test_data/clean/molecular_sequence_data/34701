Mass spectrometry (MS) has gradually replaced classical methods as a major tool in protein sequencing and characterization. However, the sample preparation repertoire has not changed very much; it has just been adjusted to the needs of the new analytical method. In this chapter frequently used in-solution enzymatic digestions and chemical cleavages are reviewed. In addition, some practical recommendations as well as the advantages and shortcomings of the methods are discussed.
