A new monoamine oxidase type C-like dehydratase gene (MaoC) supplying (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA from the fatty acid oxidation pathway to polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) biosynthetic pathways was identified from Phytophthora capsici. MaoC was over-expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant MaoC was purified. The purified tagged MaoC shows the enoyl-CoA hydratase activity of 58 U/mg towards crotonyl-CoA. MaoC may not fold properly above 40°C which was revealed by circular dichroism analysis. Crystal of MaoC diffracts to 1.93 with unit-cell parameters of a = 81.458 Å, b = 82.614 Å, c = 124.228 [corrected] Å, α = β = γ = 90°.
