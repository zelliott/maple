The nucleotide sequences of the hly and plcA genes (encoding listeriolysin, a thiol-activated cytolysin and a non-specific phospholipase C, respectively) were determined for two strains of Listeria monocytogenes serotype 1/2b. The deduced amino acid sequences for listeriolysin were identical for the two strains and identical to that of listeriolysin from serotype 4b. The two serotype 1/2b strains differed in one amino acid (histidine vs asparagine) in the deduced amino acid sequence for phosopholipase C.
