We have isolated a novel restriction endonuclease, Hpy188I, from Helicobacter pylori strain J188. Hpy188I recognizes the unique sequence, TCNGA, and cleaves the DNA between nucleotides N and G in its recognition sequence to generate a one-base 3' overhang. Cloning and sequence analysis of the Hpy188I modification gene in strain J188 reveal that hpy188IM has a 1299-base pair (bp) open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 432-amino acid product. The predicted protein sequence of M.Hpy188I contains conserved motifs typical of aminomethyltransferases, and Western blotting indicates that it is an N-6 adenine methyltransferase. Downstream of hpy188IM is a 513-bp ORF encoding a 170-amino acid product, that has a 41-bp overlap with hpy188IM. The predicted protein sequence from this ORF matches the amino acid sequence obtained from purified Hpy188I, indicating that it encodes the endonuclease. The Hpy188I R-M genes are not present in either strain of H. pylori that has been completely sequenced but are found in two of 11 H. pylori strains tested. The significantly lower G + C content of the Hpy188I R-M genes implies that they have been introduced relatively recently during the evolution of the H. pylori genome.
