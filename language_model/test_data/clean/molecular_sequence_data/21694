Blood platelets play a key role in physiological hemostasis and in thrombosis. As a consequence, platelet functional analysis is widely used in the diagnosis of hemorrhagic disorders as well as in the evaluation of thrombosis risks and of the efficacy of antithrombotics. Glycoprotein (GP) VI is a platelet-specific collagen-signaling receptor. Clinical studies suggest that increased GPVI expression is associated with a risk of arterial thrombosis. Conversely, GPVI deficiencies have been identified in patients with defective platelet responses to collagen. Currently, there is no standard test available for measuring GPVI expression, essentially because antibodies usually cross-link GPVI upon binding, leading to platelet activation and consecutive changes in GPVI expression. Here, we designed a recombinant monovalent antibody fragment (scFv) derived from an anti-GPVI monoclonal IgG, 3J24, with the characteristics required to analyze GPVI expression. Guided by in silico modeling and V-KAPPA chain analysis, a Protein L (PpL) recognition pattern was engineered in the scFv, making possible its purification and detection using PpL conjugates. The PpL affinity-purified scFv is functional. It retains GPVI-binding specificity and allows detection of platelet surface-expressed GPVI without inducing platelet activation. In conclusion, the reshaped scFv may be very useful in the development of diagnostic approaches.
