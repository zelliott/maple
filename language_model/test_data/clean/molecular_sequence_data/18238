Ca(2+)-ions play a key role in the regulation of many cellular processes and impairment of calcium homeostasis has been implicated in several diseases. Intracellularly the Ca(2+)-signal is transmitted by two families of proteins, the 'EF-hand'- and the Ca(2+)-dependent and phospholipid binding proteins. Their protein and gene structures as well as possible functional roles are summarized.
