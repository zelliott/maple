This article describes a novel HLA-B*27 allele, HLA-B*27:79, which was identified in a Hunan Han ethnic individual of China by a PCR sequence-based typing method. The new sequence has one nucleotide mutation at position 437(Aâ†’T) compared with the allele B*27:04:01. This nucleotide change causes an amino acid substitution from Aspartate (Asp) to Valine (Val) at codon 122. This is the first report of mutation at this position in the HLA-B locus. Then, we investigated the HLA-B*27 subtype polymorphism of the Hunan Han population, and the results showed that B*27:04, B*27:05 and B*27:06 are the predominant subtypes with the allele frequencies 0.97%, 0.26% and 0.10% respectively.
