In vivo patterns of expression of a miniature swine class I major histocompatibility gene, PD7, were analyzed both in situ in the pig, and in transgenic mice. Structural analysis of PD7 DNA sequences revealed that PD7 is highly homologous to the pig gene PD1, which encodes a classical transplantation antigen. Despite the extensive homology, PD7 is expressed in situ at markedly lower levels than PD1 in nearly all tissues. Introduction of PD7 into mice results in a pattern of PD7 expression in the transgenic animals that parallels that observed in situ in the pig. Comparison of two lines of PD7 transgenic mice, which differ only in the extent of 5' flanking sequence, reveals the presence of a silencer element. The silencer activity is tissue specific: differences in PD7 expression are observed only in lymphoid tissues and skin. Skin from both lines of transgenics mediates graft rejection, but the rate of rejection correlates with the level of PD7 expression.
