To elucidate the roles of genes involved in the cell wall biogenesis and function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we isolated and characterized mutants that were lethal in a strain in which the SED1 gene encoding a cell wall mannoprotein was disrupted. Thus, double mutants of SED1 and either MNN9 or MNN10 were unable to grow and YOL155c on a multicopy plasmid could suppress their synthetic lethality. A Yol155cp-GFP fusion protein was found to localize to the cell wall, suggesting that it might also be a cell wall mannoprotein. Subsequently, we analysed the effects of the shut-off of SED1 in a sed1 and mnn9 double mutant: cells after the shut-off showed anomalous cellular morphology and died in the mitotic M phase. From these and other results, we postulate that these genes function cooperatively with each other and in a cell cycle-dependent manner in the biogenesis and maintenance of cell wall in S. cerevisiae.
