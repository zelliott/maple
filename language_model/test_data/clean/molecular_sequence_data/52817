Streptomyces reticuli produces a heme-containing homodimeric enzyme (160 kDa), the catalase-peroxidase CpeB, which is processed to the enzyme CpeC during prolonged growth. CpeC contains four subunits of 60 kDa each that do not include the C-terminal portion of the progenitor subunits. A genetically engineered cpeB gene encodes a truncated subunit lacking 195 of the C-terminal amino acids; four of these subunits assemble to form the enzyme CpeD. Heme binds most strongly in CpeB, least in CpeD. The catalase-peroxidase CpeB and its apo-form (obtained after extraction of heme) catalyze the peroxidation of Mn(II) to Mn(III), independent of the presence or absence of the heme inhibitor KCN. CpeC and CpeD, in contrast, do not exhibit manganese-peroxidase activity. The data show for the first time that a bacterial catalase-peroxidase has a heme-independent manganese-peroxidase activity, which depends on the presence of the C-terminal domain.
