A 17.5 kb DNA fragment of chromosome XI, located between the genetic loci mif2 and mak11 was sequenced and analysed. Ten open reading frames were identified. Two of them are the previously sequenced genes ELM1 and PRI2, two (YKL253 and YKL256) show homologies to proteins from other organisms and one (YKL262) to yeast and mouse histone.
