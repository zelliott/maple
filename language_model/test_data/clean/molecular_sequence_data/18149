With the aid of computers, the HLA molecule for 52 specificities was cut up into peptides of 2-7 amino acids in length. From all possible peptides identified, we produced an extensive table of peptides unique to each HLA specificity. The HLA types of donors and recipients of first cadaver donor transplants were then converted to their peptides and used for matching. When compared to conventional matching, tripeptide matching was more effective in identifying patients with extremely poor outcomes. The total effectiveness of peptide matching was rather modest, although it is anticipated that this new tool, together with refined knowledge of the most immunogenic peptides, will provide a more practical method of HLA matching for allotransplantation.
