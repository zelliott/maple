The circumsporozoite (CS) protein of malaria parasites is a major surface protein of the sporozoite stage. In the process of investigating the immunogenicity of this protein in the Plasmodium vivax complex, we found that a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the CS protein of isolates of P. vivax recognizes New World monkey hepatocytes and human hepatoma cells HepG2A16 in Western blot and by immunoelectron microscopy. The mAb NVS3 binds to the amino acid sequence AGDR, which is also shared with the alpha 3 domain of the human and primate major histocompatibility complex class I. In addition, in vitro experiments suggest that the binding of the mAb NVS3 to hepatocytes from Saimiri monkey enhances the invasion or development of malaria sporozoites. These results form the basis for investigating the relationships between parasite surface proteins and host-cell receptors.
