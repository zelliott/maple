An interleukin-5 (IL-5)-dependent subclone, K-5, was established from an IL-3-dependent murine hemopoietic progenitor cell line by co-culturing with bone marrow stroma cells. K-5 cells were induced to differentiate into myeloid lineage cells by co-culturing with cloned PA6 stroma cells. By co-culturing with another cloned stroma cell (ST-2s10), K-5 cells gave rise to a factor-independent transformant cell line LT-5 which proliferated in an autocrine manner by secretion of IL-5 and produced tumors in nude mice. Molecular cloning of the IL-5 gene of LT-5 cells and the nucleotide sequencing of its 5' flanking region indicate that a transposition of an intracisternal A-particle (IAP) element to the 5' flanking region of the IL-5 gene is responsible for the constitutive expression of IL-5 mRNA of an aberrant size in LT-5 cells.
