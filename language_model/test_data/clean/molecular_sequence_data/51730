The hsp 70 gene of Plasmodium cynomolgi was isolated and characterized. As expected the gene is highly similar to that of the hsp 70 gene of Plasmodium falciparum (98% at the protein level, 82% at the nucleotide level). Surprisingly, the hsp 70 gene appears to be present in a single copy in all the P. cynomolgi strains tested, a finding that has implications for the parasite's ability to undergo a heat shock response.
