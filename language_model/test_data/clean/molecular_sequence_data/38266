DNA sequences with very high similarity (95-98%) to the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) ENV gene have been amplified by PCR in 38.5% of human breast tumors and in <2% of normal breast tissue (Wang et al., Cancer Res., 55: 5173-5179, 1995). Intrigued by these findings, which suggested an exogenous viral etiology for a certain percentage of human breast tumors, we have screened a panel of human breast tumors and normal breast tissue for the presence of MMTV-like DNA sequences. Using similar PCR procedures and stringent hybridization techniques, we have detected the presence of MMTV-like ENV gene sequences in 37% of the human breast tumors that we have analyzed. DNA sequencing has shown these sequences to be 99% homologous to the BR6 strain of MMTV and 100% homologous to the GR and C3H strains of MMTV. We have not detected these MMTV-like sequences in normal breast tissue. However, we have detected these sequences by PCR and stringent hybridization in a T-cell lymphoma of a breast cancer patient who was simultaneously diagnosed with both diseases. Our results support the possibility of an exogenous retroviral etiology for a certain percentage of human breast tumors. Our results also suggest that a similar exogenous retroviral etiology may exist for certain human T-cell lymphomas. In many inbred strains of mice, both breast cancer and T-cell lymphoma are caused by MMTV, hence, in a certain percentage of humans, one or both of these diseases may be caused by an MMTV-like retroviral entity.
