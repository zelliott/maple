The construction of integrated maps at all levels of resolution will facilitate determination of the DNA sequence and, ultimately, the entire gene content of the human genome. In the past two years, the need for extensive frameworks on which to anchor the maps of the human chromosomes has been emphasized. The first framework has been provided following construction of the genetic map using microsatellite markers. This is now being united with extensive collections of expressed sequence tags and other landmarks using radiation hybrid mapping into higher resolution map. Rapid progress is also being made towards integrating these reagents through the construction of physical clone maps using yeast artificial chromosomes which provide near-complete cloned coverage of human chromosomes.
