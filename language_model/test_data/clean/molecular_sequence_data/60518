Previously, it was found that the dnaK1 gene of the halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica encodes a polypeptide of 721 amino acids which has a long C-terminal region rich in acidic amino acid residues. To understand whether the A. halophytica DnaK1 possesses chaperone activity at high salinity and to clarify the role of the extra C-terminal amino acids, a comparative study examined three kinds of DnaK molecules for ATPase activity as well as the refolding activity of other urea-denatured proteins under various salinity conditions. DnaK1s from A. halophytica and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 and the C-terminal deleted A. halophytica DnaK1 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The ATPase activity of A. halophytica DnaK1 was very high even at high salinity ( 1.0 M NaCl or KCl), whereas this activity in Synechococcus PCC 7942 DnaK1 decreased with increasing concentrations of NaCl or KCl. The salt dependence on the refolding activity of urea-denatured lactate dehydrogenase by DnaK1s was similar to that of ATPase activity of the respective DnaK1s. The deletion of the C-terminal amino acids of A. halophytica DnaK had no effect on the ATPase activity, but caused a significant decrease in the refolding activity of other denatured proteins. These facts indicate that the extra C-terminal region of A. halophytica DnaK1 plays an important role in the refolding of other urea-denatured proteins at high salinity. Furthermore, it was shown that DnaK1 could assist the copper binding of precursor apo-plastocyanin as well as that of mature apo-plastocyanin during the folding of these copper proteins.
