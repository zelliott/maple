The major secretory ribonuclease (RNase) of human urine (RNase HUA) was isolated and sequenced by automatic Edman degradation and analysis of peptides and glycopeptides. The isolated enzyme was shown to be free of other urine RNase activities by SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and activity staining. It is a glycoprotein 128 amino acids long, differing from human pancreatic RNase in the presence of an additional threonine residue at the C-terminus. It differs from the pancreatic enzyme in its glycosylation pattern as well, and contains about 45 sugar residues. Each of the three Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequences (Asn-34, Asn-76, Asn-88) is glycosylated with a complex-type oligosaccharide chain. Glycosylation at Asn-88 has not been observed previously in mammalian secretory RNases. Preliminary sequence data on the major RNase of human seminal plasma have revealed no difference between it and the major urinary enzyme; their similarities include the presence of threonine at the C-terminus. The glycosylation pattern of human seminal RNase is very similar to that of the pancreatic enzyme. The structural differences between the secretory RNases from human pancreas, urine and seminal plasma must originate from organ-specific post-translational modifications of the one primary gene product. Detailed characterization of peptides and the results of gel filtration of tryptic and tryptic/chymotryptic digests of performic acid-oxidized RNase have been deposited as Supplementary Publication SUP 50146 (4 pages) at the British Library Lending Division, Boston Spa, Wetherby, West Yorkshire LS23 7BQ, U.K., from whom copies can be obtained on the terms indicated in Biochem.
