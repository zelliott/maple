Five new C21 steroidal glycosides, namely, komarosides D (1), E (2), F (3), G (4), and H (5), along with two known C21 steroidal glycosides cynatratoside E (6) and hancoside A (7), were isolated from the ethanol extract of the roots of Cynanchum komarovii Al. Iljinski (Asclepiadaceae). Their structures were determined by physiochemical and spectroscopic analysis. Among these glycosides, five had an aberrant 13,14:14,15-disecopregnane-type skeleton, and the other two had normal four-ring C21 steroid skeletons. The existence of more than one type of C21 steroid skeleton in one species is rare in the plants of the family Asclepiadaceae, and this has chemotaxonomic significance for this species.
