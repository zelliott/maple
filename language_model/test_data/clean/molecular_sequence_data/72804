We identified a novel Drosophila gene, Dpkn (Drosophila protein kinase related to PKN), encoding a putative protein serine/threonine kinase. Although the cDNA obtained was incomplete at its 5'-terminal region, the deduced amino acid sequence of its kinase domain exhibits a high degree of similarity to protein kinase N (PKN), which has a kinase domain related to protein kinase C (PKC) and leucine zipper-like sequences in the amino terminal region. Expression of Dpkn was observed throughout Drosophila development, although its expression level decreased at later stages of embryogenesis. The expression of Dpkn is first detected in the newly formed mesodermal cell layer and is then restricted to the developing somatic musculature, indicating a possible role of Dpkn in the development of somatic muscles in Drosophila.
