To investigate genes involved in metastatic stages of cancer, we analyzed expression of mRNAs in three cell lines derived from murine colon adenocarcinoma 26 by means of a differential display method. Each of these lines exhibits distinct metastatic characteristics. Among many bands representing different expression patterns in the display, we confirmed by northern analysis that a gene corresponding to one amplified fragment, termed grm2 (gene related to metastasis 2), was expressed more abundantly in NL4, the derivative with the lowest metastatic potential, than in cell lines NL17, an experimentally metastatic derivative, and in NL22, a spontaneously metastatic derivative. Using the grm2 fragment as a probe, we isolated murine cDNA clones and subsequently human cDNA clones corresponding to the GRM2 gene. The human and mouse homologues both encode proteins of 600 amino-acid residues, which show weak homologies to proteins belonging to the myosin family. When we examined the expression levels of this novel gene in human colon cancers and in corresponding metastatic foci, we found that in more than half of these tissues, expression was significantly reduced in association with malignant potential. Our results imply that in humans the GRM2 gene product may regulate the metastatic phenotype of some colorectal cancers.
