Six oleanane-type saponins, along with two known triterpene saponins, were isolated from the leaves of Gymnema sylvestre. The structures of the oleanane triterpene glycosides were characterized as longispinogenin 3-O-beta-D-glucuronopyranoside, 21 beta-benzoylsitakisogenin 3-O-beta-D-glucuronopyranoside, 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl oleanolic acid 28-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester, oleanolic acid 3-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-D- glucopyranoside, 3-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl (1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl oleanolic acid 28-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester and 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl oleanolic acid 28-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester on the basis of hydrolysis and spectral evidence, including 1D- and 2D-NMR (TOCSY, ROESY, HMQC and HMBC) and FABMS analyses.
