Transferrin (Tf) is a multi-function protein with a central role in iron metabolism, and it is this function that is associated with a role in the innate immune system response. The clear link between Tf and immune defense mechanism lead to propose Tf as a candidate gene for disease resistance. In this study, genomic and cDNA sequences of Tf gene in gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.) (SaTf gene), were identified and characterized. SaTf gene structure consists of a coding region of 2076 nucleotides divided into 17 exons and a no-coding region that includes 16 introns and spans 5495 nucleotides. The deduced Tf protein for gilthead seabream is composed of 691 amino acids and consists of an initial peptide and two lobes (N- and C-lobes). This gene structure is similar to that of previously described Tf genes in other fish species. RT-PCR analyses carried out in different tissues and two developmental stages showed tissue-and stage-specific Tf expression in gilthead seabream. Finally, by sequencing the transferrin genomic sequences of 20 unrelated seabreams, 31 SNPs were identified. These data allowed the estimation of the frequency of nucleotide substitution in the SaTf gene as 1SNP per 253Â bp. SNPs were detected in different regions of the genomic sequence but they were mainly localized in non-coding regions, specifically, SNP frequency in non-coding regions was fifteen-fold higher than within coding regions.
