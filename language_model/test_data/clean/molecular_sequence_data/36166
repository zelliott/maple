The regulation of the human apolipoprotein (apo) B gene that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism is apparently very complex, with multiple cis- and trans-acting regulatory factors. One of these factors is an enhancer region in the second intron. In this region a point mutation at position + 722 has been found that is detectable by the restriction enzyme StyI. The report of Levy-Wilson et al. (1991) could suggest that the mutant allele (abolished StyI site) is associated with hypocholesterolemia. To investigate further the possible effect of this mutation on plasma cholesterol levels, we have compared the frequency of the mutant allele between 206 hypercholesterolemic Norwegian or Czech subjects on one hand, and 165 hypocholesterolemic Norwegian or Czech subjects on the other hand. No significant difference in frequency was found between the hypercholesterolemic and the hypocholesterolemic groups. This finding indicates either that the mutation at position + 722 does not affect the enhancer activity or that this in vitro enhancer activity is of little or no clinical significance. One of the Norwegian hypercholesterolemic subjects who was of Czech descent possessed the apoB 3500 mutation that leads to defective binding of low density lipoprotein (LDL) to the LDL receptors. Haplotype analysis of the apoB gene in her family showed that the mutation-bearing allele was identical to that reported in other countries, indicating a common gene source.
