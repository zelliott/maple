Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder, and about 95% of SMA patients are homozygous for deletions in the SMN1 gene. Herein, classical polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) using DraI yielded false homozygous deletions of SMN1 exon 7 in a patient with SMA, but multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis revealed one remaining copy of SMN1 exon 7. Sequencing showed that this false deletion in the PCR-RFLP resulted from a novel mutation of one SMN1 copy that was not deleted (c.863G > T, p.R288M). This novel sequence variant introduced a mismatch that interfered with primer binding. These findings demonstrate that comprehensive analysis using PCR-RFLP, multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification, and sequencing can reliably and correctly diagnose SMA.
