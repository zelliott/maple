The diverse biological functions of galanin are mediated via membrane bound high-affinity receptors. In order to identify and characterize potential galanin receptor subtypes, we have examined the specific 125I-galanin binding to the CHP-212 human neuroblastoma cell line. The galanin receptors expressed in CHP-212 cells, like GALR1 have high affinity for galanin (Kd = 0.07 nM) and the potency for inhibition of 125I-galanin binding by galanin peptides parallels that of hGALR1 expressed in a stable CHO cell line. We confirmed that GALR1 is expressed in these cells by RT-PCR. We further determined the tissue expression patterns of hGALR1 which is expressed in a variety of human tissues at a very low level, with the highest levels seen in heart, small intestine and prostate. A species of approximately 70 kDa is recognized by antisera specific for hGALR1 by Western blot analysis and should allow future measurements of receptor protein expression.
