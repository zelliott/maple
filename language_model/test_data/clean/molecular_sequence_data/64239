A random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) procedure was used to identify a specific 0.6 kb DNA fragment unique to Dermatophilus congolensis. This 0.6 kb fragment was evaluated as a specific DNA probe and used to design oligonucleotide primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The nucleotide sequences adjacent to this DNA fragment were determined by inverse PCR allowing the identification of a 4.1 kb sequence. Analysis of this revealed a complete open reading frame (ORF) with a high similarity to an alkaline ceramidase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The molecular weight of the enzyme derived from the predicted amino acid sequence is 74,662 Da, its pI is 9.81. The predicted N-terminal sequence of the enzyme contains a signal sequence indicating that the enzyme is exported by the bacterium. Since ceramides have important protective and cell regulatory roles in the epidermis we suggest that this ceramidase may have a role in the pathogenesis of dermatophilosis. It is the first completely sequenced gene described for D. congolensis.
