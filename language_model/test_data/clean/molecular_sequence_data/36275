We have isolated and sequenced a portion of the gene encoding the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II from three mammals. These mammalian sequences include one rodent and two primate CTDs. Comparisons of the new sequences to mouse and Chinese hamster show a high degree of conservation among the mammalian CTDs. Due to synonymous codon usage, the nucleotide differences between hamster, rat, ape, and human result in no amino acid changes. The amino acid sequence for the mouse CTD appears to have one different amino acid when compared to the other four sequences. Therefore, except for the one variation in mouse, all of the known mammalian CTDs have identical amino acid sequences. This is in marked contrast to the situation among more divergent species. The present study suggests that there is a strong evolutionary pressure to maintain the primary structure of the mammalian CTD.
