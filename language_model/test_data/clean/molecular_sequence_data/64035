Nine new bidesmosidic 3-O-glucuronide oleanane triterpenoid saponins were isolated from the stem bark of Symplocos glomerata King along with two known saponins, salsoloside C and copteroside E, and two major lignans, (-)-pinoresinol and (-)-pinoresinol-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside. The structures of the new saponins were established using one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry as, 3-O-[beta-D-xylopyranosyl(1-->4)-[2-O-acetyl]-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl]-28-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl]-oleanolic acid, 3-O-[beta-D-xylopyranosyl(1-->4)-[3-O-acetyl]-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl]-28-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl]-oleanolic acid, 3-O-[beta-D-xylopyranosyl (1-->4)-[2,3-O-diacetyl]-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl]-28-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl]-oleanolic acid, 3-O-[alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl(1-->4)-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl]-28-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl]-oleanolic acid, 3-O-[alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl (1-->4)-[2-O-acetyl]-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl]-28-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl]-oleanolic acid, 3-O-[[beta-D-xylopyranosyl (1-->2)]-[beta-D-xylopyranosyl (1-->4)]-[3-O-acetyl]-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl]-28-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl]-oleanolic acid, 3-O-[[beta-D-glucopyranosyl (1-->2)]-[beta-D-xylopyranosyl (1-->4)]-[3-O-acetyl]-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl]-28-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl]-oleanolic acid, 3-O-[[beta-D-glucopyranosyl (1-->2)]-[alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl (1-->4)]-[3-O-acetyl]-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl]-28-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl]-oleanolic acid, and 3beta-O-[beta-D-xylopyranosyl(1-->4)-[2-O-acetyl]-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl]-28-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl]-morolic acid. The EtOH and EtOAc extracts of the stem bark showed no cytotoxic activity. At a concentration of 370 microg/ml, the saponin mixture showed haemolytic activity and caused 50% haemolysis of a 10% suspension of sheep erythrocytes.
