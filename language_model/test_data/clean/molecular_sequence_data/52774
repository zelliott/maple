The midline tissues are important inductive centers of early vertebrate embryos. By signal peptide selection screening, we isolated a secreted factor, Kielin, which contains multiple cys-rich repeats similar to those in chordin (Chd). Expression of Kielin starts at midgastrula stages in the notochord and is detected in the floor plate of neurula embryos. Kielin is induced in mesoderm and in ectoderm by nodal-related genes. Chd is sufficient to activate Kielin expression in mesoderm whereas Shh or HNF-3beta in addition to Chd is required for induction in ectoderm. Kielin has a distinct biological activity from that of Chd. Injection of Kielin mRNA causes dorsalization of ventral marginal zone explants and expansion of MyoD expression in neurula embryos. Unlike Chd, Kielin does not efficiently induce neural differentiation of animal cap ectoderm, suggesting that the activity of Kielin is not simply caused by BMP4 blockade. Kielin is a signaling molecule that mediates inductive activities of the embryonic midline.
