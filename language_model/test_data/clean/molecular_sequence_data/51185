The refractive indices, water content, and volume of wet-spun films of Na-hyaluronate have been measured as a function of relative humidity (rh). These data are used with the Lorentz-Lorenz formula to determine the optical polarizabilities of Na-hyaluronate parallel and perpendicular to the helical axis. The analysis reveals a drop in the optical polarizabilities of approximately 20% between 80 and 88% rh, indicating a phase transition.
