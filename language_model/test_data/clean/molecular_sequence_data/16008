The paper describes a potent purification method, preparative gel retention, for the purification of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. This procedure exploits the sequence-specific DNA-binding affinity of such proteins for their enrichment, comparable to recognition site DNA affinity chromatography. The method was employed to obtain a pure preparation of nuclear factor I (NFI) from porcine liver from which sequences of partial peptides could be obtained. Oligonucleotide probes derived from these amino-acid sequences were used to identify genomic and cDNA clones of NFI.
