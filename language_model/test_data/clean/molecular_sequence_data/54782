There has been a long-standing interest in the role played by sugars in flowering. Of particular interest is how sugar-related signals are integrated into flowering genetic pathways. Here, we demonstrate that the INDETERMINATE DOMAIN transcription factor AtIDD8 regulates photoperiodic flowering by modulating sugar transport and metabolism. We found that whereas AtIDD8-deficient idd8 mutants exhibit delayed flowering under long days, AtIDD8-overexpressing plants (35S:IDD8) show early flowering. In addition, the sucrose synthase genes SUS1 and SUS4 were upregulated in 35S:IDD8 plants but downregulated in idd8 mutants, in which endogenous sugar levels were altered. AtIDD8 activates the SUS4 gene by binding directly to its promoter, resulting in promoted flowering in SUS4-overexpressing plants. SUS4 expression also responds to photoperiodic signals. Notably, the AtIDD8 gene is suppressed by sugar deprivation. Therefore, we conclude that AtIDD8 regulation of sugar transport and metabolism is linked to photoperiodic flowering.
