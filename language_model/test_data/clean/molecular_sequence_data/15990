A cDNA library was constructed in pUC 19, using poly(A+) RNA purified from Octopus dofleini branchial gland, which is the site of hemocyanin biosynthesis in cephalopods. The library was screened with an oligonucleotide probe derived from a portion of the partially known sequence of the C-terminal domain of Paroctopus dofleini dofleini. The clone with the longest insert--called pHC1--was sequenced and used as a probe for Northern blotting. It hybridized to a 9.5-kb RNA species, which was also visible as a band after ethidium bromide staining. The cDNA insert (approximately 1200 bp) of pHC1 contained an open reading frame of 1071 bp coding for 357 amino acids. In this insert, a region coding for 42 amino acids from the N-terminal end of the C-terminal domain is missing. These were obtained by sequencing a cloned primer extension product. By comparing our sequence with Helix pomatia beta c-hemocyanin unit D, we found 42.9% identical and 11.5% similar residues. One putative copper binding site (site B) was identified by homology to Helix hemocyanin and arthropodan hemocyanin. The location of a second possible site was identified.
