We present here a functional analysis of ARGRI and ARGRIII regulatory proteins which are involved together with ARGRII in specific regulation of arginine anabolic and catabolic pathways. Unlike ARGRII, ARGRI and ARGRIII have no transcriptional activation capacity. The first 60 amino acids of ARGRI (out of 177) are dispensable for its activity. The functional domain of the protein is located in the region of homology with MCM1 and SRF proteins. ARGRIII contains in its C-terminal portion a stretch of 17 aspartate residues which are indispensable for arginine regulation. Gene disruption of the ARGRIII gene impairs the growth of the mutant on rich medium, showing that ARGRIII has a pleiotropic role in the cell.
