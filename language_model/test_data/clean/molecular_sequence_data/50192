Using a subtractive cDNA approach we have identified a gene, PC326, expressed in 13 of 14 murine plasmacytoma cell lines, but not in any B- or pre-B-lymphoma cell lines. It expresses 4.6-kb and 5.2-kb mRNAs that encode a 747 amino acid protein containing two highly acidic domains flanking a novel, moderately acidic 20 amino acid sequence that is repeated 7.5 times. Sequence comparison identifies an additional 43 amino acid domain that is homologous to a repeated sequence found in the members of the beta-transducin gene family. The PC326 mRNA is detectable in testis but in no other murine tissues, including plasma cells induced by lipopolysaccharide stimulation of splenocytes. Somatic cell hybrids derived from plasmacytomas and fibroblast or T-cell lines have a fibroblastic or T-cell phenotype respectively. Unlike B-cell-specific genes (e.g. immunoglobulin), the expression of which is extinguished in these hybrids, PC326 mRNA appears to be irreversibly turned on in these hybrids. Since PC326 is not expressed in normal plasma cells, it appears that its expression is a cause or consequence of the tumorigenic process that generates murine plasmacytomas.
