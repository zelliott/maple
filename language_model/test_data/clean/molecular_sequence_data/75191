NCA (nonspecific cross-reacting antigen), a glycoprotein found in normal lung and spleen, is immunologically related to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which is found in over 95% of colon adenocarcinomas. From a human genomic library, we previously cloned part of an NCA gene and showed that the amino-terminal region has extensive sequence homology to CEA (Thompson, J. A., Pande, H., Paxton, R. J., Shively, L., Padma, A., Simmer, R. L., Todd, Ch. W., Riggs, A. D., and Shively, J.E. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 84, 2965-2969). We now present the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone, containing the entire coding region of NCA (clone 9). The clone was obtained from a lambda gt 10 library made from the colon carcinoma cell line SW 403; the clone contains a 34-amino acid leader sequence, 310 amino acids for the mature protein, and 1.4 kilobases of 3'-untranslated region of the NCA gene. A comparison of the NCA sequence to the CEA sequence (Oikawa, S., Nakazato, H., and Kosaki, G. (1987) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 142, 511-518; Zimmerman, W., Ortlieb, B., Friedrich, R., and von Kleist, S. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 84, 2690-2694) shows that both proteins contain doublets of an immunoglobulin-like domain, of which there are one copy in NCA and three copies in CEA, a 108-amino acid amino-terminal domain with no cysteine residues, and a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain of sufficient length to anchor the glycoproteins in the cell membrane. Overall, the corresponding coding regions possess 85% sequence homology at the amino acid level and 90% homology at the nucleotide level. Forty nucleotides 3' of their stop codons, the CEA and NCA cDNAs become dissimilar. The 108-amino acid amino-terminal region together with part of the leader peptide sequence corresponds exactly to a single exon described in our previous work. The data presented here further demonstrate the likelihood that CEA recently evolved from NCA by gene duplication, including two duplications of the immunoglobulin-like domain doublet of NCA.
