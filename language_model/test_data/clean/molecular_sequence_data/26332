The effects of intranigral injections of Spantide II, a novel tachykinin antagonist, on extracellular dopamine, and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels in the rat striatum were studied using in vivo microdialysis. The ability of Spantide II to inhibit intranigral substance P or neurokinin A stimulation of striatal dopamine levels was also studied. A unilateral injection (all substances were injected in a volume of 0.2 microliter) of Spantide II (0.7 nmol) into the substantia nigra, pars reticulata (SNR) of halothane anaesthetized rats produced a short-lasting decrease in dopamine levels in the ipsilateral striatum. Striatal DOPAC levels showed no change after Spantide II. A unilateral injection of substance P (0.07 nmol) into the SNR produced an increase in ipsilateral striatal dopamine levels, which was prevented when substance P was co-administered with Spantide II (0.7 nmol). A unilateral injection of neurokinin A (0.09 nmol) into the SNR produced an increase in ipsilateral striatal dopamine levels, which was not modified when neurokinin A was co-administered with Spantide II (0.7 nmol). Immunohistochemical analysis using antisera to tyrosine hydroxylase and neuropeptide K, as well as Cresyl violet staining, revealed that intranigral injections of Spantide II (0.7 nmol) did not produce significant damage in the substantia nigra. The results indicate that Spantide II is not 'neurotoxic' when injected intranigrally, and that it is a selective antagonist of substance P in the substantia nigra. Furthermore, the reduction of striatal dopamine levels after intranigral Spantide II injections suggests that the nigrostriatal dopamine projection is tonically stimulated by striatonigral substance P.
