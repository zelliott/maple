Branchio-oculo-facial syndrome (BOFS) is an autosomal-dominant condition characterized by three main features, respectively: branchial defects, ocular anomalies, and craniofacial defects including cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P). We report on one family with three affected, and two sporadic cases that have been found to carry missense mutations in the newly reported BOFS gene: TFAP2A. This report confirms the involvement of this transcription factor in this developmental syndrome with clinical variability. Moreover, we present CT scan temporal bone anomalies in the familial cases, related to branchial arch defects, highlighting the importance of radiological investigations for differential diagnosis.
