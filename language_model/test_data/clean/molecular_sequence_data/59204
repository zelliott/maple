A monoclonal antibody (MAB 2A8) was used for expression-cloning of a complete cDNA (1133/5) to a mRNA (3 kb) encoding a murine 76 kDa polypeptide. The N-terminal section of the polypeptide is composed of domains capable to form alpha-helical coiled-coils. Its C-terminus is proline-rich and has characteristics of the Src homology region 3 (SH3). Affinity-purified antibodies to a recombinant section of the protein show that the antigen is salt-stably associated with the centrosome throughout the cell cycle.
