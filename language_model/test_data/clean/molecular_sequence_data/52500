We cloned and characterized the epoxide hydrolase gene, EPH1, from Rhodotorula glutinis. The EPH1 open reading frame of 1230 bp was interrupted by nine introns and encoded a polypeptide of 409 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 46.3 kDa. The amino acid sequence was similar to that of microsomal epoxide hydrolase, which suggests that the epoxide hydrolase of R. glutinis also belongs to the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family. EPH1 cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli and resting cells showed a specific activity of 200 nmol min(-1)(mg protein)(-1) towards 1,2-epoxyhexane.
