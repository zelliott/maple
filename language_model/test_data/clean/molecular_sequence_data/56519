We have retro-transcribed and amplified by PCR the full-length cDNAs specifying the rat and human precursors of the single-stranded mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-binding protein (mtSSB). Each deduced sequence is composed of a 16-amino-acid (aa) N-terminal basic pre-sequence and a mature protein (132 aa in humans and 135 aa in the rat). The mature proteins are highly conserved among themselves and with the mtSSB from Xenopus laevis (Xl). Moreover, three regions of the protein are similar to corresponding domains of the SSB of Escherichia coli and to the E. coli F-sex factor SSB, indicating the existence of a broad class of DNA-binding proteins with structural and functional similarities both in prokaryotes and in prokaryote-derived organelles of higher organisms.
