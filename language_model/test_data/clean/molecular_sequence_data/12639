Axial deflection of DNA molecules in solution results from thermal motion and intrinsic curvature related to the DNA sequence. In order to measure directly the contribution of thermal motion we constructed intrinsically straight DNA molecules and measured their persistence length by cryo-electron microscopy. The persistence length of such intrinsically straight DNA molecules suspended in thin layers of cryo-vitrified solutions is about 80 nm. In order to test our experimental approach, we measured the apparent persistence length of DNA molecules with natural "random" sequences. The result of about 45 nm is consistent with the generally accepted value of the apparent persistence length of natural DNA sequences. By comparing the apparent persistence length to intrinsically straight DNA with that of natural DNA, it is possible to determine both the dynamic and the static contributions to the apparent persistence length.
