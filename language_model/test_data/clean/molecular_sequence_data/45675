The ascomycete Botrytis cinerea is a broad-spectrum plant pathogen. Here, we describe the first macroarray transcriptomic study of the fungus in real-time infection conditions. Infection of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves by B.cinerea was monitored using macroarrays, containing 3032 genes. Variance analysis revealed that 7% of B.cinerea genes are differentially expressed during infection and allowed us to identify 27 genes significantly up-regulated in planta. Among them, two genes have already been associated with fungal pathogenicity, while eight genes have unidentified functions. The 27 genes were separated into three groups according to their expression profile. The first group showed maximal expression at the early stage following fungal penetration, the second one showed maximal expression at the outset of the colonization of plant leaves and the third group showed maximal expression when the colonization of plant leaves was completed. A gene of the last group (BcPIC5), which is homologous to FKBP12 proteins, was disrupted in order to determine its role in pathogenicity. At seven days post-inoculation, the lesions caused by the DeltaBcPIC5 mutant on bean leaves were reduced by 69% and did not further expand compared to the wild-type. These results confirm that transcriptomic analysis under infection conditions can be very valuable for the identification of fungal genes related to pathogenicity.
