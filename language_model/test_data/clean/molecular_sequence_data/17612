Tissue specimens from 198 cases of Hodgkin's disease and 151 non-Hodgkin lymphomas as well as 34 non-malignant lymph node biopsies were examined for the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA by polymerase chain reaction. EBV-specific DNA sequences were detected in DNA extracts of 58% of Hodgkin's disease biopsies. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas and benign lymph node lesions were associated with EBV in far smaller proportions. In Hodgkin's disease biopsies, subsequent in situ hybridization revealed an exclusive localization of EBV DNA in the tumour cells, suggesting an involvement of EBV in the pathogenesis of Hodgkin's disease in a substantial proportion of cases.
