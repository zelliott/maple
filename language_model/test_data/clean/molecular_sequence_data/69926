A precolumn fluorescence derivatization method combined with high-performance liquid chromatography is described for the sensitive and selective determination of N-terminal tryptophan-containing peptides. The peptides and tryptophan were converted into fluorescent derivatives with glyoxal in a moderately acidic medium (pH 4.5). The derivatives were separated on a reversed-phase column with isocratic elution with an aqueous mobile phase composed of acetonitrile, methanol and phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), and subsequently detected by fluorimetry. The derivatization technique provided the respective N-terminal tryptophan-containing oligopeptides with single fluorescent peaks in chromatography. The detection limits for the peptides were 55-382 fmol per 100-microliters injection volume at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The method also allowed the facile detection of an N-terminal tryptophyl fragment in the enzyme reaction mixture of dynorphin A with trypsin.
