In comparing several histone H1 promoters, we have identified a highly conserved sequence element, 5'-TGTGTTA, located approx. 450-480 bp upstream from the cap site. This TG-box is a near perfect inverted repeat of the previously characterized AC-box (5'-AAACACA). The distance between these elements is also highly conserved. We performed transient transfection assays with cat gene reporter constructs which indicated that both the presence and correct position of the TG-box were essential for maximal expression of the chicken 02 H1 promoter. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first demonstration of an effect by the TG-box on transcription of a major histone-encoding H1 gene.
