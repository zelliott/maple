The mechanobullous disease Hallopeau-Siemens recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (HS-RDEB) results from mutations in the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) on chromosome 3p21.31. Typically, there are frameshift, splice site, or nonsense mutations on both alleles. In this report, we describe a patient with HS-RDEB, who was homozygous for a new frameshift mutation, 345insG, in exon 3 of COL7A1. However, sequencing of parental DNA showed that although the patient's mother was a heterozygous carrier of this mutation, the father's DNA contained only wild-type sequence. Microsatellite marker analysis confirmed paternity and genotyping of 28 microsatellites spanning chromosome 3 revealed that the affected child was homozygous for every marker tested with all alleles originating from a single maternal chromosome 3. Thus, the HS-RDEB phenotype in this patient is due to complete maternal isodisomy of chromosome 3 and reduction to homozygosity of the mutant COL7A1 gene locus. To our knowledge, there are no published reports of uniparental disomy (UPD) in HS-RDEB; moreover, this case represents only the third example of UPD of chromosome 3 to be reported. The severity of the HS-RDEB in this case was similar to other affected individuals and no additional phenotypic abnormalities were observed, suggesting an absence of maternally imprinted genes on chromosome 3.
