The Wnt gene family has a role in development as well as tumourigenesis. One mouse member, Wnt7a, is vital for limb development in vivo and also possesses transforming ability in vitro. This study reports the isolation of a full length of human homologue of mouse Wnt7a gene by library screening. Yeast artificial chromosome-fluorescence in situ hybridisation (YAC-FISH) mapped the WNT7A gene to chromosome 3p25. Human WNT7A had an ORF encoding a deduced protein of 349 aa that exhibited 97% and 92% identity to mouse Wnt7a at the aa and nucleic acid levels, respectively. It possessed the 22 conserved cysteine residues and 3 more at the amino terminus, and a putative poly A tail. This is the fifth human WNT gene in which a complete cDNA sequence had been determined.
