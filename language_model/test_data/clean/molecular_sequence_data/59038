Short cytoplasmic domains of integrin heterodimers are crucial for transduction of signals generated by adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix. Here, we describe the use of peptides mimicking the intracellular tails of integrin alpha5beta1 to assay in vitro associations with cytoskeletal proteins. Our results suggest that the focal adhesion protein, paxillin, may interact directly with the intracellular region of the integrin beta1 subunit. Paxillin is known to form stable complexes with several signaling molecules, including focal adhesion kinase. Physical interaction between paxillin and the beta1 cytoplasmic domain suggests a model in which paxillin may function as a key intermediary in integrin-mediated signal transduction.
