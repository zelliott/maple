The chloroplast psaA gene of the green unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii consists of three exons that are transcribed from different strands. Analysis of numerous nuclear and chloroplast mutants that are deficient in photosystem I activity reveals that roughly one-quarter of them are specifically affected in psaA mRNA maturation. These mutants can be grouped into three phenotypic classes, based on their inability to perform either one or both splicing reactions. The data indicate that the three exons are transcribed independently as precursors which are normally assembled in trans and that the splicing reactions can occur in either order. While some chloroplast mutations could act in cis, the nuclear mutations that fall into several complementation groups probably affect factors specifically required for assembling psaA mRNA.
