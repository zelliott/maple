The pathogenesis of enterotropic murine coronavirus strain MHV-Y differs extensively from that of prototypic respiratory strains of murine coronaviruses. The S protein of MHV-Y was characterized as a first step towards identifying viral determinants of enterotropism. Immunoblots of MHV-Y virions using anti-S protein specific antiserum revealed that the MHV-Y S protein was inefficiently cleaved. The MHV-Y S gene was cloned and sequenced. It encodes a protein predicted to be 1361 amino acids long. The presence of several amino acids changes within and surrounding the predicted cleavage site of the MHV-Y S protein may contribute to its inefficient cleavage.
