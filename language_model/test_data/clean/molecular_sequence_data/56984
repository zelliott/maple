The alpha-amylase (Amy)-encoding gene (amy) of Streptomyces thermoviolaceus CUB74, previously cloned in Escherichia coli and S. lividans and localised on a 1.7-kb BamHI-SphI genomic DNA fragment, has been sequenced. A single open reading frame of 1380 bp, which could encode an Amy protein of 460 amino acids (aa), was identified. The deduced aa sequence of the thermophilic Amy is similar (up to 69.5%) to the mesophilic Amy of S. griseus, S. limosus, S. venezuelae and S. hygroscopicus. A 40% sequence similarity was found between the extracellular forms of the S. thermoviolaceus and the pig pancreatic Amy. In addition, the activity of the S. thermoviolaceus Amy is strongly inhibited by tendamistat, a potent inhibitor of mammalian Amy. The nucleotide sequence at the 5' end of amy was able to initiate transcription in S. lividans and contains a promoter whose sequence is identical to the promoters of the S. limosus, S. venezuelae and S. griseus amy.
