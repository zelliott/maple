Using a partially purified HL-60 tyrosine protein kinase, we designed a new HPLC method for the measurement of tyrosylphosphorylation of angiotensin II. The present method uses reversed-phase chromatography and elution involving an acetonitrile gradient containing the counterion tetrabutylammonium phosphate. The peptide substrate, [gamma-32P]ATP, the cosubstrate, and 32P-labeled phosphorylated peptides were quantified online by measuring the Cerenkov effect. Injections, separation, and analysis were performed automatically. Furthermore, the method permits a direct visualization of peptide substrate phosphorylation and has a potentially universal application; i.e., it is usable with any kind of peptide in a given range of hydrophobicity. This assay was designed for specificity studies, which are of major importance at the molecular level, in order to understand active site topology and the biophysical requirements of tyrosine protein kinases. As examples, data on chromatography separations of angiotensin II analogs (five to ten amino acids in length) are presented, as well as for other peptide substrates such as RR-src, the pp60src autophosphorylation site-derived peptide, and minigastrin. We adapted our experimental conditions to accommodate crude extracts from HL-60 cells. Preliminary experiments clearly indicated that other biological sources can be used. Despite the existence of numerous methods published in the literature for the measurement of kinase activities, the method presented herein is the only one to the authors' knowledge that can be used in and has been assessed for specificity studies. Peptides do not require particular features such as charged residues (i.e., arginine) to be analyzed.
