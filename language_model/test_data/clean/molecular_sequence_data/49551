Mutations in GJB3, the gene encoding the gap junction protein Connexin 31 (CX31), have been pathogenically linked to erythrokeratodermia and non-syndromic autosomal dominant (DFNA2) or recessive hereditary hearing impairment (HHI). To determine the contribution of CX31 to sporadic deafness, we assessed 63 individuals with non-syndromic hearing impairment for CX31 mutations. Single coding exon of CX31 was amplified from genomic DNA and then sequenced. Single nucleotide sequence alteration was present in 15 out of 63 patients (24%), all of the positives being heterozygous for the four different single base pair changes that were detected: C94T, C201T, C357T and C798T. Of these, only C94T transition, identified in two patients, results in amino acid change, R32W, while the other three changes are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The R32W substitution in CX31 has been previously documented and is speculated to manifest variable penetrance, similar to the polymorphic allele encoding CX26M34T. Over one-third of all samples were also screened with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC). Seven out of 25 individuals screened were determined to be positive for CX31 sequence variation. Sequence analysis of the 25 individuals screened identified nucleotide alterations in all of the 7 'positives' and in none of the 16 'negatives' yielding a specificity and sensitivity of 100%. Thus, dHPLC represents a highly efficient CX31 screening technique. This study suggests that while sequence alterations are common, pathogenic mutations of CX31 are infrequent in sporadic non-syndromic hearing impairment.
