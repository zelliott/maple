The chicken skeletal alpha-actin gene promoter region (-202 to -12) provides myogenic transcriptional specificity. This promoter contains partial dyad symmetry about an axis at nucleotide -108 and in transfection experiments is capable of directing transcription in a bidirectional manner. At least three different transcription initiation start sites, oriented toward upstream sequences, were mapped 25 to 30 base pairs from TATA-like regions. The opposing transcriptional activity was potentiated upon the deletion of sequences proximal to the alpha-actin transcription start site. Thus, sequences which serve to position RNA polymerase for alpha-actin transcription may allow, in their absence, the selection of alternative and reverse-oriented start sites. Nuclear runoff transcription assays of embryonic muscle indicated that divergent transcription may occur in vivo but with rapid turnover of nuclear transcripts. Divergent transcriptional activity enabled us to define the 3' regulatory boundary of the skeletal alpha-actin promoter which retains a high level of myogenic transcriptional activity. The 3' regulatory border was detected when serial 3' deletions bisected the element (-91 CCAAA TATGG -82) which reduced transcriptional activity by 80%. Previously we showed that disruption of its upstream counterpart (-127 CCAAAGAAGG -136) resulted in about a 90% decrease in activity. These element pairs, which we describe as CCAAT box-associated repeats, are conserved in all sequenced vertebrate sarcomeric actin genes and may act in a cooperative manner to facilitate transcription in myogenic cells.
