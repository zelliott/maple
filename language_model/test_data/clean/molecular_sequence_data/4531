An abnormal isoform of the prion protein (PrP) appears to be the agent responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). The normal isoform of PrP is host-encoded and expressed in the central nervous system. The recent bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic in the UK and the incidence of prion-related diseases in other animals could indicate that ruminants are highly susceptible to infection via ingestion of prion-contaminated food. Sequence analysis of PrP gene open reading frames from red deer and camel was carried out to investigate sequence variability of these genes among ruminants.
