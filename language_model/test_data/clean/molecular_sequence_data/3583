Bacillus anthracis is currently under intense investigation due to its primary importance as a human pathogen. Particularly important is the development of novel anti-anthrax vaccines, devoid of the current side effects. A novel class of immunogenic bacterial proteins consists of dodecamers homologous to the DNA-binding protein of Escherichia coli (Dps). Two Dps homologous genes are present in the B. anthracis genome. The crystal structures of these two proteins (Dlp-1 and Dlp-2) have been determined and are presented here. They are sphere-like proteins with an internal cavity. We also show that they act as ferritins and are thus involved in iron uptake and regulation, a fundamental function during bacterial growth.
