The antibodies to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha(181-192) synthetic peptides were elicited in rabbits and mice using the peptides conjugated to protein carriers in different orientations, either through C-terminal Cys (S-conjugates), or through amino groups (N-conjugates). S-conjugated peptides were less potent in eliciting peptide-specific antibodies compared to N-conjugates and this type of conjugation resulted in antibodies to the coupling reagent. However, the epitopes present in either S- or N-conjugated peptides appeared to be similar, indicating that amino acid residues, which form the epitope, were located in the middle part of the peptide and did not include both N- and C-terminal residues. Peptide conjugation to a protein carrier did not play a role in stabilizing the peptide conformation, but was necessary to concentrate the peptide epitopes on the carrier surface enabling bivalent antibody binding.
