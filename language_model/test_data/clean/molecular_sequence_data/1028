Preparations of new low molecular weight protein inhibitors of serine proteinases have been obtained from buckwheat Fagopyrum esculentum seeds by chromatography of seed extracts on trypsin-Sepharose 4B, Mono-Q and Mono-S ion-exchangers. Their molecular masses, determined by mass spectrometry, were equal to 5203 (BWI-1c), 5347 (BWI-2c), 7760 (BWI-3c) and 6031 daltons (BWI-4c). All inhibitors possessed high pH-stability in the pH range 2-12 and thermostability. In addition to trypsin, BWI-3c and BWI-4c inhibitors inhibited chymotrypsin and subtilisin-like proteases. The inhibition constants (Ki) for trypsin, chymotrypsin and subtilisin by the studied inhibitors were determined. The N-terminal sequences of all inhibitors were established: BWI-1c (23 residues), BWI-2c (33 residues), BWI-3c (18 residues) and BWI-4c (20 residues). According to the physicochemical properties and N-terminal amino acid sequences, buckwheat seed protease inhibitors BWI-3c and BWI-4c are suggested to belong to the potato proteinase inhibitor I family.
