By means of a thin-layer chromatography immunostaining procedure involving a human monoclonal anti-Lc4Cer antibody, which was established by hybridizing murine myeloma cells and human lymphocytes from a cancer patient, Lc4Cer was proven to be a fetal antigen of human lung and to be a cancer-related antigen in small cell carcinomas of human lung, but not of other lung cancers, i.e., large cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, and squamous carcinomas. With the simultaneous detection of IV2Fuc alpha,II3NeuAc alpha-Gg4Cer with rabbit anti-IV2Fuc alpha,II3NeuAc alpha-Gg4Cer antiserum, the expression of Lc4Cer and IV2Fuc alpha,II3NeuAc alpha-Gg4Cer was found to be compensatory and, consequently, small cell lung carcinomas could be classified into Lc4Cer- and IV2Fuc alpha,II3NeuAc alpha-Gg4Cer-expressing types, L-SCLC and F-SCLC, respectively, which were detected in four and 27 of 31 patients' tissues and in one and three of four nude mouse-transplanted small cell lung carcinoma tissues, respectively. The compensatory expression of Lc4Cer and IV2Fuc alpha,II3NeuAc alpha-Gg4Cer in small cell carcinomas indicated that different metabolic pathways for glycosphingolipids were activated to give the distinct glycosphingolipid compositions in the two types of small cell lung carcinomas.
