Plant organs develop mostly post-embryonically from persistent or newly formed meristems. After cell division arrest, differentiation frequently involves endoreduplication and cell enlargement. Factors controlling transition from mitotic cycles to differentiation programmes have not been identified yet in plants. Here we describe ccs52, a plant homologue of APC activators involved in mitotic cyclin degradation. The ccs52 cDNA clones were isolated from Medicago sativa root nodules, which exhibit the highest degree of endopolyploidy in this plant. ccs52 represents a small multigenic family and appears to be conserved in plants. Overexpression of ccs52 in yeast triggered mitotic cyclin degradation, cell division arrest, endoreduplication and cell enlargement. In Medicago, enhanced expression of ccs52 was found in differentiating cells undergoing endoreduplication. In transgenic M.truncatula plants, overexpression of the ccs52 gene in the antisense orientation resulted in partial suppression of ccs52 expression and decreased the number of endocycles and the volume of the largest cells. Thus, the ccs52 product may switch proliferating cells to differentiation programmes which, in the case of endocycles, result in cell size increments.
