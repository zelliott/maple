We have engineered a self-processing RNA, derived from the hairpin ribozyme that runs through a cascade of cleavage and ligation reactions thereby changing its topology. The first two cleavage events leave the resulting RNA with a 5'-OH group and a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate. Thus, upon refolding, intramolecular ligation delivers a cyclic species. In addition, we demonstrate formation of concatemers resulting from multiple intermolecular ligations. Our results demonstrate the potential of RNA for self-supported topology changes and support the suggestion of 2',3'-cyclic phosphates being suitable activated building blocks for reversible phosphodiester bond formation in the RNA world.
