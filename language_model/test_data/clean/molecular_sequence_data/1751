Influenza C virus-like particles (VLPs) have been generated from cloned cDNAs. A cDNA of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene in antisense orientation was flanked by the 5' and 3' non-coding regions of RNA segment 5 of the influenza C virus. The cDNA cassette was inserted between an RNA polymerase I promoter and terminator of the Pol I vector. This plasmid DNA was transfected into 293T cells together with plasmids encoding virus proteins of C/Ann Arbor/1/50 or C/Yamagata/1/88. Transfer of the supernatants of the transfected 293T cells to HMV-II cells resulted in GFP expression in the HMV-II cells. The quantification of the GFP-positive HMV-II cells indicated the presence of approximately 10(6) VLPs (ml supernatant)(-1). Cords 50-300 microm in length were observed on transfected 293T cells, although the cords were not observed when the plasmid for M1 protein of C/Ann Arbor/1/50 was replaced with that of C/Taylor/1233/47. A series of transfection experiments with plasmids encoding M1 mutants of C/Ann Arbor/1/50 or C/Taylor/1233/47 showed that an amino acid at residue 24 of the M1 protein is responsible for cord formation. This finding provides direct evidence for a previous hypothesis that M1 protein is involved in the formation of cord-like structures protruding from the C/Yamagata/1/88-infected cells. Evidence was obtained by electron microscopy that transfected cells bearing cords produced filamentous VLPs, suggesting the potential role of the M1 protein in determining the filamentous/spherical morphology of influenza C virus.
