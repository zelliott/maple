Five novel ascosporogenous yeast strains (H382, H396, H409, H433(T) and H441) were found through a survey of vacuum-packed beef microbiota. Sequence analysis of ITS domain and LSU rRNA genes showed that the new strains represent a distinct lineage within the genus Kazachstania, closely related to Kazachstania lodderae (97.0 % identity) and Kazachstania ichnusensis (96.1 % identity). The main difference of strains H382, H396, H409, H433(T) and H441 to strains of known Kazachstania species is the maximum growth temperature, which is below 20 °C for the new strains, whereas related species grow at 25 °C. Furthermore, the strains differed from known Kazachstania species in assimilation and fermentation patterns of carbon sources. Based on these characteristics, the five strains are considered to represent a novel species of the genus Kazachstania for which the name Kazachstania psychrophila sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is H433(T) (DSM 26230(T)=CBS 12689(T)). The Mycobank number of the type strain is MB 803980.
