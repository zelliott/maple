The positive regulatory domain containing 1, encoded by the PRDM1 gene, is a transcriptional repressor considered as a master regulator that is required and sufficient for plasma cell differentiation. In the present study we have performed sequence analysis of the upstream region of the human PRDM1 gene to detect the minimal promoter region necessary for PRDM1 gene transcription. This region comprises the region upstream of the initiation site, as well as the first exon. Collectively, deletion and mutation analysis in conjunction with luciferase reporter assays, EMSA and supershift assays identified a phylogenetically conserved GC-box as an essential element for PRDM1 expression. This GC-box element matches to a binding site for multiple transcription factors such as SP1 and SP3 isoforms as well as early growth response 1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the in vivo binding capability of these factors to the human PRDM1 promoter. These studies together characterize for the first time the basal activity of the human PRDM1 promoter, through which several factors, including SP1, SP3 and early growth response 1, modulate its expression through a conserved GC-box.
