In this study a size selected genomic library from Quercus petraea was screened for (GA/CT)n-microsatellite sequences. The resulting loci were analysed by PCR for their usefulness as molecular markers in Q. petraea and Q. robur. 17 out of 52 tested primer pairs resulted in the amplification of a polymorphic single-locus pattern. The number of alleles found per locus varied from 6 to 16. Combining the genetic variation observed for the characterized loci provides a unique genotype for all the individuals tested. Using intraspecific controlled crosses of Q. robur trees Mendelian inheritance could be shown for five loci.
