A fragment (172 bp) of B. subtilis phage phi29 DNA, which does not contain a functional promoter for phage transcription, has been shown to direct transcription in the promoter-probe plasmid pPV33. The promoter candidate found in this fragment by the computer method of acceptability is compared with cryptic promoters selected by this computer method. It is characterized in vitro by electron microscopic visualization of RNA polymerase binding and 'run off' transcription, and in vivo by high resolution S1 mapping.
