Viral transcription complexes were isolated from SV40-infected cells and incubated in vitro in the presence of [alpha-32P]UTP to allow elongation of the promoter-proximal RNA up to the attenuation sites. The 94 nucleotide attenuated RNA (spanning nucleotides 243-336) was purified, digested with RNase T1 and fingerprinted. The labeled oligonucleotides were then isolated, digested with RNase T2 and their base composition was determined. Based on these analyses 10 consecutive oligonucleotides, spanning residues 259-336, were identified. As the in vivo synthesized oligonucleotides are unlabeled the junctions between labeled and unlabeled oligonucleotides define the in vivo pause sites of RNA polymerase molecules. The characterization of the 10 radioactive spots and their relative intensities allowed the localization of two in vivo pause sites: one at 13-16 nucleotides downstream from the major initiation site presumably at the initial opening of the DNA helix and the second at approximately 40 nucleotides downstream from the major initiation site, just past a GC-rich region of dyad symmetry. It is postulated that pausing of RNA polymerase molecules in the leader region is an essential process in the control of SV40 late transcription.
