Mutations in the recessive Drosophila tumor gene l(2)gl affect growth and structural properties of neural tissues and imaginal discs during larval development. We have analyzed the cellular localization of transcripts and a 130-kDa protein encoded by the l(2)gl gene, using in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence techniques. Transcripts of maternal origin are detected in freshly laid eggs and are homogeneously incorporated into blastoderm cells. The protein is found at low levels in all embryonic tissues after blastoderm formation. In later stages differential expression of the protein is observed, particularly in cells of the nervous system. The protein is located at the cell surface of dissociated embryonic cells. Anti-l(2)gl sera show cross-reaction to a mouse protein that is localized at cell-cell contact sites in tissue culture cells. Moreover, amino acid sequence homology to deduced amino acid sequences of members of the vertebrate cadherin cell-adhesion molecule family suggests that the l(2)gl gene product may have properties of a cell-adhesion molecule.
