The complete nucleotide sequence of a major component of aminopeptidase My purified from Mycoplasma salivarium was determined. The protein gene encoded a protein consisting of 520 amino acids with a molecular mass of 58079 Da. The protein contained two tryptophan residues, one of which was encoded by UGA. A computer-aided homology search suggested that aminopeptidase My had properties similar to those of leucine aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.1).
