We describe spectroscopic and biochemical studies of native and mutant Zn finger peptides from ZFY, a putative transcription factor encoded by the sex-determining region of the human Y chromosome. The parent peptide, based on ZFY domain 6, exhibits metal-dependent helix formation within a rigid tertiary framework. Nonaromatic substitutions of the consensus aromatic group (Tyr 10----Ser or Lys) are surprisingly compatible with native architecture but result in loss of stability to pH or guanidine denaturation. Remarkably, these perturbations are reverted by a second-site mutation in which an alternative aromatic residue is introduced (Ser 12----Phe). Design of the second-site revertant ("aromatic swap") is based on the ZFY two-finger repeat, a conserved symmetry among the ZFY-related zinc finger proteins, and is in accord with recent 2D NMR structures of Zn finger peptides. These experiments suggest general rules for metal-dependent folding of the Zn finger motif.
