To determine whether the estrogen receptor (ER) has a role in the modification of chromatin structure, we developed cell lines to model discrete stages in the estrogen response. Each cell line carries a population of stably expressed papillomavirus-based minichromosomes containing the 5' flanking region of the rat prolactin gene. We examined ER effects at the distal enhancer domain of the rat prolactin promoter, using DNaseI to probe for alterations of the nucleoprotein complex. Within 1 h after the start of estrogen treatment, modifications in the chromatin state of the distal enhancer region were detected in a pituitary-derived, permissive cell line (GH3G1J). In rat-1 fibroblast cell lines that maintain the same stably expressed papillomavirus-based minichromosomes in the absence of ER or pituitary-specific transcription factors (Rat-1.2A2; non-permissive), no estrogen-induced modifications in the chromatin state were detected at 1 or 24 h. In rat-1 fibroblast cell lines that also contained ectopically expressed, functional ER (Rat-1 + ER.8A1), no estrogen-induced modifications in the chromatin state were detected at 1 h, but a 24 h a specific modification in the local structure was induced. These data support a model in which the ER interacts with chromatin to modify local structure in such a way as to induce a permissive state for interactions of transcription factors necessary for hormone-induced activation of gene transcription.
