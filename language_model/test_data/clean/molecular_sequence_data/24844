The accurate detection of influenza by clinical symptoms is challenging since multiple pathogenic viruses and bacteria mimic similar symptoms in a patient. With new and more effective influenza therapeutics available, there is a growing need for highly accurate and rapid diagnosis of influenza, particularly when the window of opportunity for proper treatment is measured in hours. A parallel technology, which is also used in the treatment of influenza, was developed for the rapid diagnosis of influenza by exploiting the enzymatic activity of influenza neuraminidase. This technology, which is called Pathozyme, offers the high specificity inherent from the conservation of the neuraminidase active site. The ZstatFlu test uses a small molecule derivative of sialic acid chemically coupled to a reporter group together with simple point-of-care reagents for directly detecting influenza from a patient specimen with high specificity. A second-generation platform technology using this neuraminidase detection system coupled with a more sensitive chemiluminescent reporter has been developed and formatted for reading on high-speed instant film. This modification resulted in a platform technology many-fold more sensitive than the former while maintaining its inherent high specificity. Preliminary data from a prototype tested during the mild 2000-2001 influenza season demonstrated that an optimized chemiluminescent test system could approach the accuracy of 14 day viral culture in a convenient 10-20 min test. This platform technology is currently being explored for the rapid detection of other pathogenic organisms where sensitivity, specificity and speed are essential in a point-of-care setting.
