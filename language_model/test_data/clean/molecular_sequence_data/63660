Bacteriocin-producing strain Lactococcus lactis K-205 with antibacterial activity up to 2,700 IU/ml (calculated on nisine-producing activity) was isolated from Buryat beverage kurunga. Using genotypic analysis of oligonucleotide sequence of 16S rRNA gene, the strain was identified as L. lactis subsp. lactis. 16S rRNA gene nucleotide sequence of K-205 strain was deposed in GenBankdatabase under the number EF 114305. New K-205 strain as compared with museum nisine-producing strain L. lactis subsp. lactis had wider spectrum of bactericidal as well as fungicidal activity which is a rare characteristic for the natural isolates of this microorganism.
