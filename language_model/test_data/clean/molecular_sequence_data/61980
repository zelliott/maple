Two novel mRNA transcripts have been identified that result from species- and tissue-specific, alternative polyadenylation and splicing of the pre-mRNA encoding the apolipoprotein B (apoB) editing catalytic subunit 1 (APOBEC-1) complementation factor (ACF) family of related proteins. The alternatively processed mRNAs encode 43- and 45-kDa proteins that are components of the previously identified p44 cluster of apoB RNA binding, editosomal proteins. Recombinant ACF45 displaced ACF64 and ACF43 in mooring sequence RNA binding but did not demonstrate strong binding to APOBEC-1. In contrast, ACF43 bound strongly to APOBEC-1 but demonstrated weak binding to mooring sequence RNA. Consequently ACF45/43 complemented APOBEC-1 in apoB mRNA editing with less efficiency than full-length ACF64. These data, together with the finding that all ACF variants were co-expressed in rat liver nuclei (the site of apoB mRNA editing), suggested that ACF variants might compete with one another for APOBEC-1 and apoB mRNA binding and thereby contribute to the regulation of apoB mRNA editing. In support for this hypothesis, the ratio of nuclear ACF65/64 to ACF45/43 decreased when hepatic editing was inhibited by fasting and increased when editing was re-stimulated by refeeding. These findings suggested a new model for the regulation of apoB mRNA editing in which the catalytic potential of editosomes is modulated at the level of their assembly by alterations in the relative abundance of multiple related RNA-binding auxiliary proteins and the expression level of APOBEC-1.
