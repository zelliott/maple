Bartonella henselae is a recently recognized pathogenic bacterium associated with cat-scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis and bacillary peliosis. A recombinant clone expressing an immunoreactive antigen of B. henselae was isolated by screening a genomic DNA cosmid library by Western blotting with sera pooled from patients positive for B. henselae IgG antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA). The deduced amino acid sequence of the 43.7 kDa encoded protein was found to be 76.3 % identical to the dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase enzyme (SucB) of Brucella melitensis. SucB has been shown to be an immunogenic protein during infections by Brucella melitensis, Coxiella burnetii and Bartonella vinsonii. The agreement between reactivity with a recombinant SucB fusion protein on immunoblot analysis and the results obtained by IFA was 55 % for IFA-positive sera and 88 % for IFA-negative sera. Cross-reactivity was observed with sera from patients with antibodies against Brucella melitensis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Francisella tularensis, Coxiella burnetii and Rickettsia typhi.
