5-Lipoxygenase catalyzes the synthesis of leukotrienes from arachidonic acid. This enzyme can reside either in the cytoplasm or the nucleus; its subcellular distribution is influenced by extracellular factors, and its nuclear import correlates with changes in leukotriene synthetic capacity. To identify sequences responsible for the nuclear import of 5-lipoxygenase, we transfected NIH 3T3 cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages with expression vectors encoding various 5-lipoxygenase constructs fused to green fluorescent protein. Overexpression of wild type 5-lipoxygenase with or without fusion to green fluorescent protein resulted in a predominantly intranuclear pattern of fluorescence, similar to the distribution of native 5-lipoxygenase in primary alveolar macrophages. Within the 5-lipoxygenase protein is a sequence (Arg(638)-Lys(655)) that closely resembles a bipartite nuclear localization signal. Studies using deletion mutants indicated that this region was necessary for nuclear import of 5-lipoxygenase. Analysis of mutants containing specific amino acid substitutions within this sequence confirmed that it was this sequence that was necessary for nuclear import of 5-lipoxygenase and that a specific arginine residue was critical for this function. As nuclear import of 5-lipoxygenase may regulate leukotriene production, natural or induced mutations in this bipartite nuclear localization sequence may also be important in affecting leukotriene synthesis.
