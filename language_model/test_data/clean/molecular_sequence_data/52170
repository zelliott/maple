Expression of the lux operon from the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi is dependent on cell density and requires an unlinked regulatory gene, luxR, and other cofactors for autoregulation. Escherichia coli transformed with the lux operon emits very low levels of light, and this deficiency can be partially alleviated by coexpression of luxR in trans. The V. harveyi lux promoter was analyzed in vivo by primer extension mapping to examine the function of luxR. RNA isolated from E. coli transformed with the Vibrio harveyi lux operon was shown to have a start site at 123 bp upstream of the first ATG codon of luxC. This is in sharp contrast to the start site found for lux RNA isolated from V. harveyi, at 26 bp upstream of the luxC initiation codon. However, when E. coli was cotransformed with both the lux operon and luxR, the start site of the lux mRNA shifted from -123 to -26. Furthermore, expression of the luxR gene caused a 350-fold increase in lux mRNA levels. The results suggest that LuxR of V. harveyi is a transcriptional activator stimulating initiation at the -26 lux promoter.
