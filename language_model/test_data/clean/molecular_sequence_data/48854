Strain DCY 63(T), isolated from the rhizosphere of ginseng, was a Gram-reaction-negative, strictly aerobic, non-motile, catalase- and oxidase-positive rod. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain DCY 63(T) belonged to the genus Chryseobacterium and was closely related to Chryseobacterium indoltheticum LMG 4025(T) (98.1 %), Chryseobacterium ginsenosidimutans THG 15(T) (98.0 %) and Chryseobacterium scophthalmum LMG 13028(T) (97.1 %). The major polar lipids of strain DCY 63(T) were phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), four unidentified aminolipids and three unidentified polar lipids, and the major fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0, iso-C17 : 0 3-OH, summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω7c and/or C16 : 1ω6c) and summed feature 9 (iso-C17 : 1ω9c and/or C16 : 0 10-methyl). The predominant isoprenoid quinone of strain DCY 63(T) was MK-6 and the G+C content of the genomic DNA was 31.6 mol%. The DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain DCY 63(T) and C. indoltheticum LMG 4025(T), C. ginsenosidimutans THG 15(T) and C. scophthalmum LMG 13028(T) were less than 30 %. On the basis of these data, strain DCY 63(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Chryseobacterium, for which the name Chryseobacterium ginsengisoli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is DCY 63(T) (= KCTC 23760(T) = JCM 18019(T)). An emended description of Chryseobacterium gleum is also proposed.
