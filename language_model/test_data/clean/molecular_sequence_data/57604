A NAD-dependent, oxygen-labile alcohol dehydrogenase was purified from Desulfovibrio gigas. It was decameric, with subunits of M(r) 43,000. The best substrates were ethanol (Km, 0.15 mM) and 1-propanol (Km, 0.28 mM). N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis showed that the enzyme belongs to the same family of alcohol dehydrogenases as Zymomonas mobilis ADH2 and Bacillus methanolicus MDH.
