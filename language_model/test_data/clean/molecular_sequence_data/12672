Encoded combinatorial chemical synthesis on solid phase is a new paradigm in organic chemistry that provides chemists with powers similar to those enjoyed by molecular biologists. Encoded chemical libraries will have a profound impact on all endeavors that seek to identify molecules with optimized properties and to understand the factors governing molecular interactions. In particular, the discovery and optimization of new therapeutic and diagnostic drug molecules, traditionally a slow manual process, will be greatly accelerated by this technology.
