Thyroid-hormone and retinoic-acid receptors exert their regulatory functions by acting as both activators and repressors of gene expression. A nuclear receptor co-repressor (N-CoR) of relative molecular mass 270K has been identified which mediates ligand-independent inhibition of gene transcription by these receptors, suggesting that the molecular mechanisms of repression by thyroid-hormone and retinoic-acid receptors are analogous to the co-repressor-dependent transcriptional inhibitory mechanisms of yeast and Drosophila.
