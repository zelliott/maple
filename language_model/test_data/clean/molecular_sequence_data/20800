Rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) is a structurally complex cell wall pectic polysaccharide. Despite its complexity, both the structure of RG-II and its ability to dimerise via a borate diester are conserved in vascular plants suggesting that RG-II has a fundamental role in primary cell wall organisation and function. The selection and analysis of new mutants affected in RG-II formation represents a promising strategy to unravel these functions and to identify genes encoding enzymes involved in RG-II biosynthesis. In this paper, a novel fingerprinting strategy is described for the screening of RG-II mutants based on the mild acid hydrolysis of RG-II coupled to the analysis of the resulting fragments by mass spectrometry. This methodology was developed using RG-II fractions isolated from citrus pectins and then validated for RG-II isolated from the Arabidopsis mur1 mutant and irx10 irx10-like double mutant.
