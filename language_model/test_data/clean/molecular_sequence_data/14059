Analyzing more than 100 independent rice cybrids, we found evidence for inter-molecular recombination between parental mitochondrial genomes occurring at high frequency soon after protoplast fusion. The structure of the region around the atp6 gene showed extensive polymorphism among Indica (MTC-5A), Japonica (Nipponbare), and wild abortive (IR58024A) mitochondrial genomes. Recombination between the mitochondrial genomes of IR58024A and MTC-5A around the atp6 gene was detected by Southern-blot analysis of cybrid plants. Such recombinant mitochondrial molecules were also cloned from IR58024A/Nipponbare cybrid callus. PCR analysis around the atp6 gene demonstrated that inter-parental recombination occurs in practically all cybrid calli within 2 weeks after protoplast fusion. At this point, parental and recombinant mitochondrial genomes co-existed within the callus. Over the course of further cultivation, however, mitochondrial genome diversity decreased as parental and/or recombinant genomes segregated out.
