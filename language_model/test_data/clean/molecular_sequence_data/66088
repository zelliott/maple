Cadmium-resistant bacteria were isolated from the farmland soil in Zhangshi Irrigation Area in Shenyang of Northeast China, an area has been polluted by heavy metals, especially cadmium, for more than 40 years. The cadA gene was detected in 4 Bacillus strains and for the first time in one Flavobacterium strain. The high sequence identity (93%-99%) of cadA gene, shared indels in different bacterial species and genera, and the phylogenetic incongruence between 16S rDNA gene tree and cadA gene tree suggested that lateral gene transfer (LGT) occurred among Bacillus and Flavobacterium spp. The LGT of cadA gene might play a vital role in promoting the spread of cadmium-resistant phenotypes throughout soil microbial communities.
