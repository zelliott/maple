Spartina mottle virus (SpMV) was first reported 1980 and classified by physical and biological properties as a tentative member of the genus Rymovirus in the Potyviridae. This genus was recently separated into two genera: Rymovirus and Tritimovirus. Now the sequence of the 3'-terminal part of the genome of SpMV was determined. Additionally a virus isolate originating from Cynodon dactylon in Italy was cloned and sequenced. This Assisi-isolate shared 87.5% amino acid sequence identity with SpMV. The high degree of identity and their close serological relationship indicate that SpMV and Assisi-isolate have to be regarded as different strains of one virus. The Assisi-isolate should be designated as SpMV-AV. Comparing the C-terminal part of the ORF of several Potyviridae the sequences of SpMV strains were more similar to those of the genera Rymovirus and Potyvirus than to the genera Tritimovirus, Macluravirus, Bymovirus and Ipomovirus. The comparisons revealed identities of less than 32% for the CP and 37% for the 3'-NIb/CP region, indicating that SpMV can not be classified to any of the established genera. The results of serological tests support a separate position of SpMV in the Potyviridae. We propose to introduce the name Sparmovirus for the new genus.
