Parthenogenesis in the mouse is embryonic lethal partly because of imprinted genes that are expressed only from the paternal genome. In a systematic screen using subtraction hybridization between cDNAs from normal and parthenogenetic embryos, we initially identified two apparently novel imprinted genes, Peg1 and Peg3. Peg1 (paternally expressed gene 1) or Mest, the first imprinted gene found on the mouse chromosome 6, may contribute to the lethality of parthenogenones and of embryos with a maternal duplication for the proximal chromosome 6. Peg1/Mest is widely expressed in mesodermal tissues and belongs to the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family. A similar approach with androgenones can be used to identify imprinted genes that are expressed from the maternal genome only.
