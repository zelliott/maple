We have isolated a genomic clone of a putative xylanase gene (xyn1) from Humicola grisea by using the DNA fragment encoding a cellulose-binding domain of H. grisea cellobiohydrolase 1 as a probe. The translation product of the xyn1 gene predicts a xylanase of 429 amino acids in length, with a cellulose-binding domain in the C-terminus.
