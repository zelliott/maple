A UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferase (GalNAc-transferase) from human placenta was purified to apparent homogeneity using a synthetic acceptor peptide as affinity ligand. The purified GalNAc-transferase migrated as a single band with an approximate molecular weight of 52,000 by reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Based on a partial amino acid sequence, the cDNA encoding the transferase was cloned and sequenced from a cDNA library of a human cancer cell line. The cDNA sequence has a 571-amino acid coding region indicating a protein of 64.7 kDa with a type II domain structure. The deduced protein sequence showed significant similarity to a recently cloned bovine polypeptide GalNAc-transferase (Homa, F.L., Hollanders, T., Lehman, D.J., Thomsen, D.R., and Elhammer, A.P. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 12609-12616). A polymerase chain reaction construct was expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus vector. Northern analysis of eight human tissues differed clearly from that of the bovine GalNAc-transferase. Polymerase chain reaction cloning and sequencing of the human version of the bovine transferase are presented, and 98% similarity at the amino acid level was found. The data suggest that the purified human GalNAc-transferase is a novel member of a family of polypeptide GalNAc-transferases, and a nomenclature GalNAc-T1 and GalNAc-T2 is introduced to distinguish the members.
