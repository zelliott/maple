Pyogenic granulomas (lobular capillary hemangiomas) and condyloma acuminata share similar locations and risk factors. Human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11 are commonly associated with condyloma acuminata, but their association with pyogenic granulomas has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to determine whether pyogenic granulomas contain evidence of infection with condyloma-producing HPVs.

Polymerase chain reaction assays for the E6 and E7 gene sequences of HPV types 6 and 11 and another assay for the E7 region of HPV types 16, 31, 33, 35, 42, and 58 were used to evaluate deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extracted from archival pyogenic granuloma biopsies taken from cutaneous and oral epithelium.

Neither cutaneous nor oral pyogenic granulomas contain amplifiable E6 or E7 sequences from any of these viruses.

Pyogenic granulomas are not caused by HPV 6, 11, 16, 31, 33, 35, 42, or 58. This study does not exclude the possibility that other viruses may be responsible for these tumors.
