Villin headpiece (HP67) is a small, autonomously-folding domain that has become a model system for understanding the fundamental tenets governing protein folding. In this communication, we explore the role that Leu61 plays in the structure and stability of the construct. Deletion of Leu61 results in a completely unfolded protein that cannot be expressed in Escherichia coli. Omission of only the aliphatic leucine side chain (HP67 L61G) perturbed neither the backbone conformation nor the orientation of local hydrophobic side chains. As a result, a large, solvent-exposed hydrophobic pocket, a negative replica of the leucine side-chain, was created on the surface. The loss of the hydrophobic interface between leucine 61 and the hydrophobic pocket destabilized the construct by ~3.3 kcal/mol. Insertion of a single glycine residue immediately before Leu61 (HP67 L61[GL]) was also highly destabilizing and had the effect of altering the backbone conformation (α-helix to π-helix) in order to precisely preserve the wild-type position and conformation of all hydrophobic residues, including Leu61. In addition to demonstrating that the hydrophobic side-chain of Leu61 is critically important for the stability of villin headpiece, our results are consistent with the notion that the precise interactions present within the hydrophobic core, rather than the hydrogen bonds that define the secondary structure, specify a protein's fold.
