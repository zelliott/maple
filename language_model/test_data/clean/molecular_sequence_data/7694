This chapter summarises modern microchemical approaches to the purification, identification and primary structure analysis of peptides and proteins. Discussion of high-sensitivity purification methods is restricted to two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and microbore/capillary column reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Associated techniques are discussed, particularly with respect to analysis of the products with current automated amino acid sequencers and mass spectrometers.
