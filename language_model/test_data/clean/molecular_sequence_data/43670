Small proteinaceous infectious particles called prions cause certain neurodegenerative diseases in human and animals. Limited proteolysis of infectious scrapie prions PrP(Sc) yields an N-truncated polypeptide termed PrP 27-30, which encompasses residues 90 to 231 of PrP(Sc) and which assembles into 100 to 200 A wide amyloid rods. It has been hypothesized that the infectious prion is converted from its non-infectious cellular form (PrP(C)) by means of an alpha-helical to beta-sheet conformational change. Secondary structure analysis, computer modeling, and structural biophysics methods support this hypothesis. Residues 90 to 145 of PrP, which contain two putative alpha-helical domains H1 and H2, may be of particular relevance to the disease pathogenesis, as C-terminal truncation at residue 145 was found in a patient with an inherited prion disease. Moreover, our recent X-ray diffraction analysis suggests that the peptide consisting of these residues (designated SHa 90-145) closely models the amyloidogenic beta-sheet core of PrP. In the current study, we have analyzed in detail the X-ray diffraction patterns of SHa 90-145. Two samples were examined: one that was dehydrated under ambient conditions whilst in an external magnetic field (to induce fibril orientation), and another that was sealed after partial drying. The dried, magnetically oriented sample showed a cross-beta diffraction pattern in which the fiber axis (rotation axis) was parallel to the H-bonding direction of the beta-sheets. The major wide-angle peaks indicate the presence of approximately 40 A wide beta-crystallites, which constitute the protofilament. Each crystallite is composed of several orthogonal unit cells, normal to the fiber (a-axis) direction, having lattice constants a = 9.69 A, b = 6.54 A, and c = 18.06 A. Electron density maps were calculated by iterative Fourier synthesis using beta-silk as an initial phase model. The distribution of density indicated that there were two types of beta-sheet, suggesting that larger and smaller side-chains localized to different sheets. This would arise from folding of the polypeptide in which there are turns in the middle of both the H1 and H2 domains. A monoclinic macrolattice, with a = 9.61 A, b = c = 52.99 A and alpha = 114.6 degrees, was found to index all the reflections, including those in the low-angle region. This suggests that the beta-crystallites are nearly hexagonally packed. To account for the approximately 100 A wide fibers visualized by negative staining in the electron microscope, the beta-crystallites would be arranged in 4-mers. The partially dried sample showed a sharp 4.7 A reflection (from H-bonding) and five broad peaks superimposed on monotonically decreasing diffuse scattering. This solution-like scattering was modeled by an anisometric rectangle with a thickness comparable to a singe beta-chain. The structure, which occurred during dehydration, could be a transient in the alpha-helical to beta-sheet conversion, suggesting that formation of hydrogen bonding precedes the inter-sheet interaction and assembly into the amyloid of scrapie prion.
