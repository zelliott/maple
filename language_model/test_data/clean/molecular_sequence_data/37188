Dobrava virus (DOBV) occurs in two different rodent species, Apodemus flavicollis (DOBV-Af) and A. agrarius (DOBV-Aa). We sequenced the S and M genomic segments from sympatric DOBV-Af and DOBV-Aa strains which fell into two distinct genetic lineages. Molecular phylogenetic analyses gave evidence for genetic reassortment between S and M segments of DOBV-Af and DOBV-Aa and indicated homologous recombination events in DOBV evolution. DOBV-Af and DOBV-Aa are distinct but also subject to genetic exchanges that affect their evolutionary trajectories.
