We have isolated mutants responsible for a super-secretion phenotype in Kluyveromyces lactis using the gene coding for a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase as a marker for secretion. These mutations defined two groups, dominant and recessive. The recessive mutant strain, which secreted the heterologous protein in five-fold excess compared to the wild-type strain, was used for the cloning of genes, restraining the super-secreting phenotype. In screening for genes affecting super-secreting phenotype, we found that multiple copies of 10 different independently isolated DNA sequences suppressed the super-secreting phenotype. The first among the genes characterized, named KlSEL1 ('secretion lowering') showed homology to Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORF YML013w. The KlSEL1 gene is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 620 amino acid residues containing a putative transmembrane domain and UBX domain, characteristic for the ubiquitin-regulatory proteins. We demonstrated that the disruption of the SEL1 orthologues in K. lactis and S. cerevisiae conferred the super-secreting phenotype. SEL1 isolated from S. cerevisiae suppressed the super-secretion phenotype in K. lactis klsel1 strain, likewise homologous KlSEL1. No other phenotypic features for strains lacking the SEL1 gene were noticed except for the S. cerevisiae mutant growth being notably slower than in a wt strain. No growth changes were observed in the K. lactis klsel1 mutant. The set of genes (suppressors of over-secreting phenotype) could be attractive for further analysis of gene functions, super-secreting mechanisms and construction of new strains. This collection could be useful for the expedient construction of reduced yeast genomes, optimized for heterologous protein secretion.
