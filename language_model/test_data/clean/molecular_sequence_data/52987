The peripheral expression of trkA encoding for NGF receptor was investigated by RNase protection assay. A thymus-specific protected fragment was identified. Using 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends, three different trkA fragments were characterized. The longer fragment corresponded to the classical trkA L3 transcripts while the two shorter fragments lacked sequences encoding for leucine-rich motifs of the extracellular domain of TrkA, similarly to the trkB L1 and L0 variants. RT-PCR analysis of adult rat tissues showed the expression of trkA L1 transcripts in the thymus, testis, lung and kidney but not in the central nervous system. Their combined expression with trkA L3 transcripts suggests that specific peripheral TrkA oligomers may modulate NGF binding and function in non-neuronal cells.
