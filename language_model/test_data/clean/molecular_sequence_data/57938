The interaction of low mobility group proteins (LMG), isolated from chromatin of pancreatic carcinoma cells (CAPAN-2), with fragments of 5'-flanking region of the antigen 17-1A gene was studied by gel retardation assay. The LMG proteins, which formed complexes with DNA were extracted from the gels and identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. The proteins of Mw about 100, 60, 55 and 48 kDa, which formed specific complexes with fragments of 5'-flanking region of the antigen 17-1A gene, were identified.
