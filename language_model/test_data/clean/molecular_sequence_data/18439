The potential of plasma-desorption mass spectrometry (PDMS) in peptide sequencing is investigated. This paper shows that PDMS spectra recorded for longer times and using larger amounts of peptide than used for obtaining molecular weight information, provides sequence information on peptides of up to 4.5 kDa molecular weight. This approach strongly enhances the utility of PDMS for validation of the sequence of recombinant peptides.
