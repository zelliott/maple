Biomphalaria glabrataembryonic (Bge) cells have been shown to provide favourable environmental conditions for the development of Schistosoma mansoni sporocysts. We investigated the effect of Bge excretory-secretory products on metabolic activity and gene transcription in S. mansoni mother sporocysts. Using the differential-display technique, we identified several sporocyst transcripts regulated by exposure to Bge soluble components. Research in databases indicated that six of the eight differential products analysed were homologous to sequences already present in databases. Two transcripts appeared of interest for schistosome development since they could be associated with cell division and protein synthesis in developing sporocysts. Their up-regulation following contact with cell products was confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The first fragment coded for a part of the chaperonin containing T-complex protein gamma subunit-like protein of S. mansoni (SmTCP 1-C). The second one represented a new S. mansoni expressed sequence tag encoding a protein homologous to various glutaminyl-tRNA synthetases (GlnRS). The full-length sequence of SmGlnRS was cloned from adult schistosomes and its primary sequence was compared to other GlnRS. The overexpression of SmTCP-1 and SmGlnRS could be correlated with the metabolic changes observed in Bge-exposed sporocysts.
