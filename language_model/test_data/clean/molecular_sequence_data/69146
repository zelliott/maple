Glucokinase has a central role in glucose metabolism in pancreatic beta cells and hepatocytes and is an important candidate gene for Type 2 diabetes. Mutations of the glucokinase gene have been reported in Caucasian pedigrees with maturity-onset diabetes of the young and late-onset Type 2 diabetes. In population studies of American Blacks and Mauritian Creoles an association between alleles of a glucokinase polymorphism and Type 2 diabetes has been described. Two microsatellite polymorphisms (GCK 1 and GCK 2) flanking the glucokinase gene were investigated in Caucasian subjects. There was no significant linkage disequilibrium between the alleles of the two polymorphisms. The overall allelic frequencies for GCK 1 and the combined haplotyes did not significantly differ between 95 Type 2 diabetic and 76 normoglycaemic subjects. In an expanded cohort of 151 diabetic subjects the allelic frequencies at GCK 2 were also similar to controls. These results suggest that a single mutation of the glucokinase gene is not a common cause of Type 2 diabetes in English Caucasians.
