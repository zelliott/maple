The metalloprotease disintegrin cysteine-rich (MDC) proteins are a recently identified family of transmembrane proteins that function in proteolytic processing of cell surface molecules and in cell adhesion. Since lymphocytes must interact with a constantly changing environment, we hypothesized that lymphocytes would express unique MDC proteins. To identify MDC proteins expressed in human lymph node, a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy combined with degenerate oligonucleotide primers was employed. We report here the identification of MDC-L (ADAM 23), a novel member of the MDC protein family. The results obtained from cDNA cloning and Northern blot analysis of mRNA isolated from various lymphoid tissues indicate that a 2.8-kilobase mRNA encoding a transmembrane form, MDC-Lm, and a 2.2-kilobase mRNA encoding a secreted form, MDC-Ls, are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. MDC-L mRNA was shown to be predominantly expressed in secondary lymphoid tissues, such as lymph node, spleen, small intestine, stomach, colon, appendix, and trachea. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining with an anti-MDC-L antibody demonstrated that cells with typical lymphocyte morphology are responsible for expression of the MDC-L antigen in these lymphoid tissues. MDC-Lm was found to be expressed on the surface of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and transformed B- and T-lymphocyte cell lines as an 87-kDa protein. Thus, we have identified a novel lymphocyte-expressed MDC protein family member.
