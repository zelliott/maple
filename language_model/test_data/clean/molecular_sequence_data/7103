The 16S ribosomal RNA gene from the beer-spoilage organism, Megasphaera cerevisiae was polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified and sequenced. Analysis confirmed the phylogenetic position of M. cerevisiae as a sister taxon of Megasphaera elsdenii, within the obligately anaerobic, Gram-negative cocci. The sequence obtained should facilitate the development of DNA probes for early detection of this spoilage organism.
