Meiosis-specific pre-mRNA splicing in budding yeast embraces multiple pre-mRNA targets grouped into regulons defined by their genetic requirements for vegetatively optional splicing factors (e.g., splicing enhancer Mer1 and the U1 snRNP subunit Nam8) or snRNA modifications (trimethylguanosine caps). Here, we genetically demarcate a complete meiotic splicing regulon by the criterion of cDNA bypass of the requirement for the governing splicing regulators to execute sporulation. We thereby show that the Mer1 and Nam8 regulons embrace four essential pre-mRNAs: MER2, MER3, SPO22, and AMA1. Whereas Nam8 also regulates PCH2 splicing, PCH2 cDNA is not needed for sporulation by nam8Î” diploids. Our results show that there are no essential intron-containing RNAs missing from the known roster of Mer1 and Nam8 targets. Nam8 is composed of three RRM domains, flanked by N-terminal leader and C-terminal tail segments. We find that the RRM2 and RRM3 domains, and their putative RNA-binding sites, are essential for yeast sporulation, whereas the leader, tail, and RRM1 modules are not.
