Caldesmon is a smooth muscle and nonmuscle regulatory protein that interacts with actin, myosin, tropomyosin, and calmodulin. Two overlapping clones, isolated from a chicken oviduct cDNA plasmid library and a chicken gizzard cDNA lambda NM1149 library, were used to generate a 4108-base pair sequence coding for one caldesmon. Expression of the coding sequence confirms this is one of the large smooth muscle caldesmons. The deduced protein molecular weight is 86.974, significantly less than the molecular weights estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The protein has a high content of Gly, Lys, Arg, and Ala; there are two cysteine residues, one at either end of the molecule. Comparison with the Protein Identification Resource database demonstrates a similarity with a tropomyosin binding domain of troponin T, but none with any calmodulin or actin binding proteins. The center of the protein has an 8-fold repeat of a 13 amino acid sequence whose general motif is -Glu3-(Lys/Arg)2-Ala2-Glu2-(Lys/Arg)1-X-(Lys/Arg)1-Ala1-, where X is Glu, Gln, or Ala. Comparison with peptide sequences from a chymotryptic fragment that binds actin and calmodulin places this domain on the C terminus of caldesmon adjacent to the troponin T similarity. A tentative map of the major binding domains is proposed on the basis of available data.
