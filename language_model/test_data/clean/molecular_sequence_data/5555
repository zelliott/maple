A dcm-1 mutant, obtained by transposon mutagenesis of Myxococcus xanthus, could aggregate and form mounds but was unable to sporulate under nutrient starvation. A sequence analysis of the site of insertion of the transposon showed that the insertion lies within the 3' end of a 1,572-bp open reading frame (ORF) designated the M. xanthus pccB ORF. The wild-type form of the M. xanthus pccB gene, obtained from a lambdaEMBL library of M. xanthus, shows extensive similarity to a beta subunit of propionyl coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase, an alpha subunit of methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase, and a 12S subunit of transcarboxylase. In enzyme assays, extracts of the dcm-1 mutant were deficient in propionyl-CoA carboxylase activity. This enzyme catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of propionyl-CoA to yield methylmalonyl-CoA. The methylmalonyl-CoA rescued the dcm-1 mutant fruiting body and spore development. During development, the dcm-1 mutant cells also had reduced levels of long-chain fatty acids (C16 to C18) compared to wild-type cells.
