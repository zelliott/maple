Dominant expression of T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha or beta chain variable region (V alpha or V beta) gene families has been observed in the T-cell response to some conventional peptide antigens. Current models for the interaction of TCR V region elements with different determinants of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide complex, the normal TCR ligand, suggest that the TCR V-J junctional region (CDR3, where J is joining) is the primary contact with a peptide epitope and that other TCR V region segments may interact directly with neighboring MHC determinants. This suggests that V alpha or V beta dominance in a specific response can be MHC-selected. In this case, if related peptides bind to an MHC molecule in a similar orientation, they could select for identical V alpha or V beta dominance even if they are noncrossreactive at the level of T-cell activation. We have screened for this possibility by introducing minimal conservative substitutions in a synthetic peptide, YYEELLKYYEELLK, that is presented to T cells in association with an uncommon A beta E alpha d mixed Ia isotype. We report here that the peptide variant FFEELLKFFEELLK is noncrossreactive with YYEELLKYYEELLK but appears to preserve the same MHC binding motif since T-cell responses are restricted to the same mixed A beta E alpha isotype. Although the two peptides are noncrossreactive in either direction, the same members of the V alpha 4 gene family are dominantly expressed in T cells specific for either peptide. We conclude that the similar topography of the two MHC-peptide complexes gives functional significance to a unique A beta E alpha determinant that selects for V alpha 4 dominance.
