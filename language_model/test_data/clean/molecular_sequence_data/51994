In the present study the human cytokeratin 13 gene (KRT13), encoding a polypeptide characteristic of internal stratified epithelia, has been mapped with the help of the polymerase chain reaction and somatic cell hybrids to chromosome 17. In situ hybridization of a KRT13 cDNA probe to metaphase chromosomes allowed the assignment of the KRT13 gene within the q12-q21.2 region of chromosome 17.
