Ag-mediated changes in B lymphocyte migration are important for normal immune function, yet the mechanisms by which these changes occur are poorly defined. Because chemokines direct many lymphocyte movements, molecules that regulate signaling by G protein-coupled chemokine receptors are likely to participate in Ag receptor-induced changes in cell migration. In this study, we have investigated the expression pattern and activity in murine B cells of members of the regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) family of molecules. We present the sequence of mouse RGS1 and describe a novel short isoform of RGS3 that we term RGS3s. Following in vivo activation by Ag, B cells rapidly up-regulate expression of RGS1 and RGS2 while simultaneously decreasing expression of RGS3 and RGS14. Anergic hen egg lysozyme autoantigen-binding B cells are also shown to have slightly elevated RGS1 and RGS2 expression. CD40 signaling, by contrast, fails to cause rapid up-regulation of RGS1 or RGS2. Using a transient transfection approach in a mature B cell line, 2PK3, we demonstrate that RGS1 and RGS3s are effective inhibitors of chemotaxis toward the lymphoid tissue chemokines stromal cell-derived factor-1, B lymphocyte chemoattractant, and EBV-induced molecule 1 ligand chemokine, whereas RGS2 has a minimal effect on migration to these chemokines. Together these findings support the conclusion that Ag-mediated changes in RGS molecule expression are part of the mechanism by which Ag receptor signaling regulates B cell migration within lymphoid tissues. The findings also suggest important roles for additional G protein-mediated events in B cell activation and tolerance.
