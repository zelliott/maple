The Sry (sex determining region, Y chromosome) open reading frame from mice representing four species of the genus Mus was sequenced in an effort to understand the conditional dysfunction of some M. domesticus Sry alleles when present on the C57BL/6J inbred strain genetic background and to delimit the functionally important protein regions. Twenty-two Sry alleles were sequenced, most from wild-derived Y chromosomes, including 11 M. domesticus alleles, seven M. musculus alleles and two alleles each from the related species M. spicilegus and M. spretus. We found that the HMG domain (high mobility group DNA binding domain) and the unique regions are well conserved, while the glutamine repeat cluster (GRC) region is quite variable. No correlation was found between the predicted protein isoforms and the ability of a Sry allele to allow differentiation of ovarian tissue when on the C57BL/6J genetic background, strongly suggesting that the cause of this sex reversal is not the Sry protein itself, but rather the regulation of SRY expression. Furthermore, our interspecies sequence analysis provides compelling evidence that the M. musculus and M. domesticus SRY functional domain is contained in the first 143 amino acids, which includes the HMG domain and adjacent unique region (UR-2).
