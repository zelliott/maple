The St genome, which is present in nearly half of all Triticeae species, originates from the genus Pseudoroegneria. However, very little is known about the high molecular weight (HMW) subunits of glutenin which are encoded by the St genome. In this paper, we report the isolation from Pd. libanotica of four sequences encoding HMW subunits of glutenin. The four genes were all small compared to standard glutenin genes. All four sequences resemble y-type glutenins rather than x-types. However, their N-terminal domains contain a glutamine residue which is present in all x-type, but very few y-type subunits, and their central repetitive domains included some irregular motifs. The indication is therefore that the Glu-1St genes evolved earlier than other modern day homoeologues, so that they represent an intermediate state in the divergence between x- and y-type subunits. No x-type Glu-1St subunit genes were identified.
