The major soluble protein of bovine cornea (BCP 54: bovine corneal protein 54 kDa) was isolated successively by gel filtration, anion-exchange chromatography and chromatofocusing. The amino acid sequence of a fragment of the purified BCP 54 obtained by lysyl-endopeptidase digestion showed marked homology with tumor-associated and 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin-inducible aldehyde dehydrogenase (AIDH). From the high similarity of BCP 54 with tumor-associated AIDH in structural form, it is suggested that BCP 54 has AIDH activity. We confirmed a high AIDH activity of BCP 54 by immunoprecipitation using a mouse anti-BCP 54 monoclonal antibody followed by a spectrophotometric assay for AIDH activity. Next we demonstrated the unique properties of the purified BCP 54 as AIDH. The major isoelectric point is 6.41. BCP 54 preferentially oxidizes aromatic aldehyde such as benzaldehyde with NAD as coenzyme, but cannot oxidize phenylacetaldehyde. After heat treatment the AIDH activity is more stable with propionaldehyde-NAD than with benzaldehyde-NADP. With propionaldehyde-NAD the pH profile shows a broad plateau from pH 6-9 followed by a sharp rise up to pH 10. In contrast, with benzaldehyde-NADP there is a sharp optimum at pH 9.0. The activity with only benzaldehyde-NADP is inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, but is not affected by disulfiram and diethylstilbestrol. So we suggested that BCP 54 is an AIDH with kinetic properties different from the rat tumor-associated AIDH.
