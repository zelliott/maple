Hemophiliacs have been found to be at high risk of hepatitis. Hemophiliacs in Japan receive imported clotting factors as well as domestic ones. Recently we found that hepatitis C virus (HCV) could be classified into at least two types, HCV-US and HCV-J, depending on the nucleotide sequence. We analyzed the nucleotide sequences of virus RNAs from the plasma of patients with hemophilia A or B and found HCV-US in 3 of 4 Japanese hemophiliacs examined.
