Serotonin type 3 receptors (5-HT(3)R) are members of the ligand gated ion channel receptor family. In this study, the interactions of the agonists serotonin (5-HT) and m-chlorophenylbiguanidine (mCPBG) at the binding site of the 5-HT(3A)R were investigated at an atomic level. Site-directed mutagenesis studies in Loop B and E along with our earlier published results from mutations within Loops A, C, and D provide comprehensive data on the interaction of 5-HT and mCPBG with 5-HT(3A)Rs. Using this data we have constructed a refined homology model of the 5-HT(3A)R that considers all of the available experimental data. 5-HT and mCPBG were docked into the newly constructed homology model and the amino acid residues critical in binding of these agonists were compared and analyzed. Our docking results reveal many similar binding interactions for 5-HT and mCPBG. Namely, residues THR181, TRP183, PHE226, ILE228, TYR234 and GLU129 were all found to play key roles in binding of both 5-HT and mCPBG. However, the results also revealed two important differences that exist between the interactions of the two agonists. In our model, a hydrogen bond is formed between the indole hydrogen of 5-HT and the residue TYR153. This interaction is not present in the case of mCPBG. Conversely, a hydrogen bond exists between SER182 and a protonated nitrogen of mCPBG, which does not exist in 5-HT. Our modeling results were found to be in accordance with experimental data.
