C-type lectins may function as pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) and play important roles in immune responses. In this work, a cDNA for a new C-type lectin, FcLec3, was obtained from Chinese white shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis using expressed sequence tag analysis and rapid amplification of the cDNA ends. FcLec3 contains an N-terminal signal peptide and a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). RT-PCR analysis showed that FcLec3 was mainly expressed in hepatopancreas and that the expression of FcLec3 was obviously up-regulated by Vibrio anguillarum or white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) challenge. Recombinant FcLec3 could agglutinate Gram-negative and -positive bacteria with the presence of calcium. A following agglutination inhibitory test indicated that FcLec3 could recognize muramic acid and peptidoglycan. Besides, pull-down assay showed that the recombinant protein could interact with VP28, one major envelope protein of WSSV. These results suggested that FcLec3 might function in the recognition of bacterial and viral pathogens in shrimp.
