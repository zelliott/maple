In the present study, we used a proteomic approach to identify surface-associated proteins from the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum 299v. Proteins were extracted from the cell surface using a mild wash in phosphate buffer and analysed by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel bands were excised and in-gel digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were analysed by capillary-LC-ESI-MS/MS. The peptide sequences were used for a database search and allowed identification of a total of 29 proteins, many of which could potentially be involved in the action of probiotics in the gastrointestinal tract. The results provide the basis for future studies on the molecular mechanisms of probiotics.
