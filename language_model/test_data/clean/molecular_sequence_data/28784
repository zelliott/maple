In sequencing the beta3 chain of laminin 5 mRNA from LNCaP cells, we observed three different human cDNA clones (XM_001716, NM_000228 and L25541) in the GenBank that identified different sequences in the untranslated regions (UTR). XM_001716 and NM_000228 are almost identical cDNA clones with approximately 99% homology. However, they are quite different from L25541 in both the 5' UTR and the 3' UTR. Development of a PCR assay to specifically detect two of these different forms of the message led to the observation that they were differentially expressed in various cell lines. The message designated B3A (NM_000228, and XM_001716) was absent in LNCaP and MCF7 and greatly reduced in PC3-N, but was present in eight other epithelial cell lines. B3B (L25541) was present in all cell lines studied. The cell lines that failed to express the B3A form also failed to express the protein based on both immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis. It appears from this data that there are two isoforms of the beta3 mRNA, and that the 5' UTRs of the mRNAs play an important role in regulating translation of the beta3 protein. Since laminin 5 is lost in prostate carcinoma, the mechanism of control that results in the translation of the two forms of message may be important in tumorigenesis.
