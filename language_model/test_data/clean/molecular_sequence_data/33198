A motile, Gram-negative, pinkish red-pigmented bacterium (strain CC-Hsuan-617(T)) was isolated from an oil-contaminated soil near an oil refinery located in Kaohsiung County, Taiwan. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain CC-Hsuan-617(T) clustered with Algoriphagus mannitolivorans (97.5 % sequence similarity), Algoriphagus aquatilis (98.0 %) and Algoriphagus boritolerans (97.5 %), followed by Algoriphagus ornithinivorans (97.1 %) and Algoriphagus alkaliphilus (97.1 %). The fatty acid profile of the novel strain was slightly different from those reported for recognized Algoriphagus species. The quinone system contained menaquinone MK-7 as the predominant component. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, an unknown polar lipid, an unknown phospholipid and an unknown aminophospholipid. The main cell polyamine was sym-homospermidine; lesser amounts of spermine and spermidine were also found. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization, and physiological and biochemical tests allowed the genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strain CC-Hsuan-617(T) from recognized Algoriphagus species. Strain CC-Hsuan-617(T) is thus considered to represent a novel species of the genus Algoriphagus, for which the name Algoriphagus olei sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CC-Hsuan-617(T) (=BCRC 17886(T)=CCUG 57471(T)).
