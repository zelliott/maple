Two types of polysaccharides, sulfated hyaluronic acid and heparin, were pattern-immobilized on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) and polystyrene film, respectively, in a specific pattern by photolithography. Sulfated hyaluronic acid was prepared from hylaronic acid by the treatment of sulfur trioxide/pyridine complex. Heparin was purchased and used without further treatment. The polysaccharides were coupled with azidoaniline. The derivatized polysaccharides were cast on a film from aqueous solution. After drying, the film was photo-irradiated in the presence or absence of a photomask. The micropatterning was confirmed by staining with a cationic dye. Platelet adhesion was reduced on the sulfated hyaluronic acid-immobilized areas. The immobilized sulfated hyaluronic acid significantly reduced thrombus formation. On the other hand, cells were cultured on the heparin-immobilized film. In the presence of fibroblast growth factor (FGF), the growth of mouse fibroblast STO cells was enhanced only on the heparin-immobilized regions. This result indicated that micropattern-immobilized heparin activated FGF for cell growth activity.
