A molecular epidemiological investigation (n = 62) conducted in western Hubei, Central China, revealed that HIV-1 subtype B' (Thailand variant of subtype B) predominated not only among former plasma donors (FPDs) (29/29, 100%) but also among heterosexuals (27/31, 87%), suggesting that subtype B' appears to bridge the spread from FPDs in the general population in this particular area in Central China.
