Multiple sclerosis is mediated by an autoimmune process causing selective destruction of oligodendrocytes. Transaldolase, which is expressed in the brain selectively in oligodendrocytes, is a target of high affinity autoantibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of multiple sclerosis patients. A three-dimensional model of human transaldolase was developed based on the crystal structure of the enzyme from Escherichia coli. To identify immunodominant epitopes, 33 peptides overlapping human transaldolase by 5 amino acids were synthesized. Ab 12484, raised against enzymatically active human transaldolase, recognized antigenic determinants corresponding to linear epitopes (residues 27-31 and 265-290) and alpha helices (residues 75-98 and 302-329). Four immunodominant peptides harboring charged amino acid residues with topographically exposed side chains were identified by sera from 13 multiple sclerosis patients with predetermined autoreactivity to transaldolase. Autoantibodies binding to the most prominent human transaldolase epitope, between residues 271 and 285, showed cross-reactivity with Epstein-Barr and herpes simplex virus type 1 capsid-derived peptides. Molecular mimicry between immunodominant autoepitopes and viral Ags may be a decisive factor in directing autoimmunity to transaldolase in multiple sclerosis patients.
