The ubiquitously expressed transcription factor Oct-1, a member of the POU domain factors, is involved in the regulation of expression of many tissue-specific and house-keeping genes. Multiple alternatively spliced isoforms of Oct-1 have been identified in human and mouse cells. The expression patterns of these isoforms and the analysis of their genomic organization and structure have suggested that the structural variation of Oct-1 isoforms may be important in conferring target and tissue specificity to its transcriptional activity. In this study, we have cloned and sequenced a new mouse Oct-1 isoform, named mOct-1Z. This novel isoform differs markedly at the C-terminus from the previously identified Oct-1 isoforms A, B, and C. It is generated by alternative splicing from the Oct-1 gene and its transcript exhibits a frameshift followed by an early stop codon, thus, its predicted protein has a distinct, much shorter C-terminal tail. However, this truncated isoform could still effectively bind to a consensus Oct-1 motif oligonucleotide and, like Oct-1B, activated the basal promoter activity of the mouse beta-casein gene. Oct-1Z is another ubiquitously expressed Oct-1 isoform, its transcript being detected in all mouse tissues examined, including the mammary gland, liver, lung, kidney, spleen, small intestine mucosa, uterus, and ovary.
