A 28-year-old Caucasian female with no personal or family history of cystic fibrosis (CF) presented for preconception counseling and screening. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation analysis using the Inno-LiPa CFTR assay revealed lack of hybridization for both the wild-type and mutant oligonucleotides for 3120+1G>A. This region was sequenced, and an apparent homozygous 3120G>A mutation was detected. Additional testing revealed an abnormal sweat chloride (77 mmol/L). Review of systems was essentially unremarkable with an absence of sinus symptoms, occasional nonproductive cough, and no features of malabsorption. Physical examination, chest X-ray, and pulmonary function tests were within normal limits. Only two other patients (siblings) with homozygous 3120G>A mutations have been reported (http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/). Both siblings had pancreatic insufficiency, mild pulmonary symptoms, and abnormal sweat chloride levels. Our findings suggest that a homozygous mutation of a G>A conversion at 3120 is associated with abnormal CFTR function and either a mild form of CF or no overt symptoms of disease, emphasizing the difficulties in assigning genotype/phenotype correlation.
