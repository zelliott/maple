By weighting the PCR reaction in favor of specificity for the target sequence in the beginning cycles and for continued efficient amplification of the sequence into later cycles, we were able to show an improvement in the specificity and quantity of amplified ras and p53 sequences. Increased purity and yield of specific products favorably enhanced post-PCR evaluation and interpretation of results using direct sequencing and single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis when point mutations were present in DNA from tumor cell lines and tissues.
