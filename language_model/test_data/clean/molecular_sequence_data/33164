Two novel Gram-positive-staining, acidophilic strains were isolated from soil samples. Both show typical features of filamentous actinomycetes. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the strains are members of the family Micromonosporaceae. The two strains contain hydroxydiaminopimelic acid, glycine, alanine and glutamic acid in the peptidoglycan. Fatty acid profiles clearly differentiate the two strains: cyclohexyl C(17 : 0), i-C(16 : 0) and ai-C(17 : 0) are predominant in Delta1(T), while the major components for Delta3(T) are ai-C(17 : 0) and i-C(16 : 0). The two strains also differ in their major menaquinones, MK-9(H(8), H(4), H(6)) for Delta1(T) and MK-9(H(8), H(6)) for Delta3(T), and in phospholipid patterns; Delta1(T) displays phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, methyl phosphatidylethanolamine and an unknown aminophospholipid, while Delta3(T) also contains minor amounts of several unknown phospholipids in addition to these phospholipids. The whole-cell sugars of both strains are galactose, arabinose and xylose. The G+C content of the DNA is 72.7 mol% for Delta1(T) and 71.9 mol% for Delta3(T). On the basis of chemotaxonomic, physiological and phylogenetic data, we propose Rugosimonospora gen. nov. to accommodate the two strains, with the description of Rugosimonospora acidiphila gen. nov., sp. nov. (the type species; type strain Delta1(T) =DSM 45227(T) =NBRC 104874(T)) and Rugosimonospora africana sp. nov. (type strain Delta3(T) =DSM 45228(T) =NBRC 104875(T)).
