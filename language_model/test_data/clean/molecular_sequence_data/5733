The identification of a gene encoding concomitantly a nuclear protein and an intrinsic centrosomal protein further emphasizes the close and presumably developmental relationship between the cell nucleus and the centrosome. Screening of a murine RNA-based cDNA library with an antiserum to a centrosomal protein and rescreening with the insert of an initial clone released two complete cDNAs (1.2 kbp and 2.2 kpb) coding for proteins with notable characteristics. The amino-terminal sections of centrosomin A (276 amino acid residues, molecular mass 34.5 kDa) and of centrosomin B (447 amino acid residues, molecular mass 54.8 kDa) are identical over 272 amino acid residues. The carboxy-terminal section of the larger protein comprises additional 175 amino acid residues including nuclear location signals. The mRNAs encoding centrosomin A and B derive from a single gene. Chromogenomic DNA as template and primer pairs complementary to the sequence which is identical in centrosomin A and B cDNAs results in amplification of only one DNA fragment. Moreover, one exon of the genomic sequence and the centrosomin B-encoding cDNA sequence include a G which is deleted in the centrosomin A-encoding cDNA. Accordingly, the two mRNAs are the products of either alternative splicing or alternative polyadenylation in combination with RNA editing. The recombinantly expressed chimeric protein consisting of centrosomin A and the green fluorescent protein from Aequorea victoria accumulates in centrosomes while the corresponding fusion protein with the centrosomin B sequence is transported into nuclei.
