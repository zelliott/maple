The relationship of a member of the transmembrane dystrophin-associated glycoprotein (DAG) complex to acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) was investigated using immunofluorescence techniques at rat neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) viewed en face. These results were compared with those from a similar previous study of dystrophin and an autosomal homologue (utrophin or dystrophin-related protein, DRP) (Bewick et al. Neuro Report 1992; 3: 857-860). The region of highest 43 K DAG (43DAG) labelling projected beyond the AChRs by approximately 0.3 microns, as does that for dystrophin. By contrast DRP labelling precisely co-localizes with the AChRs. These results suggest that at the NMJ, the region of high 43DAG concentration encompasses the area of highest intensity labelling for both DRP and dystrophin.
