The Escherichia coli regulatory protein TyrR controls the expression of eight transcription units that encode proteins involved in the biosynthesis and transport of aromatic amino acids. It is a homodimer of 57 600 subunit molecular weight and has a binding site for ATP and weak ATPase activity. In the presence of ATP, TyrR binds tyrosine, which induces self-association of TyrR from a dimer to a hexamer. This report examines the interaction of TyrR with a 42 bp DNA oligonucleotide containing a centrally located binding site for TyrR (TyrR box). Replacement of a thymidine residue with an aminouridine residue at positions 7, 9, 13, 15, 19, 22, and 26 from one end of the 42mer enables labeling with fluorescein and successive placement of the label along the major groove of the DNA. The fluorescence footprinting of the oligonucleotide was followed using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence methods. Binding of the TyrR dimer caused significant changes in the fluorescent properties of the labels attached to positions 13, 15, and 26, suggesting the involvement of these bases in the binding of the protein. Except for the position 15 conjugate, binding of the TyrR dimer caused little change in fluorescence intensity. Therefore, fluorescence anisotropy was used to follow the binding equilibrium. The fluorescence of the position 15 conjugate increased 1.6-fold on binding TyrR, suggesting that the fluorophore was in close contact with the protein. For all conjugates, the addition of tyrosine at the end of the titration with TyrR increased the anisotropy markedly, suggesting that the hexameric form of TyrR could bind the oligonucleotide. Two rotational correlation times were found for the labeled conjugates: one reflecting the motion of the probe at its point of attachment to the DNA (220-290 ps), the other reflecting the global tumbling of the labeled oligonucleotide (14-21 ns). On binding TyrR, changes in the correlation times and their associated amplitudes and changes in the range of angular motion of the probe depended on the position of the label. Evidence is presented that the binding of the TyrR hexamer, but not the TyrR dimer, affects regions that flank the binding sequence. The results support the hypothesis that the binding of the TyrR hexamer is responsible for interaction between tandem TyrR boxes in the tyrR regulon.
