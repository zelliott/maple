Spermatogenesis is a developmental process that occurs in several phases and is regulated by a large number of gene products. An insertional transgenic mouse mutant (termed kisimo mouse) has been isolated that results in abnormal germ-cell development, showing abnormal elongated spermatids in the lumina of seminiferous tubules. We cloned the disrupted locus of kisimo and identified a novel testis-specific gene, THEG, which is specifically expressed in spermatids and was disrupted in the transgenic mouse. The yeast two-hybrid screening method revealed that THEG protein strongly interacts with chaperonin containing t-complex polypeptide-1epsilon, suggesting that THEG protein functions as a regulatory factor in protein assembly. Our findings indicate that the kisimo locus is essential for the maintenance of spermiogenesis and that a gene expression disorder may be involved in male infertility.
