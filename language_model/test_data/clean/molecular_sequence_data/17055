Immunolocalization of 14-3-3 protein isoforms in relation to Pick bodies in Pick body disease (PBD) brains was investigated. Weakly granular immunoreactivity of 14-3-3 proteins was found in neurons in control subjects and in Pick body disease brains. In addition to this granular immunoreactivity, many Pick bodies were immunopositive for 14-3-3 proteins as confirmed with double-immunofluorescence with an anti-PHF tau (AT8) and anti-14-3-3 that recognizes all its isoforms (common). When probed with isoform-specific antibodies, Pick bodies were positive for beta, gamma, epsilon, eta, tau, and zeta isoform and exhibited immunostaining pattern similar to that observed with the anti-14-3-3 proteins (common). In addition, immunoreactivity of sigma isoform, so far considered to be exclusively extraneuronal, was unexpectedly found in Pick bodies, normal hippocampal neurons and brain homogenate from age-matched controls. Although localization of 14-3-3 proteins in Pick bodies suggests their involvement in Pick body formation, their role may be variable dependent on the isoforms differently expressed in different area in the brain.
