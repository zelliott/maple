A group of cDNAs has been isolated and characterized from Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say)] salivary glands. Members in this group appear to encode proteins with secretion signal peptides at the N-terminals. The mature putative proteins are small, basic proteins with calculated molecular weights that ranged from 8.5 to 10 kDa, and isoelectric points from 9.92 to 10.90. Sequence analysis indicated a strong selection for mutations that generate amino acid changes within the coding region. Northern blot analysis revealed that these genes are expressed only in the first instar larvae, a critical stage that determines if the interaction between a specific Hessian fly biotype and a specific wheat cultivar is compatible. Genomic analysis demonstrated that multiple copies of similar genes are clustered within a short region on chromosome 2A. This is the same arm in which two avirulence genes have been mapped.
