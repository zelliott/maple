Previously, we showed that an apparent cell wall-plasma membrane interaction in xylem ray parenchyma differed between cold acclimated and non-acclimated red-osier dogwood (Cornus sericea L.) (Ristic and Ashworth 1994). For the present study, a calcium chloride extraction method was used to identify cell-wall-associated xylem proteins that accumulated during periods of cold acclimation. A 24-kDa protein represented the predominant protein in both total protein and CaCl2 extracts during cold acclimation of field-grown plants. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis separated the 24-kDa protein into four basic isoforms. The most abundant and basic isoform had a high glycine content. In-gel digestion of this basic 24-kDa isoform generated three partial peptide fragments, of which one exhibited homology to the dehydrin protein family. An anti-dehydrin polyclonal antibody cross-reacted with the 24-kDa protein, providing further evidence that this protein is related to dehydrins. The 24-kDa protein began to accumulate in late August, reached a maximum in midwinter, declined during the spring months and was absent in early summer.
