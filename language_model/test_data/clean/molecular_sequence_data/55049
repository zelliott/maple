To date, the structures of the glycolipids from Lactobacillus plantarum, a commonly used beneficial probiotic, have not been conclusively assigned. Herein, we report for the first time, the full characterisation of the four principal glycolipids of the L. plantarum cell wall using sugar, linkage and FAME analysis, as well as ESI-MS/MS and 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy, and assign the major glycolipids as being: α-D-Glcp-diglyceride, α-D-Galp-(1→2)-α-D-Glcp-diglyceride, β-D-Glcp-(1→6)-α-D-Galp-(1→2)-6-O-acyl-α-D-Glcp-diglyceride and β-D-Glcp-(1→6)-α-D-Galp-(1→2)-α-D-Glcp-diglyceride.
