The b6w2 allotype of the constant region of the rabbit immunoglobulin kappa 1 (K1) light chain (b locus) was discovered in wild populations from northern Spain. At the serological level, the b6w2 allotype is characterized by the presentation of all b6-specific epitopes, while an allotypic determinant which is shared between the nominal b5 and b6 allotypes is lacking. The DNA fragment encoding the b6w2 allotype was amplified by means of the polymerase chain reaction, and sequenced directly by dideoxy-DNA-sequencing. When compared with the sequence of the nominal b6 allele, the b6w2 sequence differs at eleven nucleotide positions (96.5% similarity). This variation corresponds to amino acid replacements at 1) the three positions C-terminal to the peptidyl junction with the variable region (amino acid positions 109-111); 2) the four positions N-terminal to the interdomain disulfide bond (167-170); and 3) two positions in the vicinity of the interchain disulfide bond (190 and 210). The nature and distribution of the observed nucleotide substitutions strongly suggest a possible role of the extra interdomain disulfide bond in the unusual evolutionary dynamics of the rabbit K1 light chain.
