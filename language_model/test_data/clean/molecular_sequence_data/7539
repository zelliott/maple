A 14 kb genomic clone covering the organellar-type Ca(2+)-ATPase gene of Drosophila melanogaster has been isolated and characterized. The sequence of a 7132 bp region extending from 1.1 kb 5' upstream of the initiation ATG codon over the polyadenylation signal at the 3' end has been determined. The gene consists of nine exons including one with an exceptional size of 2172 bp representing 72% of the protein coding region. Introns are relatively small (< 100 bp) except for the 3' intron which has a size of 2239 bp, an exceptionally large size among Drosophila introns. Five of the introns are in the same positions in Drosophila, Artemia and rabbit SERCA1 Ca(2+)-ATPase genes. There is only one organellar-type Ca(2+)-ATPase gene in the Drosophila genome, as was shown by Southern-blot analysis [Váradi, Gilmore-Hebert and Benz (1989) FEBS Lett. 258, 203-207] and by chromosomal localization [Magyar and Váradi (1990) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 173, 872-877]. Primer extension and S1-nuclease assays revealed a potential transcription initiation site 876 bp upstream of the translation initiation ATG with a TATA-box 23 bp upstream of this site. Analysis of the 5' region of the Drosophila organellar-type Ca(2+)-ATPase gene suggests the presence of potential recognition sequences of various muscle-specific transcription factors and shows a region with remarkable similarity to that in the rabbit SERCA2 gene. The tissue distribution of expression of the organellar-type Ca(2+)-ATPase gene has been studied by in situ RNA-RNA hybridization on microscopic sections. A low mRNA abundance can be detected in each tissue of adult flies, suggesting a housekeeping function for the gene. On the other hand a pronounced tissue specificity of expression has also been found as the organellar-type Ca(2+)-ATPase is expressed at a very high level in cell bodies of the central nervous system and in various muscles.
