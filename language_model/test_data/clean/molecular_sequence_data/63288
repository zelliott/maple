Poxvirus-encoded RNA polymerases were known previously to share extensive sequence homology in their two largest subunits with the corresponding subunits of cellular RNA polymerases and a modest alignment between the smallest poxvirus subunit and RBP10 of RNA polymerase II. The remaining subunits had no apparent cellular homologs. In this study, the HHpred program that combines amino acid sequence alignments with secondary structure predictions was used to search for homologs to the poxvirus RNA polymerase subunits. Significant matches of vaccinia RNA polymerase 22-, 19-, and 18-kDa subunits to RNA polymerase II subunits RPB5, 6, and 7, respectively, were identified. These results strengthen the concept that poxviral RNA polymerases likely evolved from cellular RNA polymerases.
