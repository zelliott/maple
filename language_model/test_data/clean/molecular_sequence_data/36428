The glucoamylase P gene of the fungus Hormoconis resinae has been cloned and sequenced from a genomic library. The gene consists of a 2153-bp protein coding region including three introns. The usual number of introns in cloned fungal glucoamylase genes has been four and in some cases five. Two of the glucoamylase P gene introns contain a sequence resembling the consensus sequence found near the 3' splice site in the introns of the fungus Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase 1 (cbh1) gene. The H. resinae glucoamylase P gene, under its own promoter, was introduced into T. reesei, but no expression could be detected.
