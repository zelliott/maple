Twenty-seven Gram-positive strains were characterized physiologically and numerically and classified them into four groups according to their specific activities for utilization of linear alkyl ethers (AEs), cyclic AEs, monoalkoxybenzenes and 1,4-diethoxybenzene. The comparative analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene and 16S-23S intergenic spacer region showed that they belonged to the genera Rhodococcus and Gordonia. Alkyl ether-utilizing rhodococci appeared to involve various and diverse cytochromes P450 of the families CYP116 (25 positive strains from 27), CYP153 (5/27), CYP249 (1/27) and a new family P450RR1 (27/27). The presence of P450RR1 was strongly related to the specific activity for utilization of 2-methoxyphenol and 2-ethoxyphenol. In addition, 26 of 27 strains contained multiple alkB genes coding for probable non-haem iron containing alkane monooxygenases and hydroxylases. Similar DNA fragments coding for a tetrahydrofuran monooxygenase A subunit (ThmA) were found in all cyclic AE-utilizing strains and nearly identical DNA fragments coding for likely orthologues of a propane monooxygenase A subunit (PrmA) in all linear AE-utilizing strains. The substrate availability in the degradation of aryl AEs, cyclic AEs and linear AEs agreed with the molecular probing of the respective genes encoding cytochrome P450RR1, ThmA and PrmA.
