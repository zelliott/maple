We have designed a cytometry-based competition assay to evaluate peptide binding to empty recombinant HLA class II molecules. The efficiency of this assay was evaluated using recombinant HLA-DP0401 molecules (HLA-DP) produced in insect cells and 13 peptides from human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). We demonstrate that our method allowed accurate measurements of peptide Ki values and can thus discriminate strong, moderate and poor HLA-DP binders. In parallel, we showed that among hTERT peptides, the most immunodominant in healthy individuals were those with moderate affinity for HLA-DP while no T cell response could be evidenced against peptides with very strong or very low affinities for HLA-DP. This strongly suggests that the precise determination of peptide affinity with our method can improve HLA class II epitope prediction.
