Two Drosophila receptors (AlstR/DAR-1 and DAR-2) with sequence similarity to mammalian galanin receptors have been previously identified. These receptors have been shown to form specific interactions with neuropeptides that resemble cockroach allatostatins (ASTs), which have a characteristic Tyr/Phe-Xaa-Phe-Gly-Leu-NH2 carboxyl-terminus. We hypothesized that similar allatostatin receptors exist in the cockroach Diploptera punctata that may regulate the numerous effects that this family of peptides exerts on a range of target tissues. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used, with primer design based on the Drosophila allatostatin receptor (AlstR). Using these primers, a putative allatostatin-like receptor cDNA was isolated from a lambda ZAP-cDNA library prepared from the corpora allata of the D. punctata. As an approach to testing the function of this receptor in vivo, the technique of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) gene interference was tested. Initial experiments suggest that the putative inhibition of receptor RNA expression may increase juvenile hormone (JH) production.
