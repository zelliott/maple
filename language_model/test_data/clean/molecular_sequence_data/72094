We report the cloning of a cDNA encoding human syntaxin 8 (STX8), using the regulator (R) domain of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) as a bait to screen a human fetal lung cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid system. This gene was found broadly transcribed and its mRNA size is about 1.3 kb. The STX8 gene maps to chromosomal band 17p12 and it encodes a 236-amino-acid protein. Syntaxin 8 contains in its C-terminal half a coiled-coil domain found highly conserved in the t-SNARE (SNAP receptor on target membrane) superfamily of proteins, which are involved in vesicular trafficking and docking. In syntaxin 8, a C-terminal hydrophobic domain may constitute a transmembrane anchor. It was recently shown that CFTR-mediated chloride currents can be regulated by syntaxin 1A, a t-SNARE family member, through direct protein-protein interaction. This raises the possibility that syntaxin 8 may also be involved in such regulations.
