The gene encoding the enzyme gluconolactonase (D-glucono-delta-lactone lactonohydrolase, EC 3.1.1.17) has been isolated from a recombinant library of genomic Zymomonas mobilis DNA, by detection of enzyme activity in recombinant clones. The gene encoded a protein of 320 amino acids, which is processed to the mature enzyme of 285 amino acids (31079 Da) by cleavage at an Ala-Ala bond, as determined from N-terminal sequencing of the purified enzyme. A minor sequence commencing at amino acid 6 is suggestive of an alternative start of translation at the ATG codon of amino acid 5; in this case the expressed enzyme would remain cytoplasmic, whereas it is presumed that the main portion is directed to the membrane of periplasm by the leader sequence.
