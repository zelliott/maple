This study describes the nascent RNA-binding protein of the pea chloroplast transcriptional complex. The protein has been identified by photoaffinity labelling of the transcriptionally active chromosome (TAC) which utilizes the endogenous plastid DNA as template. UV irradiation of lysed chloroplast or the isolated TAC under conditions optimized for transcription photocross-links nascent radiolabelled transcripts (up to 250 nucleotides in length) to a 48 kDa protein. The photoaffinity labelling of the transcript-binding protein is dependent on UV irradiation, is maximal after about 30 min of irradiation, and is completely dependent on transcriptional activity; no cross-linkage has been observed with pre-synthesized RNA. Cross-linkage is influenced by salts and inhibitors in accordance with their effects on transcription. The photoconjugate is composed of protein and RNA moieties, and can be hydrolysed by several proteases. However, the cross-linked transcript is protected from nucleases until the protein is removed. Manganese enhances photoaffinity labelling of the transcript-binding protein, and this is paralleled by an increase in total transcriptional activity of TAC. This protein was isolated by 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the sequence of 15 amino acid residues at the amino terminus was determined. The nascent transcript-binding protein appears to be involved in the transcription of all three classes of chloroplast genes. We also found a polypeptide of identical molecular weight to get cross-linked to nascent transcripts in chloroplasts isolated from other legumes such as Cicer arietenum, Vigna radiata and Phaseolus vulgaris, and monocots like Zea mays, Oryza sativa and Pennisetum americanum.
