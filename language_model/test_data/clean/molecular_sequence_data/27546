Cell wall proteins from purified Candida albicans and Neurospora crassa cell walls were released using trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMS) which cleaves the cell wall glucan/chitin matrix and deglycosylates the proteins. The cell wall proteins were then characterized by SDS-PAGE and identified by proteomic analysis. The analyses for C. albicans identified 15 cell wall proteins and six secreted proteins. For N. crassa, the analyses identified 26 cell wall proteins and nine secreted proteins. Most of the C. albicans cell wall proteins are found in the cell walls of both yeast and hyphae cells, but some cell type-specific cell wall proteins were observed. The analyses showed that the pattern of cell wall proteins present in N. crassa vegetative hyphae and conidia (asexual spores) are quite different. Almost all of the cell wall proteins identified in N. crassa have close homologs in the sequenced fungal genomes, suggesting that these proteins have important conserved functions within the cell wall.
