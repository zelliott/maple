Members of the plant-specific GRAS family of putative transcription factors are involved in various aspects of plant development. SCARECROW (SCR) is a member of this protein family and plays a significant role in the radial patterning of both roots and shoots. However, little is known about the regulation of SCR expression and its mode of action in plants. Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of a Brassica napus SCARECROW-like protein, BnSCL1, isolated by selecting for proteins that interact with the Arabidopsis histone deacetylase AtHDA19 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. BnSCL1 contains domains conserved in the GRAS family of proteins, interacts with AtHDA19 through a VHIID domain, and exerts transcription activation of reporter genes . BnSCL1 is expressed predominantly in the roots, where its expression is regulated by auxin, as it also is in shoots and mature leaves. These results indicate that BnSCL1 is a member of the GRAS family, and suggest that its mode of action in plant auxin response may involve interaction with HDA19.
