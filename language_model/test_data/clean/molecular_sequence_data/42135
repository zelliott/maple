The role of tRNAs in protein synthesis seems routine when compared with the novel ways in which the Ty retrotransposons of Saccharomyces cerevisiae use these interpreters of the genetic code. tRNAs and tRNA genes control essential steps in the retrotransposon life cycle by regulating protein expression, priming DNA synthesis and specifying integration target sites.
