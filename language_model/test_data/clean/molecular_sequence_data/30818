1. Both alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin-like proteins were detected in the whey fraction of feline milk by immunoblotting with rabbit antisera to alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin, respectively. 2. alpha-Lactalbumin was found to occur in both glycosylated and unglycosylated forms in approximately equal concentrations. No polymorphism of feline alpha-lactalbumin was found. 3. Feline beta-lactoglobulin-like proteins produced complex electrophoretic patterns that appear to be determined by three distinct loci. Between two and five genetic variants are expressed by each locus. 4. Lysozyme was detected at levels of approximately 1 mg/ml in skim milk. 5. The identifications of the proteins as alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin and lysozyme were confirmed by determination of N-terminal amino acid sequences.
