The kidney and several other thyroid hormone-responsive tissues contain a NADP-regulated thyroid hormone (TH)-binding protein (THBP), with an apparent molecular mass of 36 kDa on SDS-PAGE, responsible for most of the intracellular high-affinity T3 and T4 binding. THBP was purified to homogeneity from human kidney cytosol and used to generate proteolytic peptides. Microsequencing of four peptides revealed identity to amino acid sequences deduced from a human cDNA homolog to a cDNA encoding kangaroo mu-crystallin. This protein is a major structural kangaroo lens protein with no known function in other species. A full-sized cDNA (TH5.9) was isolated by 5'- and 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using a human brain cDNA library and gene-specific PCR primers, confirming identity to the previously cloned human cDNA. The TH5.9 cDNA encodes a 314-residue protein (theoretical mol wt = 33,775) with significant homologies (40 to 60%) with two bacterial enzymes: lysine cyclodeaminase and ornithine cyclodeaminase. The TH5.9 cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. Purified GST fusion protein, but not GST, bound T3 specifically with high affinity [dissociation constant (Kd) = 0.5 nM] in the presence of NADPH, and was labeled by UV-driven cross-linking of underivatized [(125)I]T3. T3 binding and photoaffinity labeling of GST fusion protein were activated by NADPH [activation constant (K[act]) = 10(-8) M], but not by NADH. The expressed protein displays the appropriate binding properties, indicating that TH5.9 cDNA encodes the NADP-regulated THBP characterized in human tissues.
