Repeated sequences were identified in the 5' region of the human Tg gene in introns 4, 5, 10, and 11. Another repeated cluster was located in the 5' flanking sequences, approximately 6 Kb upstream from the first exon. The nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that these repeated sequences are members of the Alu family. The homology between the sequences of the intron 4 and the Alu consensus was 86%. The Alu member studied was oriented in the direction of transcription of the Tg.
