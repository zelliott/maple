In the present study, the requirements and characteristics for the production of IL-13 by human T cells, T cell clones and B cells were determined and compared with those of IL-4. IL-13 was produced by human CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte subsets isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and by CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones. CD4+ T cell clones belonging to Th0, Th1-like and Th2-like subsets produced IL-13 following antigen-specific or polyclonal activation. In addition, EBV-transformed B cell lines expressed IL-13 mRNA and produced small amounts of IL-13 protein. Expression of IL-13 mRNA and production of IL-13 protein by peripheral blood T cells and T cell clones was induced rapidly and was relatively long lasting, whereas IL-4 production by these cells was transient. In addition, IL-13 mRNA expression was induced by modes of activation that failed to induce IL-4 mRNA expression. IL-13 shares many biological activities with IL-4 which is compatible with the notion that the IL-13 and IL-4 receptors share a common component required for signal transduction. However, IL-13 lacks the T cell-activating properties of IL-4. Here we have shown that this is related to the fact that T cells fail to bind radiolabeled IL-13 and do not express the IL-13-specific receptor component. Taken together, these results indicate that the differences in expression and biological activities of IL-4 and IL-13 on T cells may have consequences for the relative roles of these cytokines in the immune response.
