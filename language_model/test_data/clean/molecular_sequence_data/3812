We report the identification of previously unrecognised errors in the nucleotide sequences of two long established HLA-DRB1 alleles, DRB1*0801 and DRB1*12011. The errors were detected during development of sequencing based typing (SBT) methods for the HLA-DRB1 locus and were confirmed by sequencing cell lines from the 10th International Histocompatibility Workshop (IHW).
