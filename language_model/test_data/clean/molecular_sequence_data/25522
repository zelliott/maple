A gene (I-18C) cloned from the early ecdysterone (EDS)-inducible puff site, I-18C, in Chironomus tentans salivary glands, codes by differential processing for at least five transcripts which can be grouped into spliced and unspliced transcripts. The spliced group comprises several RNAs of approx. 4.6 kb, and the unspliced group comprises the 1.8-kb and 6.5-kb RNAs. All these transcripts have a similar or the same transcription start point. The steady-state level of the spliced 4.6-kb RNAs reveals some parallels with EDS concentrations in animals during the various developmental stages analyzed, while the levels of the unspliced 1.8-kb and 6.5-kb RNAs do not correlate with the EDS concentrations.
