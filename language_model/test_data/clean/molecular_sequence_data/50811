Brain microsomal membranes are capable of sequentially removing Met, Leu and Val from a chemically synthesized COOH-terminal heptapeptide (propionyl-Gly-Ser-Pro-(farnesyl-Cys)-Val-Leu-Met) of mouse N-ras protein. The carboxypeptidase generating Met displays maximum activity at neutral pH and shows high affinity for the farnesylated substrate (Km = 73 microM) as compared to its non farnesylated precursor (Km = 600 microM). The results of inhibitor action suggest that the membrane carboxypeptidase is a novel, probably thiol-dependent, serine type peptidase.
