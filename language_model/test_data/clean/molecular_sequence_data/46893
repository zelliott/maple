The mutation Gly467-->Ser in Glu glucoamylase was designed to investigate differences between two highly homologous wild-type Saccharomycopsis fibuligera Gla and Glu glucoamylases. Gly467, localized in the conserved active site region, S5, is replaced by Ser in the Gla glucoamylase. These amino acid residues are the only two known to occupy this position in the elucidated glucoamylase sequences. The data from the kinetic analysis revealed that replacement of Gly467 with Ser in Glu glucoamylase decreased the kcat towards all substrates tested to values comparable with those of the Gla enzyme. Moreover, the mutant glucoamylase appeared to be less stable compared to the wild-type Glu glucoamylase with respect to thermal unfolding. Microcalorimetric titration studies of the interaction with the inhibitor acarbose indicated differences in the binding between Gla and Glu enzymes. The Gla glucoamylase, although less active, binds acarbose stronger (Ka congruent with 10(13).M(-1)) than the Glu enzyme (Ka congruent with 10(12).M(-1)). In all enzymes studied, the binding of acarbose was clearly driven by enthalpy, with a slightly favorable entropic contribution. The binding of another glucoamylase inhibitor, 1-deoxynojirimycin, was about 8-9 orders of magnitude weaker (Ka congruent with 10(4).M(-1)) than that of acarbose. From comparison of kinetic parameters for the nonglycosylated and glycosylated enzymes it can be deduced that the glycosylation does not play a critical role in enzymatic activity. However, results from differential scanning calorimetry demonstrate an important role of the carbohydrate moiety in the thermal stability of glucoamylase.
