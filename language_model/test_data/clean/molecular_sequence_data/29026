Cdt1 is essential for loading Mcm2-7 proteins into prereplicative complexes (pre-RCs) during replication licensing and has been found in organisms as diverse as fission yeast and humans. We have identified a homologue of Cdt1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is required for pre-RC assembly. We show that, like Mcm2-7p, Cdt1p accumulates in the nucleus during G1 phase and is excluded from the nucleus later in the cell cycle by cyclin dependent kinases (cdks). Cdt1p interacts with the Mcm2--7p complex, and the nuclear accumulation of these proteins during G1 is interdependent. This coregulation of Cdt1p and Mcm2-7p represents a novel level of pre-RC control.
