The genes encoding orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) and orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (OMPDC), the fifth and sixth enzymes in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, are fused as OPRT-OMPDC in most eukaryotic groups. On the other hand, the inversely linked OMPDC-OPRT fusion is present in trypanosomatids, belonging to kinetoplastids together with bodonids in a supergroup, Euglenozoa. Here, we show the presence of OMPDC-OPRT in the bodonid, Bodo caudatus, while OPRT-OMPDC in Euglena gracilis, another euglenozoan species belonging to euglenoids. These results suggest that the OMPDC-OPRT fusion event occurred in a common ancestor of kinetoplastids. Genome sequence database searches further revealed the presence of OMPDC-OPRT in stramenopiles and cyanobacteria. Phylogenetic reconstruction of OPRT and OMPDC rejected statistically the monophyly of the OPRT domains of stramenopile and kinetoplastid OMPDC-OPRT, demonstrating that these gene fusions do not share a common evolutionary origin, despite the identical gene order. Thus, the OMPDC-OPRT fusion is likely to have emerged independently in these eukaryotic groups. Phylogenetic analyses also suggested that cyanobacterial OMPDC-OPRT arose via lateral transfer. We conclude that gene fusion events occur more frequently than previously thought and that lateral gene transfer has made a marked contribution to establishment of the rearranged structure of OPRT and OMPDC genes in eukaryotes.
