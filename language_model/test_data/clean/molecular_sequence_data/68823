In view of its central role in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis and its polymorphic genetic variability, the phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) gene in man has been the target of protein structural studies and genetic analysis for more than 25 years. We have now isolated genomic clones containing the complete PGM1 gene and have shown that it spans over 65 kb and contains 11 exons. We have also shown that the sites of the two mutations which form the molecular basis for the common PGM1 protein polymorphism lie in exons 4 and 8 and are 18 kb apart. Within this region there is a site of intragenic recombination. We have discovered two alternatively spliced first exons, one of which, exon 1A, is transcribed in a wide variety of cell types; the other, exon 1B, is transcribed in fast muscle. Exon 1A is transcribed from a promoter which has the structural hallmarks of a housekeeping promoter but lies more than 35 kb upstream of exon 2. Exon 1B lies 6 kb upstream of exon 2 within the large first intron of the ubiquitously expressed PGM1 transcript. The fast-muscle form of PGM1 is characterized by 18 extra amino acid residues at its N-terminal end. Sequence comparisons show that exons 1A and 1B are structurally related and have arisen by duplication.
