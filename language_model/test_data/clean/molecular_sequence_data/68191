We have previously identified hsp56, a protein component of steroid receptor complexes, as an FK506 binding protein [Yem et al. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 2868-2871]. We now report that hsp56 is also found to be a major immunophilin in chicken thymus, by virtue of binding to FK506-Affi-Gel-10 as well as positive cross-reactivity with a polyclonal antiserum directed against human hsp56. Limited digests of purified chicken hsp56 with endoproteinase Lys C result in the production of a unique polypeptide having a mass of about 17 kDa (p17), as judged by Western blotting. Peptide mapping provided additional proof that p17 is a fragment which comprises the entire FK506 binding domain I of chicken hsp56, terminating with an Arg-Lys which might represent a processing site. Binding of radiolabeled dihydro FK506 to p17 is saturable with a calculated KD of 42 nM. Since size exclusion chromatography of drug-p17 complexes indicates that the active species is a homodimer with a mass of 30-40 kDa, the stoichiometry calculated for the drug-protein complex is approximately 1:1. Furthermore, unlike FKBP-12, chicken p17 bound to FK506 does not bind to calcineurin-calmodulin complexes. This work demonstrates the excision of a domain from an hsp56 protein that is active in binding FK506 and functionally distinct from FKBP-12, a protein of similar size and structure.
