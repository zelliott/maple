In 2010, yam beans in a field trial in Peru showed viral disease symptoms. Graft-transmission and positive ELISA results using potyvirus-specific antibodies suggested that the symptoms could be the result of a potyviral infection. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) were extracted from one of the samples and sent for high-throughput sequencing. The full genome of a new potyvirus could be assembled from the resulting siRNA sequences, and it was sufficiently different from other sequences to be considered a member of a new species, which we have designated Yam bean mosaic virus (YBMV). Sequence similarity suggests that YBMV has also been detected in yam beans in Indonesia.
