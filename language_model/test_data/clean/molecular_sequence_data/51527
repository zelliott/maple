Southern blot and nucleotide sequence analysis of Phanerochaete chrysosporium BKM-F-1767 genomic clones indicate that this wood-degrading fungus contains at least six genes with significant homology to the Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase I gene (cbh1). Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to separate P. chrysosporium chromosomes, the six cellulase genes were found to hybridize to at least three different chromosomes, one of which is dimorphic. The organization of these genes was similar in another P. chrysosporium strain, ME 446. It is clear that, unlike T. reesei, the most well-studied cellulolytic fungus, P. chrysosporium contains a complex, cbh1-like gene family.
