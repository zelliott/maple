The TraT protein is a cell-surface-exposed, outer membrane lipoprotein specified by large, usually conjugative, F-like plasmids. Two biological activities have been associated with the protein: (i) prevention of self-mating of cells carrying identical or closely related conjugative plasmids, by blocking the formation of stable mating aggregates; and (ii) resistance to the bactericidal activities of serum, possibly by inhibiting the correct assembly or efficient functioning of the terminal membrane attack complex of complement. The protein therefore interacts not only with components of the outer membrane but also with specific external agents. In conjugative plasmids the traT gene lies within the region necessary for the conjugal transfer of DNA (tra), although its expression is not necessarily dependent on the expression of other tra genes. Recently, however, the gene has been discovered in isolation from other tra genes in nonconjugative virulence-associated plasmids, providing further evidence that the TraT protein may have a role in pathogenesis. The nucleotide sequences of several traT genes have been determined, and comparison of the corresponding amino acid sequences suggests that a central region of five amino acid residues flanked by hydrophobic domains determines the specificity of the protein in surface exclusion. Additionally, studies of mutants with different amino acid alterations within the hydrophobic domains have shown that insertion of charged residues disrupts normal outer membrane integrity. This review considers our current knowledge of the distribution, structure, and biological role(s) of the protein. Recent applications of the protein in studies of the unusual permeability properties of the outer membrane and for the transport of foreign antigenic determinants to the bacterial cell surface are also discussed.
