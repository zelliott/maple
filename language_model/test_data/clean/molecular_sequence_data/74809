Deubiquitylating enzymes have key regulatory roles in multiple cellular processes by mediating ubiquitin removal and processing. The ubiquitin-specific processing proteases (USPs) represent the largest subclass of deubiquitylases. Recently, several USPs that recognize the monoubiquitylated histones H2A and/or H2B have been identified. Among these enzymes, three USPs contain a zinc-finger ubiquitin-specific protease (ZnF-UBP) domain, indicating that this domain plays a crucial part in regulating their activity. To address the putative function of this domain, we systematically analysed and aligned yeast and human ZnF-UBP-containing proteins. By complementing our analysis with structural and functional data, we present a classification of the different ZnF-UBP-containing proteins and a model for their regulation.
