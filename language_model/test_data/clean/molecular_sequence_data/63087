Activation of pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) by xenobiotic inducers of cytochromes P450 is part of a pleiotropic response that includes liver hypertrophy, tumor promotion, effects on lipid homeostasis, and energy metabolism. Here, we describe an acute response to CAR and PXR activators that is associated with induction of Insig-1, a protein with antilipogenic properties. We first observed that activation of CAR and PXR in mouse liver results in activation of Insig-1 along with reduced protein levels of the active form of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (Srebp-1). Studies in mice deficient in CAR and PXR revealed that the effect on triglycerides involves these two nuclear receptors. Finally, we identified a functional binding site for CAR and PXR in the Insig-1 gene by in vivo, in vitro, and in silico genomic analysis. Our experiments suggest that activation Insig-1 by drugs leads to reduced levels of active Srebp-1 and consequently to reduced target gene expression including the genes responsible for triglyceride synthesis. The reduction nuclear Srebp-1 by drugs is not observed when Insig-1 expression is repressed by small interfering RNA. In addition, observed that Insig-1 is also a target of AMP-activated kinase, the hepatic activity of which is increased by activators of CAR and PXR and is known to cause a reduction of triglycerides. The fact that drugs that serve as CAR or PXR ligands induce Insig-1 might have clinical consequences and explains alterations lipid levels after drug therapy.
