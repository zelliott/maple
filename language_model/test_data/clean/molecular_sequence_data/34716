Eukaryotic translation initiation begins with assembly of a 48S ribosomal complex at the 5' cap structure or at an internal ribosomal entry segment (IRES). In both cases, ribosomal positioning at the AUG codon requires a 5' untranslated region upstream from the initiation site. Here, we report that translation of the genomic RNA of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 takes place by attachment of the 48S ribosomal preinitiation complex to the coding region, with no need for an upstream 5' untranslated RNA sequence. This unusual mechanism is mediated by an RNA sequence that has features of an IRES with the unique ability to recruit ribosomes upstream from its core domain. A combination of translation assays and structural studies reveal that sequences located 50 nucleotides downstream of the AUG codon are crucial for IRES activity.
