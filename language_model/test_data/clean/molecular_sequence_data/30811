The mitochondrial MURF4 gene of T. brucei has pronounced G versus C strand bias and heterogeneously sized transcripts, characteristic of genes encoding extensively edited transcripts. We find that MURF4 transcripts of T. brucei are extensively edited throughout by the addition and deletion of numerous uridines, creating potential initiation and termination codons and a continuous open reading frame. A potential guide RNA sequence occurs in a minicircle between inverted repeats. The 5' region of L. tarentolae MURF4 transcripts is also extensively edited, with a created initiation codon. The predicted MURF4 amino acid sequences have homology to those of mitochondrial ATP-ase subunit 6 genes from a variety of organisms. In addition, their hydropathic profiles are quite similar to those of other species. We therefore conclude that MURF4 encodes ATPase subunit 6 genes.
