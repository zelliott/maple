Cell cultures infected with BHV-1/F(syn), a recombinant bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) which expresses a synthetic open reading frame encoding the fusion (F) protein of the bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), showed a cytopathic effect (CPE) indistinguishable from that induced by wildtype BHV-1 although transient transfection experiments demonstrated that expression of the F protein leads to formation of large syncytia. Since it has been shown that glycoprotein M (gM) of pseudorabies virus inhibits BRSV F-induced syncytium formation in transient plasmid transfection experiments [Pseudorbies virus glycoprotein M inhibits membrane fusion. J. Virol. 74 (2000) 6760], the gM ORF of wtBHV-1 and BHV-1/F(syn) was interrupted. Infection of cell cultures with the resulting gM(-) mutant of BHV-1/F(syn) led to formation of syncytia, whereas the CPE in gM(-)BHV-1 infected cells was comparable to the CPE in wtBHV-1 infected cultures. Our results demonstrate that gM is not essential for BHV-1 replication in cell culture and that gM is involved in inhibition of the cell fusion activity of the BHV-1 expressed BRSV F protein.
