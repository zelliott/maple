Antiserum to Aeromonas hydrophila A6 cell envelopes was shown in a previous study (C. Y. F. Wong, G. Mayrhofer, M. W. Heuzenroeder, H. M. Atkinson, D. M. Quinn, and R. L. P. Flower, FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 15:233-241, 1996) to protect mice against lethal infection by this organism. In this study, colony blot analysis of an A. hydrophila genomic library using antiserum to A. hydrophila A6 cell envelopes revealed a cosmid clone expressing a 30-kDa protein which has not been described previously in aeromonads. The nucleotide sequence of a 3.9-kb fragment derived from this cosmid which expressed the 30-kDa protein revealed two potential open reading frames (ORFs) with homology to known immunophilin proteins. ORF1 encoded a 212-amino-acid protein (molecular mass, 22.4 kDa) with 56% identity to the immunophilin SlyD protein of Escherichia coli. ORF1 was subsequently designated ilpA (immunophilin-like protein). ORF3 encoded a potential gene product of 268 amino acids with a typical signal sequence and a predicted molecular size of 28.7 kDa. The inferred amino acid sequence showed 46% identity with the sequence of the FkpA protein of E. coli and 40% identity with the sequence of the macrophage infectivity potentiator (Mip) protein of Legionella pneumophila. ORF3 was designated fkpA (FK506 binding protein) by analogy with the E. coli FkpA protein. Expression of the FkpA protein was confirmed by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis, which detected a 30-kDa protein, with antiserum to the Mip protein of Legionella longbeachae and a specific antiserum to anA. hydrophila 30-kDa membrane protein. PCR and Southern analysis showed that a DNA sequence encoding FkpA was found in all 178 aeromonads of diverse origins tested. A nonpolar insertion mutation in the fkpA gene did not attenuate virulence in a suckling mouse model nor did it affect the expression of hemolysins or DNase. This suggests that either the fkpA gene is not essential in the virulence of A. hydrophila under these conditions or there are other genes in A. hydrophila coding for proteins with similar functions.
