L-shaped structures formed by two consecutive alpha-helices joined by short connections are considered. The L-structures with the alpha m gamma beta/delta alpha n-conformations are of particular value since they usually have Pro residues in the second positions of the second alpha-helices. These structures can be divided into two classes, the right-turned and left-turned L-structures, depending on whether the second alpha-helix is located on the right or the left, relative to the first one when viewed from the hydrophobic core. Stereochemical analysis shows that in an ideal case the left- and right-turned L-structures should have different sequence patterns of hydrophobic, hydrophilic and proline residues. These sequence patterns can be used in the prediction of the L-shaped structures as well as in protein design and engineering.
