Probing of a host and ingestion of a blood-meal in a fifth instar Rhodnius prolixus results in a cascade of tightly integrated events. The huge blood-meal is pumped into the anterior midgut during feeding, then modified by diuresis and stored until it is digested. While serotonin is known to be a diuretic hormone in R. prolixus, a peptidergic factor(s) was also known to play a role in diuresis. In the present study we employed molecular techniques and mass spectrometry to determine the sequence of a native CRF-like peptide from R. prolixus (Rhopr DH). In addition, we confirmed the distribution and localization of Rhopr DH using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, and demonstrated its potent biological activity on both the anterior midgut and Malpighian tubules.
