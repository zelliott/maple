We studied whether antigen-specific T cells being restricted by the very similar HLA-Dw4 and/or -Dw14.1 molecules might demonstrate homogeneities in parts of their TCR. TCCs were generated from three individuals who were all HLA-Dw4/Dw14.1 heterozygous. Thirty-five TCCs specific for PPD or TT and restricted by HLA-Dw4 and/or -Dw14.1 were selected for TCR beta gene sequencing. We found that 19 different V beta genes from 13 V beta families were expressed by these TCCs. Thus, it seems that many different TCRV beta genes may be used by TCCs restricted by these HLA molecules. For PPD-specific TCCs, a possible biased usage of V beta 8, as well as possible preferential usage of a CDR3 motif, were found.
