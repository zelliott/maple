The aim of this study was to develop a method for quantitation of APC mRNA and to measure APC mRNA levels in human tissues. This was done using a competitive reverse transcription PCR with a synthetic RNA control. APC mRNA (pg/microgram total RNA) was quantitated in the following tissues: normal colon 133.6 +/- 69.0; normal duodenum 16.6 +/- 15.7; normal thyroid 30.4 +/- 20.3; normal esophagus 65.2 +/- 58.8; colonic carcinoma 66.5 +/- 30.3; esophageal carcinoma 54.7 +/- 26.5; papillary thyroid carcinoma 55.8 +/- 32.9 and colonic adenomas from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis 46 +/- 15. APC mRNA levels were significantly lower in the duodenum and thyroid than in the colon and esophagus. The quantity of APC mRNA was lower in colonic adenomas from FAP patients than in normal colonic mucosa (p < 0.05).
