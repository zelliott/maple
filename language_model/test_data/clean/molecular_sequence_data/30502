Strains of Entamoeba histolytica which were isolated from symptomatic patients and which possess a characteristic pathogenic isoenzyme pattern (zymodeme) have extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules containing RNA genes and clusters of tandemly reiterated PvuI elements. The nucleotide sequence of comparable reiterated BamHI elements present in amebae with nonpathogenic zymodemes differs from that found in pathogenic ones. By using the polymerase chain reaction, it was demonstrated that the cloned, nonpathogenic E. histolytica strain SAW 1734R clAR also contains one or few of the tandemly repeated DNA PvuI elements characteristic of the pathogenic amebae. Sequences were detected by hybridization with the P-145 probe after in vitro amplification. Because of technical difficulties, it was impossible to resolve whether single copies of the nonpathogenic BamHI repetitive elements are present in pathogenic amebae. Our findings suggest that in the nonpathogenic amebae, the signal to start amplifying the PvuI-type elements may be induced during the process of elimination of bacterial associates from their growth environment.
