Two cases of pulmonary infection due to strains of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae were investigated. Beta-lactamase determinants, such as bla(IMP-4) and bla(SHV-12), and the 16S rRNA methyltransferase-encoding gene armA were detected in these plasmid-bearing organisms. The integron-borne bla(IMP-4) and armA contained intervening sequences highly related to those of a Vibrio cholerae O139 plasmid found in Hangzhou, China.
