A/duck/Shanghai/28-1/2009(H4N2) (DK28) was isolated from a live poultry market in Shanghai, China. Using PCR and sequencing analysis, we obtained the complete genome sequences of the DK28 virus. The sequence analysis demonstrated that this H4N2 virus was a novel multiple-gene reassortant avian influenza virus (AIV) whose genes originated from H1N1, H1N3, H3N3, H4N2, and H4N6. Knowledge regarding the complete genome sequences of the DK28 virus will be useful for epidemiological surveillance.
