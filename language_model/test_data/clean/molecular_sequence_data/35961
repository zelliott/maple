Secondary structure and antigenicity predictive methods have been applied to the sequences of human and bovine tropoelastins in order to have some insight into the molecular structure of its insoluble counterpart, i.e., elastin. For both tropoelastins, all the predictions yielded 11 major regions, in which the pleated conformation was predominant, separated by 10 strong helical segments of various lengths located within alanyl rich regions of the chains. The overall conformations of human and bovine tropoelastins were estimated to contain 18 +/- 5% alpha-helices, 63 +/- 17% beta-sheets, 13 +/- 13% beta-turns and 6 +/- 6% random coil. For both tropoelastins, antigenicity predictions indicated the presence of seven synthetic decapeptides corresponding to continuous linear epitopes of the molecule. Some of the predicted epitopes are located in the same regions in both species while others are not. These predictions have allowed us to propose an alpha/beta conformation for tropoelastin. Therefore this extracellular matrix macromolecule might be more structured (10 helical segments for about 18% of the overall structure) than previously suggested.
