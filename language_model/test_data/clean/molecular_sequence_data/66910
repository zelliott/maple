Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are important enteropathogens causing severe diseases such as hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome in humans. The majority of STEC strains of serogroups O157, O26, or O111 associated with severe cases of these diseases possess a pathogenicity island termed the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). LEE, which is responsible for the formation of attaching-and-effacing lesions on intestinal epithelial cells, is important for the full virulence of STEC. Nonetheless, LEE-negative STEC strains have repeatedly been reported to be associated with severe diseases in humans. In this study, we characterized adhesion to cultured epithelial cells of certain LEE-negative STEC isolated from humans with or without bloody diarrhea. Several LEE-negative STEC belonging to serogroup O91 showed an unusual, chain-like adhesion pattern to HEp-2 cells. Using Tn5-based transposon mutagenesis, we identified the gene essential for the chain-like adhesion phenotype of this O91 STEC strain. Sequence analysis of the Tn5-inserted allele identified a novel chromosomal open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide with a high degree of similarity to the E. coli immunoglobulin-binding (Eib) proteins EibA, -C, -D, -E, and -F. Therefore, the ORF was designated EibG. Laboratory E. coli strain MC4100 transformed with a multicopy plasmid carrying eibG showed chain-like adhesion to HEp-2 cells, and whole-cell lysates of the strain bound to human-derived immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc and IgA. These results indicate that EibG acts as an IgG Fc- and IgA-binding protein, as well as an adhesin of LEE-negative STEC.
