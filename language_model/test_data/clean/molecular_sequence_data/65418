Processing of DNA replication and repair intermediates is a critical aspect of genome stability maintenance. The coordinated action of RecQ-like helicases with structure-specific nucleases such as Flap Endonuclease 1 plays an important role in the processing of certain DNA structures associated with the replication fork, DNA repair, or telomeres. We will summarize our current understanding of how and in what context these interactions take place, with a particular emphasis on the mechanisms of RecQ helicases in processing of key DNA replication and repair intermediates by their protein interactions with FEN-1 and related structure-specific nucleases.
