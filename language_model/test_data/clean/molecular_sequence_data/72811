In 180 unrelated Japanese individuals 18 examples of allele 27 were detected at the locus D1S80 (MCT118). On 6% polylacrylamide gels 5 out of these 18 alleles were found to migrate between allele 26 and allele 27, but closer to allele 27, and thus were labelled variants of allele 27. All 18 examples of allele 27 were sequenced and the results were compared. Although all had the same number of base pairs (578 bp) the five variants could be subdivided into three types. V1, V2 and V3. The variants and the standard allele were composed of the same kinds of repeat units, but the order of arrangement was different. We investigated whether it was possible to distinguish the standard allele 27, and the variants V1, V2, and V3 by PCR-RFLP. EcoRII and MspI which have restriction sites within the repeat units were adopted as restriction enzymes. The variants could be discriminated from each other after treatment of the PCR fragments with EcoRII or MspI, followed by PAG electrophoresis.
