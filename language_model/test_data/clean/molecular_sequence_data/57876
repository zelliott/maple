Strains of a new type of slowly growing scotochromogenic, rose-pink-pigmented mycobacterium were isolated repeatedly from sphagnum vegetation, true moss, and soil in Ireland. These strains grew at 22, 31, and 37 degrees C but not at 45 degrees C and possessed acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase activities. They reduced nitrate, tolerated 0.1% NaNO2, did not split amides, and were resistant to most of the antituberculous drugs tested, except ethambutol. They did not form acid from glucose and mannose. Their internal phenetic similarity was 97.08% +/- 2.07%. The whole mycolate pattern confirmed the homogeneity of the taxa sharing similar mycolate types with several other mycobacterial species. However, on the basis of the nature of the major pyrolysis esters, the taxon appeared unique. The phylogenetic analysis based on evolutionary distance values revealed that the strains belong to a new species of slowly growing mycobacteria. The DNA-DNA hybridization values confirmed that these strains differ significantly from Mycobacterium nonchromogenicum, M. terrae, M. triviale, and M. thermoresistibile. The strains produced a unique rose-pink pigment and were nonpathogenic for mice, guinea pigs, and rabbits, but they provoked a nonspecific hypersensitivity reaction to bovine tuberculin in guinea pigs and cattle. Hence, they are considered a member of a new species of nonpathogenic slowly growing mycobacteria, for which the name Mycobacterium hiberniae is proposed. Strain Hi 11 is the type strain, a culture of which has been deposited in the American Type Culture Collection as strain ATCC 49874.
