NK cells can recognize and destroy a broad range of cells, including many tumor cells and virally infected cells, yet spare most normal cells. Identification of the target structure recognized by these cells has proved elusive. An attractive hypothesis is that, unlike B cells and T cells that recognize a specific foreign marker, NK cells respond to the absence of a "self" marker. Class I MHC molecules have been implicated as the self markers whose absence can trigger lysis. We show here that normal cells are lysed on incubation with IL-2-activated NK cells if peptides that can bind to the class I MHC molecules of the normal cells are also included in the assay, and speculate that this binding is somehow removing a self marker that normally protects a cell from lysis. NK cells were derived from splenocytes of young (5 to 8 wk old) athymic nude BALB/c (H-2d) or nude C57Bl/6 (H-2b) mice incubated with 1000 U/ml rIL-2, and target cells were derived from splenocytes of normal BALB/c or C57Bl/6 mice incubated with Con A. Peptides were from xenogeneic, viral, self, and mutated self protein sequences and included sequences specific for Kd, Kb, Db, and Ld. All peptides increased lysability of those targets to which they could bind.
