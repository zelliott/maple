This study investigated features and clinical implications of HBV mutations in patients with different clinical manifestations. In total, 516 patients were enrolled in this study, including 131 patients with acute hepatitis B, 239 patients with chronic hepatitis B, and 146 patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. HBV genotypes and mutations were analyzed by direct sequencing of complete viral genomes. Genotypes B2, C1, C2, and D1 accounted for 22.2%, 1.6%, 74.6%, and 1.6%, respectively. Genotype B was more frequently detected in patients with acute hepatitis B than those with chronic hepatitis B and acute-on-chronic liver failure. Deletion mutations were detected mostly in preS1 and preS2 regions and the detection rates were 3.8%, 19.7%, and 24.7% for acute hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis B and acute-on-chronic liver failure patients, respectively. Incidences of point mutation T53C (preS1F53L), G1613A (polR841K), G1775A and A1762T + G1764A in the basal core promoter region, G1896A and G1899A in precore region and A2189C (coreI97L) in core region increased along with acute hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis B, and acute-on-chronic liver failure. The mutation G1896A was independently associated with poor survival of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. The gradual increase of viral mutation incidences was also observed in three HLA-A2-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes from HLA-A2-positive patients, that is env188-196 (5.8%, 10.1%, 22.5%), core107-115 (4.3%, 4.6%, 19.7%), and x92-100 (1.4%, 20.2%, 33.8%). In conclusion, certain viral mutations in various regions of HBV genome are associated with disease progression of HBV infection.
