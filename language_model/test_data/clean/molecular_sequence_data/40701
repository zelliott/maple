The red ant, Myrmica rubra, is an increasingly invasive pest species in north-eastern USA, where it is known as the European fire ant. During surveys for natural enemies in part of its native range in the UK, three previously unreported fungal pathogens developed on ants when incubated in the laboratory. These are described and illustrated: Paraisaria myrmicarum sp. nov., Hirsutella stilbelliformis var. myrmicarum var. nov., and Hirsutella subramanianii var. myrmicarum var. nov. Based on analyses of the protein coding region EF-1α and LSU rDNA, all three described taxa are shown to be affiliated with the hypocrealean family Ophiocordycipitaceae. The implications for the management of M. rubra in its exotic North American range using classical biological control are discussed.
