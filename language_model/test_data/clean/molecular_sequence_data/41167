A group of nine Gram-negative staining, facultatively anaerobic bacterial strains isolated from native oak trees displaying symptoms of acute oak decline (AOD) in the UK were investigated using a polyphasic approach. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that these isolates form a distinct lineage within the genus Brenneria, family Enterobacteriaceae, and are most closely related to Brenneria rubrifaciens (97.6 % sequence similarity to the type strain). Multilocus sequence analysis based on four housekeeping genes (gyrB, rpoB, infB and atpD) confirmed their position within the genus Brenneria, while DNA-DNA hybridization indicated that the isolates belong to a single taxon. The isolates can be differentiated phenotypically from their closest phylogenetic neighbours. The phylogenetic and phenotypic data demonstrate that these isolates from oak with symptoms of AOD represent a novel species in the genus Brenneria, for which the name Brenneria goodwinii sp. nov. (type strain FRB 141(T)  = R-43656(T)  = BCC 845(T)  = LMG 26270(T)  = NCPPB 4484(T)) is proposed.
