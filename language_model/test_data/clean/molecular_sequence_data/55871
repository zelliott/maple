The lipoxygenase activity from cucumber cotyledons grown with their embryonic axis was separated into two fractions having M(r)s of 90,000 and 96,000, respectively, by hydrophobic chromatography. However, from de-embryonated cucumber cotyledons, only one form of lipoxygenase having a M(r) of 90,000 was purified. The three lipoxygenases could not be distinguished from each other either immunologically or by their enzymatic properties. Furthermore, peptide maps of the 90,000 and 96,000-lipoxygenases were identical. In a crude homogenate of cucumber cotyledons, the 96,000-lipoxygenase was rapidly degraded to the 90,000-form. Thus, it was inferred that the 90,000-lipoxygenase was probably the 96,000-form which had lost a peptide fragment of 6,000. It is suggested that there is a specific proteolytic activity for the degradation of 96,000-lipoxygenase. Estimation of changes in the proteolytic activity during seedling growth suggests that the activity at least partly contributes to the rapid in vivo degradation of cucumber cotyledon lipoxygenase.
