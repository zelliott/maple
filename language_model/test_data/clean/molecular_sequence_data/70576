A fibrinogenase (Ba100) with an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa under non-reducing conditions and a pI of 5.4 was purified from the venom of the African puff adder (Bitis arietans) by fibrinogen affinity chromatography. Under reducing conditions the protease dissociates into subunits of 21 kDa and 16 kDa. N-Terminal amino acid sequencing showed these two chains to have 66.7% homology and homology to C-type lectins. The fibrinogenase activity of Ba100 cleaves the Aalpha and Bbeta chain of fibrinogen rendering the molecule unable to polymerise into fibrin clots. Ba100 inhibited platelet aggregation in platelet rich plasma, and clot formation in whole blood, in a concentration dependent manner.
