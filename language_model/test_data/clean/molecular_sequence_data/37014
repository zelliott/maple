The syntheses are described of 2,3-di-O-glycosyl derivatives of methyl alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (1-5) and alpha-D-mannopyranoside (6-9). [formula: see text] [table: see text] The deviation from additivity in 13C NMR spectra calculated for 1-9 were similar for stereochemically related trisaccharides.
