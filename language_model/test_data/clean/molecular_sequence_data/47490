Mammalian RNA polymerase II complexes and coactivators containing homologs of yeast Srb/Med proteins have been isolated recently from tissue culture cells. The yeast Srb/Med complex is involved in global gene expression and is essential, but it is not yet known if its mammalian counterparts are broadly expressed in tissues or if they are essential. We have isolated the murine gene encoding Srb7, an Srb/Med complex protein whose sequence and function is highly conserved between yeast and humans. The mouse Srb7 gene is single copy, and Northern analysis showed that it is expressed in all tissues examined. Disruption of the gene in embryonic stem cells revealed that it is essential for cell viability and murine embryonic development. These results, together with evidence that murine Srb7 is associated exclusively with high molecular weight forms of RNA polymerase II in extracts, suggest that Srb7-containing polymerase complexes occur in most tissues and have essential roles in expression of protein coding genes.
