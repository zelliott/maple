The hydration of oleic acid into 10-hydroxystearic acid was originally described for a Pseudomonas cell extract almost half a century ago. In the intervening years, the enzyme has never been characterized in any detail. We report here the isolation and characterization of oleate hydratase (EC 4.2.1.53) from Elizabethkingia meningoseptica.
