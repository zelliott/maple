Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) controls a wide range of biological functions by regulating the cellular proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation. A growing body of preclinical data demonstrated that deregulation of the FGFR signalling through genetic modification was observed in various types of cancers. However, the extent to which genetic modifications interfere with gene regulation and their involvement in cancer susceptibility remains largely unknown. In this work, we performed in silico profiling of harmful non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the protein kinase domain of FGFR2. Tolerance index, position-specific independent count score, change in free energy score (ΔΔG), Eris and FoldX indicated that seven mutations were found to be deleterious and may alter the protein function and structure. Furthermore, based on physico-chemical properties, two mutations K659N and R747H were found to be most deleterious in protein kinase domain and taken for further structural analysis. Docking study showed a complete loss of binding affinity followed by interference in hydrogen bonding and surrounding residues due to K659N and R747H mutations. In order to elucidate the mechanism behind the impact of mutation that can generate a ripple effect throughout the protein structure and ultimately affect the function, in-depth molecular dynamics simulation and principal component analysis were performed. The obtained results indicate that K659N and R747H mutations have a distinct effect on the dynamic behaviour of FGFR2 protein. Our strategy may be helpful for understanding SNP effects on proteins with function and their role in human genetic diseases and for the development of novel pharmacological strategies.
