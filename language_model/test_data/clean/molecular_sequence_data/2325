The promoter region for transcription of the 3.6-kilobase mRNA of hepatitis B virus was identified by the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay by using HuH-7 hepatoma cells and was found to function directly in virus production by way of the transient expression system of HBV. The 5'-upstream sequence from nucleotides 1573 to 1657 (the transcription start site) was indispensable for promoter function, while the AT-rich sequence (from nucleotides 1581 to 1604) containing a directly repeated sequence TGTT connecting the same flanking sequence PyAAAGAC (where Py is a pyrimidine) at both sides was an essential element within this promoter region. A specific cellular factor which interacted with the essential element was detected in the HuH-7 cell extract. A similar binding factor was also observed in HepG2 and huH2-2 hepatoma cells. This factor may thus be responsible for regulating 3.6-kilobase mRNA, pregenome RNA transcription, or both.
