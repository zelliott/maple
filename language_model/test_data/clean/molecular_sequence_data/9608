1. This study set out to examine the endothelin receptor subtypes mediating vasoconstriction in the rat renal arcuate artery. This was done in isolated vessels 120-200 microns in diameter, incubated with a selective agonist and the novel 'antisense' peptide to part of the human endothelinA receptor. 2. Groups of vessels (n = 6) were incubated with increasing concentrations of endothelin-1 (ET-1), from 1 to 100 nM, which caused a 65% maximal contraction at the highest dose with an pEC50 of 8.16 +/- 0.11 M. By contrast, in six other vessels sarafotoxin 6c over the same dose range gave a minimal contraction (around 5% of maximum). 3. Preincubation of six vessels with the antisense peptide ETR p1/f1 at 1 microM had no effect on the ET-1 induced vasoconstriction, in terms of displacement of the concentration-response curve or the maximal tension achieved by the agonist. In the six vessels exposed to 4 microM ETR p1/f1, there was a significant shift of the concentration-response curve and a lower pEC50 at 7.78 +/- 0.09 M (P < 0.05). At the highest concentrations of ETR p1/f1, there was a marked suppression of all responses to ET-1, which at the maximal concentrations tested, 0.1 microM, only reached some 10% of the maximal achievable contraction. 4. Increasing ET-1 concentrations up to 2 microM in vessels incubated with 40 microM ETR-p1/f1 showed that the blockade could be overcome and that the relationship was shifted to the right (P < 0.001) by approximately one log unit with a pEC50 of 7.13 +/- 0.11 M. A Schild plot of the data indicated the antagonist to be acting competitively at a single population of receptors. 5. At the highest concentrations tested, 40 microM, ETR-p1/f1 had no effect on noradrenaline-induced contractions, indicating a lack of non-specific actions. 6. Together, these data suggest that at the rat renal arcuate artery the endothelinA receptor is the predominant functional receptor mediating contraction. Furthermore, this study has shown the potential usefulness of this novel type of 'antisense' peptide in blocking receptor activation.
