Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), that can amplify a fragment of the DNA-polymerase gene of 4 herpes viruses, i.e. herpes simplex viruses, type 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex viruses, type 2 (HSV-2), Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus, was made use of to study the genetic polymorphism of HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains. The obtained amplicons were analyzed by the method of restriction-size fragments' polymorphism (RSFP) with restrictases Rsal, Taql and Hinfl. Four HSV-1 strains had an identical restriction profile. Strain G (HSV-2) also displayed the expected restriction profiles, however, contradictory results were obtained for strain BH (HSV-2): the restriction profiles with restrictases Hinfl and Rsal corresponded to HSV-2, and the restriction profile with Taql corresponded to HSV-1. The sequencing of appropriate fragments of strains G and BH revealed a dot-type mutation localized in Taql restriction site. The thus worked out PCR was used jointly with RSFP in the genotyping of 75 urogenital samples obtained from women with genital herpes who were treated at Moscow patient-care facilities. HSV-1 and HSV-2 were detected in 18 (24%) and 57 (76%) of samples, respectively. No changes were registered in the restriction profile for HSV-2 among the investigated samples and all of them had the restriction profile similar to that of strain G. The conclusion is that genital herpes associated with HSV-2 is genetically stable within its Moscow population.
