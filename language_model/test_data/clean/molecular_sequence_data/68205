Threonine 246 is an active site residue that is conserved in all known L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; EC 1.1.1.27) sequences. In order to investigate the role of Thr246 in Bacillus stearothermophilus LDH, this residue was altered by site-directed mutagenesis to valine, alanine, leucine, and serine, respectively. The effects of these mutations, as observed in both steady-state and single-turnover kinetic measurements with different substrates, demonstrated the importance for catalysis of a hydroxyl group in the 246 amino acid residue. In contrast, no significant contribution of the OH group of Thr246 to productive pyruvate binding was observed. Instead, it is proposed that the role of Thr246 may be to facilitate hydride transfer from the nicotinamide ring of the NADH cofactor to the pyruvate carbonyl group.
