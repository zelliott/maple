Leucine-rich glioma inactivated 3 (LGI3) is a member of LGI/epitempin family of which the first member, LGI1/epitempin, was shown to be mutated in glioma and autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy. Similar to LGI1, LGI3 is expressed predominantly in brain and its function is unknown. In this study, we examined the expression of mouse LGI3 (mLGI3) in adult and developing brain and analyzed the 5'-upstream transcriptional regulatory regions of mLGI3 gene. In situ hybridization showed that mLGI3 was expressed in widespread areas with selective regional variation in adult brain. In developing brain, mLGI3 mRNA was expressed at low level during embryo stages and markedly increased in broad areas after birth. Analysis of the 5'- and 3'-ends of mLGI3 mRNA identified a single transcription start site and two alternative 3'-ends. Luciferase reporter analysis using Neuro-2a cells and electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified a neuronal restrictive silencer element (NRSE; -2573 approximately -2553) and a phorbol ester-sensitive AP-2 element with repressor activity (-44 approximately -33) among multiple positive and negative regulatory regions. Since NRSE and AP-2 are implicated in neuron-specific gene expression and developmental regulation of many genes in brain, respectively, these results suggested that NRSE and AP-2 might play important roles in regulation of mLGI3 expression in brain.
