During the course for the studies of thymosin beta 4 and prothymosin alpha from porcine thymus, a new analog of thymosin beta 4 has been identified. This peptide consists of 41 amino acid residues. The amino terminus is blocked by an acetyl group as revealed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometric analysis. Amino acid sequence studies disclosed that this peptide is identical to bovine thymosin beta 9 except that leucine at position 6 in beta 9 is substituted by methionine. Thus, this new peptide has been termed thymosin beta 9 Met. The recoveries of beta 9 Met, beta 4, and prothymosin alpha in porcine tissues have been determined (in micrograms/g tissue) as follows: thymus (43, 85, 133); spleen (68, 203, 37); liver (10, 31, 27); heart (1.5, 10, 0); kidney (5, 51, 37); brain (0.8, 31, 5). Biologically, thymosin beta 9 Met was found to be more active than beta 4 in enhancing gamma-interferon production in cord blood lymphocytes. However, beta 4 appeared to stimulate higher amounts of interleukin 2 and tumor necrotic factor. The significance for the coexistence of two homologous peptides with similar functions in the thymus and a number of other organs is not clear, and deserves further investigation.
