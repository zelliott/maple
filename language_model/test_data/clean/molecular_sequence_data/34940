Gene 17 product (gp17) of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa-infecting bacteriophage phiKMV shows in silico similarity to T7 DNA ligase. In a semi-quantitative activity assay, it is shown that gp17 is a functional, ATP-dependent DNA ligase, in spite of some structural differences related to DNA-binding properties). Enzymatic activity of His6-based purified expression product was optimised (4 degrees C at 24h for sticky end double-stranded DNA fragments) and estimated at 0.5 Weiss U/microg.
