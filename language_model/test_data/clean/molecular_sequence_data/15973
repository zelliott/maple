We describe the structure of the promoter and intron 1 of the human and rat tyrosine hydroxylase genes. The 5' flanking region of the two genes are 74% identical (+1 to -380) and contain a completely conserved cAMP response element. Although both genes are single copy, multiple splicing events of the human transcript lead to multiple mRNAs. Based on several lines of evidence alternative forms of mRNA of rat TH analogous to those in the human are not present. Both rat and human promoters direct the transcription of reporter genes when introduced into rat pheochromocytoma and fibroblast cells.
