The female of Phlebotomus (Anaphlebotomus) fertei Depaquit, Léger & Robert, 2002 is described from Madagascar. The spermathecae have separated ducts, a body with an enlarged-sclerified dilatation and a deriviated large bladder with thin walls and long head. P. fertei female has the following characters: long antennal segments, pharyngeal armature with small teeth and cibarium with 15 to 30 denticles, and very long legs. Its remarkable spermatheca is closely related to that of P. berentiensis. The status of P. (Anaphlebotomus) berentiensis (Léger & Rodhain, 1978) is revised into this paper. The female is redescribed and the male is described for the first time. The latter has an unusual antennal formula (2/III-XII), a cibarium with four teeth and about 30 denticles, no tuft of setae on the coxite, four spines on the style, including a very long proximal one. Males and females were linked to each other based on morphological and molecular characteristics (second internal transcribed spacer of the ribosomal DNA and ND4 gene of the mitochondrial DNA). The inclusion of these taxa into the subgenus Anaphlebotomus Theodor, 1948 is exclusively based on male characters as listed by Theodor (style with four spines, no basal lobe on the coxite, paramere with two or three branches). The very heterogeneous characters of the females do not allow their use for the definition of this subgenus, which is probably not homogeneous.
