Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is characterized by the failure of activated phagocytes to generate superoxide. Defects in at least four different genes lead to CGD. Patients with the X-linked form of CGD have mutations in the gene for the beta-subunit of cytochrome b558 (gp91-phox). Patients with a rare autosomal recessive form of CGD have mutations in the gene for the alpha-subunit of this cytochrome (p22-phox). Usually, this leads to the absence of cytochrome b558 in the phagocytes (A22(0) CGD). We studied the molecular defect in five European patients from three unrelated families with this type of CGD. P22-phox mRNA was reverse-transcribed, and the coding region was amplified by PCR in one fragment and sequenced. Three patients from one family, with parents that were first cousins, were homozygous for a single base substitution (G-297-->A) resulting in a nonconservative amino acid change (Arg-90-->Gln). This mutation was previously found in a compound heterozygote A22(0) CGD patient. Another patient, also from first-cousin parents, was homozygous for an A-309-->G mutation in the open reading frame that predicts a nonconservative amino acid replacement (His-94-->Arg). The fifth patient was also born from a first-cousin marriage and was shown to be homozygous for the absence of exon 4 from the cDNA. In this patient, a G-->A substitution was found at position 1 of intron 4 in the genomic DNA. Therefore, the absence of exon 4 in the cDNA of this patient is due to a splicing error.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
