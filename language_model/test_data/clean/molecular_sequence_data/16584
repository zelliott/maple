The Gram-negative iron-oxidizing bacterium Leptospirillum ferrooxidans contains all genes necessary for nitrogen fixation, from genes encoding the Mo-Fe nitrogenase, the specific regulator (nifA), global regulators like glnB and ntrC like genes, to other sensors and transport systems somehow related to nitrogen assimilation. We review current knowledge about the nif regulon and its connection with other metabolic functions in L. ferrooxidans.
