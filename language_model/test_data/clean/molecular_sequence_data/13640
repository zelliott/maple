Genital human papillomaviruses (HPV) were detected by PCR using L1 consensus primers MY09 and MY11. To determine the underlying HPV type(s). PCR products were subsequently analyzed employing a combination of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and hybridization with a generic oligonucleotide probe that binds to a conserved region located close to the MY11-binding site within the PCR products. Using computer-assisted sequence analysis, the lengths of the corresponding BamHI, DdeI, HaeIII, HinfI and PstI restriction fragments hybridizing with the generic probe were calculated, revealing distinct patterns for each of the 45 mucosal HPV types. This method is superior to RFLP analysis since it is not impaired by large amounts of restriction fragments resulting from nonspecific PCR products. Moreover, considering clinical specimens containing two or three different HPV types, direct sequencing of PCR products will be inconclusive, and the increased number of restriction fragments will complicate interpretation of RFLP patterns. Subsequent hybridization with the generic probe, however, results in the appearance of, at most, 2 or 3 bands per restriction enzyme digest and thus facilitates identification of the underlying HPV types.
