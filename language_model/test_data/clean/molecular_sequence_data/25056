Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health problem. There is an intense effort to identify correlates of protective immunity and to design new TB vaccines. CD8 T cells are thought to play a significant role in controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Relatively little has been published about the antigens and epitopes targeted by mycobacteria-specific CD8 T cells. Here we present an update of our 1999 overview of human CD8 T cell epitopes in mycobacterial antigens and discuss related issues relevant to TB diagnosis and vaccine development.
