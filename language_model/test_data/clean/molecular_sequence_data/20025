During the preparation of recombinant derivatives of the CAN97-83 clinical isolate of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), consensus nucleotide sequencing of the recovered RNA genomes provided evidence of frequent sequence heterogeneity at a number of genome positions. This heterogeneity was suggestive of sizable subpopulations containing mutations. An analysis of molecularly cloned cDNAs confirmed the presence of mixed populations. The biologically derived virus on which the recombinant system is based also contained sizeable mutant subpopulations, whose presence was confirmed by biological cloning and nucleotide sequencing. Most of the mutations occurred in the SH gene. For example, partial consensus sequencing of 40 independent preparations of recombinant HMPV (wild-type and various derivatives) showed that 31 of these preparations contained a total of 41 instances of small insertions in the SH gene and a total of five small insertions elsewhere. In each of these 31 preparations, there was at least one insert in SH that changed the reading frame and would yield a truncated protein. Nearly all of these insertions involved adding one or more A residues to various tracks of four or more A residues, with the most frequent site being a tract of seven A residues. There were also two instances of nucleotide deletions and numerous instances of nucleotide substitution point mutations, mostly in the SH gene. The occurrence of mutant subpopulations was greatly reduced by the replacement of the SH gene with a synthetic version in which these oligonucleotide tracts were eliminated by silent nucleotide changes. We suggest that we frequently detected subpopulations in which the expression of full-length SH protein was ablated because it provided a modest selective advantage to this clinical isolate in vitro. Adaptation involving the functional loss of a gene is unusual for an RNA virus.
