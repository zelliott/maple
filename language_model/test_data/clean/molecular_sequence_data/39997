The leading eigenvalue of the matrix associated with a DNA sequence as a important invariant is effectively used in analysis of DNA sequences. Here, we propose a new invariant base on the 2DD-Curves of DNA sequences which is simple for calculation. We can use it as an alternative invariant to characterize the DNA sequence. The utility of the new parameter is illustrated on the DNA sequences of 11 species.
