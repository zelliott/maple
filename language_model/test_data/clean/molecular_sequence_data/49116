We found in the environmental strain Nitrosomonas europaea a chromosomal integron-like structure with an integrase gene, intI(Neu). We have tested the capacity of the IntINeu integrase to excise and integrate several resistance gene cassettes. The results allow us to consider IntINeu a new functional integron integrase.
