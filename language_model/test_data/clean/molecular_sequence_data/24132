LIM protein cDNA, from Bombyx mori that contains an open reading frame of 622 bp encoding 94 amino acids, was identified and characterized. The B. mori LIM protein homologue is classified into group 2 LIM proteins that contain glycine-rich LIM domain. B. mori LIM protein mRNA is up-regulated at late embryogenesis and detected in the mid-gut of 5th instar larvae.
