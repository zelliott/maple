Blastocystis hominis is a protozoan parasite found in humans. B. hominis-like organisms have been found in a variety of animals, but have been called Blastocystis sp. because the isolates from animals were indistinguishable from B. hominis morphologically. Recent molecular studies show that some isolates from animals have genetic similarity with B. hominis. However, it has been unclear whether the isolates from animals have zoonotic potential or not. In the present study, the SSUrDNA of 19 Blastocystis isolates from these animals was sequenced in its entirety, and the phylogenetic relationship among isolates from humans and animals was clarified using available nucleotide sequences of the same locus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 19 isolates analyzed in the present study could be classified into seven groups (I-VII): Group I consisted of the isolates from humans, primates, cattle, pigs and birds; Group II of the isolates from humans and primates; Group III of the isolates from humans, cattle and pigs; Group IV of the isolates from primates, birds and rodents; Group V of the isolates from cattle and pigs; Groups VI and VII of the isolates from humans and birds. These results indicate that many of the isolates harboring in animals have zoonotic potential, or have cross-transmissibility among heterogeneous hosts.
