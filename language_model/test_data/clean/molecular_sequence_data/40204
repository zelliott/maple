In the United Kingdom, rabbits have been reported to harbour genotypes of Cryptosporidium (now recognized as C. cuniculus) identical to those from human patients exhibiting symptoms of cryptosporidiosis. The high density of rabbits in many regions of Australia, including both rural and urban as well as natural water catchments areas, and the absence of any information on Cryptosporidium from lagomorphs in this country stimulated the present study. We undertook an epidemiological study that genetically characterized Cryptosporidium from rabbits from four locations in Victoria by PCR-coupled sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of sequence data for loci within the small subunit of nuclear ribosomal RNA (SSU; for specific identification) and the 60kDa glycoprotein gene (gp60; for genotypic/subgenotypic identification). Cryptosporidium was detected in 12 (6.8%) of 176 individual faecal samples. For SSU, all 12 sequences were identical to each other and to that of C. cuniculus. For pgp60, all corresponding sequences matched the known genotype Vb, and were classified as subgenotype VbA23R3 (n=11) and VbA26R4 (n=1), which are both new records. Present evidence indicates that genotype Vb is limited to rabbits; however, it would be premature to conclude that this genotype is not zoonotic. Future studies should focus on the zoonotic potential of C. cuniculus from rabbits and a wide range of yet unstudied animals.
