Ajmaline is a widely used antiarrhythmic drug. Its action on voltage-gated ion channels in skeletal muscle is not well documented and we have here elucidated its effects on Na(+) and K(+) channels.

Sodium (I(Na)) and potassium (I(K)) currents in amphibian skeletal muscle fibres were recorded using 'loose-patch' and two-microelectrode voltage clamp techniques (2-MVC). Action potentials were generated using current clamp.

Under 'loose patch' clamp conditions, the IC(50) for I(Na) was 23.2 microM with Hill-coefficient h=1.21. For I(K), IC(50) was 9.2 microM, h=0.87. Clinically relevant ajmaline concentrations (1-3 microM) reduced peak I(Na) by approximately 5% but outward I(K) values were reduced by approximately 20%. Na(+) channel steady-state activation and fast inactivation were concentration-dependently shifted towards hyperpolarized potentials ( approximately 10 mV at 25 microM). Inactivation curves were markedly flattened by ajmaline. Peak-I(K) under maintained depolarisation was reduced to approximately 30% of control values by 100 microM ajmaline. I(K) activation time constants were increased at least two-fold. Lower concentrations (10 or 25 microM) reduced steady-state-I(K) slightly but peak-I(K) significantly. Action potential generation threshold was increased by 10 microM ajmaline and repolarisation prolonged.

Ajmaline acts differentially on Na(+) and K(+) channels in skeletal muscle. This suggests at least multiple sites of action including the S4 subunit. Our data may provide a first insight into specific mechanisms of ajmaline-ion channel interaction in tissues other than cardiac muscle and could suggest possible side-effects that need to be further evaluated.
