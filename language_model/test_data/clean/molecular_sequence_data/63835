Ms8xRf3 is a genetically modified rapeseed hybrid which is widely cultivated in Canada and exported to some other countries for production of foodstuffs or fodder. In this study, the genomic sequences flanking the right borders of the integrated transgenic sequences in the Ms8xRf3 genome were characterized and showed high similarities with the bacterial artificial chromosome clone of Chinese cabbage. Event-specific qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods were established with the primers and probes targeting the junction regions to produce a 123 base pair (bp) product for the Ms8 event and 92 bp for the Rf3 event. The absolute detection limit of qualitative PCR was 2.5 initial template copies for the Ms8 event and 50 copies for the Rf3 event. Quantitiative detection methods were established, with the absolute quantification limit being approximately 25 initial template copies.
