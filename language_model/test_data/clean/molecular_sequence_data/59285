Acetyl LDL (modified low-density lipoprotein), which is thought to be taken up through scavenger receptor A (SR-A), rapidly induced the appearance of phosphotyrosine proteins in monocytic THP-1-derived macrophages in vitro. The two alternative forms of Lyn (p53 and p56) were found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated within 30 s after the stimulation with acetyl LDL. The catalytic activity of Lyn measured by an in vitro kinase assay had also increased in acetyl LDL-stimulated THP-1-derived macrophages. Furthermore, Lyn could be co-immunoprecipitated with SR-A from the cell lysate. These observations suggest a functional and possible physical association of SR-A with Lyn in THP-1-derived macrophages, and also imply a possible involvement of Lyn in SR-A signal transduction.
