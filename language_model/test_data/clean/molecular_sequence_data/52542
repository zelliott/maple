A full-length cDNA encoding a SUMO-1-specific protease, named SUSP1, was identified and cloned for the first time from the human brain. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cDNA containing an open reading frame of 3336 base pairs revealed that the protease consists of 1112 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 126,116 Da. Like yeast Ulp1, SUSP1 is a cysteine protease containing the well conserved His/Asp/Cys catalytic triad. SUSP1 expressed in Escherichia coli cells efficiently released SUMO-1 from SUMO-1. beta-galactosidase fusion but not from other ubiquitin-like protein fusions, including Smt3.beta-galactosidase, suggesting its role in the generation of matured SUMO-1 specifically from its precursors. Interestingly, reproductive organs, such as testis, ovary, and prostate, contained much higher amounts of SUSP1 mRNA than colon and peripheral blood leukocyte, whereas other tissues, such as heart and spleen, had little or none. In addition, confocal microscopy using green fluorescent protein.SUSP1 fusion showed that SUSP1 is exclusively localized to the cytoplasm of NIH3T3 and HeLa cells. These results suggest that SUSP1 may play a role in the regulation of SUMO-1-mediated cellular processes particularly related to reproduction.
