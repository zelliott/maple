It is of fundamental importance to use an appropriate adjuvant to generate a potent immune response for immunotherapy. In this study, we had a comparative investigation on the effectiveness of two adjuvant formulations, liposome-polycation-DNA (LPD) and monophosphoryl lipid A(MPL) in combination with a truncated peptide of bFGF(tbFGF) as antigen. LPD/tbFGF induced continuously increasing antibodies expression during the whole immunization period. In contrast, the level of antibodies was variable in MPL/tbFGF-immunized mice, MPL/tbFGF elicited potent antibodies response in the early-phase of immunization (during the first 3 immunizations), but the later immunizations did not produce a significant increase in the level of antibodies. Evaluation of IFN-γ and IL-4 responses revealed that both LPD/tbFGF and MPL/tbFGF demonstrated generation of higher level of IFN-γ, whereas no significant increase in IL-4 levels was detected in the two groups. In addition, histological analysis exhibited obvious germinal centers in the spleen tissues of LPD/tbFGF mice. The data suggested that LPD would be a promising long-effective adjuvant due to its potent and persistent immunostimulation and MPL could play an appropriate role in short-acting immunization.
