Helicases are molecular motors known to unwind double-stranded DNA. In a recent issue of Molecular Cell, Fan et al. (2006) revealed the core structure of XPB helicase, a component of transcription factor IIH, and proposed a mechanism for its dual role in transcription and nucleotide excision repair.
