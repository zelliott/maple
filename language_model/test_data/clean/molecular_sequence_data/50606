Helper component (HC-Pro) is a virus-encoded nonstructural protein required for aphid transmission of potyviruses. In the tobacco vein mottling virus (TVMV) polyprotein, HC-Pro represents a 457 residue polypeptide from amino acid position 257 to 713. Previous sequence comparison studies have suggested that mutations of one or two specific amino acid residues in the HC-Pro protein might result in loss of aphid transmission activity. To test this hypothesis, the initial targets were the residues corresponding to these specific amino acids, a lys to glu change and an ile to val change at amino acid positions 307 and 482, respectively, of the TVMV polyprotein, as well as the combination of the two. Two additional mutations within the HC-Pro representing dipeptide changes thr-ser to ile-asp and thr-ala to leu-glu at amino acid positions (283/284) and (368/369), respectively, were also tested to further define the effects of mutations in this region on helper component activity. The mutations at positions 482 and (368/369) had no effect on aphid transmission activity, while mutation at position 307 completely abolished the activity. Except for the 482 mutation, all the mutations also affected symptomatology and virus accumulation in infected plants. Due to the very low concentrations of HC-Pro in plants infected with the (283/284) mutant, the effect of this dipeptide change on aphid transmission activity could not be assessed. The majority of the tested mutations fall within a putative zinc-finger motif postulated in the cysteine-rich N-terminus of HC-Pro. The possible role of this motif in the potyviruses is further discussed in the light of our present results with TVMV.
