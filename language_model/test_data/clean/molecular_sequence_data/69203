Desulfoferrodoxin from Desulfovibrio vulgaris, strain Hildenborough, is a homodimer of 28 kDa; it contains two Fe atoms per 14.0 kDa subunit. The N-terminal amino-acid sequence is homogeneous and corresponds to the previously described Rho gene, which encodes a highly charged 14 kDa polypeptide without a leader sequence. Although one of the two iron centers, FeA, has previously been described as a 'strained rubredoxin-like' site, EPR of the ferric form proves very similar to that of the pentagonal bipyramidally coordinated iron in ferric complexes of DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid: both systems have spin S = 5/2 and rhombicity E/D = 0.08. Unlike the Fe site in rubredoxin the FeA site in desulfoferrodoxin has a pH dependent midpoint potential with pKox = 9.2 and pKred = 5.3. Upon reduction (Em,7.5 = +2 mV) FeA exhibits an unusually sharp S = 2 resonance in parallel-mode EPR. The second iron, FeB, has S = 5/2 and E/D = 0.33; upon reduction (Em,7.5 = +90 mV) FeB turns EPR-silent.
