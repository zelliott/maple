To develop an attenuated vaccine against the highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (HP-PRRS) virus, the HP-PRRS virus strain TJ was attenuated by serial passages and plaque cloned every 5 to 10 passages in Marc-145 cells. Genetic variation and pathogenicity of HP-PRRSV strain TJ in the course of attenuation were analyzed. The results showed that the strain TJ sustained various sequence changes during the course of attenuation. Fifty-eight amino acids changes and a new continuous 120 amino acids deletion after the discontinuous 30 amino acids deletion (sites 481 and 533-561) occurred in strain TJ passages 140, and the position of 120 amino acids deletion was between 628 to 747 according to VR-2332. Animal test showed that the pathogenicity of strain TJ passages 20 was attenuated obviously, so we presume that genetic variation in nonstructural protein nsp2-nsp5, nsp7 and structural protein GP5 during the attenuation provides the molecular bases for the observed attenuated phenotype.
