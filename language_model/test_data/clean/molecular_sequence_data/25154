The distribution of d(CT)-rich pyrimidine tracts in the karyotypes of a variety of vertebrates was studied by in situ hybridization. The probe for these studies was a 56bp homopyrimidine/homopurine sequence obtained from a mouse genomic library constructed with DNA prepared from a restriction enzyme digestion of metaphase chromosomes. Single-stranded DNA nuclease digestions and two-dimensional gel analysis of topoisomers of this sequence indicated that it is capable of adopting a triplex conformation in vitro. In situ hybridization with this probe to the karyotypes of ten different vertebrate species revealed a highly conserved chromosomal distribution of d(CT)-rich tracts. These tracts are found throughout the chromosomal arms and in some karyotypes they are clustered, producing a banding pattern. However, at the resolution of the light microscope these tracts appeared to be absent from the centromeric regions of all chromosomes examined except those of chicken. The non-random distribution of these tracts to the chromosomal arm regions implies an organizational or functional role for this repeat class. It is unlikely that the 56 bp sequence type contributed to the formation of the triplex DNA structure previously detected in centromeric domains of mouse.
