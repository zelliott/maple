In this study, we further examined the sequence selectivity of camptothecin in mammalian topoisomerase I cDNA from human and Chinese hamster. In the absence of camptothecin, almost all the bases at the 3'-terminus of cleavage sites are T for calf thymus and wheat germ topoisomerase I. In addition, wheat germ topoisomerase I exhibits preference for C (or not T) at -3 and for T at -2 position. As for camptothecin-stimulated cleavage with topoisomerase I, G (or not T) at +1 is an additional strong preference. This sequence selectivity of camptothecin is similar to that previously found in SV40 DNA, suggesting that camptothecin preferentially interacts with topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage sites where G is the base at the 5'-terminus. These results support the stacking model of camptothecin (Jaxel et al. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 20418-20423). Comparison of calf thymus and wheat germ topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage sites in the presence of camptothecin shows that many major cleavage sites are similar. However, the relative intensities are often different. One of the differences was attributable to a bias at position -3 where calf thymus topoisomerase I prefers G and wheat germ topoisomerase I prefers C. This difference may explain the unique patterns of cleavage sites induced by the two enzymes. Sequencing analysis of camptothecin-stimulated cleavage sites in the surrounding regions of point mutations in topoisomerase I cDNA, which were found in camptothecin-resistant cell lines, reveals no direct relationship between DNA cleavage sites in vitro and mutation sites.
