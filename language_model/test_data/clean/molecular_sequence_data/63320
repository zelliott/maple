Antibody 1E9, which was elicited with a hexachloronorbornene derivative and catalyzes the Diels-Alder reaction between tetrachlorothiophene dioxide and N-ethylmaleimide with high efficiency, was successfully reengineered to bind a range of structurally diverse steroids with nanomolar affinities. Remarkably, two mutations (Leu(H47)Trp/Arg(H100)Trp) out of 36 total sequence differences suffice to switch the selectivity of 1E9 to that of the progesterone-binding antibody DB3. In contrast to the double mutant, which tightly binds multiple steroids with differently configured A-B ring junctions, the individual Leu(H47)Trp and Arg(H100)Trp single mutants both exhibit significantly greater specificity than DB3, preferentially binding 5alpha-pregnan-3beta-ol-20-one (K(d) approximately 5 nM) over other steroids. These findings illustrate how easily differently shaped binding pockets can be created through subtle changes to the same primordial germ line template.
