Among the 21 O-polysaccharide (OPS) O-antigen-based serotypes described for Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, those of O:6 and O:7 are unusual in that both contain colitose (4-keto-3,6-dideoxy-d-mannose or 4-keto-3,6-dideoxy-l-xylo-hexose), which has not otherwise been reported for this species, and the O:6 OPS also contains yersiniose A (4-C[(R)-1-hydroxyethyl]-3,6-dideoxy-d-xylo-hexose), another unusual dideoxyhexose sugar. In Y. pseudotuberculosis, the genes for OPS synthesis generally cluster together between the hemH and gsk loci. Here, we present the sequences of the OPS gene clusters of Y. pseudotuberculosis O:6 and O:7, and the location of the genes required for synthesis of these OPSs, except that there is still ambiguity regarding allocation of some of the glycosyltransferase functions. The O:6 and O:7 gene clusters have much in common with each other, but differ substantially from the group of 13 gene clusters already sequenced, which share several features and sequence similarities. We also present a possible sequence of events for the derivation of the O:6 and O:7 gene clusters from the most closely related set of 13 sequenced previously.
