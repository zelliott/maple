The DNA genome of Mycoplasma genitalium currently represents the smallest of all known human bacterial pathogens. Despite their clinical importance in sexually transmitted infection and relevance as model bacterial pathogens, genomic diversity among M. genitalium strains worldwide is unknown. Herein we present the complete draft genome sequences of four geographically diverse strains of M. genitalium.
