Mutations in canonical transient receptor potential channel 6 (TRPC6) have been identified as responsible for the development of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, a proteinuric disease with steroid resistance and poor prognosis. This study explores the prevalence of TRPC6 variants in Chinese children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS), the genotype/phenotype correlation of TRPC6 variants, the therapeutic response, and the underlying molecular mechanism.

Fifty-one children with sporadic INS were enrolled: 23 steroid-sensitive cases and 28 steroid-resistant cases Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify 13 exons and the promoter sequences of TRPC6 before sequencing. The expression of TRPC6 in renal tissues was illustrated by immunohistochemistry staining. The transcriptional activity of variants in TRPC6 promoter was measured by the luciferase assay.

Three variants (-254C>G, rs3824934; +43C/T, rs3802829; and 240 G>A, rs17096918) were identified. The allele frequency of the -254C>G single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) patients (40.5%) was higher than that in the steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome subjects (27.1%; P = 0.046). The -254C>G SNP enhanced transcription from TRPC6 promoter in vitro and was associated with increased TRPC6 expression in renal tissues of SRNS patients.

-254C>G, a SNP underlying enhanced TRPC6 transcription and expression, may be correlated with the development of steroid resistance in Chinese children with INS.
