(+)-CC-1065 is a biologically potent DNA-reactive antitumor antibiotic produced by Streptomyces zelensis. In a previous study we have reported that (+)-CC-1065 produces bending of DNA that has similarities to that intrinsically associated with A-tracts [Lin, C. H., Sun, D., & Hurley, L. H. (1991) Chem. Res. Toxicol, 4, 21-26]. In this article we provide evidence using a combination of non-denaturing gel analysis, hydroxyl-radical footprinting, and high-field NMR for both distinctions between the two types of bends and the importance of junctions in both types of bends. For A-tracts we demonstrate that the locus of bending is at the center of an A-tract and that upon modification of the 3' adenine with (+)-CC-1065 this locus is moved less than 1 base pair to the 3' side, and the bending magnitude is significantly increased. For drug bonding sequences such as 5'-AGTTA* or 5'-GATTA* (where * denotes the drug bonding site), the locus of bending is found to be between the two thymines, and the bending is focused over a 2-base-pair sequence rather than a 5-base-pair sequence, as is the case for the A-tract. An important distinction between an A-tract intrinsic bend and a (+)-CC-1065-induced bend is the effect of temperature. While, as shown previously, the magnitude of A-tract bending increases with decrease in temperature, for drug-induced bending of 5'-AGTTA* the bending magnitude increases with increased temperature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
