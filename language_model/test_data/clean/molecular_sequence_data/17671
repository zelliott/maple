The expression site for the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) gene of Trypanosoma brucei contains several genes of unknown function (ESAGs, for expression site-associated genes). Among these, ESAG 4 shows homology to eukaryotic adenylate/guanylate cyclase genes, in the region encoding the presumptive enzyme catalytic domain. This gene belongs to a family of related sequences, and hybridizes to the genomic DNA of other trypanosomatids, such as Trypanosoma congolense, Trypanosoma vivax and Trypanosoma mega. While ESAG 4 is transcribed only in bloodstream forms by a RNA polymerase resistant to alpha-amanitin, at least three other members of this family are transcribed in both bloodstream and procyclic forms, by a RNA polymerase sensitive to the drug. These genes encode different putative transmembrane proteins showing high sequence conservation in the region corresponding to the adenylate/guanylate cyclase catalytic domain.
