When the precursor to mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (pmAspAT) is synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system (RRL), its properties are quite unlike those of the purified protein (Mattingly, J.R., Jr., Youssef, J., Iriarte, A., and Martinez-Carrion, M. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 3925-3937). These results suggest that molecular chaperones present in RRL modulate the folding of pmAspAT. To investigate the structural basis for this, we have used protease resistance to monitor the extent of folding for several related AspATs after synthesis in RRL and in wheat germ extract (WGE). In addition to pmAspAT, the following proteins were examined: the mature form of pmAspAT (delta 2-28 pmAspAT), its cytosolic counterpart (cAspAT), a chimeric protein consisting of the presequence of pmAspAT attached to the amino terminus of cAspAT (pcAspAT), and a pmAspAT variant in which the presequence and the amino-terminal domain of the mature enzyme are deleted (delta 2-57 pmAspAT). In RRL, delta 2-28 pmAspAT folds somewhat faster than intact pmAspAT, whereas the truncated delta 2-57 pmAspAT is unable to fold. In contrast, cAspAT and pcAspAT both fold with extreme rapidity. After synthesis in WGE, pmAspAT and delta 2-28 pmAspAT never acquire a protease-resistant conformation, whereas the folding of cAspAT and pcAspAT still occurs rapidly. We conclude that the presequence has only a minor role in determining the folding rate of the pmAspAT mitochondrial precursor protein in RRL or WGE and has no influence on the folding of the homologous cAspAT. Rather, the primary sequence of the mature part of the protein seems to dictate whether or how molecular chaperones regulate folding events.
