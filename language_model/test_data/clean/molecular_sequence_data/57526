Urinary bladder carcinoma often is diagnosed from malignant cells in bladder washings obtained at cystoscopic examination. In some cases, there are difficulties distinguishing between cytologic Grades 1 and 2. Detection of genetic alterations in combination with morphologic analysis may facilitate the diagnosis.

The presence of amplified c-erb-B2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) was examined in tumor cells present in bladder washings. The gene copy number was determined with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

The authors detected amplified c-erb-B2 and EGF-R in cancer cells of cytologic Grade 2 and 3 tumors. They did not detect amplification in cytologic Grade 1 tumor cells or in cells from bladders, without known malignant neoplasms.

Examination of genetic alterations, in combination with morphologic analysis, facilitates the diagnosis of carcinoma.
