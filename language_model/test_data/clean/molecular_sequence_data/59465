A genomic DNA clone (14.5 kbp) for amelogenin, a tooth enamel specific protein, has been isolated from a mouse genomic library. The nucleotide structure of this DNA was determined by the polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis. The result indicated that the cloned DNA contained all the exons in addition to approximately 5.5 kbp of upstream sequence.
