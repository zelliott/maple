The Eastern woodchuck (Marmota monax) is a useful experimental model for evaluating antiviral therapy against chronic HBV infection. In the present study, an immunogenic complex (IGC) composed of immune sera containing PreS/S heterologous antibodies (anti-HBs) and serum-derived WHV particles containing 10(7) WHV-DNA copies/50 µl was developed. The IGC was administered to WHV-negative woodchucks and natural chronic WHV carriers, with the final aim of evaluating the outcome of WHV infection in both groups. A control group of three animals, infected experimentally with viral particles only, was also evaluated. Following IGC administration, two WHV-negative woodchucks exhibited persistent infection, with WHV-DNA levels 3-6 logs lower than the WHV-DNA levels of the controls that developed persistent infection. WHeAg seroconversion to anti-WHe was observed in these two woodchucks and in two control woodchucks which developed self-limited infection. In two of the four chronic carriers, the WHV-DNA level decreased significantly (by 4-6 logs) following IGC administration, with no rebound in viral load during follow-up. WHeAg seroconversion to anti-WHe was observed also in these animals. Analyses of the sequences derived from envelope proteins confirmed that IGC did not induce the emergence of resistant viral variants. The results of this study indicate that the IGC could be useful for breaking the tolerance in hepadnaviral infection and for boosting the host's innate and adoptive immune response.
