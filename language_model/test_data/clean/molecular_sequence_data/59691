Synthetic oligonucleotide primers based on cDNA sequence were used to amplify the region spanning intron 2 of the alpha-globin gene of the bivalve mollusc Anadara trapezia. Amplification of this region from individual clams showed highly polymorphic patterns. The sequence of this intron was found to include a number of mono- [d(T)n and d(C)n], di- [d(CA)n and d(CT)n] and tetranucleotide d(CTGT)n repeats which were found to be polymorphic with respect to the types and numbers of repeats present. Two separate repeat-containing polymorphic regions were located near each end of this intron. The repeat at the 3' end consisted of an unusual example of a d(T)n polymorphism at the position of the polypyrimidine tract usually involved in intron splicing. Thirteen individual cloned intron 2 sequences, derived by PCR amplification from pooled genomic DNA, were sequenced without finding two identical sequences. All of the sequenced clones contained microsatellite sequences.
