The entire sequence of 13952 nucleotides of a plasmid-like, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) from rice was assembled from more than 50 independent cDNA clones. The 5' non-coding region of the coding (sense) strand spans over 166 nucleotides, followed by one long open reading frame (ORF) of 13716 nucleotides that encodes a large putative polyprotein of 4572 amino acid residues, and by a 70-nucleotide 3' non-coding region. This ORF is apparently the longest reported to date in the plant kingdom. Amino acid sequence comparisons revealed that the large putative polyprotein includes an RNA helicase-like domain and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (replicase)-like domain. Comparisons of the amino acid sequences of these two domains and of the entire genetic organization of the rice dsRNA with those found in potyviruses and the CHV1-713 dsRNA of chestnut blight fungus suggest that the rice dsRNA is located evolutionarily between potyviruses and the CHV1-713 dsRNA. This plasmid-like dsRNA in rice seems to constitute a novel RNA replicon in plants.
