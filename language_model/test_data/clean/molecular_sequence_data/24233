The age-related and T cell-independent immunological properties of most capsular polysaccharides limit their use as vaccines, especially in children under 2 years of age. To overcome these limitations, polysaccharide antigens have been successfully conjugated to a variety of carrier proteins, such as diphtheria toxoid or tetanus toxoid (TT) and the diphtheria mutant (CRM197) to produce very successful glycoconjugate vaccines. The increasing demand for new conjugate vaccines requires the availability of additional carriers providing high and long-lasting T helper cell immunity. Here we describe the design and construction of three recombinant carrier proteins (N6, N10, N19) constituted by strings of 6, 10 or 19 human CD4(+) T cell epitopes from various pathogen-derived antigens, including TT and proteins from Plasmodium falciparum, influenza virus and hepatitis B virus. Each of these epitopes is defined as universal in that it binds to many human MHC class II molecules. When conjugated to Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) oligosaccharide, these carriers elicit a potent anti-Hib antibody response in mice. In the case of the N19-Hib conjugate, this response is at least as good as that observed with CRM197-Hib, a conjugate vaccine currently used for mass immunization. We also show that some of the universal epitopes constituting the recombinant carriers are specifically recognized by two human in vitro systems, suggesting that T cell memory is provided by the selected epitopes. The data indicate that rationally designed recombinant polyepitope proteins represent excellent candidates for the development and clinical testing of new conjugate vaccines.
