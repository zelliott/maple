Many proteins of widely differing functionality and structure are capable of binding heparin. Structural characterisations of the many types of such complexes are being reported in ever-increasing number and at improved resolution. Several crystal structures of complexes formed through the interaction of heparin-derived oligosaccharides with one or more protein partners have been described.
