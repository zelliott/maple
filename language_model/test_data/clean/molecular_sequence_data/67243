Myostatin is a potent negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. Although several cDNA clones have been characterized in different vertebrates, the genomic organization and bioactivity of non-mammalian homologs have not. The intron/exon organization and promoter subsequence analysis of two rainbow trout myostatin genes, rtMSTN-1a and rtMSTN-1b (formerly 1 and 2 respectively), as well as a quantitative assessment of their embryonic, larval, and adult tissue expression profiles are reported herein. Each gene was similarly organized into three exons of 490, 368, and 1600 bp for MSTN-1a and 486, 386, and 1419 bp for MSTN-1b. Comparative mapping of coding regions from several vertebrate myostatin genes revealed a common organization between species, including conserved pre-mRNA splice sites; the first among the fishes and the second across all vertebrate species. In silico subsequence analysis of the promoter regions identified E-boxes and other putative myogenic response elements. However, the number and diversity of elements were considerably less than those found in mammalian promoters or in the recently characterized zebrafish MSTN-2 gene. A quantitative analysis of the embryonic expression profile for both genes indicates that rtMSTN-1a expression is consistently greater than that of rtMSTN-1b and neither gene is significantly expressed throughout gastrulation. Expression of both steadily increases fourfold during somitogenesis and subsides as this period ends. After eyeing, however, rtMSTN-1a mRNA levels ultimately rise 20-fold by day 49 and peak before hatching and yolk sac absorption (YSA). Levels of rtMSTN-1b rise similarly, but do not peak before YSA. An analysis of adult (2-year-old fish) tissue expression indicates that both transcripts are present in most tissues although levels are highest in brain, testes, eyes, muscle, and surprisingly spleen. These studies suggest that strong selective pressures have preserved the genomic organization of myostatin genes throughout evolution. However, the different expression profiles and putative promoter elements in fishes versus mammals suggests that limitations in myostatin function may have evolved recently.
