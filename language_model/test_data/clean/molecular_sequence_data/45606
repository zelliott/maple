Amyloid fibrils associated with Alzheimer's disease and a wide range of other neurodegenerative diseases have a cross beta-sheet structure, where main chain hydrogen bonding occurs between beta-strands in the direction of the fibril axis. The surface of the beta-sheet has pronounced ridges and grooves when the individual beta-strands have a parallel orientation and the amino acids are in-register with one another. Here we show that in Abeta amyloid fibrils, Met35 packs against Gly33 in the C-terminus of Abeta40 and against Gly37 in the C-terminus of Abeta42. These packing interactions suggest that the protofilament subunits are displaced relative to one another in the Abeta40 and Abeta42 fibril structures. We take advantage of this corrugated structure to design a new class of inhibitors that prevent fibril formation by placing alternating glycine and aromatic residues on one face of a beta-strand. We show that peptide inhibitors based on a GxFxGxF framework disrupt sheet-to-sheet packing and inhibit the formation of mature Abeta fibrils as assayed by thioflavin T fluorescence, electron microscopy, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The alternating large and small amino acids in the GxFxGxF sequence are complementary to the corresponding amino acids in the IxGxMxG motif found in the C-terminal sequence of Abeta40 and Abeta42. Importantly, the designed peptide inhibitors significantly reduce the toxicity induced by Abeta42 on cultured rat cortical neurons.
