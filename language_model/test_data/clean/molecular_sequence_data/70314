The preinsertion site of an adenovirus-5/simian virus 40 recombinant construct (Ad5/SV40) has been cloned and sequenced. Our data suggest that viral integration has occurred in a genomic region which has been the target of multiple events of Alu element retropositions within a TAA minisatellite. Extensive homologies between the left viral end and the host cellular DNA were also observed. The compositional similarity between Adenoviridae and the region of viral integration is consistent with the observed insertion of exogenous DNA in isochores of similar composition [G. Bernardi, Annu. Rev. Genet. 23 (1989) 637-661].
