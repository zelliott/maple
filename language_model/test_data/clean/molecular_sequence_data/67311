Acyl carrier protein (ACP) is a small acidic protein, an important cofactor involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. Its main function is to protect the growing acyl chain from the hydrophilic environment during fatty acid biosynthesis and simultaneously, present it to the active site of fatty acid pathway enzymes, liable for its elongation. The ACP molecule is expressed as apo-ACP (inactive) and is post-transitionally modified to the holo form (active) by the enzyme holo ACP synthase (ACPS). Here we report the complete backbone and side chain chemical shift assignments of the holo-ACP molecule of Leishmania major.
