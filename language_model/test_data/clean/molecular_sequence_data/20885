The thermodynamic stability of a protein plays an important role during evolution and adaptation in order to maintain a folded and active conformation. p53 is a tumour suppressor involved in the regulation of numerous genes. Human p53 has an unusually low thermodynamic stability and is frequently inactivated by oncogenic missense mutations. Here, we examined the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of p53 DNA binding domains from selected invertebrate and vertebrate species by differential scanning calorimetry and equilibrium urea denaturation. There is a correlation in the apparent melting temperature of p53 with the body temperature of homeotherm vertebrates. We found that p53 from these organisms has a half-life for spontaneous unfolding at organismal body temperature of 10-20 min. We also found that p53 from invertebrates has higher stability, bearing more resemblance towards p63 and p73 from humans. Using structure-guided mutagenesis on the human p53 scaffold, we demonstrated that the amino acid changes on the protein surface and in the protein interior lead to the elevated stability of p53 orthologs. We propose a model in which the p53 DNA binding domain has been shaped by the complex interplay of different selective pressures and underwent adaptive evolution leading to pronounced effects on its stability. p53 from vertebrates has evolved to have a low thermodynamic stability and similarly short spontaneous half-life at organismal body temperature, which is related to function.
