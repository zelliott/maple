Streptomyces auratus strain AGR0001 produces neophoslactomycin A, a novel analog of phoslactomycin that possesses potent activity against some phytopathogenic fungi. Here, the draft genome sequence of S. auratus strain AGR0001 is presented, which would provide insight into the biosynthetic mechanism of neophoslactomycin A.
