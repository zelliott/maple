We have identified an orphan G protein-coupled receptor, SP174, that shares a high degree of homology with the recently described ADP receptor P2Y(12). mRNA for SP174 is abundant in the brain and in cells of the immune system. In the present study, we demonstrate that SP174 is also a receptor for ADP, which is coupled to Galphai. ADP potently stimulates SP174 with an EC(50) of 60 nM, and other related nucleotides are active as well, with a rank order of potency 2-methylthio-ADP tetrasodium = adenosine 5'-O-2-(thio)diphosphate = 2-methylthio-ATP tetrasodium > ADP > AP3A >ATP > IDP. This pharmacological profile is similar to that for P2Y(12). We have also identified the murine homolog of SP174, which exhibits 75% homology to the human receptor. ADP is also a potent agonist at the murine receptor, and its pharmacological profile is similar to its human counterpart, but ADP and related nucleotides are more potent at the murine receptor than the human receptor. In keeping with the general nomenclature for the purinergic receptors, we propose designating this novel receptor P2Y(13).
