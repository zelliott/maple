Synthetic mRNA analogues were constructed with sequences related to the Cro-protein mRNA from lambda-phage and prepared by T7 transcription. Each mRNA contained several thiouridine (thio-U) residues. The regions upstream from the AUG initiator codon of the mRNA were the same in all the messages, whereas in the downstream part the thio-U residues were placed in selected positions. These positions covered the region from +4 to +16 (A in the initiator AUG codon being defined as +1). After binding to the ribosome in the presence of initiator tRNA the thio-U residues were activated by u.v. irradiation and the resulting sites of cross-linking to 16 S rRNA and ribosomal proteins were analysed. Cross-links to several ribosomal proteins were identified in different types of complex. Changes in the conformation of the small ribosomal subunit in different initiation and elongation complexes are discussed.
