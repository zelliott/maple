A study of chicken GH receptor (cGHR) expression has revealed that the two major liver and skeletal muscle transcripts of the cGHR are developmentally expressed. Expression of the larger (4.7 kilobases) transcript increases with age. The smaller transcript (0.7 kilobases) is a truncation product, resulting from alternative usage of a functional polyadenylation [poly(A)] signal embedded in the coding sequence. The extent to which alternative cleavage and polyadenylation occur displays some tissue and sex specificity. Cleavage and polyadenylation occur down-stream of the AATAAA portion of the poly(A) signal (cGHR positions 304-309) and up-stream of a GT-rich sequence. The truncated transcript appears to be translated, based on its association in vivo with polyribosomes, although the physiological role of the putative protein product of this truncated transcript is as yet unknown. Three other avian species (quail, turkey, and duck) also show a polyadenylated truncation of the GHR message due to a poly(A) signal at the same location in the coding sequence. In cell culture expression, mutation of AATAAA to AACAAG prevents production of the truncated transcript. In a chimeric construct, the signal and neighboring sequence from the cGHR are sufficient to confer cleavage and polyadenylation upon the rat GHR, a gene that otherwise lacks the internal poly(A) signal. Alternative polyadenylation within the coding region of a structural gene is discussed as a heretofore unknown means of post-transcriptional regulation of a gene product.
