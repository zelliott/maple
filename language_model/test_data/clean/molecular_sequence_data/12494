Many transcriptional regulators function in homo- or heterodimeric combinations. The same protein can carry out distinct regulatory functions depending on the partner with which it associates. Here, we describe a mutant of the Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein (CRP) that has an altered dimerization specificity; that is, mutant/mutant homodimers form preferentially over wild-type/mutant heterodimers. CRP dimerization involves the formation of a parallel coiled-coil structure, and our CRP mutant bears an amino acid substitution affecting the first "d" position residue within the alpha-helix that mediates CRP dimerization. The genetic strategy we used to isolate this CRP altered dimerization specificity (ADS) mutant is generalizable and could be utilized to isolate ADS mutants of other dimeric transcriptional regulators.
