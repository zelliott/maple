The yeast HOM3 gene has been cloned molecularly by complementation of a HOM3 mutant. The gene is located about 8 kilobase pairs from HIS1 and is present as a single copy in the yeast genome. Mutations in HOM3 result in a requirement for threonine and methionine (or homoserine) for growth and a lack of detectable aspartokinase activity. The nucleotide sequence of HOM3 predicts an enzyme 414 amino acids long that shows homology to the three Escherichia coli aspartokinases, indicating that it is the structural gene for yeast aspartokinase. An approximately 1800-base pair mRNA is transcribed from the HOM3 gene, initiating at several start sites, 80 and 70 base pairs downstream, respectively, from two TATA boxes. Upstream of the TATA boxes is a single TGACTC sequence. This sequence has been shown to be essential for regulation of several genes that encode amino acid biosynthetic enzymes by the general control system. However, no increase in aspartokinase mRNA is observed under general control derepressing conditions.
