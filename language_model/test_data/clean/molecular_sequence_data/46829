The complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pLQ510 from Moraxella catarrhalis strain E22 has been determined. This plasmid contained 12,082 bp with 38% GC content. Five open reading frames that encoded predicted proteins with homology to plasmid-encoded proteins from other bacteria were identified. A putative origin of replication that contained an AT-rich region followed by four direct repeats and an inverted repeat was identified.
