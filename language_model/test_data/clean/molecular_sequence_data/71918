Cyclin A1 is a recently cloned cyclin with high level expression in meiotic cells in the testis. However, it is also frequently expressed at high levels in acute myeloid leukemia. To elucidate the regulation of cyclin A1 gene expression, we cloned and analyzed the genomic structure of cyclin A1. It consists of 9 exons within 13 kilobase pairs. The TATA-less promoter initiates transcription from several start sites with the majority of transcripts beginning within a 4-base pair stretch. A construct containing a fragment from -190 to +145 showed the highest transcriptional activity. Transfection of cyclin A1 promoter constructs into S2 Drosophila cells demonstrated that Sp1 is essential for the activity of the promoter. Sp1, as well as Sp3, bound to four GC boxes between nucleotides -130 and -80 as observed by gel shift analysis. Mutations in two or more of the four GC boxes decreased promoter activity by >80%. The promoter was found to be cell cycle-regulated with highest activities found in late S and G2/M phase. Further analyses suggested that cell cycle regulation was accomplished by periodic repression of the GC boxes in G1 phase. Taken together, our data show that cyclin A1 promoter activity critically depends on four GC boxes, and members of the Sp1 family appear to be involved in directing expression of cyclin A1 in both a tissue- and cell cycle-specific manner.
