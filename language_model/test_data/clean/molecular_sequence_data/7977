A polyphasic study in which we performed an amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of whole-cell proteins, a gas chromatographic analysis of methylated fatty acids, pyrolysis mass spectrometry, a random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis, a phenotypic analysis, and an analysis of the levels of DNA binding of Paenibacillus gordonae and Paenibacillus validus strains (including both type strains) showed that these organisms form a homogeneous group and that the names P. gordonae and P. validus are therefore synonyms. P. validus has nomenclatural priority, and an emended description of this species is given; the type strain is strain LMG 11161 (= ATCC 43897).
