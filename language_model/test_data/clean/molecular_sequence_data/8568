Hepatic cystathionine beta-synthase activity is decreased by the addition of cysteine to the diet. This effect of cysteine was slightly greater in diets containing 0.25% methionine than in those containing 1% methionine, and was reduced during aging. Similar changes were observed in the level of the mRNA of this enzyme, although the changes in the transcript levels were slightly greater than the changes in enzyme activity. Thus, we conclude that the addition of cysteine to a methionine-containing diet causes a decrease in cystathionine beta-synthase activity mainly by diminishing its mRNA level.
