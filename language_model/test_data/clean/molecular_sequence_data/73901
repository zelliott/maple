Prohibitin is the protein which has an inhibitory function in cell growth, and its gene is suggested to be one of putative tumor suppressor genes. In this report, we described a partial cloning of prohibitin cDNAs from canine, feline, bovine, equine, and rabbit liver mRNAs by RT-PCR, and their homology analysis. The sequences of these RT-PCR products were compared with each other as well as those reported for human and rat. The homology in this region of prohibitin cDNA was approximately 90%, and the amino acid sequence of each RT-PCR product shared more than 95% identity. Therefore, it is concluded that all the RT-PCR products are a part of prohibitin cDNA of each animal.
