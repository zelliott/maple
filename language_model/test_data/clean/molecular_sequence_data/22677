We show that the mechanisms of DNA-dependent and -independent dTTP hydrolysis by the gene 4 protein of bacteriophage T7 differ in the pathways by which these reactions are catalyzed. In the presence of dTTP, gene 4 protein monomers assemble as a ring that binds single-stranded DNA and couples the hydrolysis of dTTP to unidirectional translocation and the unwinding of duplex DNA. When mixing wild-type monomers with monomers lacking the catalytic base for the dTTPase reaction, we observe that each wild-type subunit hydrolyzes dTTP independently in the absence of single-stranded DNA. Conversely, when either these catalytically inactive monomers or altered monomers incapable of binding single-stranded DNA are mixed with wild-type monomers, a small fraction of altered to wild-type monomers causes a sharp decline in DNA-dependent dTTP hydrolysis. We propose that sequential hydrolysis of dTTP is coupled to the transfer of single-stranded DNA from subunit to adjacent subunit.
