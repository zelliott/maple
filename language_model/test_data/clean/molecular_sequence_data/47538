The gene encoding the matrix protein of peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) has been cloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. This gene is 1466 nucleotides long and contains an open reading frame (ORF) capable of encoding a basic protein of 335 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 38,057 Da. This ORF starts at position 33-35 and ends with the codon TAA at position 1038-1040 thus leaving a long untranslated region (426 nucleotides) at the 3' end of the messenger RNA. This fragment is very G/C rich (68.5%) and in contrast to the ORF region appears to be least conserved in the M gene sequence of the morbilliviruses. A comparison of the PPRV M protein with those of other viruses in the group confirms the previously noted high degree of conservation for this protein sequence. The percent of identity within the group ranges from 76.7 to 86.9%, the highest being with the dolphin morbillivirus matrix protein.
