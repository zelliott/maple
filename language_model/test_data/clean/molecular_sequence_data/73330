The putative peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase gene PACO1 from Phalaenopsis was isolated from a genomic library constructed in the lambda EMBL3 vector by screening with PACO1 cDNA. This gene encompasses approximately 14 Kb and is divided into seven exons by six introns. The consensus GT-AG dinucleotides situated at all the boundaries between exons and introns. According to the genomic Southern analysis with different fragments of the first intron, PACO1 gene possesses a large intron about 10 Kb interrupting the first and secondary exon.
