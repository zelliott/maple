The S3 segment (the small segment 3), encoding the structural protein, VP6, from the five United States (US) prototype bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes were amplified by the Clamp-R method and cloned as full-length entities. The complete nucleotide sequence of each cognate gene segment was determined. Each cognate S3 segment of BTV-10, 11, 13 and 17 was 1049 nucleotides long and contained an open reading frame (ORF) capable of encoding a 325-amino acid protein. However, the S3 segment of BTV-2, which also contained 1049 nucleotides, had a longer 5'-non-coding region of 99-nucleotide and contained an ORF capable only of encoding a 301-amino acid protein. Comparative analyses of the predicted amino acid sequences of S3 segments of BTV-2, 10, 11, 13 and 17 revealed that VP6 was unusually high in glycine and contained few aromatic amino acids, but a high concentration of charged amino acids, which is a characteristic of a hydrophilic protein. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that BTV-11, 13 and 17 were more closely related than the other two US BTV serotypes. BTV-2 was the most distantly related.
