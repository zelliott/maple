An acidic, partially acetylated galactomannan has been isolated from the lipopolysaccharide of the reference strain (C.D.C. 864-57) for Serratia marcescens serogroup O4. From the results of methylation analysis, Smith degradations, and n.m.r. spectroscopic studies of the O-deacetylated polymer, it was concluded that the repeating unit has the structure shown, in which the acetal-linked pyruvic acid has the R configuration. The polymer is believed to confer O specificity on the organism, but not to constitute the side chain of the lipopolysaccharide. (formula; see text).
