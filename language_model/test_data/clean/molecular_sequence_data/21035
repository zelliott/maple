The structure of the Atu1476 protein from Agrobacterium tumefaciens was determined at 2 A resolution. The crystal structure and biochemical characterization of this enzyme support the conclusion that this protein is an S-formylglutathione hydrolase (AtuSFGH). The three-dimensional structure of AtuSFGH contains the alpha/beta hydrolase fold topology and exists as a homo-dimer. Contacts between the two monomers in the dimer are formed both by hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. Biochemical characterization reveals that AtuSFGH hydrolyzes C--O bonds with high affinity toward short to medium chain esters, unlike the other known SFGHs which have greater affinity toward shorter chained esters. A potential role for Cys54 in regulation of enzyme activity through S-glutathionylation is also proposed.
