Polyploidization is a key component of plant evolution. The number of independent origins of polyploid species traditionally has been underestimated. The objective of this study was to ascertain the number of origins of a tetraploid Aegilops species. We screened 84 primer sets to identify genome-specific primer sets for the tetraploid wheat relative [Aegilops triuncialis (UUCC genome)] and its diploid progenitors [Ae. umbellulata (UU genome) and Ae. caudata (CC genome)]. Primer sets G12 and G43 were U genome-specific and D21 was a C genome-specific primer. DNA sequence comparison of the G43 locus was used to estimate the number of polyploidization events in the formation of Ae. triuncialis. Parsimony analysis of G43 data revealed at least two independent formations of Ae. triuncialis. In the chloroplast hotspot region, located between genes rbcL and petA, sequence analysis suggested that at least three polyploidization origins might have occurred independently. Ae. triuncialis appears to be a tetraploid derived from multiple origins with minimal genome change after its formation.
