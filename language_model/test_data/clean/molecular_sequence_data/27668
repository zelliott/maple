A polypeptide chain-terminating mutation (M5631) previously has been shown to be a +1T insertion in the yeast mitochondrial gene oxi1, coding for subunit II of the cytochrome c oxidase. A spontaneously arisen frameshift suppressor (mfs-1) that is mitochondrially inherited suppresses this mutation to a considerable extent. The suppressor mutation was mapped by genetic and molecular analyses in the mitochondrial tRNASer-var1 region of the mitochondrial genome of the yeast S. cerevisiae. Genetic analyses show that the suppressor mfs-1 does not suppress other known mitochondrial frameshift mutations, or missense and nonsense mutations.
