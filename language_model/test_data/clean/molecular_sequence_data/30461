Six neutral glycosphingolipids were isolated from porcine corneas using silicic acid column chromatography and preparative thin-layer chromatography. Five of these glycolipids were partially identified by gas-liquid chromatography. Two were glucosylceramides, two were lactosylceramides and one was tetrahexosylceramide containing galactose, glucose and N-acetylgalactosamine in the molar ratio of 2:1:1. Glucosylceramides were found to be the predominating component, with lactosyl- and tetrahexosylceramides being the minor constituents. Sphingosine was the major long-chain base in all fractions. The fatty acids of the corneal neutral glycosphingolipids were variable in chain length. This represents the first investigation of neutral glycosphingolipids in corneas of any species.
