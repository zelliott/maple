Monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3) belongs to the MCP subgroup of CC chemokines that are structurally closely related but, which differ in receptor usage and hence in biological activities. MCP-3 is one of the most pluripotent chemokines since it activates all types of leukocytes, by binding to at least four different chemokine receptors. The natural protein is heterogeneous due to glycosylation and NH2-terminal processing. Only small amounts of MCP-3 are induced in various cell types by endogeneous (cytokines) or exogeneous (bacteria, viruses) agents. Nevertheless, this omnipotent chemokine, inducible in most body compartments, might play an important role in normal homeostasis as well as in various pathologies including cancer, auto-immune diseases and chronic inflammation.
