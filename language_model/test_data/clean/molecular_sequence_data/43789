A 268 bp region (P268) of the pea plastocyanin gene promoter responsible for high-level expression has been shown to interact with the high mobility group proteins HMG-1 and HMG-I/Y isolated from pea shoot chromatin. cDNAs encoding an HMG-1 protein of 154 amino acid residues containing a single HMG-box and a C-terminal acidic tail and an HMG-I/Y-like protein of 197 amino acid residues containing four AT-hooks have been isolated and expressed in Escherichia coli to provide large amounts of full-length proteins. DNase I footprinting identified eight binding sites for HMG-I/Y and six binding sites for HMG-1 in P268. Inhibition of binding by the antibiotic distamycin, which binds in the minor groove of A/T-rich DNA, revealed that HMG-I/Y binding was 400-fold more sensitive than HMG-1 binding. Binding-site selection from a pool of random oligonucleotides indicated that HMG-I/Y binds to oligonucleotides containing stretches of five or more A/T bp and HMG-1 binds preferentially to oligonucleotides enriched in dinucleotides such as TpT and TpG.
