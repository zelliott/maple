A panel of 15 single alanine substitutions on the floor of the peptide binding groove of the murine class I histocompatibility molecule H-2Kd has been analyzed. All but two mutant molecules were expressed on the cell surface, and were tested for peptide binding and presentation to specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Eleven out of 13 mutant molecules appeared to be functionally altered. Five of the substituted residues were involved in the presentation of all peptides tested. Three participated in the presentation of certain peptides but not others. Three other residues participated in epitope formation through indirect interactions. Only two mutations had no detectable effect.
