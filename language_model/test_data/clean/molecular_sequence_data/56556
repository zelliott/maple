The immunization of genetically susceptible strains of mice with type II collagen (CII) elicits a collagen-induced arthritis that resembles rheumatoid arthritis. Our laboratory previously identified a region of CII, CII-245-270, that contains a T cell epitope that is prominent in the immune response to CII. Residues critical to the I-Aq-restricted presentation of this determinant have been characterized. To produce synthetic peptides with the potential of disrupting I-Aq-restricted Ag presentation, synthetic analogue peptides were developed that contain site-directed substitutions in critical positions. One analogue peptide was found to be an efficient competitor for binding to I-Aq and to be capable of inhibiting T cell responses in vitro. When DBA/1 mice were coimmunized with CII and the analogue peptide, the incidence and severity of arthritis were greatly reduced, concordant with the humoral immune responses to CII.
