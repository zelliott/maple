We recently reported the identification of GIYWHHY as an efficient and specific substrate for p60(c-src) protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) by screening a secondary random peptide library (Q. Lou et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem., 4: 677-682, 1996). Based on the primary structure of GIYWHHY, we designed and synthesized several pseudosubstrate-based peptide inhibitors. Some of these peptide inhibitors are highly potent and specific with IC50 in the low micromolar range. Because both YIYGSFK and GIYWHHY are efficient and specific substrates for p60(c-src) PTK, chimeric branched peptides based on these two sequences were synthesized. These branched peptides inhibit p60(c-src) PTK with high potency, indicating that the enzyme-active site of p60(c-src) PTK can accommodate more than a linear motif. This may explain why seemingly several peptides with very different linear structures can all be phosphorylated by this enzyme.
