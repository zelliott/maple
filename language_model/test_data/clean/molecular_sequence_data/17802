To facilitate cloning procedures in recombinant murine leukemia virus-derived retroviruses, we have constructed vectors that both carry a polylinker with multiple restriction sites and express resistance to either G418 or hygromycin B. Our vectors are self-inactivating retroviruses that suppress interferences between LTR enhancers and internal promoters and avoid transcriptional stimulation of host cell genes. They can also be used as expression vectors in direct transfection assays, since no translation initiation codon lies between the 5' LTR and the cloning polylinker.
