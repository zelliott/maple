Indolicidin is a 13-residue cationic, antimicrobial peptide-amide isolated from the cytoplasmic granules of bovine neutrophils. The unique composition of indolicidin distinguishes it from alpha-helical and beta-structured cationic peptides, because five of indolicidin's 13 residues are tryptophans: H-Ile-Leu-Pro-Trp-Lys-Trp-Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro-Trp-Arg-Arg-NH(2). Solid phase synthesis of indolicidin gave rise to a minor byproduct that possessed unusual fluorescence and UV absorbance properties compared with authentic indolicidin. The byproduct was purified by combined ion exchange and reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography steps and was shown be identical to authentic indolicidin in its microbicidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Mass analysis of the byproduct revealed a 2-atomic mass unit reduction compared with indolicidin, suggesting the deprotonation of two indole side chains to form an intrachain delta(1),delta(1)'-ditryptophan derivative. We confirmed the nature of the cross-linked byproduct, termed X-indolicidin, by absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy, peptide mapping, and sequence analysis. Edman degradation revealed that Trp-6 and Trp-9 were covalently cross-linked. Compared with indolicidin, X-indolicidin was partially resistant to digestion with trypsin and chymotrypsin, suggesting that the ditryptophan stabilizes a subset of molecular conformations that are protease resistant but that are absent in the native structure.
