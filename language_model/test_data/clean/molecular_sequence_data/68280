DNA-protein interactions around the regulatory region of the pS2 gene were studied to gain insight into the mechanisms that operate in the estrogen receptor regulated expression of this gene in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell. Using a revised photocrosslinking technology in combination with gel retardation assays, two distinct multiprotein DNA complexes were shown to assemble in an estrogen receptor-dependent process. Immunological analysis demonstrated the participation of both the estrogen receptor and a c-fos related protein in the formation of these complexes. The results support a model of estrogen receptor function in which the receptor facilitates the formation of multiprotein complexes at DNA sites that can regulate the transcription of a hormone responsive gene by RNA polymerase II and any additional general transcription machinery. These receptor-containing complexes are referred to as "receptorsomes."
