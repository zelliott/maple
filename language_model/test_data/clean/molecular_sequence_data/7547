To investigate the function of a basic and neutral amino acid transporter-like protein (rBAT) which is a candidate gene for cystinuria, we analysed the rBAT gene in cystinuric patients. Patient 1 is a compound heterozygote with mutations in the rBAT gene causing a glutamine-to-lysine transition at amino acid 268, and a threonine-to-alanine transition at amino acid 341, who inherited these alleles from his mother (E268K) and father (T341A), respectively. Injection of T341A and E268K mutant cRNAs into oocytes decreased transport activity to 53.9% and 62.5% of control (L-cystine transport activity in oocytes injected with wild-type rBAT cRNA), respectively. Co-injection of E268K and T341A into oocytes strongly decreased amino acid transport activity to 28% of control. On the other hand, co-injection of wild-type and mutant rBAT did not decrease transport activity. Furthermore, immunological studies have demonstrated that the reduction of amino acid transport is not due to a decrease in the amount of rBAT protein expressed in oocyte membranes. These results indicate that mutations in the rBAT gene are crucial disease-causing lesions in cystinuria. In addition, co-injection experiments suggest that rBAT may function as a transport activator or regulatory subunit by homo- or hetero-multimer complex formation.
