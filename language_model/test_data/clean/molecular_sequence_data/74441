Blackcurrant reversion nepovirus (BRV; genus Nepovirus) has a single-stranded, bipartite RNA genome surrounded by 60 copies of a single capsid protein (CP). BRV is the most important mite-transmitted viral pathogen of the Ribes species. It is the causal agent of blackcurrant reversion disease. We determined the structure of BRV to 1.7 nm resolution using electron cryo- microscopy (cryoEM) and image reconstruction. The reconstruction reveals a pseudo T=3 viral capsid similar to that of tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV). We modelled the BRV capsid protein to that of TRSV and fitted it into the cryoEM reconstruction. The fit indicated that the extended C-terminus of BRV-CP is located on the capsid surface and the N-terminus on the interior. We generated peptide antibodies to two putatively exposed C-terminal sequences and these reacted with the virus. Hence homology modelling may be useful for defining epitopes for antibody generation for diagnostic testing of BRV in commercial crops.
