A cDNA clone (rpS13) encoding the S13 ribosomal protein (rpS13) has been isolated from the catfish Ictalurus punctatus, and is the first example of an rpS13 isolated from a teleost species. The deduced 151-amino-acid (aa) sequence is 96% identical to the rat and human rpS13, extending the evolutionary conservation of this protein.
