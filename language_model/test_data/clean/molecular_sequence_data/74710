Nine anamorphic, ascomycetous yeast strains belonging to the Pichia anomala clade were recovered from forest soil in 2006 in Taiwan. The nine yeast strains represent four novel yeast species based on the sequences of their D1/D2 domain of the large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene and their physiological characteristics. The scientific names of Candida dajiaensis sp. nov., Candida yuanshanicus sp. nov., Candida jianshihensis sp. nov., and Candida sanyiensis sp. nov. are proposed for these novel yeast species. The type strains are C. dajiaensis SM11S03(T) (=CBS 10590(T)=BCRC 23099(T)), C. yuanshanicus SY3S02(T) (=CBS 10589(T)=BCRC 23100(T)), C. jianshihensis SM8S04(T) (=CBS 10591(T)=BCRC 23096(T)), and C. sanyiensis SA1S06(T) (=CBS 10592(T)=BCRC 23094(T)). Sequence analysis of the D1/D2 of the LSU rRNA gene revealed that the three species, C. dajiaensis, C. yuanshanicus and Pichia onychis, shared a separate branch in the phylogenetic tree, C. jianshihensis is phylogenetically related to Candida ulmi and Pichia alni, and the phylogenetically closest relative of C. sanyiensis is Pichia populi.
