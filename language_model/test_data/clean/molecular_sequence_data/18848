The amplification of useful genes from metagenomes offers great biotechnological potential. We employed this approach to isolate alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) genes from Pseudomonas to aid in the synthesis of optically pure alcohols from various ketones. A PCR primer combination synthesized by reference to the adh sequences of known Pseudomonas genes was used to amplify full-length adh genes directly from 17 samples of DNA extracted from soil. Three such adh preparations were used to construct Escherichia coli plasmid libraries. Of the approximately 2800 colonies obtained, 240 putative adh-positive clones were identified by colony-PCR. Next, 23 functional adh genes named using the descriptors HBadh and HPadh were analyzed. The adh genes obtained via this metagenomic approach varied in their DNA and amino acid sequences. Expression of the gene products in E. coli indicated varying substrate specificity. Two representative genes, HBadh-1 and HPadh-24, expressed in E. coli and Pseudomonas putida, respectively, were purified and characterized in detail. The enzyme products of these genes were confirmed to be useful for producing anti-Prelog chiral alcohols.
