In a previous study (Hughes EE, Gilleland LB, Gilleland HE Jr. [1992] Infect Immun 60:3497-3503), ten synthetic peptides were used to test for surface-exposed antigenic regions located throughout the length of outer membrane protein F of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An additional nine peptides of 11-21 amino acid residues in length were synthesized. Antisera collected from mice immunized with each of the 19 synthetic peptides conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin were used to determine which of the peptides had elicited antibodies capable of reacting with the surface of whole cells of the various heterologous Fisher-Devlin immunotypes of P. aeruginosa. Cell surface reactivity was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with whole cells of the various immunotypes as the ELISA antigens and by opsonophagocytic uptake assays with the various peptide-directed antisera, immunotype 2 P. aeruginosa cells, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes of human and murine origin. Three peptides located in the carboxy-terminal portion of protein F elicited antibodies with the greatest cell-surface reactivity. Peptide 9 (TDAYNQKLSERRAN), peptide 10 (NATAEGRAINRRVE), and peptide 18 (NEYGVEGGRVNAVG) appear to have sufficient potential for further development as vaccine candidates for immunoprophylaxis against infections caused by P. aeruginosa. A topological model for the arrangement of protein F within the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa is presented.
