Pollination of many flowers initiates a sequence of precisely regulated developmental events that include senescence of the perianth and development of the ovary. The plant hormone ethylene is known to play a key role in regulating the biochemical and anatomical changes that constitute the postpollination syndrome. For this reason, we have studied the pollination syndrome in Phalaenopsis orchids by examining the spatial and temporal location of ethylene biosynthesis within the orchid flower, and how this biosynthesis is regulated by factors that influence expression of genes that encode key enzymes in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway. In particular, we examined the role in the postpollination syndrome of the expression of the gene for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) oxidase, which catalyzes the conversion of ACC to ethylene. In vivo incubation of tissues with the ethylene precursor ACC demonstrated that ACC oxidase activity increases after pollination in the stigma, contrary to the observation that activity is constitutive in petunia and carnation gynoecia. RNA blot hybridization of floral tissues indicates that the increase in ACC oxidase activity is due to de novo synthesis of mRNA and presumably protein, which is induced after pollination. Furthermore, the pattern of induction is consistent with a model of coordinate regulation of gene expression in which the pollination signal travels to other organs of the flower to induce their ethylene production. We have also used in situ hybridization to define further the temporal and spatial expression of ACC oxidase within the floral organs, showing that expression, and,by inference, the capability to oxidize ACC to ethylene, is induced in all living cells of the tissues examined after pollination. These findings contrast with work in petunia that suggests that ACC oxidase is localized to the stigmatic surface.
