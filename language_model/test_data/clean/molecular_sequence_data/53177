A mutant of Mycobacterium smegmatis has been isolated that is simultaneously resistant to both D-cycloserine (D-CS) and vancomycin. Genetic complementation with a PBP4 homolog restores sensitivity to both drugs. Resistance to D-CS and vancomycin in this mutant is most likely due to a novel mechanism involving peptidoglycan assembly at the cell surface.
