The ability to transfer sufficient DNA to specific target cells remains one of the main limitations to the development of gene therapy. For this reason much attention is being paid to the development of new gene delivery systems, both viral and non-viral. We describe gene transfer with a polycation-DNA complex which contains an integrin-binding domain. Integrin-mediated gene delivery has several potential advantages. Such complexes are less likely than other receptor-mediated gene delivery complexes to be constrained by the size of the complex. The ligands are small peptides, resembling naturally occurring integrin ligands, which minimises the possibility of complexes inducing an immune response in vivo.
