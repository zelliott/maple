Four RNA polymerase II promoters have been mapped in the DNA sequence of the EcoRI-H and -Dhet fragments of B95-8 Epstein-Barr virus. RNAs transcribed from three of these promoters are dramatically induced by treatment of B95-8 cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The other promoter is active with or without TPA treatment of the cells and is thus active in the latent virus cycle. Deletion mapping suggests that DNA sequence homologies between some of the promoters lie in the same region as essential upstream promoter elements.
