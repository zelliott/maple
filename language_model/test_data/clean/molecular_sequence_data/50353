Signature sequences are contiguous patterns of amino acids 10-50 residues long that are associated with a particular structure or function in proteins. These may be of three types (by our nomenclature): superfamily signatures, remnant homologies, and motifs. We have performed a systematic search through a database of protein sequences to automatically and preferentially find remnant homologies and motifs. This was accomplished in three steps: 1. We generated a nonredundant sequence database. 2. We used BLAST3 (Altschul and Lipman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87:5509-5513, 1990) to generate local pairwise and triplet sequence alignments for every protein in the database vs. every other. 3. We selected "interesting" alignments and grouped them into clusters. We find that most of the clusters contain segments from proteins which share a common structure or function. Many of them correspond to signatures previously noted in the literature. We discuss three previously recognized motifs in detail (FAD/NAD-binding, ATP/GTP-binding, and cytochrome b5-like domains) to demonstrate how the alignments generated by our procedure are consistent with previous work and make structural and functional sense. We also discuss two signatures (for N-acetyltransferases and glycerol-phosphate binding) which to our knowledge have not been previously recognized.
