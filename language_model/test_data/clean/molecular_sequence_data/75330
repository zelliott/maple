cDNA clones coding for the plasma proteinase inhibitor alpha 1-inhibitor III were isolated from an acute phase rat liver library. The isolates could be divided into four groups with characteristic BamHI restriction fragment patterns. The identity of the prototype clone pRLA1I3/2J was established by comparison with the published amino acid sequence of the purified protein. It codes for a 1477-amino acid precursor polypeptide with a 24-residue signal peptide. The mature protein shares 58% overall sequence identity with rat alpha 2-macroglobulin and contains a typical internal thiolester sequence. Twenty-two of its twenty-three cysteinyl residues are conserved with alpha 2-macroglobulin implying similar tertiary structure. However, the prototype alpha 1-inhibitor III sequence differed significantly from the rat and human alpha 2-macroglobulin sequences in its bait region suggesting alpha 1-inhibitor III possesses proteinase inhibitory specificities different from those of alpha 2-macroglobulin. The variant alpha 1-inhibitor III clone pRLA1I3/2J from a second cDNA group also differed from the prototype in the bait region coding sequence, although both specify similar signal peptides and NH2 termini. The observation of variant cDNA classes suggests that acute phase rat livers produce a heterogeneous mixture of alpha 1-inhibitor III mRNA molecules. Evidence was obtained for the presence of at least four different alpha 1-inhibitor III-related genes in the rat genome. During the first 24 h of an acute phase response the abundance of hepatic alpha 1-inhibitor III mRNA was decreased 3-4-fold. This decrease was of the same order of magnitude as the reported reduction of the corresponding plasma protein concentration, suggesting that in the early phase of the acute inflammatory response the plasma concentration of this protein is mainly controlled through the abundance of its hepatic mRNA.
