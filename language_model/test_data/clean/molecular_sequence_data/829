We report here a novel HLA-B allele, B*2740, discovered in Taiwanese volunteer marrow donors. The new sequence has nucleotide variation at position 527 (T-->A) as compared to B*2708. The nucleotide change caused an amino acid substitution from valine (V) to glutamic acid (E) at codon 152. Since B*2740 carries sequence confers to HLA-Bw6 public epitope we believe that this novel B*27 allele might have been generated from a gene conversion involving a Bw4-specific allele (probably B*2704) and a Bw6-specific allele.
