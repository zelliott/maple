We have previously reported two anti-idiotypic antibodies, 3I and 8.12, that recognize L chain determinants on anti-DNA antibodies. We have generated a new anti-idiotypic antibody, F4, that recognizes a H chain determinant on cationic anti-DNA antibodies. F4 reactivity is present in high titer in serum of approximately 60% of SLE patients and on 84 of 706 myeloma proteins. It is preferentially associated with 3I reactive L chains. Furthermore, antibodies bearing both the F4 and 3I idiotypic determinants preferentially bind DNA. Amino acid sequencing of H chains isolated from four F4-reactive myeloma proteins suggests that they derive from two currently identified VH gene families. F4 reactivity is restricted almost exclusively to Ig of the IgG isotype suggesting that F4 may recognize either a somatically mutated hypervariable region or a variable region used late in the immune response. F4, therefore, represents a new idiotypic family preferentially associated with auto-Ag specificity and having features of an Ag-driven immune response.
