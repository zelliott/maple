A multicenter prospective study was performed on 160 asthmatic adults suffering from acute episodes of bronchitis and 88 non-asthmatic controls, to investigate potential associations among Chlamydia pneumoniae infection and/or anti-C. pneumoniae heat shock protein 10 antibodies, and asthma. We used micro-immunofluorescence to detect serum anti-C. pneumoniae IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect serum anti-Chsp10 peptide IgG antibodies. The serological prevalence of C. pneumoniae was 73.1%. An association was observed between the presence of anti-Chsp10 antibodies and adult onset asthma. The humoral immune responses were not confined to any particular region of the Chsp10 protein.
