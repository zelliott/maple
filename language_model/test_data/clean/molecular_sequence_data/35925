Human ST2 cDNA, a homologue of murine ST2 that is only expressed in growth-stimulated BALB/c-3T3 cells and a member of the primary response gene family induced by growth factors, was isolated from the cDNA library of an activated human helper T cell line, 5C10. Human ST2 has 67.6% identity in a 327 amino acid overlap to murine ST2. Furthermore, as in the case of murine ST2, human ST2 encodes a protein remarkably similar in sequence to the extracellular portion of human interleukin 1 receptor, both types 1 and 2. The expression of ST2 in human lymphocytes could trigger further investigations into its physiological role in humans.
