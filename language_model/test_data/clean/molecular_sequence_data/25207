The 50 S subunit of chloroplast ribosomes was prepared from tobacco leaves. The proteins were fractionated and the N-terminal amino acid sequence of a 14 kDa protein was determined. This sequence matches the N-terminal sequence deduced from ORF55 located between ndhF and trnL on the small single-copy region of tobacco chloroplast DNA. The deduced protein shows homology to E. coli and B. stearothermophilus L32 proteins, and it has been named as CL32 and ORF55 as rpl32. The tobacco chloroplast genome therefore contains 21 different ribosomal protein genes.
