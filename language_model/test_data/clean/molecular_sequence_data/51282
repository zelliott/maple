The D-aminoacylase produced by Alcaligenes denitrificans DA181 was a new type of aminoacylase which had both high stereospecificity and specific activity. The molecular weight and isoelectric point of this enzyme were 58,000 and 4.4, respectively. The apparent Km and kcat values of this enzyme for N-acetyl-D-methionine were estimated to be 0.48 mM and 6.24 x 10(4) min-1, respectively. The optimum temperature was 45 degrees C. The enzyme was stable up to 55 degrees C for 1 hr in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The enzyme was stable in the pH range of 6.0 to 11.0 with an optimum pH of 7.5. This enzyme contained about 2.1 g atom of zinc per mole of enzyme. Enzyme activity was inhibited by incubation with EDTA. The inhibition by EDTA was fully reversed by Co2+ and partially by Zn2+.
