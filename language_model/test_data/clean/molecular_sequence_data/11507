The substrate specificities of extracellular lipases purified from Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Burkholderia cepacia (former Pseudomonas cepacia) and of extracellular polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) depolymerases purified from Comamonas sp., Pseudomonas lemoignei, and P. fluorescens GK13, as well as that of an esterase purified from P. fluorescens GK 13, to various polyesters and to lipase substrates were analyzed. All lipases and the esterase of P. fluorescens GK13 but none of the PHA depolymerases tested hydrolyzed triolein, thereby confirming a functional difference between lipases and PHA depolymerases. However, most lipases were able to hydrolyze polyesters consisting of an omega-hydroxyalkanoic acid such as poly(6-hydroxyhedxanoate) or poly(4-hydroxybutyrate). The dimeric ester of hydroxyhexanoate was the main product of enzymatic hydrolysis of polycaprolactone by P. aeruginosa lipase. Polyesters containing side chains in the polymer backbone such as poly (3-hydroxybutyrate) and other poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) were not or were only slightly hydrolyzed by the lipases tested.
