To determine the biological significance of the existence of highly specific receptors for the bacterial chemotactic peptide formylmethionyl-leucylphenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe) on neutrophil leucocytes, we investigated the role of this peptide in bacterial metabolism. The UmuD protein of the Escherichia coli SOS operon was identified as having an N-terminal fMet-Leu-Phe sequence and a recombinant E. coli with the umuD gene on plasmid pSB13 was shown to be an over-producer of both UmuD and fMet-Leu-Phe. Activation of SOS genes in conventional wild-type E. coli (K12) by u.v. light or hydrogen peroxide increased fMet-Leu-Phe production up to 4-fold. A RecA- strain, incapable of SOS activation, was a low basal producer of fMet-Leu-Phe and showed no increased production with u.v. light or oxidant stress. We propose that host phagocytes respond to fMet-Leu-Phe and closely related peptides because they are generated by bacteria under oxidant stress. Increased fMet-Leu-Phe production may signal to the host a change in the organism's biological status from commensal to pathogen because of the invasion into tissues exposing bacteria to high pO2 levels and oxidant stress.
