Ubiquitin has been isolated and purified from rabbit brain using gel permeation and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The 76-residue protein exhibits one difference towards a murine form, is identical to other characterized vertebrate ubiquitins, and confirms an extensive conservation of the ubiquitin structure. No positional microheterogeneities were detectable between two sub-forms.
