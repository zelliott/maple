Four immunologically related proteins that belong to the annexin family were identified in cold acclimated wheat (Triticum aestivum). Two soluble forms with molecular masses of 34 and 36 kDa were found to bind phospholipid membranes in a calcium-dependent manner. These two forms are similar to the previously reported doublet in several plant species. The other two forms, with molecular masses of 39 and 22.5 kDa, were found associated with the microsomal fraction. Biochemical analysis showed that both forms are intrinsic membrane proteins and their association with the membrane is calcium independent. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of the presence of these annexin forms in plants. Membrane purification by two phase partitioning demonstrated that the p39 form is localized to the plasma membrane. Immunoblot analysis showed that the protein level of both p39 and p22.5 increases gradually reaching a maximum level after one day of low temperature exposure. The protein accumulation was similar in both hardy and less hardy cultivars, suggesting that the accumulation is not correlated with freezing tolerance. The results are discussed with respect to the possible role of these new intrinsic membrane annexins in low temperature signal transduction pathway.
