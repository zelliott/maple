Seven classes of Streptomyces clavuligerus mutants defective in clavulanic acid (CLA) biosynthesis have been identified and used to clone the chromosomal DNA encoding eight CLA biosynthetic genes. The complete sequences of three and the partial sequences of two of these biosynthetic genes are reported, together with their known or predicted functions.
