We have determined the amino acid sequence of a 35 kDa proteolytic fragment ("CaD35") derived from the C-terminus of turkey gizzard caldesmon. This 239-residue peptide contains binding sites for actin and calmodulin. Residues 1-96 of CaD35 comprise "CaD15", an actin-binding subfragment which we previously showed to resemble the tropomyosin-binding segment of troponin T. The remainder of the CaD35 sequence shows no significant similarity to other proteins. Residues 111-128 may form a basic, amphipathic helix which interacts with calmodulin.
