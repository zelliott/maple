Haplotypes of the beta-globin gene complex (Hbb) in laboratory mice have been defined as d, p, and s. We previously found a new haplotype w1 in wild mice collected from northwestern China. This study analyzed the nucleotide sequences of b1 and b2-globin gene cDNAs of both the p and w1 haplotypes, in comparison with those of the d haplotype. In Hbb-b1 cDNA, six base substitutions were found between the d and w1 haplotypes and also between p and w1, but none existed between d and p. In Hbb-b2 cDNA, three base substitutions were found between the d and w1 haplotypes and also between d and p, but none between p and w1. This result indicated that the Hbb gene complex of the p haplotype carries b1(d) and b2(w1) genes and is probably a recombinant between d and w1 haplotypes. The hemoglobin containing the W1 phenotype showed oxygen-binding properties identical with those of the hemoglobins containing D and P phenotypes.
