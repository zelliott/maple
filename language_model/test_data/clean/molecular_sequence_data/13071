We have expressed and characterized human recombinant 74-kDa (rHDC74) and 54-kDa (rHDC54) L-histidine decarboxylases (HDCs) in Sf9 cells. By immunoblot analysis, rHDC74 and rHDC54 were shown to be localized predominantly in the particulate and soluble fractions, respectively. rHDC74 exhibited histamine-synthesizing activity equivalent to that of rHDC54. The existence of 74- and 54-kDa HDCs was also confirmed in the particulate and supernatant fractions of the cell lysate, respectively, from the human basophilic leukemia cell line KU-812-F. The ratio of HDC activity to immunoreactivity was similar for the two forms of the enzyme. The specific activity of purified rHDC54 (1.12 mumol/mg/min) was comparable to those of HDCs from other mammalian tissues or cells. The purified rHDC54 was eluted as a monomer form from a Superdex-200 column; the molecular mass of the enzyme was approximately 54 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis without 2-mercaptoethanol. The HDC activity of rHDC54 significantly decreased on dialysis against buffer without pyridoxal 5'-phosphate; addition of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to the dialysate readily increased in the enzyme activity to the original activity. Taken together, these results suggest that human HDC functions as both 74- and 54-kDa forms having equivalent HDC activity, which are localized in the particulate and soluble fractions, respectively, and that the latter form exhibits its activity as a monomer form.
