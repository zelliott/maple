We investigated the effect of chronic exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on DNA methylation states (percentage of methylated cytosines (%mC)) in Polish male nonsmoking coke-oven workers and matched controls. Methylation states of gene-specific promoters (p53, p16, HIC1 and IL-6) and of Alu and LINE-1 repetitive elements, as surrogate measures of global methylation, were quantified by pyrosequencing in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). DNA methylation was evaluated in relation to PAH exposure, assessed by urinary 1-pyrenol and anti-benzo[a]pyrene diolepoxide (anti-B[a]PDE)-DNA adduct levels, a critical genetic damage from B[a]P. We also evaluated whether PAH-induced DNA methylation states were in turn associated with micronuclei in PBLs, an indicator of chromosomal instability.
