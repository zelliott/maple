The in vivo activity of ribozymes designed against mRNA coding for E. coli beta-galactosidase was tested both in intramolecular and in intermolecular conditions. When recombinant M13 phage DNA carrying on the same molecule the information for both the ribozyme and the target was transfected into bacterial cells, ribozyme activity was observed. Conversely, a ribozyme coded by a recombinant M13 vector, but targeted against an mRNA transcribed from the F episome including the remaining part of the beta-galactosidase gene, was inefficient.
