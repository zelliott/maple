Two outbreaks of rubella infections notified in the Tomsk and Kemerovo Regions were investigated. Two rubella virus strains from one patient in each outbreak were isolated and genetically characterized. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to reveal partial E1 gene sequence at a length of 915 nucleotides. Analysis indicated that the rubella virus strains circulating in the West-Siberian region belonged to international genetic 1g group, which had been first detected in Russia.
