Phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase were overexpressed in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger. Moderate overexpression of these glycolytic enzymes in A. niger N400 (3-5-fold the wild-type level), either individually or simultaneously, did not increase citric acid production by the fungus significantly. Thus, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase do not seem to contribute in a major way to flux control of the metabolism involved in the conversion of glucose to citric acid. Overexpression of phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase did not influence the activities of other enzymes in the pathway, nor did it change intermediary metabolite levels. However, in strains overexpressing phosphofructokinase, the level of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, a positive allosteric effector of phosphofructokinase, was reduced almost 2-fold compared to the wild-type strain. Measurements with purified phosphofructokinase, using substrate, product and effector concentrations found intracellularly, showed that such a reduction in the fructose-2,6-bisphosphate level could decrease the specific activity of phosphofructokinase in the cell significantly. Thus, the fungus seems to adapt to overexpression of phosphofructokinase by decreasing the specific activity of the enzyme through a reduction in the level of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.
