The tryptophan-rich peptide of gp41 (so-called gp41W), one of the two envelope glycoproteins of HIV-1, is known to play a crucial role in the fusion between this virus and the host cell membranes. The influence of lipids on this role was investigated using different lipid monolayers at the air-water interface. Gp41W affinity for the lipid monolayer was measured by following the peptide-induced variation in the lateral surface pressure and we demonstrated that gp41W binds to monolayers containing the saturated zwitterionic dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) as well as to the anionic dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) and to mixed monolayers containing DPPC and cholesterol (Chol). The secondary structure of gp41W in the presence of these lipid monolayers was determined by polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS). The data showed that gp41W was an oriented Î±-helix in the presence of DPPG. However this spectroscopic method was unable to detect the gp41W structure in the presence of DPPC and DPPC/Chol monolayer. The peptide-induced modifications of the DPPC/Chol, DPPC and DPPG monolayer morphology were analyzed by Brewster angle microscopy (BAM). The peptide-induced changes in the DPPG monolayer morphology suggest that gp41W disturbed the lipid intermolecular interactions. Furthermore the peptide delayed the condensed state of DPPC and DPPC/Chol, indicating that, although gp41W was not detected by PM-IRRAS, it was present in these lipid monolayers.
