A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and P1 contig of the proximal part of chromosome 9p centromeric of markers D9S165 and D9S304 is described. This 1.1- to 1.7-Mb portion of chromosome 9p13 was previously not physically mapped. It contains 24 genes or expressed sequence tags, five polymorphic AC repeats, and three new polymorphic single-strand conformation polymorphism variants. Several of the genes thus mapped are excellent candidates for disease-causing genes whose loci have previously been assigned to proximal 9p. Our primary interest is in the cartilage-hair hypoplasia gene (CHH) that resides within the contig between markers D9S163 and D9S1791 based on linkage evidence.
