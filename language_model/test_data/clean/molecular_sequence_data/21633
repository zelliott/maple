The O-specific polysaccharide (OPS) is a variable constituent of the lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria. The polymorphic nature of OPSs within a species is usually first defined serologically, and the current serotyping scheme for Yersinia pseudotuberculosis consists of 21 O serotypes of which 15 have been characterized genetically and structurally. Here, we present the structure and DNA sequence of Y. pseudotuberculosis O:10 OPS. The O unit consists of one residue each of d-galactopyranose, N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (2-amino-2-deoxy-d-galactopyranose) and d-glucopyranose in the backbone, with two colitose (3,6-dideoxy-l-xylo-hexopyranose) side-branch residues. This structure is very similar to that shared by Escherichia coli O111 and Salmonella enterica O35. The gene cluster sequences of these serotypes, however, have only low levels of similarity to that of Y. pseudotuberculosis O:10, although there is significant conservation of gene order. Within Y. pseudotuberculosis, the O10 structure is most closely related to the O:6 and O:7 structures.
