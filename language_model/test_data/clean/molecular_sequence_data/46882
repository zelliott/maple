Biliary glycoproteins are members of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family and behave as cell adhesion molecules. The mouse genome contains two very similar Bgp genes, Bgp1 and Bgp2, whereas the human and rat genomes contain only one BGP gene. A Bgp2 isoform was previously identified as an alternative receptor for the mouse coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus. This isoform consists of two extracellular immunoglobulin domains, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail of five amino acids. In this report, we have examined whether the Bgp2 gene can express other isoforms in different mouse tissues. We found only one other isoform, which has a long cytoplasmic tail of 73 amino acids. The long cytodomain of the Bgp2 protein is highly similar to that of the Bgp1/4L isoform. The Bgp2 protein is expressed in low amounts in kidney and in a rectal carcinoma cell line. Antibodies specific to Bgp2 detected a 42-kDa protein, which is expressed at the cell surface of these samples. Bgp2 was found by immunocytochemistry in smooth muscle layers of the kidney, the uterus, in gut mononuclear cells and in the crypt epithelia of intestinal tissues. Transfection studies showed that, in contrast with Bgp1, the Bgp2 glycoprotein was not directly involved in intercellular adhesion. However, this protein is found in the proliferative compartment of the intestinal crypts and in cells involved in immune recognition. This suggests that the Bgp2 protein represents a distinctive member of the CEA family; its unusual expression patterns in mouse tissues and the unique functions it may be fulfilling may provide novel clues about the multiple functions mediated by a common BGP protein in humans and rats.
