Previously, the transfer of a phosphoryl group between the EnvZ and OmpR proteins, which are involved in expression of the ompF and ompC genes in response to the medium osmolarity, was demonstrated in vitro. In this study, the histidine (His) residue at position 243 of the EnvZ protein, and the aspartate (Asp) residues at positions 12 and 55 of the OmpR protein were changed, respectively, by means of site-directed mutagenesis. We characterized the mutant proteins in terms of not only their in vitro phosphotransfer reactions but also their in vivo osmoregulatory phenotypes. The mutant EnvZ protein was defective in its in vitro ability not only as to EnvZ-autophosphorylation but also OmpR-phosphorylation and OmpR-dephosphorylation. This particular mutant EnvZ protein seemed to exhibit null functions as to the in vivo osmoregulatory phenotype. The mutant OmpR protein with the amino acid change at position 12 was clearly phosphorylated in vitro, but at a very low rate as compared with the wild-type OmpR protein. In vitro phosphorylation of the mutant OmpR protein with the amino acid change at position 55 was more severely affected. This mutant OmpR protein appeared to exhibit null functions as to the in vivo osmoregulatory phenotype. These results suggest that the histidine residue at position 243 of the EnvZ protein and the aspartate residues at positions 12 and 55 of the OmpR protein are deeply involved in the phosphotransfer between the EnvZ and OmpR proteins.
