Several isolates of barley yellow mosaic virus (BaYMV) from different sites in the UK, including some that were virulent on European resistant winter barley cultivars (resistance-breaking strain: BaYMV-2) and some that were not, were examined by RT-PCR, restriction mapping and sequencing of selected parts of the virus genome. Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences were determined for the 5'-terminal region, part of the NIa coding region and the coat protein coding region on RNA 1 and an area at the N-terminus of the 70-kDa protein coding region on RNA 2. The sequences differed from those previously reported for a BaYMV isolate from Japan and for two German isolates, one of which was of the BaYMV-2 strain. There were no strain-specific amino acid differences and the few, non-consecutive, nucleotide differences detected were probably not significant and were insufficient to develop a rapid diagnostic test to distinguish BaYMV-2 from other isolates. Restriction mapping of RNA 2 cDNA again showed no consistent strain-related differences. The differences previously reported between the two German isolates are probably not strain-related.
