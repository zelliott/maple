A new rod-shaped endospore-forming bacterium is described, which was isolated from the hindgut of the termite Reticulitermes santonensis (Feytaud). The isolate stains Gram negative and its DNA has a guanine-plus-cytosine content of 35 mol%. Despite the Gram-staining reaction, both biochemical and physiological features place the isolate in the genus Bacillus and indicate a phenotypic resemblance to the Bacillus firmus-lentus group of species. On the basis of comparative 16S rRNA analysis and some phenotypic features the isolate clearly represents a new species for which the name Bacillus oleronius is proposed. The type strain is Bacillus oleronius Rt 10 (DSM 9356).
