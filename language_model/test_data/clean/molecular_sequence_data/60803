The hairpin ribozyme is a small, naturally occurring RNA capable of folding into a distinct three-dimensional structure and catalyzing a specific phosphodiester transfer reaction. We have adapted a high throughput screening procedure entitled nucleotide analog interference mapping (NAIM) to identify functional groups important for proper folding and catalysis of this ribozyme. A total of 18 phosphorothioate-tagged nucleotide analogs were used to determine the contribution made by individual ribose 2'-OH and purine functional groups to the hairpin ribozyme ligation reaction. Substitution with 2'-deoxy-nucleotide analogs disrupted activity at six sites within the ribozyme, and a unique interference pattern was observed at each of the 11 conserved purine nucleotides. In most cases where such information is available, the NAIM data agree with the previously reported single-site substitution results. The interference patterns are interpreted in comparison to the isolated loop A and loop B NMR structures and a model of the intact ribozyme. These data provide biochemical evidence in support of many, but not all, of the non-canonical base-pairs observed by NMR in each loop, and identify the functional groups most likely to participate in the tertiary interface between loop A and loop B. These groups include the 2'-OH groups of A10, G11, U12, C25, and A38, the exocyclic amine of G11, and the minor groove edge of A9 and A24. The data also predict non-A form sugar pucker geometry at U39 and U41. Based upon these results, a revised model for the loop A tertiary interaction with loop B is proposed. This work defines the chemical basis of purine nucleotide conservation in the hairpin ribozyme, and provides a basis for the design and interpretation of interference suppression experiments.
