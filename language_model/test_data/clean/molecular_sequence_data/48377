Several studies have documented the process of early embryonic development in poultry; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its developmental regulation are poorly understood, particularly in ducks. In this study, we analyzed differential gene expression of embryos 6 and 25 h following oviposition to determine which genes regulate the early developmental stage in ducks. Among 216 randomly selected clones, 39 protein-encoding cDNAs that function in metabolism, transcription, transportation, proliferation/apoptosis, cell cycle, cell adhesion, and methylation were identified. Additionally, the full-length cDNA of the Nanog gene, encoding a 302-amino acid protein, was obtained. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses were performed to detect expression levels of the selected genes during early and late embryonic stages, which revealed that these genes are expressed in a particular spatial and temporal pattern. These results indicate that these genes may play pivotal roles in the process of area pellucida formation through a complex and precise regulatory network during development in duck embryos.
