Piperacillin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae was mediated by mutations in a novel gene, cpoA, that also confer transformation deficiency and a decrease in penicillin-binding protein la. cpoA is part of an operon located downstream of the primary sigma factor of S. pneumoniae. The deduced protein, CpoA, and the peptide encoded by the adjacent 3' open reading frame contained domains homologous to glycosyltransferases of procaryotes and eucaryotes that act on membrane-associated substrates, such as enzymes functioning in lipopolysaccharide core biosynthesis of gram-negative bacteria, RodD of Bacillus subtilis, which is involved in teichoic acid biosynthesis, and the human PIG-A protein, which is required for early steps of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis. This suggests that the cpo operon has a similar function related to cell surface components.
