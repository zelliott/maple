A simple and efficient method to fabricate a glycosylated surface on a polyacrylonitrile-based film is described. Construction and protein adsorption processes were monitored in situ using a QCM. A PANCHEMA film was deposited on the gold surface of the quartz crystal, and the glycosylated surface was then constructed through surface modification. Con A and BSA were used as probes to study the specificity of this surface to proteins. It can recognize Con A, while showing no specific interaction with BSA. The binding affinity indicates the presence of strong multivalent interactions between Con A and the glucose residues (cluster glycoside effect). Reproducibility and repeatability of the glycosylated polymer surface are sufficient to allow specific adsorption of Con A.
