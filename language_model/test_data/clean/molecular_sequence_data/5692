We have established a eukaryotic protein expression and purification system by using the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as the host and the glutathione S-transferase (GST) as a protein purification tag. This system provides opportunities for rapid, inexpensive, and high yield production of proteins in a eukaryotic organism. Unlike E. coli, S. pombe provides for post-translational modifications of the proteins, which are often critical for the structure and function of eukaryotic proteins. Two vectors have been constructed for protein expression in S. pombe, pESP-1 and pESP-2. Both vectors use the nmt1 promoter for constitutive or induced expression of the gene of interest. Expressed GST-tagged proteins are easily and rapidly purified using glutathione agarose beads. The GST tag can be removed from the fusion proteins by treatment with either the thrombin or enterokinase protease. Proteins expressed from the pESP-2 vector will yield native amino acid sequence when the GST tag is removed by treatment with enterokinase. Nine proteins have been purified by using the system with yields ranging from 1.0 mg/l to 12.5 mg/l of induced culture.
