We have developed a series of murine monoclonal antibodies to a region of the 120 kD envelope glycoprotein (gp120) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). This region has previously been implicated as a site for virus neutralization by antisera raised to recombinant proteins and by antibodies made to full-length gp120 purified from virus. The antigen employed was a synthetic peptide containing 15 amino acids, representing amino acid residues 308-322, RIQRGPGRAFVTIGK, of env gp120 (HTLV-IIIB isolate). Five of the monoclonal antibodies raised to this antigen have reactivity with gp120 from divergent strains of HIV-1 in Western blot assays. The two of these five which were tested with live cells infected with the divergent HIV-1 isolates IIIB, MN, and RF were specifically reactive by fluorescence analyses with cells infected with the MN and IIIB isolates. Four of the five monoclonal antibodies blocked the fusion of IIIB-infected cells with uninfected MOLT-4 target cells. The monoclonal antibody most reactive with MN-infected cells by fluorescence, #5025A, blocked the fusion of MN-infected cells with uninfected MOLT-4 cells. Four of the five monoclonal antibodies neutralized the IIIB isolate of HIV-1 in vitro, but none neutralized the MN or RF isolates at the levels of antibody tested (less than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml). Taken together these data indicate that monoclonal antibodies to the immunodominant neutralizing domain of HIV-1 gp120 display different levels of group reactivity depending on the assay system being examined.
