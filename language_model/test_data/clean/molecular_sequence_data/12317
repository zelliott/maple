Cloning and characterization of the gor gene of the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus, encoding glutathione reductase, are described in this paper. This enzyme is a part of the enzymatic defences against oxidative stress in eukaryotic cells and in Gram-negative bacteria, but was never found in Gram-positive bacteria before this study. The amino acid sequence shares extensive similarities with glutathione reductases from other organisms, e.g. 62% amino acid identity with Escherichia coli protein. Northern blot analysis and glutathione reductase enzyme assays gave evidence that the gene is expressed in aerobically growing cells.
