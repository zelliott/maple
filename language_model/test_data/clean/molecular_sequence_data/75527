Isolated light chains of IgM-type immunoglobulins of carcharhine sharks were analyzed by serological and biochemical means. When analyzed by isoelectric focusing analysis, light chains of the tiger shark (Galecerdo cuvieri), the galapagos shark (Carcharhinus galapagensis) and the sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) showed a broad, but patterned, spectrum of bands ranging from pI 5.0 to 7.7 in which discrete families were observed. Serologically, light chains of the galapagos shark cross-reacted with rabbit antibodies against mouse immunoglobulin and a synthetic peptide corresponding to the J segment of T cell receptor beta chain. The latter cross-reaction is shared among light chains and T cell receptors. Although there was considerable heterogeneity in isoelectric focusing analysis, the light chains were homogeneous on the basis of apparent mass (23 kDa) and those of tiger shark and galapagos shark had relatively homogeneous dominant N-terminal sequences representing the first framework. The N-terminal sequences of these two shark light chains, were strongly homologous to one another and showed 75% identity to certain V kappa sequences of man and dog. Homology was also shown to V lambda sequences, but the degree of identity was approximately 50%. Following cleavage of the tiger shark light chain with o-iodosobenzoic acid which cleaves at tryptophanyl residues, a constant region peptide was isolated by gel filtration. It was possible to identify the homolog of this peptide within the constant regions of mammalian kappa and lambda chain, but the relationship to C kappa chain was stronger. The degree of identity among the corresponding C region peptides of mammalian, avian and elasmobranch species was much less than that observed for the framework 1 sequence of the light chain variable region. These data support the concept that variable and J region sequence have been conserved in the evolution of placoderm-derived vertebrates, but that constant regions show much greater phylogenetic variation.
