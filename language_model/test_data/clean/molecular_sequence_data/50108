The function of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins in cell differentiation was shown to be conserved from Drosophila to vertebrates, exemplified by the function of MyoD in striated muscle differentiation. In phylogeny striated muscle tissue appears first in jellyfish and the question of its evolutionary position is controversially discussed. For this reason we have studied the developmental role of myogenic bHLH genes in medusa development. Based on their dimerization ability, four genes of the bHLH family of transcription factors were isolated from the hydrozoan jellyfish Podocoryne carnea. While the proteins Id and Ash group with cognate family members from bilaterians, Net-like and JellyD1 could not be unequivocally classified. Id is expressed during the medusa budding process and in the adult medusa, Ash and Net-like are expressed in all life cycle stages from egg to adult medusa and JellyD1 is expressed in the blastula and gastrula stages, the planula larva, and in late medusa bud stages. The dimerization specificity, the expression pattern, and the conservation of two residues specific for a MyoD bHLH domain suggest that JellyD1 is related to an ancestral MyoD gene. Id, Net-like, and JellyD1 are either expressed in the entocodon or its derived tissues, the striated and smooth muscle of the bell. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that the entocodon is a mesoderm-like structure and that the common ancestor of Cnidaria and Bilateria was more complex in cell-type architecture and body organization than commonly thought.
