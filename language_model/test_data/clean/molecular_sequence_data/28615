A molecular phylogeny of the rodent superfamily Cavioidea was derived using two nuclear sequences (exon #10 of the growth hormone receptor gene and intron #1 of the transthyretin gene) and one mitochondrial gene (12S rRNA). A combined analysis produced a highly derived and well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis that differed from traditional taxonomy primarily in the placement of two taxa. Kerodon, traditionally included within the subfamily Caviinae with guinea pigs and its relatives, is placed sister to the family Hydrochaeridae and closely aligned with the subfamily Dolichotinae. Inclusion of Hydrochaeris within the Caviidae renders the familial classification paraphyletic. Our data further support the taxonomic separation of the families Agoutidae and Dasyproctidae. Both the molecular and traditional morphological interpretations are assessed in testing an ecological constraints hypothesis regarding social behaviors. Whereas traditional taxonomy is consistent with an environmental constraints explanation for social behavior, the molecular data suggest that phylogenetic effects may be a more important factor in the evolution of social behavior in this group. Although lineage-specific rate heterogeneity was identified in all three molecular data sets, no significant support was obtained for the metabolic rate hypothesis. However, both nuclear genes displayed patterns in accordance with the generation time hypothesis.
