We analyzed the enzymatic properties of duck egg-white lysozyme II (DEL), which differs from hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) in nineteen amino acid substitutions. A substrate binding study showed that DEL binds to the substrate analog at subsites A-C in the same manner as HEL. However, the experimental time-courses of DEL against the substrate N-acetylglucosamine pentamer, (GlcNAc)(5), revealed remarkably enhanced production of (GlcNAc)(2) and reduced production of (GlcNAc)(1) as compared to in the case of HEL. Computer simulation of the DEL-catalyzed reaction suggested that the amino acid substitutions at subsites E and F (Phe34 to Tyr and Asn37 to Ser) caused the great alteration in the time-courses of DEL. Subsequently, the enzymatic reactions of mutants, in which Phe34 and Asn37 in HEL were converted to Tyr and Ser, respectively, were characterized. The time-courses of the F34Y mutant exhibited profiles similar to those of HEL. In contrast, the characteristics of the N37S mutant were different from those of HEL and rather similar to those of DEL; the order of the amounts of (GlcNAc)(1) and (GlcNAc)(2) was reversed in comparison with in the case of HEL. Enhanced production of (GlcNAc)(2) was also observed for the mutant protein, F34Y/N37S, with two substitutions. These results indicated that the substitution of Asn37 with Ser can account, at least in part, for the characteristic time-courses of DEL. Moreover, replacement of Asn37 with Ser reduced the rate constant of transglycosylation. The substitution of the Asn37 residue may affect the transglycosylation activity of HEL.
