The effect of different carbon sources on the expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae of the SWA2 alpha-amylase gene from Schwanniomyces occidentalis was studied from constructs containing its 5' region (-223 to +15), which were fused in-frame to the lacZ gene coding sequence. Maximal expression was achieved with the non-fermentable substrates ethanol and/or glycerol, whereas lower levels were found with maltose or galactose. In contrast, glucose repressed it, even in the presence of any of these other carbon sources. Deletion analyses of the -233 to -85 SWA2 promoter region permitted the identification of two fragments involved in both glucose repression and ethanol activation. A possible region required for cAMP regulation was localised. The SWA2 promoter contains a MIG1-binding GC box whose deletion caused a five-fold increase in the glucose-repressed reporter expression. Despite this, expression of the SWA2 promoter was not MIG1-dependent.
