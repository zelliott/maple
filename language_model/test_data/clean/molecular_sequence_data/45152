Female, non-smoker, Asian ethnicity and adenocarcinoma histology are the major clinical predictors of gefitinib response in non-small cell lung cancer, as shown in previous studies. Recently, response to gefitinib has been associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Higher rates of mutation were seen in females, patients with adenocarcinomas, the Asian population and never-smokers, which may explain the clinical response predictors. The presence of diffuse micronodular pulmonary metastasis on chest imaging as a novel clinical predictor of its response is proposed here. Two cases of lung adenocarcinomas in men presenting with diffuse micronodular pulmonary metastasis were encountered. Both patients showed a major response to gefitinib. The dramatic reduction of micronodular pulmonary nodules throughout both lungs on computed tomography scans was achieved after treatment for a couple of months with 250 mg of oral gefitinib. In the molecular analysis, one patient had a heterozygous delL746-A750 mutation and the other had a heterozygous L858R EGFR mutation. In conclusion, patients with lung adenocarcinoma, even men, who presented with bilateral diffuse micronodular metastatic spread to the lungs tended to have an activated EGFR mutation. Therefore, they are most likely to receive benefits from molecular target drugs such as gefitinib and possibly erlotinib.
