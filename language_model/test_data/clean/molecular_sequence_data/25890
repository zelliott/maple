The core histone gene family of Aspergillus nidulans was characterized. The H2A, H2B and H3 genes are unique in the A. nidulans genome. In contrast there are two H4 genes, H4.1 and H4.2. As previously reported for the H2A gene (May and Morris 1987) introns also interrupt the other core histone genes. The H2B gene, like the H2A gene, is interrupted by three introns, the H3 and H4.1 gene are each interrupted by two introns and the H4.2 gene contains one intron. The position of the single intron in H4.2 is the same as that the first intron of the H4.1 gene. The H2A and H2B genes are arranged as a gene pair separated by approximately 600 bp and are divergently transcribed. The H3 and H4.1 genes are similarly arranged and are separated by approximately 800 bp. The H4.2 gene is not closely linked to either the H2A-H2B or H3-H4.1 gene pairs. Using pulse field gel electrophoresis an electrophoretic karyotype was established for A. nidulans. This karyotype was used to assign the H3-H4.1 gene pair and the H4.2 gene to linkage group VIII and the H2A-H2B gene pair to either linkage group III or VI. The abundance of each of the histone messenger RNAs was determined to be cell cycle regulated but the abundance of the H4.2 mRNA appears to be regulated differently from the others.
