The sixth complement protein (C6) is an essential component of the membrane attack complex (MAC); the end product of the lytic pathway of complement activation. The MAC complex constitutes a supramolecular assembly containing the five precursor proteins C5b, C6, C7, C8, and C9. Once assembled on the target surface it forms transmembrane channels that cause membrane damage and cytolysis of complement-opsonized pathogens. Besides mediating direct pathogen elimination, exposure of cells to sublytic doses of MAC can trigger diverse cellular responses such as, cell activation, induction of apoptosis, cell cycle re-entry and proliferation in various biological settings. The terminal complement components (C6-C9) are structurally related proteins, differing in size and complexity. In order to study their evolution, we report here the cloning and molecular characterization of C6 component in rainbow trout. The deduced amino acid sequence of trout C6 exhibits 55 and 44% identity with zebra fish and human orthologs, respectively. The 'domain' architecture of trout C6 resembles that of mammalian counterparts, and the cysteine backbone is also conserved. Finally, trout C6 gene appears to exist as a single copy in the trout genome, and is expressed in a wide range of trout tissues.
