An amino acid sequence essential for microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) to bind to microtubules is presented [Aizawa et al. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5885-5890]. A synthetic peptide of 23 amino acid residues which corresponded to the sequence [tubulin binding peptide (TBP)] was active in binding to tubulin and inducing its assembly. The TBP-tubulin interaction mechanism was analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as a simplified model for MAP-microtubule interactions. Intraresidue transferred nuclear Overhauser effects (TRNOEs) of TBP in TBP-tubulin mixtures were analyzed, and strong binding of two Val and two Lys residues of TBP to tubulin was detected. Among the sharply peaked signals from tubulin aromatic residues, those due to Tyr ring protons broadened upon mixing with TBP, suggesting the involvement of Tyr residue(s) in the binding with TBP. Irradiation of the tubulin Tyr protons resulted in an intermolecular TRNOE at TBP methyl proton resonances. Evidently, hydrophobic interactions between Val and Tyr residues are important for the binding of TBP to tubulin. Hydrophobic interactions have not been taken into account previously in the widely accepted electrostatic model for the binding of MAPs to microtubules.
