Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and has been used as an animal model for study of the human demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis (MS).  EAE is characterized by pathologic infiltration of mononuclear cells into the CNS and by clinical manifestation of paralytic disease.  Similar to MS, EAE is also under genetic control in that certain mouse strains are susceptible to disease induction while others are resistant.  Typically, C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) mice immunized with myelin basic protein (MBP) fail to develop paralytic signs.  This unresponsiveness is certainly not due to defects in antigen processing or antigen presentation of MBP, as an experimental protocol described here had been used to induce severe EAE in C57BL/6 mice as well as other reputed resistant mouse strains.  In addition, encephalitogenic T cell clones from C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice reactive to MBP had been successfully isolated and propagated.    The experimental protocol involves using a cellular adoptive transfer system in which MBP-primed (200 μg/mouse) C57BL/6 donor lymph node cells are isolated and cultured for five days with the antigen to expand the pool of MBP-specific T cells.  At the end of the culture period, 50 million viable cells are transferred into naive syngeneic recipients through the tail vein.  Recipient mice so treated normally do not develop EAE, thus reaffirming their resistant status, and they can remain normal indefinitely.  Ten days post cell transfer, recipient mice are challenged with complete Freund adjuvant (CFA)-emulsified MBP in four sites in the flanks.  Severe EAE starts to develop in these mice ten to fourteen days after challenge.  Results showed that the induction of disease was antigenic specific as challenge with irrelevant antigens did not induce clinical signs of disease.  Significantly, a titration of the antigen dose used to challenge the recipient mice showed that it could be as low as 5 μg/mouse.  In addition, a kinetic study of the timing of antigenic challenge showed that challenge to induce disease was effective as early as 5 days post antigenic challenge and as long as over 445 days post antigenic challenge.  These data strongly point toward the involvement of a "long-lived" T cell population in maintaining unresponsiveness.  The involvement of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in this system is not defined.
