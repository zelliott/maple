Cloning and sequence analysis of a DNA complementary to the mRNA expressed in undifferentiated mouse F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells but disappearing rapidly after treatment with a tumor-promoting phorbol ester revealed it to be a 1.9 kilobase pairs-long cDNA encoding a protein of 323 amino acid residues. Computer-assisted analyses of the deduced amino acid sequence indicated that this protein contains a typical hydrophobic signal peptide consisting of 33 amino acid residues and six putative membrane-spanning segments. The deduced amino acid sequence, as a whole, bears no significant sequence homology to any previously described protein.
