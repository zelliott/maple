We have cloned two novel C-terminal motor domain-type kinesin superfamily motor proteins (KIFCs) from mouse brain by utilizing a KIFC-specific consensus sequence. The first protein was the murine homologue of CHO2 antigen, a member of the kar3-type mitotic motor subfamily, and we designated this protein KIFC1. The other protein, KIFC2 (792 amino acids), is novel, with no significant similarity to known kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs). KIFC2 was specifically expressed in adult neurons, and was immunofluorescently localized to punctate structures in cell bodies and dendrites, but was not detected in axons. Electron microscopic analysis of the immunoisolated KIFC2-bound organelles revealed that KIFC2 associates with multivesicular body (mvb)-like organelles, suggesting that KIFC2 functions as the motor for the transport of mvb-like organelles in dendrites.
