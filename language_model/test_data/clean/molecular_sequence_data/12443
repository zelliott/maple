The substrate specificity of alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase (EC 3.2.1.55) from Bacillus subtilis 3-6 was explored using methyl 2-O-, methyl 3-O-, and methyl 5-O-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranosides, and methyl 3,5-di-O-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside. The enzyme hydrolyzed the methyl alpha-L-arabinofuranobiosides to arabinose and methyl alpha-L-arabinofuranoside in the order of (1-->2)- > (1-->3)- > (1-->5)-linkages. The enzyme hydrolyzed the (1-->3)-linkage more than the (1-->5)-linkage of the methyl alpha-L-arabinofuranotrioside.
