We have isolated and characterized complete cDNAs for two isoforms (HSPDE4D4 and HSPDE4A5) encoded by the human PDE4D gene, one of four genes that encode cAMP-specific rolipram-inhibited 3',5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (type IVPDEs; PDE4 family). The HSPDE4D4 and HSPDE4D5 cDNAs encode proteins of 810 and 746 amino acids respectively. A comparison of the nucleotide sequences of these two cDNAs with those encoding the three other human PDE4D proteins (HSPDE4D1, HSPDE4D2 and HSPDE4D3) demonstrates that each corresponding mRNA transcript has a unique region of sequence at or near its 5'-end, consistent with alternative mRNA splicing. Transient expression of the five cDNAs in monkey COS-7 cells produced proteins of apparent molecular mass under denaturing conditions of 68, 68, 95, 119 and 105 kDa for isoforms HSPDE4D1-5 respectively. Immunoblotting of human cell lines and rat brain demonstrated the presence of species that co-migrated with the proteins produced in COS-7 cells. COS-cell-expressed and native HSPDE4D1 and HSPDE4D2 were found to exist only in the cytosol, whereas HSPDE4D3, HSPDE4D4 and HSPDE4D5 were found in both cytosolic and particulate fractions. The IC50 values for the selective PDE4 inhibitor rolipram for the cytosolic forms of the five enzymes were similar (0.05-0.14 microM), whereas they were 2-7-fold higher for the particulate forms of HSPDE4D3 and HSPDE4D5 (0.32 and 0.59 microM respectively), than for the corresponding cytosolic forms. Our data indicate that the N-terminal regions of the HSPDE4D3, HSPDE4D4 and HSPDE4D5 proteins, which are derived from alternatively spliced regions of their mRNAs, are important in determining their subcellular localization, activity and differential sensitivity to inhibitors.
