The cbl (cysB-like) gene has been identified in Escherichia coli. The analysis of the cloned cbl sequence revealed strict homology to an ORF of unknown function found initially in Klebsiella aerogenes [Schwacha and Bender, J. Bacteriol. 175 (1993) 2107-2115]. The predicted Cbl protein has structural features of the LysR family of transcriptional activators. It is also strongly similar to the CysB protein, the activator of the cys regulon. The position of cbl on the Ec physical map has been established at a 2070-kb (43.5 min) region between asnU and asnV. The gene is expressed in vivo as a 1-kb monocistronic transcript starting from one major transcription start point. Unexpectedly, the in vivo expression of cbl has shown dependence on CysB, belonging to the same family of proteins. The promoter region of cbl binds purified CysB protein in a manner similar to other CysB-responsive promoters. A cbl disruption mutant was constructed by insertion of a KmR gene cartridge into the ORF on the chromosome. Phenotypes related to cbl expression suggest the involvement of the gene in an accessory regulatory circuit within the cys regulon engaging, in the last step, the function of the cysM gene encoding O-acetylserine (thiol)-lyase B.
