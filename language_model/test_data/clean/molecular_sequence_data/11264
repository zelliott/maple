A second glutathione reductase (GR) cDNA has been cloned and sequenced from pea (Pisum sativum L. cv. Birte). This new GR cDNA (GOR2) does not encode a pre-protein with a transit peptide and therefore is most likely to represent a cytosolic GR. It is significantly different at the DNA level from the previously cloned chloroplastidial/mitochondrial pea GR (GOR1), but retains the features characteristic of GRs from all sources and has GR activity when expressed in Escherichia coli. GOR2 maps to linkage group 6 on the pea genome map and it seems likely that this is the only locus for this gene. In contrast to GOR1, transcript levels of GOR2 increase in the recovery (post-stress) phases of both drought and chilling by about ten- and three-fold respectively. GOR2 therefore may play a role in the restoration of the post-stress redox state of the cytosolic glutathione pool.
