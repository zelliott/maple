The activation of enzymatic oxylipin biosynthesis upon wounding, herbivory and pathogen attack depends on the biochemical activation of lipases that make polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) available to lipoxygenases (LOXs). The identity and number of the lipases involved in this process remain controversial and they probably differ among plant species. Analysis of transgenic Nicotiana attenuata plants (ir-gla1) stably reduced in the expression of the NaGLA1 gene showed that this plastidial glycerolipase is a major supplier of trienoic fatty acids for jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis in leaves and roots after wounding and simulated herbivory, but not during infection with the oomycete Phytophthora parasitica (var. nicotianae). NaGLA1 was not essential for the developmental control of JA biosynthesis in flowers and for the biosynthesis of C(6) volatiles by the hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) pathway; however, it affected the metabolism of divinyl ethers (DVEs) early during infection with P. parasitica (var. nicotianae) and the accumulation of NaDES1 and NaLOX1 mRNAs. Profiling of lysolipids by LC-MS/MS was consistent with a rapid activation of NaGLA1 and indicated that this lipase utilizes different lipid classes as substrates. The results revealed the complexity and specificity of the regulation of lipase-mediated oxylipin biosynthesis, highlighting the existence of pathway- and stimulus-specific lipases.
