The levels of integron abundance and diversity in soil amended with pig slurry were studied. Real-time PCR illustrated a significant increase in class 1 integron prevalence after slurry application, with increased prevalence still evident at 10 months after application. Culture-dependent data revealed 10 genera, including putative human pathogens, carrying class 1 and 2 integrons.
