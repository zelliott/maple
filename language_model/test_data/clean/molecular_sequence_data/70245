Synthetic D-rhamnan, with the structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa common polysaccharide antigen (CPA), was conjugated with BSA. The artificial antigen obtained, and the natural antigens, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of P. aeruginosa and Pseudomonas cerasi with rhamnan chains of the same structure, were studied by ELISA with rabbit antibodies to the D-rhamnan-BSA conjugate and to the P. cerasi O-antigen. Immunological relations between the LPS of P. aeruginosa and P. cerasi determined by CPA as well as between these LPS and D-rhamnan-BSA were revealed by ELISA. O-antiserum to P. cerasi possesses protective activity in the mouse passive protection test when mice are challenged with some P. aeruginosa strains; the antiserum to the D-rhamnan-BSA does not possess protective activity in mice.
