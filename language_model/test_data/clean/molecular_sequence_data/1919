Physiological dependence and associated withdrawal episodes can constitute a powerful motivational force that perpetuates drug use and abuse. Using robust behavioral models of drug physiological dependence in mice, positional cloning, and sequence and expression analyses, we identified an addiction-relevant quantitative trait gene, Mpdz. Our findings provide a framework to define the protein interactions and neural circuit by which this gene's product (multiple PDZ domain protein) affects drug dependence, withdrawal and relapse.
