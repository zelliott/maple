Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV; genus Dianthovirus) and Turnip rosette virus (TRoV; genus Sobemovirus) are taxonomically and ecologically distinct plant viruses. In addition, the two genera differ in the role of coat protein (CP) in cell-to-cell movement. However, both are small icosahedral viruses requiring CP for systemic movement in the host vasculature. Here, we show that the TRoV CP gene is capable of facilitating the vascular movement of a Dianthovirus. Substitution of the RCNMV CP gene with the TRoV CP gene permits movement of the resulting chimeric virus to non-inoculated leaves. RCNMV lacking a CP gene or containing a non-translatable TRoV CP gene do not move systemically. This report introduces the molecular characterization of TRoV and describes the unprecedented complementation of systemic movement function by intergenic complete substitution of a plant virus CP gene.
