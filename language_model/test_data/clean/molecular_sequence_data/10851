The mouse c-src gene contains a short neuron-specific exon, N1. To characterize the sequences that regulate N1 splicing, we used a heterologous gene, derived from the human beta-globin gene, containing a short internal exon that is usually skipped by the splicing machinery. Various fragments from the src gene were inserted into the globin substrate to measure their effects on the splicing of the test exon. These clones were transiently expressed in neuronal and nonneuronal cell lines, and the level of exon inclusion was measured by primer extension. Several sequences from the N1 exon region induced the splicing of the heterologous exon. The most powerful effect was seen with a sequence from the intron downstream of the N1 exon. This sequence acted as a strong splicing enhancer, activating splicing of the test exon when placed in the intron downstream. The enhancer was strongest in neuronal LA-N-5 cells but also activated splicing in nonneuronal HEK293 cells. Deletion and linker scanning mutagenesis indicate that the enhancer is made up of multiple smaller elements that must act in combination. One of these elements was identified as the sequence UGCAUG. Three copies of this element can strongly activate splicing of the test exon in LA-N-5 neuroblastoma cells. These component elements of the src splicing enhancer are also apparently involved in the splicing of other short cassette exons.
