The molten globule structure of equine beta-lactoglobulin has been inferred from the hydrogen exchange protection of the backbone amide protons. In order to make it possible to measure the hydrogen exchange kinetics of the individual backbone amide protons, the uniformly (15)N-labeled recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and the NMR peak assignment was obtained for most of the backbone protons. The chemical shift and NOE results obtained under the condition where the protein assumes the native structure are fully consistent with the known secondary structure of bovine beta-lactoglobulin, indicating that the equine protein has a similar native conformation to that of the bovine protein. The hydrogen exchange rate of the individual backbone amide protons was measured under the conditions where the protein assumes the native and molten globule states. In the native state, strong protection was observed for the residues located in the eight (A to H) strands, which form a barrel structure, and residues of a major helix. In the molten globule state at acidic pH conditions, significant protection from the exchange has been observed for residues located in the A, F, G and H strands in the native structure. The pattern of protection is consistent with a native-like beta-sheet formation by these strands. The residues located in a major helix of the native structure are also protected, suggesting that this helix is formed in the molten globule and is packed against the sheet as in the native structure. These results indicate that a native-like subdomain is formed in the molten globule state of equine beta-lactoglobulin.
