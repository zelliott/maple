The HSS3/4 enhancer of Crlz1-IgJ locus was first characterized with regard to the activity of HSS1 IgJ promoter in the plasma cells, where both of HSS3/4 enhancer and HSS1 IgJ promoter were found to be opened simultaneously to drive the IgJ gene expression. Unexpectedly, the HSS3/4 enhancer was also found to be opened in the pre-B cells. However, this opening of HSS3/4 enhancer in the pre-B cells could not be related to the IgJ gene expression, because neither the IgJ promoter was opened nor its gene was expressed at the pre-B cell stage of B cell development. Instead, it was postulated that the opened HSS3/4 enhancer might act on some other nearby promoter in pre-B cells, which is now guessed to be the Crlz1 promoter located at 22.5 kb from it. In consistence with this pre-B cell-specific opening of the HSS3/4 enhancer, a pre-B cell-specific in vivo footprint on a sequence similar to the EBF-binding consensus was detected within the enhancer. In this paper, we show that the protein causing the pre-B cell-specific in vivo footprint on a sequence similar to the EBF-binding consensus is truly EBF as judged by EMSA using various oligo-DNA competitors and anti-EBF antibodies. Also, as expected from other previous reports, EBF was shown to be expressed highly in pre-B cells, but very little or not in immature B, mature B and plasma cells using both the cell lines and FACS-sorted normal primary cells. Convincingly, mutations within the EBF site of HSS3/4 enhancer were shown to significantly impair the HSS3/4 enhancer activity in the pre-B cells, but not in the plasma cells.
