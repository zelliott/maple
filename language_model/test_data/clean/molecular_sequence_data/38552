The effects of various saccharides on the reaction of cycloinulo-oligosaccharide fructanotransferase with cycloinu-lohexaose were examined. In addition to beta-D-fructofuranosides and methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside, D-mannose and L-sorbose were found to be effective acceptors in the reactions, and they enhanced the hydrolytic activity as effectively as methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside. Hetero-tetrasaccharides were isolated as the major transfer products from both reaction mixtures. The isolates were identified by NMR spectroscopy as beta-inulotriosyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside and 1-O-beta-inulotriosyl-alpha-L-sorbopyranose. Methyl beta-D-glucopyranoside was slightly effective and methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside was not effective at all as the acceptor, but these saccharides strongly enhanced the hydrolytic activity. D-Glucosamine inhibited the enzyme activity.
