The analogues of the homopyrimidine oligonucleotide dT15 has been synthesized. The analogues, contains phosphorothioate bonds of a mixture of diastereoisomers or one of the two stereoisomer (either Rp or Sp). The analogues were mixed under conditions conductive to the formation of triple stranded assemblies. The mixtures were characterized by their thermal stabilities (Tm values) and CD spectra.
