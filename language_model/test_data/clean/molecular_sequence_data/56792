The amino acid sequence of the rat 60S ribosomal subunit protein L36 was deduced from the sequence of nucleotides in a recombinant cDNA. Ribosomal protein L36 has 104 amino acids, the NH2-terminal methionine is removed after translation of the mRNA and has a molecular weight of 12,128. Hybridization of the cDNA to digests of nuclear DNA suggests that there are 8 to 11 copies of the L36 gene. The mRNA for the protein is about 500 nucleotides in length. Rat L36 is related to yeast ribosomal protein YL39.
