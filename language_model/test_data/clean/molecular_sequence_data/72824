We have isolated and sequenced a 2388 bp polyubiquitin encoding genomic DNA from Acanthamoeba encompassing two complete and one incomplete ubiquitin units. Codon usage frequency shows extreme bias. The deduced amino acid sequences of each unit are identical to each other and the same as that deduced from a previously sequenced Acanthamoeba castellanii cDNA. The upstream region of this gene, which contained some putative regulatory modules, was recovered by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification and subcloning. This upstream fragment was ligated to the CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) gene in a eukaryotic expression plasmid and successfully applied to the establishment of an Acanthamoeba transient transfection system. Transfection was performed by electroporation and the optimal voltage was 4500 volts/cm at capacitance 25 microF. DEAE-dextran (25 microg/ml) added into the electroporation buffer increased the transfection efficiency by about 45%. The CAT activity was proportional to the amount of DNA transfected and reached the peak level 48 h after transfection. CAT assays showed that the polyubiquitin gene upstream fragment contains a functional promoter which is about 2.5 times as strong as a viral RSV-LTR promoter when driving CAT expression in Acanthamoeba.
