The temporal expression of the early growth response gene (EGR-1) is one molecular mechanism for both maximal activation of the G alpha i-2 gene and accelerated growth in mitotically active predifferentiated LLC-PK1 renal cells. These events are dependent on an enhancer area in the 5'-flanking region of the G alpha i-2 gene that contains an EGR-1 motif (5'-CGCCCCCGC-3'). However, acquisition of the polarized phenotype in LLC-PK1 cells is accompanied by loss of EGR-1 expression and occupancy of the EGR-1 site by nuclear binding proteins other than EGR-1. We now demonstrate that one of these binding proteins is the Wilms' tumor suppressor (WT1). Furthermore, the temporal expression of WT1 in LLC-PK1 cells acquiring the polarized phenotype represses both G alpha i-2 gene activation and growth in these cells. These findings suggest the existence of differentiation-induced pathways in LLC-PK1 cells that alternatively abrogates EGR-1 and promotes WT1 gene expression, thereby modulating a target protooncogene G alpha i-2 that is participatory for growth and differentiation in renal cells. These studies emphasize the usefulness of the LLC-PK1 renal cell as a model to elucidate normal programs of genetic differentiation in which WT1 participates.
