The retaining endo-1,3-β-d-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.39) was isolated from the crystalline styles of the commercially available Vietnamese edible mussel Perna viridis. It catalyzes hydrolysis of β-1,3-bonds in glucans and enables to catalyze a transglycosylation reaction. Resources of mass-spectrometry for analysis of enzymatic products were studied. cDNA sequence of endo-1,3-β-d-glucanase was determined by RT-PCR in conjunction with the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) methods. The cDNA of 1380bp contains an open reading frame of 1332bp encoding a mature protein of 328 amino acids. On basis of amino acid sequence analysis endo-1,3-β-d-glucanase was classified as a glycoside hydrolase of family 16.
