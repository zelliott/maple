Endogenous chitinase plays a positive role in the pathogenicity of Bacillus thuringiensis to insect pests. The chitinase gene was cloned from B. thuringiensis serovar alesti strain HD-16, and the deduced 676 amino acid sequence showed a high degree of similarity with other Bacillus chitinases. Additionally, the deduced amino acid sequence showed that the protein contained an amino terminus signal peptide and consisted of a catalytic domain, a fibronectin type III domain and a chitin-binding domain. All three domains showed conserved sequences when compared to other bacterial chitinase or cellulase sequences.
