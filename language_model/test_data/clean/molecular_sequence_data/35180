A stock of 148 Cryptosporidium parvum DNA extracts from lambs and goat kids selected from a previous study examining the occurrence of Cryptosporidium species and GP60 subtypes in diarrheic lambs and goat kids in northeastern Spain was further characterized by a multilocus fragment typing approach with six mini- and microsatellite loci. Various degrees of polymorphism were seen at all but the MS5 locus, although all markers exhibited two major alleles accounting for more than 75% of isolates. A total of 56 multilocus subtypes (MLTs) from lambs (48 MLTs) and goat kids (11 MLTs) were identified. Individual isolates with mixed MLTs were detected on more than 25% of the farms, but most MLTs (33) were distinctive for individual farms, revealing the endemicity of cryptosporidial infections on sheep and goat farms. Comparison with a previous study in calves in northern Spain using the same six-locus subtyping scheme showed the presence of host-associated alleles, differences in the identity of major alleles, and very little overlap in MLTs between C. parvum isolates from lambs and those from calves (1 MLT) or isolates from lambs and those from goat kids (3 MLTs). The Hunter-Gaston index of the multilocus technique was 0.976 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.970 to 0.982), which supports its high discriminatory power for strain typing and epidemiological tracking. Population analyses revealed the presence of two host-associated subpopulations showing epidemic clonality among the C. parvum isolates infecting calves and lambs/goat kids, respectively, although evidence of genetic flow between the two subpopulations was also detected.
