We have isolated a 3922-base pair (bp) cDNA clone for rat nonerythroid alpha-spectrin from a rat kidney lambda gt11 cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that this cDNA contains an open reading frame of 3090 bp encoding for the C-terminal 1030 amino acid sequence of rat kidney alpha-spectrin. The 3'-untranslated region (including a 38-bp poly(A+) tail) contains an 832-bp sequence. A single mRNA of about 8 kilobase pairs was detected in rat liver, kidney, brain, heart, intestine, lung, testis, stomach, spleen, and muscle with varying abundances, which is consistent with and further confirms the presence of spectrins in nonerythroid tissues as demonstrated previously by immunoblot analysis. Southern blot analysis suggested that there is a single gene for nonerythroid alpha-spectrin. The derived amino acid sequence contains sequence from the spectrin 106-residue internal repeat 12 to the C terminus of rat kidney alpha-spectrin. Sequence comparison with human and chicken nonerythroid alpha-spectrin showed that nonerythroid alpha-spectrin is well conserved during evolution. The rat kidney alpha-spectrin sequence, when compared to rat brain alpha-spectrin, contains an extra 76-amino-acid sequence at the C terminus. Sequence comparison of all the internal repeats available revealed that the internal repeat 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 has highest sequence similarity with internal repeat 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17, respectively. Therefore, internal repeats 3-8 and 12-17 are most likely derived from an ancestral gene through gene duplication, suggesting that the spectrin gene is derived from a half-spectrin gene by gene duplication and divergence during evolution.
