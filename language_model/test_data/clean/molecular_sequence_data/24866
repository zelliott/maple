To identify novel tumor suppressor genes at chromosome 3p24-26 in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).

Twenty epithelial-derived expressed sequence tags (EST) were selected from chromosome 3p24-26. RT-PCR and Northern blot were used to detect the expression of the ESTs in NPC cell line, HNE-1, and primary cultures of normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. One EST, which was substantially downregulated in the HNE-1 cell line, was detected in 19 NPC biopsy samples. cDNA library screening was used to get its full sequence and the sequence of this novel gene was analyzed.

A novel gene located at chromosome 3p25.3 was obtained and named NAG-7. It was downregulated in 26.3% (5/19) of NPC biopsy samples. Its 1677 bp full length cDNA had a potential open reading frame predicting a 94 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 11,023.87 Dalton. Analysis of the NAG-7 gene showed that it was a transmembrane protein containing a protein kinase C phosphorylation site and a myristyl site. It has no significant homology to any reported genes in the database of GenBank.

NAG-7 is a novel gene downregulated in NPC, suggesting that it may be involved in the development of NPC.
