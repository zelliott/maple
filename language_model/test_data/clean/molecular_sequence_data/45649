POU1F1 (PIT-1/GHF-1) is a transcription factor with critical role in the transcriptional regulation of multiple genes in the pituitary and also important for the survival, differentiation and proliferation of three pituitary cell types. To understand the regulation of POU1F1 gene in Ovis aries we report its cloning, sequencing and characterization. The sequenced 5787 bp included six exons and two complete introns. Ovine POU1F1 gene has a high level of conservation with its bovine, human and rat counterparts showing 98.2%, 91.2% and 86.2% of similarity at the coding level, respectively. All six exons were analyzed for polymorphism detection in 100 animals of the Portuguese indigenous ovine breed 'Churra da Terra Quente'. One polymorphism was found at codon 58 in exon 2, in one allele of 4 animals leading to a change from cysteine to tyrosine (2% allelic frequency). In exon 3 two polymorphisms were detected: a G to A transition altering a glycine to an asparagine at codon 89 in one allele of one animal (0.5% allelic frequency) and another G to A transition at codon 105 converting an alanine into a threonine in one allele of 3 animals (1.5% allelic frequency). These polymorphisms might change the structure of the POU1F1 protein and modify gene-expression. In intron 4, an A to G transition was detected in one allele of six animals (3% allelic frequency). Exons 1, 4 and 6 showed no polymorphisms.
