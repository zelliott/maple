Throat swabs collected from patients whose serum was measles IgM negative and rubella IgM positive during 2001-2011 were used to conduct cell culture for rubella virus. After identification of cell culture with RT-PCR, nucleotide of gene E1 of rubella virus was amplified and sequenced, followed by molecular epidemiological analysis. A total of 31 rubella viruses were isolated from 60 throat swabs. Compared 27 isolates with the WHO reference strains of all genotypes, phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the amplified 739 nucleotide fragment. These isolates belonged to two different genotypes respectively. Isolates 11009, 11052 and 11106 in 2011 belonged to genotype 2B, and others belonged to genotype 1E. Most of mutations were nonsense mutation, and sequence of amino acid was highly conserved. Amino acid sequence of most isolates of genotype 1E was identical, which suggested rubella viruses from same transmission chain might be transmitted continually since 2001. Rubella virus genotype 2B was found to be popular for the first time in Shanghai in 2011. The nucleotide sequences of these genotype 2B isolates showed 99% identity compared with that of isolates recently from Vietnam, Japan and Argentina. The resources of these strains were not confirmed due to the absence of rubella virus surveillance before.
