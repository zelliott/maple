Studies of the O-polysaccharide chain of the lipopolysaccharide (O-antigen) of Providencia alcalifaciens O19 by sugar and methylation analyses along with NMR spectroscopy, including 2D 1H,1H COSY, TOCSY, NOESY and 1H,13C HSQC experiments, showed that the pentasaccharide repeating unit of the polysaccharide has the following structure: [structure: see text] where Fuc3NAc is 3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxygalactose. The unique structure of the O-antigen and serological data are in consistence with classification of this bacterium in a separate Providencia serogroup.
