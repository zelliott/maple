We show that the single intron of the actin gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a cryptic promoter for transcription of the second exon. This promoter is inactive in the normal actin gene, but can be activated when the actin gene promoter is deleted. An identical activation was induced by placing efficient transcriptional terminators at position 61 of the 309 bp intron. In all cases transcripts with identical 5' ends close to the boundary of the intron and the second exon were produced. These results indicate that the cryptic promoter in the actin intron is occluded in the normal actin gene by transcriptional interference with the actin gene promoter. Transcription initiation near the intron/exon 2 boundary is enabled by protection from traversing polymerases, that initiated transcription at the upstream located actin gene promoter. A partial promoter protection using leaky terminators resulted in small amounts of transcripts initiated from the cryptic promoter. Although we do not know any function of the cryptic promoter in actin gene expression, it is tentative to speculate that the cryptic intron promoter might be a relict of a promoter that was functional earlier in evolution.
