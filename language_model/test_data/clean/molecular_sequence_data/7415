Dynamin (Dyn) is a member of a novel group of GTPases which was initially identified as a microtubule-binding protein with a role in vectorial movement. Three distinct Dyn-encoding genes (DYN I, II and III), with a neuronal-, ubiquitous or testis-specific expression, respectively, have been identified in rat. In man, only DYN I has so far been characterized. We have previously isolated a genomic DNA fragment implicated in the correction of mitomycin C hypersensitivity of cells from a Fanconi anemia patient belonging to genetic complementation group D (FA(D)). Using this probe, we have cloned a human complementary DNA designated hDYN II encoding a ubiquitous Dyn isoform. The predicted protein consists of 866 amino acids (97.5 kDa). Dyn proteins exhibit a high degree of evolutionary conservation: hDyn II is 98% identical to rat Dyn II and 73% identical to hDyn I. A unique 3.6-kb transcript is found in all human tissues examined and it is more abundant in skeletal muscle and heart. This transcript is also expressed in tissue-culture cells. The hDYN II message is present and not mutated in the FA(D) patient studied. In addition to the GTP-binding domain and motifs associated with regulatory function, the hDyn II protein contains a noticeable number of concensus motifs for p34Cdc2 kinase phosphorylation which may indicate a potential role at the G2/mitosis transition. The sequence reported here should allow a more complete analysis of Dyn function(s) in man.
