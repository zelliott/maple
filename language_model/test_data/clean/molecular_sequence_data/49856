The synthesis of the novel unprotected carboranyl C-glycosides 2 and 20-24 starting from ethynyl C-glycosides 1, 5-8, 10, and 13 is described. The new compounds are highly water-soluble and display only a very low cytotoxicity, which makes them promising candidates for use in boron neutron capture therapy for the treatment of cancer.
