Peroxisomes are specialized organelles found in most eukaryote cells, where their major functions are in cellular respiration and fatty acid oxidation. Proliferation of this organelle, and induction of peroxisomal enzymes, is a phenomenon that occurs in diverse species, and is stimulated by a number of physiological and pharmacological stimuli. A large number of chemically diverse compounds, including hypolipidemic drugs and industrial plasticizers, have been shown to cause peroxisome proliferation and the induction of peroxisomal enzymes in rodents. Chronic exposure to these compounds produces hepatocellular carcinomas, however, the mechanism by which this tumorigenic event occurs is unknown. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae peroxisomes are induced when a fatty acid such as oleate is supplied as a carbon source in the growth medium. In addition, many peroxisomal enzymes are induced by growth on oleate; these include enzymes of the peroxisomal beta-oxidation cycle. This regulation occurs at the transcription level, and is controlled by specific trans-acting factors. The research in our laboratory has focused on the mechanisms involved in this regulation, and on the identification and characterization of the proteins involved. Our recent results, and current research directions are summarized.
