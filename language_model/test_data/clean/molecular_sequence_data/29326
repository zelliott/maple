Termitomyces constitutes a very poorly known genus of fungi whose essential characteristic is that all representatives of the genus are cultivated by termites (Macrotermitinae) in their nest and that all the fungi cultivated by termites belong to this genus. For the first time, the phylogenetic relationships of several African Termitomyces species was studied by the sequencing of their internal transcriber spacer region (ITS1--5.8S--ITS2). It appeared that this group is clearly monophyletic and belongs to the Tricholomataceae family. The total homology of the ITS zone of several Termitomyces symbionts of different termite genera indicated that the specific diversity of this group is in fact less important than previously supposed. Finally, the comparison between the Termitomyces phylogenetic tree and the taxonomic tree of Macrotermitinae showed that if for certain genera the hypothesis of termite/fungus coevolution is acceptable, it should not be applied for all symbiosis.
