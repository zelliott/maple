Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF)-1 is a multifunctional transcription factor, involved in cell growth regulation, pathogen response and immune activation. To identify novel gene targets that may contribute to IRF-1 mediated activities, RNA fingerprinting was performed using NIH3T3 cells that inducibly express a hybrid form of IRF-1 under tetracycline regulated control. Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) - a regulator of inflammation and an inhibitor of the LPS response - was identified as a gene repressed after doxycycline induced IRF-1 expression. Preliminary analysis of the human SLPI promoter identified an ISRE-like site located within the -221 to -200 region to which IRF-1 binds and a second, putative IRF-1 binding site upstream of the TATA box. Furthermore, co-transfection studies demonstrated that SLPI expression was inhibited by IRF-1 co-expression. The identification of SLPI as a target of IRF-1 regulation reveals a unique involvement of IRF-1 in repression of gene transcription and assigns a novel role for IRF-1 in inflammation.
