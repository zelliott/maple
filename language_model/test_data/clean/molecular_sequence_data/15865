OmpR protein is a positive regulator involved in activation of the ompF and ompC genes which encode the major outer membrane proteins OmpF and OmpC, respectively. OmpR protein is considered to have a two-domain structure. In the present study we isolated a C-terminal fragment of the OmpR molecule, which bound to a specific promoter sequence of the ompF gene. We conclude that the C-terminal portion of the OmpR protein contains a DNA-binding site.
