We isolated and characterized a 120-kd PNA-binding polypeptide from the human CNS. This polypeptide is linked to membranes through a PI linkage. After release from membranes by PLC it measures 105 kd, 30 kd of which appear to be contributed by N-linked carbohydrates. We isolated the polypeptide by the use of PLC and PNA affinity chromatography and used it to raise polyclonal antibodies and to determine the N-terminal sequence. Immunohistochemical and immunochemical studies using these antibodies showed that 120 kdpp is present in both myelin and oligodendrocytes.
