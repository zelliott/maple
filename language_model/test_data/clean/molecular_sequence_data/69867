The low-sulfated chondroitin 4-sulfate(LSC) chain from human urinary trypsin inhibitor was purified and the structure was characterized. After hyaluronidase SD digestion of LSC, an oligosaccharide which contains the linkage region could be obtained. The structure of oligosaccharide was analyzed by HPLC and 500 MHz 1H-NMR spectroscopy. The analytical results revealed that 4-O-sulfo GalNAc residues were located in the neighborhood of the linkage region.
