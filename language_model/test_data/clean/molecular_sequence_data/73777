Amino acid 57 of DQ beta chains is of functional importance as it influences peptide binding, is part of B and T cell epitopes, and is associated with susceptibility and resistance to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and humoral immunodeficiencies. Polymorphism of codon 57 is conserved in primates and in HLA class II B genes implying that balancing selection operates on this residue. Previously, three DQB1 allele pairs have been described, that only differ at residue 57. In an African-American Black individual with the HLA phenotype A23.30;B58,63;Cw6;DR18,12;DR52;DQ5,2, we found a fourth example of this dimorphism: the new DQB1*0203 allele, that was identical to DQB1*0202 except for codon 57, which encodes aspartic acid and alanine respectively in the two alleles. The class II haplotype carrying the new allele was deduced to be DRB1*0302,DRB3*0101,DQA1*05011,DQB1*0203.
