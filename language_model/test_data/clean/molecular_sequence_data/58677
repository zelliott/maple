Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1 or aFGF), is a mitogen for a variety of mesoderm- and neuroectoderm-derived cells, as well as an angiogenic factor in vivo. It has been implicated in angiogenic diseases including atherosclerosis, cancer and inflammatory autoimmune diseases. As part of an effort to understand the role of FGF-1 in the pathobiology of inflammation, we have isolated and characterized the mouse Fgf-1 gene. Southern blot analysis of mouse genomic DNA using the mouse Fgf-1 cDNA as a probe revealed that mouse FGF-1 is encoded by a single copy gene. Comparison of the available mouse Fgf-1 cDNA sequence with newly obtained genomic sequence allowed us to establish the exon/intron boundaries. The mouse Fgf-1 coding region is comprised of three protein coding exons, which we determined to be separated by an 11.4-kb and a 4.9-kb intron. The elucidation of the mouse Fgf-1 coding region revealed great similarity between the mouse and human Fgf-1 gene structure.
