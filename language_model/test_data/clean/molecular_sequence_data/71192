In this study, we have further delineated the domains of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor NR1 subunit that contribute to the glycine co-agonist binding site. Taking an iterative approach, we have constructed truncation mutants of the NR1 subunit, transiently expressed them in HEK-293 cells, and determined the binding of the glycine site antagonist [3H]L-689,560. Amino acids 380-811 were sufficient to form a glycine binding site with affinities for [3H]L-689,560 and glycine that were not significantly different from wild-type NR1. More extensive deletions, from either the amino- or the carboxy-terminal end, resulted in loss of ligand binding. Additional constructs were made starting from amino acids 380-843 of NR1, replacing the transmembrane (TMI-TMIII) domain with intervening linker sequences while retaining the TMIV domain so as to anchor the polypeptide to the membrane. Although robust amounts of polypeptides were synthesised by transfected cells, only low levels of [3H]L-689,560 binding sites could be detected. This suggests that only a small proportion of the synthesised polypeptide folds in the appropriate manner so as to form a ligand binding site. These data indicate that although it is possible to reduce the glycine binding site to minimal so-called S1 and S2 domains, efficient folding of the polypeptide so as to form a ligand binding site may require sequences within the TMI-TMIII domain.
