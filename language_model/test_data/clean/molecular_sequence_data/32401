Noncoding regulatory RNA molecules, also known as small RNAs, participate in several bacterial regulatory networks. The central component of the carbon storage regulator (Csr) and the homologous repressor of secondary metabolites (Rsm) systems is an RNA binding protein (CsrA or RsmA) that regulates gene expression post-transcriptionally by affecting ribosome binding and/or mRNA stability. Members of the CsrB family of noncoding regulatory RNA molecules contain multiple CsrA binding sites and function as CsrA antagonists by sequestering this protein. Depending on the particular organism, the Csr (or Rsm) system participates in global regulatory circuits that control central carbon flux, the production of extracellular products, cell motility, biofilm formation, quorum sensing and/or pathogenesis.
