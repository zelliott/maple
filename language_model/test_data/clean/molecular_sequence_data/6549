We have investigated the in vivo efficacy of a systemic gene transfer method, which combines a liposomal delivery system (DLS liposomes) with episomally replicative DNA plasmids to effect long-term expression of a transgene in cells. A single i.v. injection of a plasmid DNA vector containing the luciferase gene as a marker was administered with the DLS liposomes in BALB/c mice. The luciferase gene and its product were found in all mouse tissues tested as determined by PCR analysis and immunohistochemistry. Luciferase activity was also detected in all tissues tested and was present in lung, liver, spleen, and heart up to 3 months postinjection. In contrast to the nonepisomal vectors tested (pRSV-luc and pCMVintlux), human papovavirus (BKV)-derived episomal vectors showed long-term transgene expression. We found that these episomal vectors replicated extrachromosomally in lung 2 weeks postinjection. Results indicated that transgene expression in specific tissues depended on the promoter element used, DNA/liposome formulation, dose of DNA per injection, and route of administration.
