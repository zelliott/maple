Leaf rust is the most common disease in wheat production. There are more than 45 specific resistance genes described and used in wheat breeding to control epidemics of leaf rust, but none of them has been cloned. The leaf rust disease resistance gene 1 ( Lr1) is a good model gene for isolation by map-based cloning because it is a single, dominant gene which is located in the distal region of chromosome 5DL of wheat. As the first step towards the isolation of this gene we constructed a high-resolution genetic map in the region of the Lr1 locus by saturation mapping of two large segregating F(2) populations (Thatcher Lr1 x Thatcher, Thatcher Lr1 x Frisal). The resistance gene Lr1 was delimited in a 0.16-cM region between the RFLP markers ABC718 and PSR567 (0.12 cM from ABC718 and 0.04 cM from PSR567). A genomic BAC library of Aegilops tauschii (D genome) was screened using the RFLP markers ABC718 and PSR567. Five positive BAC clones were identified by ABC718 and four clones by PSR567. Two NBS-LRR type of resistance gene analogs, which encode proteins highly homologous to the bacterial blight disease resistance protein Xa1 of rice, were identified on BAC clones isolated with PSR567. Polymorphic BAC end probes were isolated from both ends of a 105-kb large BAC clone identified by ABC718. The end probes were mapped at the same locus as ABC718, and no recombination event was found within 105 kb around ABC718 in our analysis of more than 4,000 gametes.
