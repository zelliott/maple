Carbapenem-resistant isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii from intensive care units at Split University Hospital, Split, Croatia, were studied. Most (100 of 106) had ISAba1 inserted upstream of a bla(OXA-107) gene, encoding an unusual OXA-51-type oxacillinase. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that the isolates formed three clusters belonging to the sequence group 2 (European clone 1) lineage.
