From the rhizomes of Polygonatum alte-lobatum, two new homologous series of 1,4-benzoquinones, polygonaquinones A and B, a novel homoisoflavanone, a new gentrogenin glycoside and 13 known compounds were isolated and characterized. The structures of the new compounds were determined as two homologous series of three 2,5-dihydroxy-3-methyl-6-alkyl-1,4-benzoquinones and three 2-hydroxy-3-methyl-6-alkyl-1,4-benzoquinones, with chain lengths C21 to C23, and 4',5,7-trihydroxy-6,8-dimethylhomoisoflavanone and gentrogenin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->2)-[beta-D-xylopyranosyl(1-->3)] -beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->4)-beta-D-galactopyranoside.
