To elucidate thermoresistance, a gene of a hyperthermophilic heat shock protein (HHSP) was isolated from the hyperthermophile Desulfurococcus strain SY which grows at 95 degrees C. The molecular weight of HHSP deduced from the open reading frame was 59,137 (545 amino acid residues). Sequence alignments of peptides reveal similarities (evolutionary distances) to the alpha (0.279) and beta (0.296) subunits of thermosome, TF55 (0.343) and human t-complex polypeptide 1. The structure of a thermophilic heat shock protein TGroEL (Tamada et al. (1991) Biochem, Biophys. Res. Commun. 179, 565) was quite different from that of HHSP. TGroEL and HSP60 have sequences identical to HHSP at its equatorial domain, while those identical to the alpha subunit of F-type ATPase are at its apical domain.
