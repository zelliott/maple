Oral spirochetes possess many potential virulence factors, including the capacity for tissue invasion and persistence despite a vigorous host immune response. In an attempt to identify treponemal immunoreactive components, sera derived from individuals with advanced periodontal disease were used as a reagent to isolate recombinant bacteriophage lambda clones expressing antigens of the oral spirochete Treponema denticola ATCC 35405. Nucleotide sequence analysis of a clone expressing three immunoreactive products has revealed seven T. denticola genes which appear to encode homologs of flagellar basal body constituents, FlgB, FlgC, FliE, and FliF, a flagellar switch component, FliG, and the putative flagellar export proteins, FliH and FliI, initially characterized in Salmonella typhimurium. Also identified was a gene resembling fliJ. Primer extension analysis identified a transcriptional start site 5' to the treponemal flgB gene. Appropriately spaced with respect to this start site was a sigma28 binding motif. The absence of additional identifiable sigma factor binding motifs within the treponemal sequence and the proximity of adjacent genes suggested operonic arrangement, and reverse transcriptase PCR provided evidence of cotranscription. Supporting the identification of these genes as flagellar components, heterologous expression in enteric bacteria of the putative switch basal body genes from T. denticola interfered with motility. Specifically, the presence of a plasmid expressing treponemal fliG reduced swarming motility in S. typhimurium, while in Escherichia coli, this plasmid conferred a nonmotile phenotype and a reduction in flagellar number. Thus, while spirochetal flagella are subject to unique synthetic and functional constraints, the organization of flagellar genes and the presence of sigma28-like elements are reminiscent of the flagellar systems of other bacteria, and there appears to be sufficient conservation of constituent proteins to allow interaction between T. denticola switch-basal body proteins and the flagellar machinery of gram-negative bacteria.
