The mammalian cellular response to genotoxic stress is a complex process involving many known and probably many as yet unknown genes. Induction of the human DNA damage- and growth arrest-inducible gene, GADD34, by ionizing radiation was only seen in certain cell lines and correlated with apoptosis following ionizing radiation. In addition, the kinetics and dose response of GADD34 to ionizing radiation closely paralleled that of the apoptosis inhibitor, BAX. However, unlike BAX, the GADD34 response was independent of cellular p53 status. The carboxyl terminus of GADD34 has homology with the carboxyl termini of two viral proteins, one of which is known to prevent apoptosis of virus infected cells. The association of GADD34 expression with certain types of apoptosis and its homology with a known apoptosis regulator suggests that GADD34 may play a role in apoptosis as well.
