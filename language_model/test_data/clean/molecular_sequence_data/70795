Hematopoietic progenitor cells are incubated with cytokine combinations for in vitro expansion of stem cells and to enhance retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Optimization of the engraftment of these treated cells would be critical to the success of stem cell transplantation or gene therapy. Previous studies demonstrated that a 48-hour incubation of donor BALB/c bone marrow with a mixture of four cytokines (IL-3, IL-6, IL-11, and SCF), resulted in expansion of primitive progenitor/stem cells but a loss of long-term engraftment in nonmyeloablated or myeloablated recipients. We have established the expression pattern for a number of adhesion receptors by normal hematopoietic progenitors and cell lines and the modulation in expression induced by cytokines or cell cycle progression to ascertain the molecular basis for such defective engraftment. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the cytokine combination of IL-3, IL-6, IL-11, and SCF dramatically down-regulated alpha 4 integrin receptor expression in HL-60 cells. Synchronized FDC-P1 cells exhibited modulation of alpha 4 expression through cell cycle progression, both by quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry. Normal murine bone marrow lineage-depleted, Sca+ cells expressed a number of adhesion receptors, including alpha L, alpha 1, alpha 3, alpha 4, alpha 5, alpha 6, beta 1, L-selectin, CD44, and PECAM as assessed by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and RT-PCR. There was modulation of the expression of several of these receptors after incubation in the four cytokines for 24 and/or 48 hours: the proportion of cells expressing alpha L, alpha 5, alpha 6, and PECAM increased, whereas the proportion of cells expressing alpha 4 and beta 1 decreased, after cytokine incubation. There was a demonstrable concomitant decline in adhesion of these cells to fibronectin after the cytokine incubation, a finding that correlates with the decrease in expression of alpha 4. These changes in adhesion receptor expression and function with cytokines and during cell cycle transit may be critical to stem cell homing and engraftment after transplantation, as multiple receptors could be involved in the process of rolling, attachment to endothelium, endothelial transmigration, and migration within the marrow space.
