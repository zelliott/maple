Hepatitis C virus (HCV) possesses two separate enzymatic functions in the NS3 protein: a protease and an NTPase/RNA helicase. In order to determine the minimal domain for NTPase and RNA helicase activities of the HCV NS3 protein, serial deletion mutants were constructed. The NS3H protein a fusion protein of 25 amino acids (aa) from an expression vector and the C-terminal 466 aa of the HCV NS3 protein, contains an NTPase/RNA helicase activity. We made deletion mutants of 10, 30, 50, 97, and 135 aa from the C-terminus and 16 and 32 aa from the N-terminus of the NS3H protein. The deleted protein lacking 50 aa from the C-terminus still possessed both activities, while the protein lacking 97 aa from the C-terminus lost an RNA helicase activity. The mutant lacking 16 amino acids from the N-terminus retained the enzymatic activities and the N-terminal 32 aa deleted mutant lost an NTPase/RNA helicase activity. A combinational deletion mutant lacking 16 aa the N-terminus and 50 aa from the C-terminus retained the enzymatic activities. These results show that the functional domain of the HCV NTPase/ RNA helicase is about 400 aa in length and maps between NS3 residues 1209 and 1608.
