Mitochondrial ribosomal RNA coding regions in the only three green algal taxa investigated to date are fundamentally different in that they are continuous in Prototheca wickerhamii, but highly fragmented and scrambled in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Chlamydomonas eugametos. To gain more insight into the mode of evolution of fragmented and scrambled mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes within the green algal group, this work (1) provides additional information on fragmentation patterns of mitochondrial small- and large-subunit (SSU and LSU) rRNAs that strongly supports the concept of a gradual increase in the extent of discontinuity of mitochondrial rRNAs among chlorophycean green algae and (2) reports the first example of fragmented and scrambled mitochondrial LSU rRNA coding regions in a green algal taxon outside the Chlamydomonas group. The present study (1) suggests that the scrambling of the mitochondrial rRNA coding regions may have occurred early in the evolution of fragmented and scrambled mitochondrial rRNA genes within the chlorophycean green algal group, most likely in parallel with the fragmentation events, (2) proposes recombination as a possible mechanism involved in the evolution of these mitochondrial rRNA genes, and (3) presents a hypothetical pathway for converting continuous mitochondrial rRNA genes into the highly fragmented and scrambled rRNA coding regions of Chlamydomonas through a series of recombinatorial events between short repeated sequences.
