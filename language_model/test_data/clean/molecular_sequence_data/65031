In this study, the aim was to determine whether TCP transcription factors are implicated in meristem activation in potato (Solanum tuberosum). By searching a database of potato EST sequences, with a sequence characteristically conserved in TCP domains, a potato tcp gene was identified. A BAC clone containing the tcp sequence was isolated and the genomic sequence was determined. Using a CAPS marker assay, the potato tcp gene (sttcp1) was mapped to chromosome 8. In dormant buds, relatively high levels of sttcp1-specific transcript were detected by in situ hybridization. By contrast, in sprouting buds, no expression of the sttcp1 could be detected. Furthermore, an inverse relationship between axillary bud size and the steady-state level of the sstcp1 transcript was demonstrated. In non-growing buds exhibiting correlative inhibition, sttcpI-specific transcript levels were also relatively high, but rapidly decreased when apical dominance was removed by excision of the apical bud.
