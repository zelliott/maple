Alteration of the cell/substratum adhesive structures of rat fibroblasts (3Y1 cells) upon transformation by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) was investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy. In serum-containing culture medium, 3Y1 cells developed focal adhesions as their main adhesive structures, while BY1 cells expressed peculiar close contacts along the cell periphery with the vitronectin receptor integrin, in addition to podosomes. These peripheral close contacts are referred to as the peripheral adhesions. The peripheral adhesions were observed as a darker region than podosomes by interference reflection microscopy. They were more easily destroyed by incubating the cells with RGD-containing peptide than were the focal adhesions. In contrast to focal adhesions and podosomes, actin bundles were not detected within the peripheral adhesions, where pp60v-src and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins accumulated. Expression of the integrin was determined by the substratum composition when BY1 cells were cultured in serum-free culture medium. Under such conditions, BY1 cells expressed the peripheral adhesions within 3 hours on adhesion molecule-coated glass. On the other hand, in serum-containing medium, they first developed focal adhesions transiently at their early stage of adhesion, and then the peripheral adhesions were predominantly expressed within 12 hours. Podosomes were formed in a time course similar to that of the peripheral adhesions. These findings suggest that the peripheral adhesion is a class of stable adhesive structure distinct from the focal adhesion or podosome of BY1 cells. Similar close contact-type peripheral adhesions with the integrin were also observed in a variety of cultured cells such as normal fibroblasts at their logarithmic growth phase, phorbol ester-treated fibroblasts, and several malignant tumor cells, with poorly organized focal adhesions and stress fibers. These findings further suggest that the peripheral adhesions may be widely involved in the adhesion of cells that inadequately develop stress fibers and focal adhesions.
