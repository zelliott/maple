Neurexophilin 1 (Nxph1) is a specific endoligand of Î±-neurexins that is essential for trans-synaptic activation. Here, we report its dynamic expression during development in zebrafish. Our study revealed an early onset of expression of nxph1. RT-PCR on a series of embryonic stages showed that it is maternally deposited, although only readily detectable by whole mount in situ hybridization by 22hpf. During embryogenesis and larval stages, the zygotic transcript is expressed dynamically in various clusters of post-mitotic neurons and in glia in the central nervous system.
