Lactobacillus plantarum 423 produces a small heat-stable antimicrobial protein designated plantaricin 423. This protein is bactericidal for many Gram-positive foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria, including Listeria spp., Staphylococcus spp., Pediococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp., etc. The DNA sequence of the plantaricin 423-encoding region on plasmid pPLA4 revealed a four open reading frame (ORF) operon structure similar to pediocin PA-1/AcH from Pediococcus acidilactici and coagulin from Bacillus coagulans I(4). The first ORF, plaA, encodes a 56-amino acid prepeptide consisting of a 37-amino acid mature molecule, with a 19-amino acid N-terminal leader peptide. The second ORF, plaB, encodes a putative immunity protein with protein sequence similarities to several bacteriocin immunity proteins. The plaC and plaD genes are virtually identical to pedC and pedD of the pediocin PA-1 operon, as well as coaC and coaD of the coagulin operon. Plantaricin 423 was cloned on a shuttle vector under the control of a yeast promoter and heterologously produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
