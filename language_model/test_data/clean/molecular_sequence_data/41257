Mobilizable genomic islands (MGIs) are small genomic islands that are mobilizable by SXT/R391 integrating conjugative elements (ICEs) due to similar origins of transfer. Their site-specific integration and excision are catalyzed by the integrase that they encode, but their conjugative transfer entirely depends upon the conjugative machinery of SXT/R391 ICEs. In this study, we report the mechanisms that control the excision and integration processes of MGIs. We found that while the MGI-encoded integrase Int(MGI) is sufficient to promote MGI integration, efficient excision from the host chromosome requires the combined action of Int(MGI) and of a novel recombination directionality factor, RdfM. We determined that the genes encoding these proteins are activated by SetCD, the main transcriptional activators of SXT/R391 ICEs. Although they share the same regulators, we found that unlike rdfM, int(MGI) has a basal level of expression in the absence of SetCD. These findings explain how an MGI can integrate into the chromosome of a new host in the absence of a coresident ICE and shed new light on the cross talk that can occur between mobilizable and mobilizing elements that mobilize them, helping us to understand part of the rules that dictate horizontal transfer mechanisms.
