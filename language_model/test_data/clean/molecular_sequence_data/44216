The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 contains several cryptic plasmids of 2.4, 5.2, and about 50 or 100 kbp. The complete nucleotide sequence of the 5.2-kbp plasmid, pCC5.2, has been analyzed and is reported here. This plasmid contains 5214 bp and 53.1% A+T. Six open reading frames, ORFs A-F (encoding peptides of larger than 90 amino acid residues), were located on both strands of pCC5.2. ORF B codes for a potential replication protein containing 971 amino acids, for which there are three homologous proteins encoded by other cyanobacterial plasmids. ORF C encodes a polypeptide of 93 amino acids which shares homologies with products of two ORFs found in the protein database. Counterparts of the products of ORF A, D, E, and F could not be found in the protein database. Detection of a single-stranded DNA intermediate during replication of pCC5.2 indicates that this plasmid may also replicate by a rolling circle mechanism, as has been reported for pCA2.4 and pCB2.4 from the same strain of Synechocystis (PCC 6803).
