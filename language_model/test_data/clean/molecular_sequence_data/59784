The oligosaccharides from the lipopolysaccharides of Moraxella catarrhalis serotype B, strain CCUG 3292, were isolated after mild acid hydrolysis and separated by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. The structures of the oligosaccharides were established by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It is concluded that the oligosaccharides comprise a mixture of mainly a nona- and a deca-saccharide. [formula: see text] Smaller amounts of undeca-saccharides and of truncated forms, namely, hexa-, hepta-, and octa-saccharides, were also detected.
