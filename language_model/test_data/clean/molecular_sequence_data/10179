A solid phase conjugation method is described based on the preadsorption of proteins to aluminium hydroxide adjuvant followed by activation of the adsorbed carrier proteins with iodoacetic acid N-hydroxysuccinimidester or other conjugation reagents. Cysteine-containing peptides were coupled to the iodoacetic acid-activated carrier-adjuvant particles through their SH groups. No dialysis is required since the reaction product is isolated at each step of the procedure by a simple centrifugation and can easily be extensively washed between individual manipulations. The method generates peptide-carrier-adjuvant particles with sterically defined presentation of the peptides at the surface of the particles. When used for immunization of mice and rabbits the conjugates elicited high-titered specific anti-peptide sera, which reacted well with the parent protein in ELISA. The strongest reactions were with the denatured form of the parent protein. On immunoblots antisera to the N- and C-terminus of calreticulin recognized the same M, 52,000 protein.
