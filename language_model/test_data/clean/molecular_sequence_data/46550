The hamster cell line HE5 has been derived from primary hamster embryo cells by transformation with human adenovirus type 2 (Ad2). Each cell contains 2-3 copies of Ad2 DNA inserted into host DNA at apparently identical sites. The site of the junction between the right terminus of Ad2 DNA and hamster cell DNA was cloned and sequenced. The eight [corrected] right terminal nucleotides of Ad2 DNA were deleted. The unoccupied cellular DNA sequence in cell line HE5 , corresponding to the site of the junction between Ad2 and hamster cell DNA, was also cloned; 120-130 nucleotides in the cellular DNA were found to be identical to the cellular DNA sequence in the cloned junction DNA fragment, up to the site of the junction. The unoccupied and the occupied cellular DNAs and the adjacent viral DNA exhibited a few short nucleotide homologies. Patch homologies ranging in length from dodeca - to octanucleotides were detected by computer analyses at locations more remote from the junction site. When the right terminal nucleotide sequence of Ad2 DNA was matched to randomly selected sequences of 401 nucleotides from vertebrate or prokaryotic DNA, similar homologies were observed. It is likely that foreign (viral) DNA can be inserted via short sequence homologies at many different sites of cellular DNA.
