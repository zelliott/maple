Fourteen CA-repeat microsatellite polymorphisms from human chromosome 21 (HC21) (D21S364, D21S365, D21S366, D21S367, D21S368, D21S369, D21S406, D21S407, D21S408, D21S409, D21S410, D21S411, D21S415, and D21S1217) have been cloned from a flow-sorted phage library (LA21NS01). These microsatellite loci have been mapped using a somatic cell hybrid panel of HC21, and heterozygosities and allele frequencies have been determined. The markers spread along the length of the long arm of the HC21. Twelve of these microsatellites have heterozygosities between 0.47 and 0.90. These new CA-repeat markers will improve the genetic map of HC21.
