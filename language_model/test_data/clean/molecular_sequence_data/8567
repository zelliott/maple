The utility of the 16S ribosomal RNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Treponema denticola was examined and compared with that of anaerobic culture. Primer pairs consisting of 20-27 nucleotides amplified 404- to 688-bp regions of 16S ribosomal RNA genes of these organisms. This method had a lower detection limit of 50 target cells in a background of 10(7) cells. Its specificity for B. forsythus, P. gingivalis, and T. denticola seemed high. The primers for A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. rectus, and P. intermedia cross-reacted with some closely related species but did not reveal amplification products in tests with more distantly related organisms. The primers for E. corrodens did not seem to cross-react with oral organisms. This PCR technique was sensitive, reproducible, and easy to perform. PCR-based amplification may prove valuable for the detection of some periodontal pathogens in crude subgingival specimens.
