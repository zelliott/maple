From a library of sequences binding preferentially to nuclear matrix (matrix attachment regions, MARs), a fragment of about 300 bp in length (CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen)-MAR) was isolated and characterized. The CEA-MAR sequence was found in more than ten loci of chromosome 19 containing elements similar to genes of the CEA family. No sequences of this group were found on other human chromosomes. Two CEA-MAR-containing loci were sequenced, and sequences for another seven loci were found in GenBank. A comparative analysis of CEA-MARs and the flanking sequences is reported. Based on the sequence of the CEA-containing chromosome 19 loci, a hypothetical model of the domain structure of a 2-Mb chromosome region was constructed and the mutual arrangement of CEA-MARs and genes of CEA family was elucidated. The CEA-MARs were located 5-20 kb downstream of the CEA genes. These results suggest that the duplication unit of the CEA family may coincide with chromatin domains containing these genes.
