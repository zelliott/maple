Tarantula heart cDNA libraries were screened with synthetic oligonucleotide probes deduced from the highly conserved amino acid sequences of the two copper-binding sites, copper A and copper B, found in chelicerate hemocyanins. Positive cDNA clones could be obtained and four different cDNA types were characterized.
