Ten introns interrupting the coding sequence of the mouse src protooncogene were sequenced (in total 11260 bp) and their general characteristics compared with the homologous genes in human and chicken. While the study of genome organization of the src gene was performed only in the inbred mouse strain BALB/cHeA (Mus musculus domesticus), one special region in the intron 5 was also sequenced in additional mouse strains (M. musculus musculus and M. spretus), because the discovered CA and GT repeat array differences could serve as a new polymorphic marker in the chromosome No. 2 and help elucidate some evolutionary relations between mouse strains.
