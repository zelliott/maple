Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is not only involved in environmental stress but also plays roles in the ovary development in some vertebrates. To understand its role in crustacean, we examined the HSP90 cDNA for the first time in the ovary and hepatopancreas of the oriental river prawn, Macrobrachium nipponense and designated this protein as MnHSP90 in this study. The MnHSP90 was cloned by the methods of degenerated oligonucleotide primers and rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE). Bioinformatics analysis showed that the MnHSP90 cDNA was 2,684 bp in length, containing a 126 bp 5' untranslated region (UTR), a 359 bp 3' UTR, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 2,199 bp encoding a 732-amino acid polypeptide with predicted molecular mass of 84.3 KDa. Sequence alignment showed that the MnHSP90 shared 72-79% identity with other animals. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis demonstrated that the MnHSP90 mRNA was ubiquitously detected in all tested tissues, with the highest expression in the thoracic ganglia, the mediate in heart, muscle and intestine, and the lowest in haemocytes and gills. The MnHSP90 mRNA levels in the hepatopancreas and ovary of M. nipponense reached a maximum at the stage III (early vitellogenic stage) and stage IV (later vitellogenic stage) ovaries, respectively, and then decreased significantly in both tissues as the ovarian development proceeded. The level of MnHSP90 expression in the hepatopancreas was higher than that in the ovary when compared with in the same ovarian developmental stage. Our results indicate that MnHSP90 is involved in ovarian development in oriental river prawn and may play a regulatory role in ovary maturation.
