Streptococcus dysgalactiae S2, a bovine mastitis isolate, expresses the fibronectin (Fn)-binding adhesin FnbB. Here, we describe a new fibronectin-binding domain called UFnBD, located 100 amino acid N-terminal to the primary repetitive Fn-binding domain (FnBRD-B) of FnbB. UFnBD interacted with N-terminal region of Fn (N29) and this binding was mostly mediated by type I module pair 2-3 of N29 fragment, whereas FnBRD-B mainly bound to type I module pair 4-5. Furthermore, UFnBD inhibited adherence of S. dysgalactiae to Fn but at lower level as compared to FnBRD-B. UFnBD exclusively shared antigenic properties with the Fn-binding unit Du of FnbpA from Staphylococcus aureus but not with ligand-binding domains or motifs of other adhesins, while Fn-induced determinants of FnBRD-B and other adhesins appeared to be conformationally related. Consistent with this, a monoclonal antibody 7E11 generated from a mouse immunized with FnbB, and that recognized UFnBD did not cross-react with FnBRD-B. The epitope for 7E11 was mapped to 40 amino acid long segment within UFnBD and interaction between the antibody and the epitope was specifically induced by Fn or N29. A similar antibody epitope was observed in Streptococcus pyogenes strains suggesting the presence of an adhesin bearing epitope related to FnbB.
