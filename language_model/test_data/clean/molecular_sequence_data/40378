A Gram-stain-positive, aerobic bacterium, designated strain BZ41(T), was isolated from hydrocarbon-contaminated soil. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain BZ41(T) was related to members of the genus Agromyces and showed highest similarity with the type strain of Agromyces ramosus (96.8 %). The morphological, biochemical and chemotaxonomic characteristics of the new isolate were consistent with the description of the genus Agromyces. The cell-wall peptidoglycan of strain BZ41(T) was of type B2γ and contained the amino acids 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, alanine, glycine and glutamic acid in an approximate molar ratio of 1.8 : 0.7 : 1.1 : 1.0. The predominant cell-wall sugars were galactose, glucose, mannose and rhamnose. Strain BZ41(T) had MK-12 and MK-11 as major menaquinones and contained anteiso-C₁₅:₀ and anteiso-C₁₇:₀ as major fatty acids. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain BZ41(T) was 69.7 mol%. On the basis of phenotypic characteristics and genotypic analysis, strain BZ41(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Agromyces, for which the name Agromyces bauzanensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is BZ41(T) (=DSM 22275(T) =CGMCC 1.8984(T)).
