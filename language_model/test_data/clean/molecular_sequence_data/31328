Various approaches have been developed to study how mutations in Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA affect the function of the ribosome. Most of them are in vivo approaches, where mutations are introduced in a specialized plasmid harboring the ribosomal RNA genes. The mutated plasmids are then expressed in an appropriate host, where they can confer resistance to antibiotics whose target is the ribosome. Conditions can be used where the host ribosomal RNA genes or the host ribosomes are selectively inactivated, and the effect of the mutations on ribosome assembly and function can be studied. Another approach, which has been developed mainly with 16S ribosomal RNA, can be used entirely in vitro. In this approach, a plasmid has been constructed which contains the 16S ribosomal RNA gene under control of a T7 promoter. Mutations can be introduced in the 16S ribosomal RNA sequence and the mutated 16S ribosomal RNAs are produced by in vitro transcription. It is then possible to investigate how the mutations affect the assembly of the 16S ribosomal RNA into 30S subunits and the activity of the reconstituted 30S subunits in cell-free protein synthesis assays. Although these approaches are recent, they have already provided a large body of interesting information, relating specific RNA sequences to interactions with ribosomal proteins, to ribosome function, and to its response to antibiotics.
