hRPB11 is a core subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II) specifically down-regulated on doxorubicin (dox) treatment. Levels of this protein profoundly affect cell differentiation, cell proliferation, and tumorigenicity in vivo. Here we describe Che-1, a novel human protein that interacts with hRPB11. Che-1 possesses a domain of high homology with Escherichia coli RNA polymerase final sigma-factor 70 and SV40 large T antigen. In addition, we report that Che-1 interacts with the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) by two distinct domains. Functionally, we demonstrate that Che-1 represses the growth suppression function of Rb, counteracting the inhibitory action of Rb on the trans-activation function of E2F1. These results identify a novel protein that binds Rb and the core of pol II, and suggest that Che-1 may be part of transcription regulatory complex.
