Genomic Southern blots of chicken DNA, probed with radiolabeled DNA fragments that flank the 5'-end of the asa gene encoding chicken alpha-skeletal actin, indicate the presence of repetitive nucleotide sequences. Sequence analysis of this region reveals a member of the CR1 family of middle-repetitive elements. A 186-bp restriction fragment carrying the 3'-end of this CR1 element binds factor(s) present in nuclear extracts, as assayed by band-shift electrophoresis. However, the CR1 repeat has limited influence on transcription from the alpha-skeletal actin promoter, as assessed by CAT assays of transfected chicken myoblasts and fibroblasts.
