Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris cv. Saxa) chloroplasts contain two tRNA(Phe) species, namely tRNA(Phe)1 and tRNA(Phe)2. By sequence determination, we show that tRNA(Phe)2 is identical to the previously sequenced tRNA(Phe)1 except for two undermodified nucleotides. By reversed-phase chromatography analyses, we demonstrate that the relative amounts of these two chloroplast tRNAs(Phe) vary during leaf development: in etiolated leaves the undermodified tRNA(Phe)2 only represents 15% of total chloroplast tRNA(Phe), during development and greening it increases to reach 60% in 8-day-old leaves, and it then decreases to 9% in senescing leaves.
