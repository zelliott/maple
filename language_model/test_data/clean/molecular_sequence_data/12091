Ever since the discovery that the human tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS)-encoding gene is induced by interferon (IFN) [J. Fleckner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 (1991) 11520-11524] and contains IFN-response regulatory elements [Frolova et al., Gene 128 (1993) 237-245], the biological rationale for this induction has remained unresolved. A survey of immune system proteins in this study reveals that the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, beta-2-microglobulin (beta MG) and complement factor B, which are known to be induced by IFN, together with immunoglobulins (Ig) are all exceptionally enriched in Trp residues, as compared to human proteins in general. It also reveals the conservation of a sequence motif, CX10-17 WX26-62C, in Ig domains. The conservation of this sequence motif and the utility of Trp residues within antigen-binding sites clearly contribute to the Trp enrichment in Ig. These observations suggest a biological rationale for the induction of TrpRS by IFN in safeguarding Trp incorporation for the IFN-enhanced synthesis of immunological molecules.
