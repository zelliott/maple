Over the past year, many reports have been published on a variety of clinical manifestations related to antiphospholipid antibodies. The low prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies with the rare occurrence of thrombosis and a low rate of fetal loss in studies in Malaysia and China showed a potential role for local factors. A study of cross-reactive idiotype of the anticardiolipin antibody suggested that anticardiolipin antibodies are derived from a set of natural autoreactive clones. Regarding the pathogenic role of the antiphospholipid antibody, evidence has been presented that the epitopes formed between cardiolipin and beta 2 glycoprotein I are the targets of the antiphospholipid antibody. Complement activation, abnormalities of natural anticoagulants such as protein S deficiency, and genetic association with DR4, DR7, and DRw53 have also been studied.
