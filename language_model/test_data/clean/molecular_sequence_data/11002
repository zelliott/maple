The X and Y chromosomes of the mouse, like those of other mammals, are heteromorphic over most of their length, but at the distal ends of the chromosomes is a region of sequence identity, the pseudoautosomal region (PAR), where the chromosomes pair and recombine during male meiosis. The point at which the PAR diverges into X- and Y-specific sequences is called the pseudoautosomal boundary. We have completed a genomic walk from the X-specific Amelogenin gene to the PAR. Analysis of this region revealed that the pseudoautosomal boundary of mice is located within an intron of a transcribed gene that encodes a novel RING finger protein. The first three of the exons of the gene are located on the X chromosome whereas the 3' exons of the gene are located on both X and Y chromosomes. This unusual arrangement may indicate that the gene is in a state of transition from pseudoautosomal to X-unique and provides evidence for a process of attrition of the pseudoautosomal region on the Y chromosome.
