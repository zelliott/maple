Monocot-adapted brome mosaic virus (BMV) and dicot-adapted cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) are closely related bromoviruses with tripartite RNA genomes. Although RNAs 1 and 2 together are sufficient for RNA replication in protoplasts, systemic infection also requires RNA3, which encodes the coat protein and the nonstructural 3a movement protein. We have previously shown with bromoviral reassortants that host specificity determinants in both viruses are encoded by RNA3 as well as by RNA1 and/or RNA2. Here, to test their possible role in host specificity, the 3a movement protein genes were precisely exchanged between BMV and CCMV. The hybrid viruses, but not 3a deletion mutants, systemically infected Nicotiana benthamiana, a permissive host for both parental viruses. The hybrids thus retain basic competence for replication, packaging, cell-to-cell spread, and long-distance (vascular) spread. However, the hybrids failed to systemically infect either barley or cowpea, selective hosts for parental viruses. Thus, the 3a gene and/or its encoded 3a protein contributes to host specificity of both monocot- and dicot-adapted bromoviruses. Tests of inoculated cowpea leaves showed that the spread of the CCMV hybrid containing the BMV 3a gene was blocked at a very early stage of infection. Moreover, the BMV hybrid containing the CCMV 3a gene appeared to spread farther than wt BMV in inoculated cowpea leaves. Several pseudorevertants directing systemic infection in cowpea leaves were obtained from plants inoculated with the CCMV(BMV 3a) hybrid, suggesting that the number of mutations required to adapt the hybrid to dicots is small.
