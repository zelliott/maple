Methylophaga sp. strains JAM1 and JAM7 have been isolated from a denitrification system. Strain JAM1 was the first Methylophaga strain reported to be able to grow under denitrifying conditions. Here, we report the complete genome sequences of the two strains, which allowed prediction of gene clusters involved in denitrification in strain JAM1.
