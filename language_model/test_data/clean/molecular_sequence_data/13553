Four oleanne triterpene saponins, 3beta,16beta, 23-trihydroxy-keton-13beta,28-epoxyolean-9(11)-en-3-yl -[beta-D-glucopranosyl(1-->2)]-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->3)]-beta -D-fucopyranoside [1] (clinopodiside D), 16beta-propionyl-3beta,23-dihydroxyoleana-11-21-dien-3 -yl-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->2)]-[beta-D-glucopranosyl(1-->3)]-b eta-D-fucopyranoside [2] (clinipodiside E), 3beta,16beta,21alpha,23,28-pentahydroxy-11-methoxyolean++  +-12-en-3-yl-[beta-D-glucopyranolyl(1-->2)]-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl (1-->3)]-beta-D-fucopyranoside [3] (clinopodiside F), and 3beta,16beta,21beta,23,28-pentahydroxyoleana-11,13(18) -dien-3-yl-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->2)]-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1 -->3)]-beta-D-fucopyranoside [4] (clinopodiside G), were isolated and purified from the plant Clinopodium chinensis. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of interpretation of nmr and ms data and from chemical evidence. The results are of potential interest for medicinal reasons.
