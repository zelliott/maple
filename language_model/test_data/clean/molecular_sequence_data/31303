The nucleotide sequence of the import precursor of subunit b of rat liver H(+)-ATP synthase has been determined from a recombinant cDNA clone isolated by screening a rat liver cDNA library with a probe DNA. The sequence was composed of 1,124 nucleotides including a coding region for the import precursor of subunit b and noncoding regions of both the 5'- and 3'-sides. The import precursor of subunit b and its mature polypeptide deduced from the open reading frame consisted of 256 and 214 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 28,867 and 24,628, respectively. The presequence of 42 amino acids could be the import signal peptide which serves to direct the protein into the mitochondrial matrix.
