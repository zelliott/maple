Both experimental work and surveys of the lengths of internal exons in nature have suggested that vertebrate internal exons require a minimum size of approximately 50 nucleotides for efficient inclusion in mature mRNA. This phenomenon has been ascribed to steric interference between complexes involved in recognition of the splicing signals at the two ends of short internal exons. To determine whether U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, a multicomponent splicing factor that is involved in the first recognition of splice sites, contributes to the lower size limit of vertebrate internal exons, we have taken advantage of our previous observation that U1 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) which bind upstream or downstream of the 5' splice site (5'SS) stimulate splicing of the upstream intron. By varying the position of U1 binding relative to the 3'SS, we show that U1-dependent splicing of the upstream intron becomes inefficient when U1 is positioned 48 nucleotides or less downstream of the 3'SS, suggesting a minimal distance between U1 and the 3'SS of approximately 50 nucleotides. This distance corresponds well to the suggested minimum size of internal exons. The results of experiments in which the 3'SS region of the reporter was duplicated suggest an optimal distance of greater than 72 nucleotides. We have also found that inclusion of a 24-nucleotide miniexon is promoted by the binding of U1 to the downstream intron but not by binding to the 5'SS. Our results are discussed in the context of models to explain constitutive splicing of small exons in nature.
