We have studied a family of long repetitive DNA sequences (Hsr1) interspersed in the large genome of the European plethodontid salamander Hydromantes. The sequence analysis of a 5-kb fragment (Hsr1A) of one member has revealed significant similarities with amino acidic domains of retroviruses and retrotransposons. The similarity of the reverse transcriptase domain and the gene organization identifies Hsr1A as a member of the gypsy/Ty3 class of retrotransposons. We hypothesize that Hsr1 sequences are vestiges of an invasion of the Hydromantes genome that occurred early in the evolutionary history of these European plethodontids. About 10(6) Hsr1 sequences are present in the large Hydromantes genome. This is the highest number of copies so far discovered for retrotransposon-like elements in eukaryote organisms.
