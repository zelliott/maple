The increasing need for large-scale genotyping applications of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in model and nonmodel organisms requires the development of low-cost technologies accessible to minimally equipped laboratories. The method presented here allows efficient discrimination of SNPs by allele-specific PCR in a single reaction with standard PCR conditions. A common reverse primer and two forward allele-specific primers with different tails amplify two allele-specific PCR products of different lengths, which are further separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR specificity is improved by the introduction of a destabilizing mismatch within the 30 end of the allele-specific primers. This is a simple and inexpensive method for SNP detection that does not require PCR optimization.
