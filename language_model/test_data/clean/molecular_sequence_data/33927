Here, we report the draft genome sequence of Paenibacillus elgii B69, which was isolated from soil and has broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. As far as we know, the P. elgii genome is the largest of the Paenibacillus genus for which genome sequences are available. Multiple sets of genes related to antibiotic biosynthetic pathways have been found in the genome.
