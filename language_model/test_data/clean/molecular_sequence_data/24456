The primary structure of the newly sequence analysed placental tissue protein 13 (PP13) was highly homologous to several members of the beta-galactoside-binding S-type lectin (galectin) family. By homology modelling, the three-dimensional structure of PP13 was built based on high-resolution crystal structures of homologues and also their characteristic 'jellyroll' fold was found in the case of PP13. Our model has been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank. By multiple sequence alignment and structure-based secondary structure prediction, we underlined the structural similarity of PP13 with its homologues. The secondary structure of PP13 was identical with 'proto-type' galectins consisting of a five- and a six-stranded beta-sheet, joined by two alpha-helices, and galectins' highly conserved carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) was also present in PP13. Of the eight consensus residues in the CRD, four identical and three conservatively substituted were shared by PP13. By docking simulations PP13 possessed sugar-binding activity with highest affinity to N-acetyllactosamine and lactose typical of most galectins. All ligands were docked into the putative CRD of PP13. Based on several lines of evidence discussed in this paper demonstrating that PP13 is a novel galectin, PP13 was also designated galectin-13. These computational results provide some new insights into the possible role and importance of PP13 in various processes of the human body and can be of help in the initial steps of further functional research.
