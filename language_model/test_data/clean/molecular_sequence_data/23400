Peptide mimics derived from the first extracellular loop of CCR5 bearing non-peptide spacers in place of Ala-Ala-Ala sequence in the peptide moiety were synthesized, and the effects of these compounds on the inhibition against HIV-1 were examined. Compound 2b having m-aminophenoxyacetic acid derivative as a non-peptide spacer significantly inhibited HIV-1.
