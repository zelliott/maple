Antibodies can be used to identify tissue- and stage-specifically expressed genes. A monoclonal antibody MAB ab49 from a hybridoma library screened for immunohistochemical staining in the adult nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster was found to selectively bind to all neuropil regions and to synaptic boutons of motor neurons. In Western blots of homogenized brains the antibody recognizes two proteins of 32 and 34 kD. Using this antibody we have isolated seven cDNA clones that derive from two polyadenylated mRNA splice variants of a gene located at 79E1-2 on polytene chromosomes. The two mRNAs code for two inferred proteins of 249 and 223 amino acids, respectively, which are identical except for their C-terminals and a central deletion of 21 amino acids in the second protein. Both contain a contiguous string of 11 cysteine residues. In situ hybridization to frozen head sections detects expression of this gene in retina and neuronal perikarya. The 32 and 34 kD brain proteins that presumably are localized predominantly in synaptic terminals of photoreceptors and most if not all neurons may correspond to two variant cysteine-string proteins as they are of similar molecular weight and share an antigenic binding site for MAB ab49.
