A Gram-reaction-positive, facultatively anaerobic, motile, endospore-forming, rod-shaped strain, designated SgZ-7(T), was isolated from a windrow compost pile and was characterized by means of a polyphasic approach. Growth occurred with 0-3 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 1 %), at pH 6.0-10.0 (optimum pH 7.2) and at 40-60 °C (optimum 50 °C). The main respiratory quinone was MK-7. The predominant polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol. The major fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0 and anteiso-C15 : 0. The DNA G+C content was 46.6 mol%. The phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons revealed that strain SgZ-7(T) should be assigned to the genus Bacillus and was related most closely to Bacillus drentensis LMG 21831(T) (sequence similarity 97.2 %). The result of the DNA-DNA hybridization experiment revealed a low relatedness (27.2 %) between the isolate and B. drentensis LMG 21831(T). The results of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic analyses clearly indicated that strain SgZ-7(T) represents a novel species, for which the name Bacillus thermocopriae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SgZ-7(T) (= CCTCC AB 2012030(T) = KACC 16700(T)).
