A polyphasic taxonomic study was performed on seven Bacillus-like bacteria isolated from three hypersaline and alkaline lakes located in China, Kenya and Tanzania. All strains were moderately halophilic and alkaliphilic, Gram positive, motile rods. The DNA G+C content from the seven isolates ranged from 42.2 to 43.4mol% and their major fatty acid was anteiso-C(15:0). Strain CG1(T), selected as representative strain of the isolates, possesses meso-diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall peptidoglycan, MK-7 as the predominant menaquinone and diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine as the major polar lipids. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the isolates belonged to the genus Bacillus. The seven isolates shared 97.7-99.9% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, and formed a branch that was distinct from the type strains of the recognized species of the genus Bacillus. They were most closely related to Bacillus agaradhaerens DSM 8721(T) (92.6-93.8% 16S rRNA sequence similarity). DNA-DNA hybridization values between the seven isolates were 85-100%. According to the polyphasic characterization, the strains represent a novel species, for which the name Bacillus locisalis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CG1(T) (CCM 7370(T)=CECT 7152(T)=CGMCC 1.6286(T)=DSM 18085(T)).
