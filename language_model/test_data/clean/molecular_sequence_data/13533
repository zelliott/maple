Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) analyses were used to characterize the genetic composition of anther-derived plants of a diploid potato clone, CP2 (Solanum chacoense 80-1 x S. phureja 1-3). The ploidy of anther-derived plants was first determined by flow cytometry. A total of 44 decamer primers was screened for RAPD polymorphism. The loci that segregated were selected and scored. The monoploids had less than half as many loci carrying RAPD markers compared with the anther donor. Among 14 anther-derived diploids, 5 were identified as homozygous by marker frequency similar to monoploids and 9 as heterozygous. Five of seven SSRs obtained from published potato sequences were polymorphic in CP2. CP2 was found to be heterozygous with two alleles at four SSR loci (TC/TA, AAG, AGA, CTT) and three alleles at a ACTC locus. Primer pairs flanking each of the five polymorphic SSRs revealed that monoploids had only the allele contributed by S. chacoense 80-1. Homozygous diploids had only one band per SSR locus, whereas heterozygous diploids displayed more than one allele for at least one SSR locus. Results of the SSR analysis supported the findings based on RAPD markers; the same five diploid clones were characterized as homozygous by both SSR and RAPD markers.
