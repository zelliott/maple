Thermostabilities of kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase and of its mutants that became thermostable, in the free state, because of single-amino-acid replacements were studied after immobilization of the enzymes on cyanogen bromide-activated Sephadex G-200 particles. Lys in place of Gln at position 102 decreased the thermostability of the immobilized enzyme, whereas replacement with other amino acids enhanced it.
