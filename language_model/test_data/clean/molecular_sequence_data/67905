In vertebrates, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) are key hormones regulating growth and reproduction in the brain-pituitary axis. The regulating hormonal interactions are of great interest, therefore, the aim of this study is to provide novel insights into the involvement of brain GnRH and PACAP in oogensis and spermatogenesis in a fish model, the blue gourami (Trichogaster trichopterus). cDNA cloning of two GnRH forms combined with phylogenetic analysis revealed that three paralogous GnRH forms exist in blue gourami and evolve as a result of genome duplication. GnRH1 mRNA levels are related to final oocyte maturation (FOM), and this peptide stimulated β follicle-stimulating hormone (βFSH) and growth hormone (GH) gene expression; GnRH2 stimulated β gonadotropins (GtH) gene expression and GnRH analog combined with PACAP-38 synergistically upregulate GH and βFSH gene expression. The data presented, together with previous studies in our lab, enable suggesting mechanisms explaining the physiological relevance of these peptides in the regulation of gametogenesis and steroidogenesis in blue gourami females. These findings support the biological importance of the GnRH and PACAP hormones family, enabling them to stimulate differential biological functions in the regulation of growth and reproduction.
