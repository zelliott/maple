Early development in many animals is programmed by maternal mRNAs inherited by the fertilized egg. Many of these RNAs are translationally dormant in immature oocytes, but are recruited onto polysomes during meiotic maturation or fertilization. Polyadenylation plays a major role in controlling the translation of maternal mRNA during these times of development. Polyadenylation, in turn, is dependent upon two cis elements that reside in the 3'-terminal region of responsive mRNAs. In two cases, the factors that interact with these regions have been examined. The half-life of maternal mRNA also is regulated by polyadenylation, which again is controlled by 3'-terminal cis elements. The recent literature covering these topics is reviewed.
