In an attempt to determine the localization of the messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding somatostatin in the rat retina, we studied Sprague-Dawley rats by in situ hybridization histochemistry using radiolabelled oligodeoxyribonucleotides complementary for rat somatostatin mRNA. Among the layers of retina, we found specific labelling in the soma of some cells in the innermost and outermost laminae of the inner nuclear layer and in the ganglion cell layer; no specific labelling was observed in the inner and outer plexiform layers or in the outer nuclear layer. These data indicate the major site of somatostain synthesis within the rat retina.
