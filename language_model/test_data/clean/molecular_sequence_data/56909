We have cloned a cDNA sequence coding for a Chironomus tentans steroid hormone receptor homologue which exhibits extensive amino acid sequence co-linearity with the ecdysteroid receptor of Drosophila melanogaster (dEcR; cell 67, 59-77). The DNA-binding domain has 95% and the hormone-binding domain 75% amino acid sequence identity with the cloned dEcR. The gene for this C. tentans protein is located on chromosome II, region 17C, as determined by in situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes of salivary glands. On Northern blots cDNA probes of the cloned gene hybridize to polyadenylated RNA of ca 4.2 kb. The expression of the cloned gene seems to be developmentally regulated and correlates to changes in ecdysteroid titer. Transfection of this C. tentans protein into D. melanogaster Schneider's line 2 cells leads to transcriptional interference with endogenous dEcR on an ecdysteroid-regulated promoter.
