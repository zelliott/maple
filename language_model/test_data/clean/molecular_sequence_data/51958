Sequence-tagged sites (STSs) are short stretches of DNA that can be specifically detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and can be used to construct long-range physical maps of chromosomal DNA. These STSs can be detected by PCR assays developed by reference to data obtained from the sequencing of restriction fragment length polymorphism-DNA markers for chromosome 21, which were derived from recombinant lamba-phage and plasmid clones made from DNA of a human-hamster hybrid cell line. In this report, we describe the generation of 19 new STSs that are specific for human chromosome 21.
