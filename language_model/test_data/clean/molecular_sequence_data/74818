When it is bound to lipid bilayers, the conformation and location of the membrane pH (low) insertion peptide (pHLIP) depend on pH. This unique feature allows us to explicitly measure the kinetics leading to different membrane-bound states of pHLIP using a model membrane and stopped-flow technique. Our results show that the membrane association kinetics of pHLIP are multiexponential and are consistent with a parallel membrane interaction mechanism. Interestingly, our results also show that the overall rate at which the membrane-inserted state is formed is almost identical to that of formation of the surface-bound state, while prebinding slows the rate of peptide insertion.
