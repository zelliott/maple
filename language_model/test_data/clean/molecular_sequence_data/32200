Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) pollinosis is the most prevalent allergy in Japan. Recently, the Japanese cedar pollen allergen Cry j 3 was cloned as a homologue of Jun a 3, which is a major allergen from mountain cedar (Juniperus ashei) pollen. However, native Cry j 3 has not been isolated and there are no reports on its allergenic activity. The aims of this study were to isolate native Cry j 3 and assess its immunoglobulin E (IgE)-binding capacity in patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis.

Native Cry j 3 was purified from Japanese cedar pollen by multidimensional chromatography. We assessed the IgE-binding capacity using sera from patients allergic to Japanese cedar pollen by immunoblot analysis and ELISA. Moreover, we assayed the capacity of Cry j 3 to induce histamine release from the patients' leukocytes. We cloned cDNA corresponding to purified Cry j 3 from a cDNA library of Japanese cedar pollen.

We isolated native Cry j 3 as a 27-kDa protein. The IgE-binding frequency of Cry j 3 from the sera of patients allergic to Japanese cedar pollen was estimated as 27% (27/100) by ELISA. Cry j 3 induced the release of histamine from leukocytes. We cloned the cDNA and named it Cry j 3.8. Cry j 3.8 cDNA encoded 225 amino acids and had significant homology with thaumatin-like proteins.

Cry j 3 is a causative allergen in Japanese cedar pollinosis and may play crucial roles in the cross-reactivity with oral allergy syndrome.
