Spider silk is one of nature's most remarkable biomaterials due to extraordinary strength and toughness not found in today's synthetic materials. Of the seven types of silk, wrapping silk (AcSp1) is the most extensible of the types of silks and has no sequence similarity to the other types. Here we report the chemical shifts for the AcSp1 199 amino acid protein repeat unit and its anticipated secondary structure based on secondary chemical shifts.
