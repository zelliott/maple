A cDNA library, prepared from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from quiescent AKR-2B cells 4 hr after stimulation with epidermal growth factor in the presence of cycloheximide, was screened to identify RNA transcripts whose abundance is specifically increased as a primary response to growth stimulation. Approximately 40% of the inducible clones detected by this procedure corresponded to either cytoskeletal beta- or gamma-actin genes. One nonactin clone, designated c99, was found to be derived from an 8.5-kilobase RNA whose abundance began to increase as early as 30 min after stimulation. DNA sequencing established the identity of this RNA as fibronectin. Several additional mitogens were then tested and found to efficiently induce fibronectin mRNA. These included fetal calf serum, platelet-derived growth factor, and transforming growth factor type beta. For at least one inducer, fetal calf serum, the increase in mRNA was preceded by an increase in fibronectin gene transcription. This increase was rapid, reaching maximal levels within 10 min, and was accompanied by near-coordinate increases in both c-fos and beta-actin transcription. These results indicate that fibronectin is a member of a class of "early-response" genes, typified by c-fos and including beta-actin, whose rapid expression may be important in mediating cellular responses to peptide growth factors.
