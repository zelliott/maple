The biogenesis of Symbiodinium symbiosome in the host cells of the sea anemone, Aiptasia pulchella, involves retention of ApRab5 on and exclusion of ApRab11 from the organelle. One predicted consequence of this differential Rab association is the constant membrane fusion of symbiosomes with endocytic vesicles in the absence of parallel membrane retrieval and the subsequent formation of spacious symbiosomes, which nevertheless, contradicts the common perception. To solve this discrepancy, we determined whether membrane fusion occurs between symbiosomes and endocytic vesicles, and whether ApRab11-independent recycling is involved in symbiosome biogenesis. By using the biotin-avidin detection system, we found evidence for symbiosome-endocytic vesicle fusion. Cloning and characterization of ApRab4, an A. pulchella homolog of Rab4, showed that ApRab4 is associated with both the early endocytic and the perinuclear recycling compartments, and its normal function is required for the organization of the recycling compartments. Immunostaining localized ApRab4 to the symbiosome membrane, partially overlapping with ApRab5-decorated microdomains. Significantly, a treatment that impaired Symbiodinium photosynthesis also abolished symbiosome association of ApRab4. Furthermore, ApRab4 was quickly recruited to newly formed phagosomes, but prolonged association only occurred in those harboring live zooxanthelllae. We propose that ApRab4 retention on the symbiosome is an essential part of the mechanism for the biogenesis of Symbiodinium symbiosome.
