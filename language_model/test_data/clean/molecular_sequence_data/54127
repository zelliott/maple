A Gram-staining-negative, pink bacterium, designated strain BUZ 2(T), was isolated from coastal mud from the North Sea (Fedderwardersiel, Germany). Cells were rod-shaped and able to form multicellular filaments. Growth after 7 days was observed at 10-40 °C, at pH 6-8 and with 0-0.5 % NaCl. The phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain BUZ 2(T) is a member of the family Cytophagaceae, its closest neighbours being Rudanella lutea 5715S-11(T), Spirosoma linguale LMG 10896(T) and Spirosoma panaciterrae Gsoil 1519(T) (87.8, 86.4 and 86.1 % sequence similarity, respectively). The major fatty acids were summed feature 3 (comprising C(16 : 1)ω7c and/or iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH), C(16 : 1)ω5c and iso-C(15 : 0). The predominant respiratory quinone was MK-7 and the major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine and several unidentified aminophospholipids. The DNA G+C content was 56.5 mol%. On the basis of this polyphasic study, we propose that strain BUZ 2(T) represents a novel genus and species, for which the name Fibrella aestuarina gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Fibrella aestuarina is BUZ 2(T) (=DSM 22563(T) =CCUG 58136(T)). An emended description of the genus Rudanella is also proposed.
