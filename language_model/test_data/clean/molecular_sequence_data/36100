Cultured cells of Anabaena flos-aquae strain CYA 83/1, isolated from Lake Edlandsvatn, Norway, produced two microcystin mono-methyl ester derivatives (1 and 2) at the D-Glu unit in addition to microcystin-LR (3), [D-Asp3]microcystin-LR (4), microcystin-RR (5), and [D-Asp3]microcystin-RR (6). Structures of these compounds were assigned based on their amino acid analysis with a Waters Pico Tag HPLC system plus fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS), including tandem FABMS, analysis on the two new microcystins, [D-Glu(OCH3)6]microcystin-LR (1) and [D-Asp3, D-Glu(OCH3)6]microcystin-LR (2). Toxicity data were not obtained for 1 and 2 because of the small amounts isolated from the cells.
