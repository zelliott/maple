We have determined the DNA sequence of a BALB/c Tla region class I gene from the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) that had been identified previously as encoding a murine antigen by DNA-mediated gene transfer. Analysis of the DNA sequence shows, however, that this gene, the T1c gene from the Tlac genotype, could not encode a TL antigen or any other functional class I molecule due to the presence of numerous stop codons and frameshift mutations in the coding regions. This result suggests that the earlier transformation data may have been incorrect or perhaps that the clone containing the T1c gene contains sequences that induced expression of a serologically reactive Tla gene in the genome of the recipient L cell. The T1c gene is structurally related to the previously sequenced T13c gene that encodes a serologically defined TL antigen. The 3' half of the T1c gene including exons 4, 5, 6, and the 3' untranslated region has about 85% nucleotide similarity (including introns) with the corresponding parts of the T13c gene; however, the 5' half of the T1c gene has little homology with the T13c gene. There is a sharp line of demarcation between the homologous and nonhomologous regions, and this border occurs precisely at a B2 Alu repeat sequence present in the T13c gene. This suggests that a recombination event took place here and that an Alu repeat sequence that is known to have characteristics of transposable elements played some role in a recombination or gene conversion event.
