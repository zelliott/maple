We report here the isolation and genomic organization of the orthologous mouse Duffy gene, named Dfy. It is a single copy gene located in chromosome 1 in a region homologous to the human Duffy gene (FY). Sequence analyses indicate that Dfy consists of two exons: exon 1 of 55 nucleotides, which encodes 7 amino acid residues; and exon 2 of 1038 nucleotides, which encodes 327 residues. The single intron consists of 462 nucleotides. The 5'-end promoter region contains motifs involved in vertebrate development in addition to potential binding sites of factors for globin transcription. The open reading frame (ORF) shows 60% homology with the human Duffy protein. However, mouse erythrocytes are serologically Duffy-negative and mouse erythrocyte membrane proteins do not cross-react with two Duffy-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies. The deduced protein predicts a M(r) of 36,692 and carries three potential N-glycosylation sites to asparagine residues. Hydropathy analysis predicts an exocellular amino-terminal domain of 57 residues, seven transmembrane alpha-helices, and an endocellular carboxy-terminal domain of 29 residues. In bone marrow and spleen, Dfy expresses a major 1.4-kb and a minor 1.8-kb mRNA. Contrary to humans, Dfy is expressed in liver, synthesizing a 1.4-kb mRNA, and is repressed in kidney. Dfy is highly expressed in mouse brain and produces a major 8.5-kb and a minor 10.2-kb mRNA. The human erythroleukemia K562 cells, transfected with cDNA encoding the mouse Duffy-like protein and mouse erythrocytes, have the same chemokine binding profiles indicating that they contain the same protein.
