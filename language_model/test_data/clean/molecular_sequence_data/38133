This paper describes eight new alleles (B*0807, B*0809, B*1551, B*3529, B*3532, B*4025, B*5304 and B*5508) that have been found by routine HLA-B genotyping with sequence-specific oligonucleotides (SSOs). All of the new alleles have variations which cause changes in residues that occur within antigen binding pockets and T-cell recognition sites of the antigen. The new polymorphisms within these new alleles may affect the nature and specificity of peptide binding and cause differential T-cell activation, which may have an affect in transplantation.
