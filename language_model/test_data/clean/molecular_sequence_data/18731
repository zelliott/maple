Here, we present two new HLA allelic variants at C locus: HLA-C*08:63 and HLA-C*14:44 detected by sequence-based typing. In both cases, a single-nucleotide mutation in exon 3 is responsible for a change in aminoacid translation. The extremely high polymorphism of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) system in human genome is responsible for the capability to recognize different antigens, including non-self-MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) molecules. This very high polymorphism and the improving accuracy of genomic HLA typing methods lead to an exponential increasing of known HLA alleles. Here, we describe the characterization of two new HLA-C alleles identified by sequence-based typing (SBT): HLA-C*08:63 and HLA-C*14:44.
