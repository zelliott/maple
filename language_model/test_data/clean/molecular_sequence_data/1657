Rhesus and human cytomegalovirus (RhCMV and HCMV, respectively) exhibit comparable inhibition by benzimidazole nucleosides, including 2,5,6-trichloro-(1-beta-d-ribofuranosyl)benzimidazole (TCRB), and pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines. The two HCMV protein targets of TCRB, UL89 and UL56, are highly conserved with their RhCMV homologues. These data indicate that infection of rhesus macaques with RhCMV represents a useful model to test novel anti-HCMV drugs.
