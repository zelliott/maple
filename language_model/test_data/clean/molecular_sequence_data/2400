To investigate the role of sequences lying downstream of the conserved AAUAAA hexanucleotide in pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation, deletions or substitutions were constructed in polyadenylation signals from simian virus 40 and adenovirus, and their effects were assayed in both crude and fractionated HeLa cell nuclear extracts. As expected, these sequences influenced the efficiency of both cleavage and polyadenylation as well as the accuracy of the cleavage reaction. Sequences near or upstream of the actual site of poly(A) addition appeared to specify a unique cleavage site, since their deletion resulted, in some cases, in heterogeneous cleavage. Furthermore, the sequences that allowed the simian virus 40 late pre-RNA to be cleaved preferentially by partially purified cleavage activity were also those at the cleavage site itself. Interestingly, sequences downstream of the cleavage site interacted with factors not directly involved in catalyzing cleavage and polyadenylation, since the effects of deletions were substantially diminished when partially purified components were used in assays. In addition, these sequences contained elements that could affect 3'-end formation both positively and negatively.
