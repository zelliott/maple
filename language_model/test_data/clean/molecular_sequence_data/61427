Using a semi-continuous enrichment method, we isolated two thermophilic bacterial strains, which could completely degrade abietane resin acids, including dehydroabietic acid (DhA). Strain DhA-73, isolated from a laboratory-scale bioreactor treating bleached kraft mill effluent at 55 degrees C, grew on DhA as sole carbon source; while DhA-71, isolated from municipal compost, required dilute tryptic soy broth for growth on DhA. DhA-71 grew on DhA from 30 degrees C to 60 degrees C with maximum growth at 50 degrees C; while, DhA-73 grew on DhA from 37 degrees C to 60 degrees C with maximum growth at 55 degrees C. At 55 degrees C, the doubling times for DhA-71 and DhA-73 were 3.3 and 3.7 h, respectively. DhA-71 and DhA-73 had growth yields of 0.26 and 0.19 g of protein per g of DhA, respectively. During growth on DhA, both strains converted DhA to CO2, biomass, and dissolved organic carbon. Analyses of the 16S-rDNA sequences of these two strains suggest that they belong to two new genera in the Rubrivivax subgroup of the beta subclass of the Proteobacteria. Strains DhA-71 and DhA-73 are the first two bacteria isolated and characterized that are capable of biodegradation of resin acids at high temperatures. This study provided direct evidence for biodegradation of resin acids and feasibility for biotreatment of pulp mill effluent at elevated temperatures.
