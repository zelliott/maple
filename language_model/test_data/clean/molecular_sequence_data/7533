The primary structure of a novel insect neuropeptide, Cardioacceleratory Peptide 2b (CAP2b), from the tobacco hawkmoth Manduca sexta has been established using a combination of mass spectroscopy, Edman degradation microsequencing, amino acid analysis, and biological assays. The sequence of CAP2b, pyroGlu-Leu-Tyr-Ala-Phe-Pro-Arg-Val-amide, has a molecular weight of 974.6 and is blocked at both the amino and carboxyl ends. Examination of several national computer protein data bases failed to reveal other peptides or proteins with any sequence homology to CAP2b indicating that this is likely to be a novel insect neuropeptide. This peptide may be a general activator of insect viscera since it causes an increase in heart rate in Manduca and in Drosophila, and has also been implicated in the regulation of fluid secretion by the Malphigian tubules of Drosophila.
