Four adjacent genes (sipW, sipX, sipY and sipZ) encoding different type I signal peptidases, were isolated on a 7860 bp DNA fragment from Streptomyces lividans TK21. Three of the sip genes constitute an operon and the fourth is the first gene of another operon encompassing three additional, unrelated genes. A DNA fragment containing the four sip genes complemented an Escherichia coli type I signal peptidase mutant when cloned in a multicopy plasmid. Clustering of four different type I signal peptidase genes seems, so far, to be a unique feature of Streptomyces.
