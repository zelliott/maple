Novel endothelin-1 (ET-1) analogues which are highly potent endothelin antagonists at both receptor subtype ETA and ETB are reported. The replacement of Asp18 with the Thr18 and of Ile19 with a hydrophobic amino acid whose side-chain branches on the gamma-carbon such as Leu, cyclohexylalanine, and gamma-methylleucine (gamma-MeLeu) resulted in loss of or significantly decreased the biological activity of ET-1, while high affinity for the ETA (IC50 = 0.42-0.70 nM) and ETB (IC50 = 0.17-0.43 nM) receptor was retained. These compounds were shown to have high antagonist activities in ET-1-induced vasoconstriction of porcine coronary artery (pA2 7.4-7.7) and in Sarafotoxin S6c-induced vasoconstriction of rabbit pulmonary artery ([Thr18, gamma-MeLeu19]ET-1: pA2 8.4). Among these compounds, [Thr18, gamma-MeLeu19]ET-1 has the desirable characteristic of possessing no agonist activity at either receptor subtype.
