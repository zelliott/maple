Many methanotrophs contain both a soluble and a particulate methane monooxygenase. A unique metabolic switch, mediated by copper ions, regulates the expression of these enzymes. When the copper-to-biomass ratio of the cell is low, the soluble enzyme is expressed, and when the copper-to-biomass ratio is high, the particulate enzyme is expressed. A model for the mechanism of this switch is proposed.
