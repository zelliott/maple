Marteilia refringens is a paramyxean parasite which infects the flat oyster Ostrea edulis and mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), where it has been attributed to a separate species, Marteilia maurini, by several authors. Doubts persist though as to the existence or not of two species of Marteilia in Europe. We have devised a molecular method for the diagnosis of M. refringens based on 358 bp nested-PCR of the rDNA intergene spacer (rDNA IGS) which is capable of detecting 0.5 fg of M. refringens DNA. Molecular characterization of this spacer indicates that the Marteilia parasites which infect oysters and mussels are two different strains of the same species.
