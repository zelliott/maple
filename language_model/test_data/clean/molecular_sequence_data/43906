We isolated a citrate synthase gene (citA) from Aspergillus nidulans. By analysis of the protein coding region, citA was shown to encode a citrate synthase (CitA) of 52.2 kDa consisting of 474 amino acid residues that were interrupted by seven introns. Also, the precursor CitA protein was revealed to have an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal of 35 amino acid residues containing an R-3 cleavage motif, R(32)-C-Y decreases S(35), which supports the fact that citA encodes the mitochondrial form of citrate synthase of A. nidulans. Southern blot analysis showed that citA is present as a single copy in the genome.
