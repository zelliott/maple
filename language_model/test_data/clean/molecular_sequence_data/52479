To identify candidate interferons (IFNs) for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and to investigate sequence-function relationships, the antiviral activities of nine species of recombinant IFN-alpha [IFN-alpha A, IFN-alpha B, IFN-alpha C, IFN-alpha D, IFN-alpha J, [Ser116]IFN-alpha J1, IFN-alpha K, IFN-alpha J/C(Fnu4HI), and IFN-alpha A/D(BglII)] were evaluated against HIV-1. MT-2 cells were exposed to various concentrations of each IFN and were then infected with HIV. Protective effect was determined by cell viability using a tetrazolium dye assay. Activity against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was assessed on MDBK and WISH cells. The 50% inhibitory concentration against HIV was 37 +/- 14 pg/ml for IFN-alpha A, and ranged from 15 +/- 3 pg/ml for IFN-alpha J/C(Fnu4HI) to > 90,000 pg/ml for IFN-alpha D. In general, relative activity against HIV was similar to relative activity against VSV on WISH cells. IFN-alpha D was notable for its decreased activity on human cells. The observations suggest that it may be possible to produce IFNs-alpha with more favorable therapeutic indices than currently available IFNs. Furthermore, the anti-HIV activity of IFNs-alpha is not determined solely by their linear amino acid sequence.
