The ubiquitous inducibility of the immediate-early gene c-fos in the central nervous system has led to the search for downstream genes which are regulated by its product, Fos. Recent evidence suggests that c-fos induction by a single injection of the classical antipsychotic haloperidol may contribute to the subsequent increase in neurotensin gene expression in the rodent striatum. Consistent with this proposal, in the present study haloperidol-induced Fos-like immunoreactivity and neurotensin/neuromedin N messenger RNA were found to be expressed by the same population of striatal neurons. Moreover, inhibition of haloperidol-induced c-fos expression by intrastriatal injection of antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides complimentary either to bases 109-126 or 127-144 of c-fos attenuated the subsequent increase in neurotensin/neuromedin N messenger RNA. However, injection of a sense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide corresponding to bases 127-144 of c-fos did not reduce haloperidol-induced c-fos or neurotensin/neuromedin N expression. Furthermore, constitutive expression of Jun-like immunoreactivity in the striatum was not reduced by either the sense or antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides. Similarly, the sense and antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide failed to reduce proenkephalin messenger RNA, which is located in the same striatal neurons that express haloperidol-induced neurotensin/neuromedin N messenger RNA, which is located in the same striatal neurons that express haloperidol-induced neurotensin/neuromedin N messenger RNA. Lastly, haloperidol-induced increases in nerve growth factor I-A-, JunB- and FosB-like immunoreactivity and fosB messenger RNA were not decreased by intrastriatal injection of either the sense or antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides. These results indicate that the antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides attenuated haloperidol-induced neurotensin/neuromedin N expression by selectively reducing c-fos expression and emphasize the potential importance of immediate-early gene induction in the mechanism of action of this antipsychotic drug.
