Two soluble exopeptidases were identified in promastigotes of Leishmania major, using an iodinated model tetrapeptide (LIAY) as substrate. Similar activities were also detected in L. major amastigotes and in different species of Leishmania promastigotes. A carboxy- and an aminopeptidase activity were resolved and isolated by anion exchange and gel permeation chromatographies. A single polypeptide of 62 kDa co-purified with the aminopeptidase activity. Optimum pH was neutral for the carboxypeptidase and neutral to alkaline for the aminopeptidase. Both activities were able to hydrolyse a dipeptide substrate (YL), and were inhibited by 20 microM bestatin and 200 microM 1,10-phenanthroline, but not by leupeptin, iodoacetamide and a range of other inhibitors. These results strongly suggest that both enzymes are metalloexopeptidases and thus represent a novel class of soluble peptidases in Leishmania.
