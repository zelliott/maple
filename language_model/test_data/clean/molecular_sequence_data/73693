We report the fist genetic transformation system, shuttle vectors, and integrative vectors for the thermotolerant, methylotrophic bacterium Bacillus methanolicus. By using a polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation procedure, we have successfully transformed B. methanolicus with both integrative and multicopy plasmids. For plasmids with a single BmeTI recognition site, dam methylation of plasmid DNA (in vivo or in vitro) was found to enhance transformation efficiency from 7- to 11-fold. Two low-copy-number Escherichia coli-B, methanolicus shuttle plasmids, pDQ507 and pDQ508, are described. pDQ508 caries the replication origin cloned from a 17-kb endogenous B. methanolicus plasmid, pBM1. pDQ507 carries a cloned B. methanolicus DNA fragment, pmr-1, possibly of chromosomal origin, that supports maintenance of pDQ507 as a circular, extrachromosomal DNA molecule. Deletion analysis of pDQ507 indicated two regions required for replication, i.e., a 90-bp AT-rich segment containing a 46-bp imperfect, inverted repeat sequence and a second region 65% homologous to the B. subtilis dpp operon. We also evaluated two E. coli-B. subtilis vectors, pEN1 and pHP13, for use as E. coli-B. methanolicus shuttle vectors. The plasmids pHP13, pDQ507, and pDQ508 were segregationally and structurally stable in B. methanolicus for greater than 60 generations of growth under nonselective conditions; pEN1 was segregationally unstable. Single-stranded plasmid DNA was detected in B. methanolicus transformants carrying either pEN1, pHP13, or pDQ508, suggesting that pDQ508, like the B. subtilis plasmids, is replicated by a rolling-circle mechanism. These studies provide the basic tools for the genetic manipulation of B. methanolicus.
