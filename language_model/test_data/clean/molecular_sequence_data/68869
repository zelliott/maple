Alcohol-soluble proteins from Amaranthus seeds differ from prolamine fractions of cereals and plants. Albumins and globulins are the major fractions of Amaranthus. Peptide sequences of storage and membrane proteins from different cereals and plants were compared. Secondary structure of proteins was computerized by dot matrix and hydropathy analyses.
