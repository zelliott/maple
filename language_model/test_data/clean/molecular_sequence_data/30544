Several species of mRNA have been shown to encode the alpha subunit of the stimulatory GTP-binding regulatory protein, Gs alpha. The various Gs alpha mRNAs are generated through alternative splicing of a single precursor RNA and through the use of alternative acceptor splice sites. We now report the existence of a Gs alpha mRNA that uses a previously unidentified promoter and leading exon (termed exon 1'). In both the canine and human Gs alpha genes, exon 1' is located 2.5 kilobases 5' of exon 1. Exon 1' does not contribute an in-frame ATG, and thus its mRNA encodes a truncated form of Gs alpha. Initiation of translation is predicted to begin at an AUG in exon 2, as demonstrated both by in vitro translation and COS cell expression studies.
