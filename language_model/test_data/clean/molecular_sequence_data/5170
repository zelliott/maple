We sought to find a peptide analogue of an important antigen (TSL-1) of Trichinella spiralis which is recognized by the 7C2C5 antibody. A phage library which displays a short (15-mer) randomly-generated peptide at the filament of the minor coat protein of the virion was used for selection by the 7C2C5 antibody. A peptide thus identified, ICDASGLGCWCWSLSP, was found to be a true surrogate since its binding to the antibody could be blocked by the native antigen and, conversely, an antiserum made to the peptide could recognize the native antigen. In addition, the peptide appeared to detect T. spiralis-infected pigs although it was less discriminatory than the native antigen.
