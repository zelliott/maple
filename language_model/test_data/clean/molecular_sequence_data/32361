A detailed phylogenetic analysis of two variants of the Graffi murine retrovirus, GV-1.2 and GV-1.4, showed that they are closely related to SRS 19-6 and Moloney MuLVs. Two stretches of sequence testify to the divergence between Graffi and SRS 19-6 MuLVs, one corresponding to a recombination event of Graffi MuLV with a xenotropic virus. Moloney MuLV was found more distant, particularly in the GAG region. Our study encompasses every class of MuLVs (ecotropic, amphotropic, xenotropic, polytropic) with some focus on exogenous ecotropic viruses and further adds to previous phylogenetic studies. Graffi, SRS 19-6, Moloney, Friend and Rauscher MuLVs form a cluster that appears to share a common ancestor with the Casitas-amphotropic and -ecotropic MuLVs but are more distant to the Akv-type and xenotropic MuLVs. The analysis also revealed that the ENV region of HEMV, the prototype of the MuLV ancestor, was closely related to the corresponding region of Cas-Br-E.
