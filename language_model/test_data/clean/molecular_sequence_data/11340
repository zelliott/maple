To elucidate the relationship between the frequency of core mutations and precore mutation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Japanese HBV carriers, we investigated the nucleotide sequence of the precore/core region of HBV in 26 Japanese HBV carriers [15 who were HBe antigen-negative (HBeAg-) and 11 who were HBeAg-positive (HBeAg+)]. The number of amino acid changes (5.9 +/- 3.8) in the core region of HBV in HBeAg-carriers was significantly greater than that in the HBeAg+ carriers (1.5 +/- 1.0; P < 0.005). The precore stop codon mutation was found in 93.3% of HBeAg-negative HBV carriers, while no precore mutation was found in the HBeAg-positive HBV carriers, suggesting that the frequency of core mutations may be associated with the presence of the precore stop codon mutation. However, there was no significant difference in the frequency of amino acid changes among HBeAg-HBV carriers. The mean number of core amino acid changes of liver cirrhosis patients, chronic active hepatitis patients, chronic persistent hepatitis patients, and asymptomatic carriers were 2.7 +/- 1.5, 6.0 +/- 2.2, 4.7 +/- 1.2, and 8.4 +/- 5.3, respectively. We detected hot spots for core mutations, which showed characteristic localizations and specific substitutions: Gly-87, Leu-97, and Thr-130 were detected exclusively in patients with chronic liver disease with or without HBeAg. To address further the relationship between frequency of core mutations and the presence of the precore stop codon mutation, we investigated the precore/core nucleotide sequence serially along with seroconversion in three patients with chronic hepatitis B in whom the hepatitis either became inactive or remained active after the seroconversion. Emergence of the precore stop codon mutation and a significant increase in core amino-acid changes after seroconversion were noted in all three patients. Our results suggest a close association between the frequency of core amino acid changes and the presence of the precore stop codon mutation; some characteristic core mutations may be associated with the clinical course of chronic hepatitis B in Japanese patients.
