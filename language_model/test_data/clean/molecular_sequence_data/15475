Eleven strains of halophilic, facultative anaerobes isolated from healthy and diseased Dentex dentex and Sparus aurata (bony fishes) cultured in Spanish Mediterranean fisheries have been studied by a polyphasic approach that included a wide phenotypic characterization, DNA-DNA hybridization and phylogenetic analysis using 16S rRNA, recA and rpoD gene sequences. All strains were phylogenetically related to Enterovibrio species and Vibrio calviensis. On the basis of sequence analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization data, eight of the strains were identified as Enterovibrio coralii. The remaining three strains formed a tight, independent clade in all sequence analyses and showed less than 70 % DNA-DNA hybridization with strains of the closest Enterovibrio species, from which they could be differentiated by several phenotypic traits. We conclude that these three strains represent a novel species in the genus Enterovibrio and we thus propose the name Enterovibrio nigricans sp. nov., with strain DAl 1-1-5(T) (=CECT 7320(T) =CAIM 661(T)) as the type strain. In addition, we propose the reclassification of Vibrio calviensis Denner et al. 2002 as Enterovibrio calviensis comb. nov. (type strain RE35F/12(T) [corrected] =CIP 107077(T) =DSM 14347(T) =CECT 7414(T)) and we provide an emended description of the genus Enterovibrio.
