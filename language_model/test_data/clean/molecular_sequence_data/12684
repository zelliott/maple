Altered porcine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-B)-cDNA was ligated to the expression vector. The resultant plasmid, pSA10041 was cotransfected with pSV2neo plasmid in NIH3T3 cells and clones were selected using G418. The clones were checked for integration of TGF-B-cDNA by PCR. The western blotting results confirm the expression of TGF-B in NIH3T3 cells. This construct can be used to develop transgenic mice to study its effect in vivo.
