A cluster of metalloproteinase genes, stromelysin, fibroblast collagenase, and stromelysin 2 together with the anonymous DNA marker D11S385, was mapped using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to a 135-kb region of chromosome 11q22-q23. The physical proximity of these markers was subsequently confirmed using two YAC clones, and their relative order was established as stromelysin 2-collagenase-stromelysin-D11S385. The pattern of marker representation in a panel of radiation-reduced chromosome 11 hybrids suggests that the metalloproteinase gene/D11S385 cluster is orientated with STMY2 closest to the centromere.
