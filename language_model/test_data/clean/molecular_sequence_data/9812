Of the six complementarity-determining regions (CDR) forming the structure of the Ab combining site, CDR3 of heavy chain is the most variable in length and sequence. Diversity of this loop is determined by the number of gene segments involved, extent of addition to or deletion from the joining genes, and imprecision of the site of recombination. In neonatal mice and Xenopus tadpoles, the last two factors occur less frequently than in adults, which in tadpoles result in low affinity Ab responses that do not mature. In contrast, adult urodele amphibians make larval-like responses and are notorious for lifelong poor immunocompetence. The mechanism for this is not known, and in this study we cloned germline VH genes from the axolotl and obtained rearrangements to these VH gene segments by reverse-transcriptase PCR. These sequences were analyzed for heavy chain junctional diversity and found to be even less variable than that in newborn mouse or Xenopus tadpoles, although for different reasons. Only 29% of the CDR3 loop in the axolotl consisted of somatically generated sequences, compared with 44% in tadpole, 39% in newborn mice, and 57% in both adult mice and Xenopus. This distinguishing feature of axolotl CDR3 results not only from shorter junctional sequences, but also unusually extensive integration of germline JH sequence. As the CDR3 loop is the most important portion of the Ig sequence for determining Ab combining site diversity, our data provide the molecular basis for a contributing factor in the deficient urodele amphibian Ab responses.
