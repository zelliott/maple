Three highly homologous cDNAs encoding human pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein (SP1) were isolated from a human placental cDNA library. These cDNAs share greater than 90% nucleotide homology in their coding sequences, and greater than 79% of the encoded amino acids are homologous. Proteins encoded by these cDNAs are very similar to members of the carcinoembryonic antigen family and contain repeating domains, conserved disulfide bridges, and beta-sheet structure typical of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. However, the high degree of sequence homology and relatively lesser degree of glycosylation among the SP1 proteins suggest that they exist as a unique family instead of being members of the CEA family. Both soluble and potentially membrane-bound forms of SP1 proteins were present in the placenta. Northern blot analysis using specific probes confirmed the expression of multiple mRNA species in human term placenta.
