In order to analyse the cruciferin gene family in radish a cDNA library was screened either with heterologous rapeseed probes or by differential screening and sequencing. We could identify six partial cDNA clones belonging to two different groups of cruciferin genes which do not cross-hybridize, and probably three distinct subfamilies. One of these classes corresponds to the previously described cruciferin from rapeseed and Arabidopsis. A gene corresponding to the second group, as well as its border sequences, was isolated from a radish genomic library and analysed in more detail. The cruciferin gene (cruRS) contains three introns and encodes a 479 amino acid protein. The transcription initiation site was determined. The expression of the different group of genes was studied by northern blot analysis: genes of both classes are expressed simultaneously and roughly at the same level between 25 and 35 days after flowering. Cruciferin gene copy number was estimated by Southern blot analysis. There appear to be seven or eight genes in one class and three in the other, located at different loci.
