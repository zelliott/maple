Thirty VH-containing cosmid clones, isolated from rabbit germ-line DNA libraries, were restriction mapped and shown to contain approximately 100 VH genes in 765-kb of DNA. Twenty-two of the cosmid clones were grouped into seven distinct clusters. The VH genes were separated by an average of 8 kb, although some were separated by less than 3 kb. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of two of these VH genes with the sequences of another 11 VH genes showed that they were all generally more than 80% homologous suggesting that rabbit VH genes are members of one highly homologous gene family. Most rabbit Ig molecules have the VH allotypic specificities a1, a2, or a3 and are designated VHa-positive. A small number (less than 30%) of Ig molecules lack these VHa allotypic specificities and are designated VHa-negative. The VH containing cosmid clones were hybridized with synthetic oligomer probes designed to be specific for genes encoding VHa-positive or VHa-negative molecules. At least 50% of the germ-line VH genes hybridized with the VHa-negative oligomer and thus presumably encode VHa-negative molecules; as few as 15% of the genes could be identified as encoding VHa-positive molecules based on hybridization with the VHa-positive oligomer. Approximately 35% of the VH genes did not hybridize with either oligomer and could not be classified as VHa-negative or VHa-positive. We propose that the predominance of serum VHa-positive molecules, in contrast to the predominance of VHa-negative encoding germ-line genes, may reflect preferential usage of a few germline VH genes. The implications of this idea toward explaining the allelic inheritance of VHa allotypes are discussed.
