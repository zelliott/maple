To demonstrate the correlation of rdxA gene mutation and metronidazole (MTZ) resistance of H.pylori isolates in the local area.

Clinical strains of H.pylori were isolated from gastric biopsy of patients. Resistance to metronidazole of the isolates was determined by using diffusion test and two  fold dilution test. Genome DNAs of the isolates were prepared for PCR to detect rdxA gene. The target amplification products were sequenced after T-A cloning. The sequences were compared with the reported sequences from Hp26695 and 134 other strains of H.pylori.

MTZ resistance rate was 76.1% in 21 clinical isolates. The target fragment 886 bp in length containing rdxA gene could be successfully amplified. In comparison with the reported corresponding sequence of H.pylori stain 26695, homologies of the nucleotide sequences from the amplification products were 90.1% approximate, equals 95.1%. Mutations caused by base insertion/deletion and substitution in the MTZ resistance isolates were found. Among these mutations, two types of insertion mutations have not been reported in literatures. No same mutations were present in the MTZ sensitive isolates.

The rdxA gene mutation may play an important role in MTZ resistance of H.pylori.
