pp120/HA4 is a hepatocyte membrane glycoprotein phosphorylated by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. In this study, we have investigated the role of pp120/HA4 in insulin action. Transfection of antisense pp120/HA4 cDNA in H35 hepatoma cells resulted in inhibition of pp120/HA4 expression and was associated with a 2-3-fold decrease in the rate of insulin internalization. Furthermore, insulin internalization in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts co-transfected with insulin receptors and pp120/HA4 was increased 2-fold compared with cells expressing insulin receptors alone. In contrast, no effect on internalization was observed in cells overexpressing a naturally occurring splice variant of pp120/HA4 that lacks the phosphorylation sites in the intracellular domain. Insulin internalization was also unaffected in cells expressing three site-directed mutants of pp120/HA4 in which the sites of phosphorylation by the insulin receptor kinase had been removed (Y488F, Y488F/Y513F, and S503A). Our data suggest that pp120/HA4 is part of a complex of proteins required for receptor-mediated internalization of insulin. It is possible that this function is regulated by insulin-induced phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of pp120/HA4.
