The hedgehog signaling pathway is indispensable in embryogenesis, being responsible for the development of a wide array of vertebrate organs. Given its importance in embryogenesis, the precise regulation of hedgehog signaling is crucial. Aberrant activation of this pathway in postnatal life has been associated with a number of tumor types, reinforcing the role of developmental signaling pathways in tumorigenesis. The small GTPase Rab23 acts as a negative regulator of the hedgehog signaling pathway, most notably in the vertebrate neural system. By analogy with studies of other Rab proteins, analysis of the localization of wild-type and constitutively active and inactive forms of Rab23 provides the potential to shed light on the role of Rab23 at the cellular level. We previously produced expression constructs encoding these proteins for analysis in mammalian cell cultures at both the light and the electron microscopy level. This revealed that both wild-type and active Rab23 localizes to the plasma membrane and to endocytic vesicles (T. M. Evans et al. [2003] Traffic4, 869-884). We describe the methods used to design and make the Rab23 expression constructs, and to assess their localization relative to key hedgehog pathways and endocytic markers in both transiently and stably transfected cell cultures.
