We have isolated a cDNA clone encoding human enkephalinase (neutral endopeptidase, EC 3.4.24.11) in a lambda gt10 library from human placenta, and present the complete 742 amino acid sequence of human enkephalinase. The human enzyme displays a high homology with rat and rabbit enkephalinase. Like the rat and rabbit enzyme, human enkephalinase contains a single N-terminal transmembrane region and is likely to be inserted through cell membranes with the majority of protein, including its carboxy-terminus, located extracellularly.
