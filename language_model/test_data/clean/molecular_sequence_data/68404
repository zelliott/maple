Biochemical and immunological data suggest that a relatively limited number of polypeptide antigens of viable Onchocerca volvulus-infective larvae are available to be recognized by the host's immune system. A partial cDNA clone encoding one such antigen, designated lambda RAL-2, was isolated by screening an expression cDNA library with antisera raised against viable O. volvulus L3. The antigen encoded by this clone was subsequently found to be immunogenic in the majority of individuals exposed to O. volvulus. In the present study, the native antigen corresponding to lambda RAL-2 (Ov17) has been characterized. Immunolocalization and in situ hybridization techniques have been used to localize Ov17 in adult and larval stages of the parasite. In adult females, Ov17 was localized primarily in the hypodermis. Ov17 was accessible to surface labeling reagents in viable adult parasites. Full-length cDNA clones encoding Ov17 suggested that the nascent protein contains a putative leader sequence, which is almost immediately followed by a polyglutamine tract. Analysis of antibody reactivity to recombinant proteins containing and lacking the polyglutamine tract demonstrated that this structure was not a significant B cell epitope in individuals exposed to O. volvulus.
