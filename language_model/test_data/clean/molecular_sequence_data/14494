Debaryomyces hansenii is a halotolerant yeast species that has been shown to carry various nuclear genes of plasmid or viral origin (NUPAVs). However, a recent ancestor of such NUPAVs has not been identified. Here we determined for the first time the molecular structure of an entire cytoplasmic linear plasmid, pDH1A, indigenous to this species. The element is related to non-autonomous killer plasmids from Kluyveromyces lactis and Pichia acaciae and carries a B-type DNA polymerase as well as remnants of a killer toxin system, a secreted chitin-binding protein. Other essential toxin subunits or an immunity function, however, appear to be lost, while two additional small open reading frames are present. Transcripts for all four genes located on pDH1A could be verified by RT-PCR. Interestingly, all genes from pDH1A could be identified as ancestors of NUPAVs located at different chromosomes within the nucleus of D. hansenii, suggesting repeated nuclear capture of fragments originating from pDH1A.
