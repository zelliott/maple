Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder caused by mutations of the LDL-receptor gene. In the present study, we investigated four Japanese FH homozygotes and identified five point mutations: a splice site mutation in intron 12 (the 1845 + 2 T-->C mutation), a missense mutation in exon 7 (the C317S mutation), a nonsense mutation in exon 17 (the K790X mutation), a missense mutation in exon 14 (the P664L mutation), and a missense mutation in exon 4 (the E119K mutation). We developed simple methods for detecting these mutations. When we examined the presence of these mutations in 24 unrelated FH homozygotes, the 1845 + 2 T-->C mutation was found in 7 of them, and the other four mutations were unique for each proband. We also screened 120 unrelated FH heterozygotes for these mutations and found that the frequencies of the 1845 + 2 T-->C, C317S, K790X, P664L, and E119K mutations were 13.3% (16/120), 6.7% (8/120), 6.7% (8/120), 3.3% (4/120), and 1.7% (2/120), respectively. These mutations were found in more than 30% of unrelated Japanese FH patients. By using the detection methods developed in this study, the diagnosis of more than 30% of the genetic bases of Japanese FH heterozygotes is expected.
