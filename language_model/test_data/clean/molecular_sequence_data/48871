A Gram-reaction-negative, non-spore-forming, gliding, non-translucent, colourless or yellow, aerobic and elevated-colony-forming strain, designated E403(T), was isolated from the Bashi Channel and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Strain E403(T) could grow in the presence of 0.3-8 % (w/v) NaCl, at 16-43 °C and at pH 6-9, and grew optimally at 28 °C, pH 8, in natural seawater medium. The respiratory quinones were MK-6 and MK-7. The major fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0, iso-C17 : 0 3-OH, iso-C15 : 1 G, summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω7c/C16 : 1ω6c), iso-C15 : 0 3-OH and C16 : 0. The DNA G+C content of strain E403(T) was 37.9 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences of members of the family Flavobacteriaceae showed that strain E403(T) formed a distinct evolutionary lineage within the stable cluster containing type strains Zhouia amylolytica HN-171(T) (92.2 % similarity) and Joostella marina En5(T) (92.4 % similarity). In addition to the large 16S rRNA gene sequence differences, E403(T) can also be distinguished from the reference type strains J. marina En5(T) and Sinomicrobium oceani SCSIO 03483(T) by several phenotypic characteristics and chemotaxonomic properties. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic properties, strain E403(T) is suggested to represent a novel species of a new genus in the family Flavobacteriaceae, for which the name Pustulibacterium marinum gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is E403(T) (= CCTCC AB2012862(T) = CGMCC 1.12333(T) = KCTC 32192(T)).
