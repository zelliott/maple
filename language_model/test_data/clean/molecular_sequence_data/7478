Fas was recently demonstrated to be the major target molecule engaged by CD4+ cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). We examined Fas expression on various cloned T cell subpopulations and their susceptibility to lysis by CD4+ or CD8+ CTL. A reciprocal relationship in Fas and Fas-ligand expression was observed in CD4+ T helper (Th)1- and Th2-type clones, and Fas mRNA was predominantly detected in Th2 clones, whereas Fas-ligand mRNA was principally found in Th1 clones. The two Th0 clones tested expressed both Fas and Fas-ligand, but only one exhibited cytolytic activity, whereas both were sensitive to CD4-mediated lysis. A functional consequence of the inverse Fas-Fas-ligand expression pattern was that Th2 and Th0 cells were sensitive to lysis by both Th1 CD4+ CTL and a CD8+ CTL clone in a Fas-dependent manner. These results suggest that cytolytic CD4+ Th1 cells may play an immunomodulatory role, regulating a Th2/Th0 response by Fas-mediated lysis.
