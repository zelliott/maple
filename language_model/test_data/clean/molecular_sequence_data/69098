The expression of LeY antigen (Fuc alpha 1-->2Gal beta 1-->4 [Fuc alpha-->3] GlcNAc beta 1-->R), recognized by the monoclonal antibody BM-1, was studied in peripheral blood T-lymphocyte subpopulations in patients with viral hepatitis, and in liver tissue of patients with acute viral hepatitis. The relationship between the expression of LeY antigen on peripheral blood T-lymphocytes and the effects of interferon (IFN) therapy for chronic hepatitis type C were also evaluated. LeY antigen is not markedly expressed in B or T-lymphocytes of healthy individuals. However, it was strongly expressed in CD8 and CD4 T-lymphocytes in patients with viral hepatitis. In the acute phase of acute viral hepatitis, the expression of LeY antigen was more markedly expressed on peripheral CD8 T-lymphocytes than on CD4 T-lymphocytes. In chronic hepatitis type B and type C, it was significantly expressed more often on CD4 T-lymphocytes. In the liver tissues of patients with acute viral hepatitis, LeY antigen was expressed on hepatocytes and infiltrating lymphocytes. IFN therapy for chronic active hepatitis type C proved most effective when LeY antigen was more markedly expressed on the patient's CD4 and CD8 peripheral blood T-lymphocytes before treatment. Further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between the mechanisms of hepatic cell injury and LeY antigen.
