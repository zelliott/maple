The botulinal neurotoxins (BoNT) associate with non-toxic proteins (ANTP) by non-covalent bonds to form large complexes. In C. botulinum C, the BoNT/C1 locus consists of six genes which are organized in three clusters. Cluster 1 encompasses the genes of BoNT/C1 and ANTP/139 which could be involved in the resistance of the BoNT/C1 to the acidic pH and protease degradation. The second cluster consists of three genes which encode hemagglutinin components. The last gene encodes a DNA binding protein (Orf22) which might regulate the BoNT/C1 complex gene expression. BoNT and tetanus toxin (TeTx) display similar structure and mechanism of action at the molecular level. Their identity at the amino acid level range from 34 to 96.8%, indicating that the clostridial neurotoxin genes probably derive from a common ancestor. The fact that Clostridium other than C. botulinum such as C. butyricum and C. baratii can produce a BoNT suggests that the BoNT genes can be transferred between Clostridium strains. The toxigenic C. butyricum strains seem to derive from originally non-toxic strains by neurotoxin gene transfer from C. botulinum E, probably including a mobile DNA element. In C. botulinum C and D the gene encoding the exoenzyme C3 has been localized in a transposon-like element of 21.5 kbp. Transposons could be involved in BoNT gene transfer in C. botulinum.
