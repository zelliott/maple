Mutation of the XPB gene in humans gives rise to the distinct, autosomal recessive disorder, with a striking clinical heterogeneity: xeroderma pigmentosum associated with Cockayne's syndrome and trichothiodystrophy. XPB is a subunit of a multifunctional RNA polymerase II general initiation factor TFIIH and codes for 3'-->5' DNA helicase essential for both nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription. Since XPB defective human disease is extremely rare, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutant cell lines belonging to the 3rd rodent complementation group (the hamster ERCC3 gene is the homologue of the human XPB gene) are a unique resource for analyzing structure-function relationships in the ERCC3/XPB protein. We have amplified, cloned and sequenced the ERCC3 genes from wild type and 27-1, UV24 and MMC-2 CHO mutant cell lines and identified the sites of the respective mutations. 27-1 mutant has an A1075G transition (K359E) located at the very beginning of the Ia helicase domain which causes deficiency in open complex formation and in 3', 5' and dual incisions during NER. UV24 cell line has two mutations. First, it is a T1144C transition (S382P) located behind the Ia helicase domain in a region responsible for ERCC3 binding to XPG, p62 and p44. Second mutation is identical with a mutation in MMC-2 mutant. It is a C2215T transition (Q739STOP) causing the truncation of the C-terminus of the protein, responsible for the 5' incision, by 44 amino acids. All mutant cell lines are unable to recover RNA synthesis after 10Jm(-2) UV, suggesting a defect in transcription-coupled repair. Their limited global NER capacity measured by a single-cell gel electrophoresis assay (0.25Jm(-2)) varies from 6% to 11%.
