Using human alpha glycophorin cDNA probe and six restriction enzymes, we examined the homologues of human glycophorin genes in genomic DNA of 11 unrelated chimpanzees. We show that, in contrast to the human, the chimpanzee exhibits an unusual array of nonrandomly distributed restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP). No clear correlation was found between the RFLP and the V-A-B-D blood-group phenotypes of the subjects, with one possible exception. However, pairs of allelic RFLP occurring at a relatively high frequency were identified. In addition, the homology of chimpanzee glycophorin genes to the human genes was examined using as probes synthetic oligonucleotides specifying distinct regions of human glycophorin genes. We show that the glycophorin gene family in the chimpanzee consists of at least three members that are homologous to the human alpha, delta, and E genes (glycophorins A, B, and E) and may share a similar gross structure and overall organization.
