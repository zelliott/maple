Human brain cDNA libraries were screened with cDNA inserts corresponding to the mRNA for the Na+,K(+)-ATPase alpha-subunit from pig kidney. The results obtained demonstrate the existence of two highly homologous mRNAs encoding the alpha- and alpha III-isoforms of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase catalytic subunit.
