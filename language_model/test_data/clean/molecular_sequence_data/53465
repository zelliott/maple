Eukaryotic chromosome segregation depends on the mitotic spindle apparatus, a bipolar array of microtubules nucleated from centrosomes. Centrosomal microtubule nucleation requires attachment of gamma-tubulin ring complexes to a salt-insoluble centrosomal core, but the factor(s) underlying this attachment remains unknown. In budding yeast, this attachment is provided by the coiled-coil protein Spc110p, which links the yeast gamma-tubulin complex to the core of the yeast centrosome. Here, we show that the large coiled-coil protein kendrin is a human orthologue of Spc110p. We identified kendrin by its C-terminal calmodulin-binding site, which shares homology with the Spc110p calmodulin-binding site. Kendrin localizes specifically to centrosomes throughout the cell cycle. N-terminal regions of kendrin share significant sequence homology with pericentrin, a previously identified murine centrosome component known to interact with gamma-tubulin. In mitotic human breast carcinoma cells containing abundant centrosome-like structures, kendrin is found only at centrosomes associated with spindle microtubules.
