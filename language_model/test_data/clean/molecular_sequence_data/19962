Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in Huntingtin, which provokes aggregation of a proteolytic amino-terminal fragment of the affected protein encompassing the polyQ expansion. Accumulation of mutant Huntingtin somehow triggers cellular dysfunction and leads to a progressive degeneration of striatal neurons. Despite considerable efforts, the function of Huntingtin as well as the precise molecular mechanisms by which the expanded polyQ elicits cellular dysfunction remain unclear. In addition, no treatment is available to prevent, cure, or even slow down the progression of this devastating disorder. Antibodies are valuable tools to understand protein function and disease mechanisms. Here, we have identified the epitope recognized by the mAb 2B4, a broadly used antibody generated against the amino-terminal region of Huntingtin, which detects both aggregated and soluble Huntingtin. The 2B4 antibody specifically recognizes amino acids 50-64 of human Huntingtin but not the murine homologous region. Furthermore, the 2B4 epitope resides within the proline-rich region of Huntingtin, which is critical for polyQ aggregation and toxicity. These properties suggest that the 2B4 antibody might be useful in antibody-based therapeutic strategies.
