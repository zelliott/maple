Using DNA heteroduplex tracking assays, we characterized human immunodeficiency virus type 1 env V4/V5 genetic populations in multiple blood plasma samples collected over an average of 7 months from 24 chronically infected human subjects. We observed complex and dynamic V4/V5 genetic populations in most subjects. Comparisons of V4/V5 and V1/V2 population changes over the course of the study showed that major shifts in genetic populations frequently occurred in one region but not the other, and these observations were independently confirmed in one subject by single-genome sequencing. These results suggest that the V1/V2 and V4/V5 regions of env often evolve independently during chronic infection.
