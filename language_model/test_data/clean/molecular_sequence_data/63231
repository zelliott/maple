Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a bacterial pathogen that can persist for decades in an infected patient without causing a disease. In vivo, the tubercle bacillus present in the lungs store triacylglycerols in inclusion bodies. The same process can be observed in vitro when the bacteria infect adipose tissues. Indeed, before entering in the dormant state, bacteria accumulate lipids originating from the host cell membrane degradation and from de novo synthesis. During the reactivation phase, these lipids are hydrolysed and the infection process occurs. The degradation of both extra and intracellular lipids can be directly related to the presence of lipolytic enzymes in mycobacteria, which have been ignored during a long period particularly due to the difficulties to obtain a high expression level of these enzymes in M. tuberculosis. The completion of the M. tuberculosis genome offered new opportunity to this kind of study. The aim of this review is to focus on the recent results obtained in the field of mycobacterium lipolytic enzymes and although no experimental proof has been shown in vivo, it is tempting to speculate that these enzymes could be involved in the virulence and pathogenicity processes.
