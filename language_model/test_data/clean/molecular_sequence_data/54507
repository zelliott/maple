Pinewood nematode (PWN) is the causal agent of the pine wilt disease. Previous studies have suggested that secretions from the esophageal glands of PWN play an important role in pathogenicity. A cluster of three venom allergen-like protein genes and one pseudogene, Bx-vap-1, Bx-vap-2, Bx-vap-3 and Bx-vap-P, were identified within a 3.7-kb region. Additionally, three putative modification, transport and regulatory protein genes were also detected in the same flanking region of the Bx-vap gene cluster. Genes vap-1, -2 and -3 are functional and encode three major allelic variants of PWN venom allergen-like proteins. But Bx-vap-P is an untranscribed pseudogene. Genes vap-1, -2 and -3 produce predicted products of 204, 206 and 203 amino acid residues, respectively, including the putative signal peptide sequence at the amino termini. In situ mRNA hybridization analysis showed that the transcripts of genes vap-1, -2 and -3 accumulated exclusively within the esophageal gland cells of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus.
