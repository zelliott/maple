To investigate the interactions between chromosomal DNA and nuclear matrices in higher plants, matrix associated regions (MARs) of rice (Oryza sativa L.) DNAs were cloned. First, we prepared nuclear matrices from isolated nuclei by digesting them with EcoRI and then extracting with 2 M NaCl. About 6% of the total DNA remained in the nuclear matrices after this digestion and extraction. The residual DNA fragments in the nuclear matrices were cloned. Some of the cloned DNA fragments showed binding to certain nuclear proteins. One of the MAR fragments contained sequences related to known consensus motifs and a hairpin loop structure. A method is presented for isolation of matrix associated region (MAR) DNAs from plant cells.
