A cDNA encoding pyruvate kinase from Schizosaccharomyces pombe has been isolated from a lambda ZAPII library. This cDNA was sequenced and found to contain an open reading frame of 1524 nucleotides, giving a predicted protein subunit M, of 55470. The sequence shows a high degree of identity with other pyruvate kinase sequences, with residues implicated in the binding of substrate and metal ion co-factors conserved. However, there are significant differences in the putative subunit interface and effector binding regions which may account for the unusual quaternary structure and regulatory properties of the S. pombe enzyme.
