We have isolated six distinct dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) class I sequences. An additional functional nonclassical class I gene, DLA-79, was characterized previously. This brings the number of isolated canine class I sequences to seven. These seven loci account for nearly all class I sequences detected in genomic DNA by Southern blotting. With approximately seven members, the class I gene family in dog is considerably less complex than in either human or mouse. Three of the six sequences described in this article contain complete class I genes. These genes have the typical arrangement of exons and introns, and their predicted protein sequences have the features expected of expressed class I molecules. Two sequences contain truncated genes. These genes, having only partial class I homology and disruptive mutations, are clearly nonfunctional. The remaining locus contains a full-length processed gene which is unique among characterized class I loci. Sequence comparisons were performed to examine evolutionary relationships among the family members. Two sequences, DLA-64 (complete) and -53 (truncated), appear to be chimeras presumably formed by interlocus recombination. Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, mRNA originating from each of the three complete genes was identified in canine peripheral blood leukocytes. DLA-79 specific transcripts were identified previously. Thus, each of the four complete canine class I genes is transcribed in vivo.
