A MADS family gene, OsMADS6, was isolated from a rice (Oryza sativa L.) young flower cDNA library using OsAMDS1 as a probe. With this clone, various MADS box genes that encode for protein-to-protein interaction partners of the OsMADS6 protein were isolated by the yeast two-hybrid screening method. On the basis of sequence homology, OsMADS6 and the selected partners can be classified in the APETALA1/AGAMOUS-LIKE9 (AP1/AGL9) family. One of the interaction partners, OsMADS14, was selected for further study. Both genes began expression at early stages of flower development, and their expression was extended into the later stages. In mature flowers the OsMADS6 transcript was detectable in lodicules and also weakly in sterile lemmas and carpels, whereas the OsMADS14 transcript was detectable in sterile lemmas, paleas/lemmas, stamens, and carpels. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we demonstrated that the region containing of the 109th to 137th amino acid residues of OsMADS6 is indispensable in the interaction with OsMADS14. Site-directed mutation analysis revealed that the four periodical leucine residues within the region are essential for this interaction. Furthermore, it was shown that the 14 amino acid residues located immediately downstream of the K domain enhance the interaction, and that the two leucine residues within this region play an important role in that enhancement.
