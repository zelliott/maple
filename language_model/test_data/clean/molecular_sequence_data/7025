To test the influence of cytosine methylation on homologous recombination and the rejoining of DNA double strand breaks in mammalian cells, we developed a sensitive and quantitative assay system using extrachromosomal substrates. First, methylation was introduced into substrates in vitro with the prokaryotic SssI methylase, which specifically methylates the C-5 position of cytosine bases within CpG dinucleotides, mimicking the mammalian DNA methyltransferase. Next, methylated substrates were incubated in mammalian cells for a sufficient length of time to recombine or rejoin prior to substrate recovery. Results from bacterial transformation of the substrates and from direct Southern analysis demonstrate that cytosine methylation has no detectable effect on either DNA end-joining or homologous recombination. Thus, the components of the protein machinery involved in these complex processes are unaffected by the major DNA modification in mammalian cells. These results leave open the possibility that methylation may modulate the accessibility of these components to chromosomal DNA by altering local chromatin structure.
