For the first time, here we announce the complete genome sequence of a field isolate of Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) derived from macerated rectal tissue of a free living bharal (Pseudois nayaur) that displayed clinical disease consistent with severe infection with PPRV. Further, we compare the full genome of this isolate, termed PPRV Tibet/Bharal/2008, with previously available PPRV genomes, including those of virus isolates from domestic small ruminants local to the area where the reported isolate was collected. The current sequence is phylogenetically classified as a lineage IV virus, sharing high levels of sequence identity with previously described Tibetan PPRV isolates. Indeed, across the entire genome, only 26 nucleotide differences (0.16% nucleotide variation) and, consequently, 9 amino acid changes were present compared to sequences of locally derived viruses.
