The effects of either substance P (SP) or a metabolically stable SP analogue, [pGlu5,Me-Phe8,Sar9]SP(5-11), alone or in combination with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on blood pressure (BP) and extravasation of serum albumin were examined in normal and diabetic rats. CGRP (12 ng/kg) modified neither BP nor vascular permeability in control and diabetic rats. Both SP and its analogue (74 ng/kg) produced hypotension, and increased plasma extravasation in the respiratory tissues, urinary bladder and skin. The simultaneous injection of CGRP and SP resulted in modest potentiation of the vascular permeability actions of SP in control and diabetic rats. However, extravasation induced by [pGlu5,Me-Phe8,Sar9]SP(5-11) was potentiated by CGRP in control animals, but not in diabetic rats. Defective neurogenic inflammatory responses in diabetic rats may result from decreased responses in the effector tissues of diabetic rats to the neuropeptides released from sensory nerves.
