Overexpression of the HER-2 (neu, erbB-2) receptor results in cellular transformation and is associated with a variety of human cancers. Multiple mechanisms, including gene amplification and transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational controls contribute to the regulation of HER-2 expression. One of the components of these regulatory mechanisms is a short upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the HER-2 mRNA that represses downstream translation in a variety of cell types. Here we explore the mechanism by which this uORF exerts its inhibitory effect. As judged by comparisons of protein and mRNA abundance and by polysomal distribution analyses, the uORF represses translation of the HER-2 cistron or of a heterologous reporter gene. Despite its conservation among mammalian species, the peptide sequence of the uORF is not required for this inhibitory effect. Rather, the majority of ribosomes that load on the HER-2 mRNA most likely translate the uORF and are then unable to reinitiate at the downstream AUG codon, in part due to the short intercistronic spacing. A minority of ribosomes gain access to the HER-2 initiation codon either by leaky scanning past the upstream AUG codon or by reinitiating after having translated the uORF despite the short intercistronic region. These results suggest that the HER-2 uORF controls synthesis of this oncoprotein by limiting ribosomal access to downstream initiation sites.
