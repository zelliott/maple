Repair of the ubiquitous mutagenic lesion 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is initiated in eukaryotes by DNA glycosylases/lyases, such as yeast Ogg1, that do not share significant sequence identity with their prokaryotic counterparts, typified by Escherichia coli MutM (Fpg) protein. The unexpected presence of a functional mutM orthologue in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has brought into question the existence of functional OGG1 orthologues in plants. We report here the cDNA cloning, expression and functional characterization of AtOGG1, an Arabidopsis thaliana gene widely expressed in different plant tissues which encodes a 40.3 kDa protein with significant sequence identity to yeast and human Ogg1 proteins. Purified AtOgg1 enzyme specifically cleaves duplex DNA containing an 8-OxoG:C mispair, and the repair reaction proceeds through an imine intermediate
