Various methods have been developed recently for predicting antigenic determinants in a protein by analyzing its hydropathicity, flexibility or secondary structure. The predicted results by these methods were compared directly to the observed structure of the proteins to determine how accurate they were. Regression and correlation of the predicted hydropathicity versus the observed solvent accessibility and the predicted chain flexibility versus actual mobility were determined. Three separate methods of hydropathic analysis had correlation coefficients of 0.52, 0.63 and 0.57 respectively, while a published method for chain flexibility analysis had a 0.19 correlation coefficient. Similarly, agreement between the observed and the predicted secondary structures by two methods was also determined. The limitations of these techniques were clearly defined.
