Strain CN83T, a Gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterium, was isolated from sediment of the East China Sea. The isolate was catalase- and oxidase-positive and cells were motile by means of polar flagella. The DNA G+C content was 44.9 mol%. The major fatty acids were C16:1omega7c and/or iso-C15:0 2-OH, C16:0, C18:1omega7c, C14:0 and C12:0. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain CN83T belonged to the genus Vibrio and had the highest sequence similarity to Vibrio agarivorans (98.4%) and Vibrio campbellii (97.8%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that strain CN83T formed a monophyletic clade adjacent to the type strain of V. agarivorans. The DNA-DNA hybridization values of strain CN83T with V. agarivorans DSM 13756T and V. campbellii DSM 19270T were 44.6 and 25.5%, respectively. On the basis of the phenotypic and genotypic data, strain CN83T represents a novel species of the genus Vibrio, for which the name Vibrio hangzhouensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CN83T (=CGMCC 1.7062T=JCM 15146T).
