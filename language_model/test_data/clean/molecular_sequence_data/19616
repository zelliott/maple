An endonuclease from Xanthomonas oryzae pathovar oryzae KACC 10331, XorII, was recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli using a T7 system. XorII was purified using a combination of ion exchange and immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). An optimized washing protocol was carried out on an IMAC in order to obtain a high purity product. The final amount of purified XorII was approximately 2.5 mg/L of LB medium. The purified recombinant XorII was functional and showed the same cleavage pattern as PvuI. The enzyme activity tested the highest at 25 degrees in 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol at a pH of 7.9.
