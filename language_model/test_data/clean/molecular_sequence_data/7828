The distribution of two common DNA polymorphisms (5' untranslated exon 1 and intron 5-DdeI) of the antithrombin III (ATIII) gene was studied in three ethnic groups in Singapore: 251 Chinese, 221 Dravidian Indians and 102 Malays. The polymorphisms were identified by the polymerase chain reaction and size fractionation in agarose gels. The 5' untranslated to exon 1 polymorphism is a length polymorphism while the intron 5 polymorphism is a restriction site (DdeI) polymorphism. The frequency of the short fragment (S) of the 5' to exon 1 length polymorphism of the ATIII gene was found to be 0.37 in the Chinese, 0.54 in the Malays and 0.65 in the Dravidian Indians. For the Chinese, this was significantly lower compared to the Caucasians and Indians (p < 0.0001) and the Malays (p < 0.01). On the other hand, the frequencies of DdeI+ did not vary significantly among these three populations (p > 0.05). The distribution of different genotypes at these two loci of the ATIII gene was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in all three ethnic groups. A strong linkage disequilibrium between these two polymorphisms was observed in all the ethnic groups and the estimated correlation coefficient (delta) was 0.42 in the Chinese (p < 0.001), 0.61 in the Dravidian Indians (p < 0.001) and 0.43 in the Malays (p < 0.001). The frequencies of haplotype S+, L+ and L- were, respectively, 0.37, 0.40 and 0.23 in the Chinese, 0.65, 0.18 and 0.16 in the Dravidian Indians and 0.54, 0.37 and 0.09 in the Malays.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
