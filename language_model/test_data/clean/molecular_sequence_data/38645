Highly structured and double-stranded (ds) RNAs are adaptable and potent biochemical entities. They interact with dsRNA-binding proteins (RBPs), the great majority of which contain a sequence called the dsRNA-binding motif (dsRBM). This approximately 70-amino-acid sequence motif forms a tertiary structure that interacts with dsRNA, with partially duplexed RNA and, in some cases, with RNA-DNA hybrids, generally without obvious RNA sequence specificity. At least nine families of functionally diverse proteins contain one or more dsRBMs. The motif also participates in complex formation through protein-protein interactions.
