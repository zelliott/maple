The role of a tRNA-like structure within the 5'-flanking sequence of a human tRNA(Glu) gene in the modulation of its transcription in vitro by HeLa cell extracts has been investigated using several deletion mutants of a recombinant of the gene which lacked part or all of the tRNA-like structure. The transcriptional efficiency of four mutants was the same as that of the wild-type recombinant, two mutants had decreased transcriptional efficiency, one was more efficient, and one, lacking part of the 5' intragenic control region, was inactive. Correlation of the transcriptional efficiencies with the position and the size of the 5'-flanking sequence that was deleted indicated that the tRNA-like structure may be deleted without loss of transcriptional efficiency. Current models for the modulation of tRNA gene transcription by the 5'-flanking sequence are assessed in the light of the results obtained, and a potential model is presented.
