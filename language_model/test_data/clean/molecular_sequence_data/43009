Chymotrypsinogen is a principal precursor of pancreatic proteolytic enzymes. We previously isolated a cDNA clone for human prechymotrypsinogen from a human pancreatic cDNA library. In the present study, we used this cDNA sequences to isolate genomic DNA clones. Three overlapping cosmid clones spanning approximately 65-kb genomic sequences were isolated from a human cosmid library. The genomic DNA clones were characterized by restriction enzyme mapping and by hybridizing them to subfragments of the cDNA. The sequence tagged sites for human chymotrypsinogen gene were created by designing two oligonucleotides. Furthermore, the isolated genomic clones were confirmed to be localized on chromosome 16q23 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and G-banding analysis.
