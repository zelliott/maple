The addition of a N7-methyl guanosine cap to the 5' end of nascent mRNA is carried out by the mRNA-capping enzyme, a two-domain protein that is a member of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily. The mRNA-capping enzyme is composed of a catalytic nucleotidyltransferase domain and a noncatalytic oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) domain. Large-scale domain motion triggered by substrate binding mediates catalytically requisite conformational rearrangement of the GTP substrate prior to the chemical step. In this study, we employ targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) on the PBCV-1 capping enzyme to probe the global domain dynamics and internal dynamics of conserved residues during the conformational transformation from the open to the closed state. Analysis of the resulting trajectories along with structural and sequence homology to other members of the superfamily allows us to suggest a conserved mechanism of conformational rearrangements spanning all mRNA-capping enzymes and all ATP-dependent DNA ligases. Our results suggest that the OB domain moves quasi-statically toward the nucleotidyltransferase domain, pivoting about a short linker region. The approach of the OB domain brings a conserved RxDK sequence, an element of conserved motif VI, within proximity of the triphosphate of GTP, destabilizing the unreactive conformation and thereby allowing thermal fluctuations to partition the substrate toward the catalytically competent state.
