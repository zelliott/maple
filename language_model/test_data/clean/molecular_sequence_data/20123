Signaling initiated by Class Ia phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3Ks) is essential for cell proliferation and survival. We discovered a novel protein we call PI3K interacting protein 1 (PIK3IP1) that shares homology with the p85 regulatory PI3K subunit. Using a variety of in vitro and cell based assays, we demonstrate that PIK3IP1 directly binds to the p110 catalytic subunit and down modulates PI3K activity. Our studies suggest that PIK3IP1 is a new type of PI3K regulator.
