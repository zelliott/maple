Viruses in the genus Bocavirus are associated with respiratory and enteric disease in dogs and cattle. In addition, novel porcine bocaviruses (PBoVs) have been identified in domestic and wild pigs in recent years, but are of unknown relevance to date. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence ra tes and genetic diversity of PBoVs in pigs in the USA. Using newly established multiplex real-time PCR assays, 385 lung, lymph node, serum and faecal samples from pigs with various disease conditions were investigated. A high PBoV prevalence rate ranging from 21.3 to 50.8 % was identified in the investigated samples and often two or more PBoV species were detected in the same sample. Cloning and sequencing analysis of the partial non-structural protein NS1 and the capsid proteins VP1 and VP2 of DNA samples positive for PBoV groups 1 (n = 6), 2 (n = 16) and 3 (n = 42), including subgroups 3A, 3B or 3C, revealed a high genetic diversity especially for the PBoV G3 VP2 gene, whereas the PBoV group 1 VP1 gene displayed a low nucleotide polymorphism. Using primer walking, 18 partial or nearly complete genomes of PBoVs were obtained and six of the 18 nearly complete genomes represented novel PBoV species. Recombination analysis using partial NS1, VP1 and VP2 genes and the nearly complete genomes indicated possible recombination events within and between PBoVs. Further studies will be required to reveal the possible pathogenic role of these diverse PBoVs.
