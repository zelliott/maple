An intrasanguineous host-mediated assay was used to determine the mutational specificity of the hepatocarinogen N-nitroso-N,N-dimethylamine metabolized in vivo. A total of 114 forward mutations in the lacl gene of Escherichia coli reisolated from the livers of treated Swiss albino mice were characterized at the DNA sequence level. Consistent with the methylating ability of this compound and the demonstrated mutagenic specificity of O6-methylguanine, the predominant mutation was the G:C----A:T transition. These were recovered, on average, seven times more frequently at guanines flanked (5') by a purine residue than at those preceded by a pyrimidine residue--a specificity similar to that reported for many direct-acting SN1 alkylating agents. This nitrosamine appears to be distinguished from related N-nitroso methylating compounds by the induction of additional mutational events. Here, the exceptions consisted of four A:T----G:C transitions, four A:T site transversions, and a single G:C----T:A transversion. In addition, the DNA sequence alterations of 34 I- mutants of E. coli reisolated from otherwise untreated mice were identified. The predominant mutation was the G:C----A:T transition, which accounted for almost half of all background mutations. The sites at which these mutations were recovered appear to indicate that some of these mutations may have arisen as a result of an accelerated rate of cytosine deamination. These data suggest that many of the additional "spontaneous" mutations observed under in vivo conditions resulted from genotoxic events occurring during the host-defense (immune) reaction.
