Amino acid sequences deduced from rat complementary DNA clones encoding the insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) receptor closely resemble those of the bovine cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (Man-6-P receptorCI), suggesting they are identical structures. It is also shown that IGF-II receptors are adsorbed by immobilized pentamannosyl-6-phosphate and are specifically eluted with Man-6-P. Furthermore, Man-6-P specifically increases by about two times the apparent affinity of the purified rat placental receptor for 125I-labeled IGF-II. These results indicate that the type II IGF receptor contains cooperative, high-affinity binding sites for both IGF-II and Man-6-P-containing proteins.
