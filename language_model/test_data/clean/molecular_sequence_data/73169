We studied a 27 amino acid peptide (QEHA27) containing the G beta gamma binding motif QXXER, found in adenylyl cyclase 2 and several effector proteins of the G beta gamma-subunit. The patch-clamp technique was utilized to record Ca2+ current from serotonergic dorsal raphe neurons and to introduce the peptide QEHA27 into the cell. We investigated whether it antagonized the inhibitory modulation of Ca2+ current. Compared to the control group, 5-HT was 41% less effective at inhibiting Ca2+ current with 500 microM QEHA27 in the pipette. The QEHA27 peptide did not simply occlude the response to 5-HT because there was no stimulating effect of QEHA27 on the G-protein mediated response. This appears to be the first report of an interference between this peptide and the modulation of Ca2+ currents; it suggests that at least part of the action of the G-protein may be mediated by a beta gamma -subunit.
