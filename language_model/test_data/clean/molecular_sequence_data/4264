The publication of the Haemophilus influenzae genome sequence in 1995 was a landmark in microbiological research. It has changed our understanding of the prokaryotic world, and will influence the approach and focus of research on microorganisms over the next few years. In this article we outline what has been learned from this and other genome sequencing projects, and discuss some of the potential avenues of investigation that will follow in the 'post-genome era'.
