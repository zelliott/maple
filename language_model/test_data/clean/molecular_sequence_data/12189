T4 endonuclease V is a DNA repair enzyme from bacteriophage T4 that catalyzes the first reaction step of the pyrimidine dimer-specific base excision repair pathway. The crystal structure of this enzyme complexed with a duplex DNA substrate, containing a thymine dimer, has been determined at 2.75 A resolution. The atomic structure of the complex reveals the unique conformation of the DNA duplex, which exhibits a sharp kink with a 60 degree inclination at the central thymine dimer. The adenine base complementary to the 5' side of the thymine dimer is completely flipped out of the DNA duplex and trapped in a cavity on the protein surface. These structural features allow an understanding of the catalytic mechanism and implicate a general mechanism of how other repair enzymes recognize damaged DNA duplexes.
