Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were used in polymerase chain reaction assays to detect tetracycline resistance genes, Tet M and Tet O. Each of 44 clinical isolates and eight laboratory strains, representing 20 different species carrying either Tet M or Tet O determinants, gave appropriate PCR products with the two primer sets. The PCR products hybridized with radiolabelled Tet M or Tet O probes. The PCR assay was then used to evaluate vaginal swab specimens from women with vaginitis and semen specimens from men with prostatis. Seven of eight vaginal samples and five of eight semen samples exhibited PCR products that hybridized with the radiolabelled probes, suggesting the presence of Tet M and/or Tet O genes. PCR-based detection of Tet M and/or Tet O genes holds promise for evaluation of urogenital specimens.
