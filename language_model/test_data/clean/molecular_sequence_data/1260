MHC loci encode highly polymorphic molecules involved in the presentation of self and non-self peptides to cells of the adaptive and innate immune systems. Although variable, MHC-E genes are well conserved among primates and provide signals to natural killer cells. In this study, we sequenced and analyzed MHC-E alleles of pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina), a nonhuman primate used for HIV pathogenesis and vaccine studies. Among a group of seven macaques, the characterization of eight Mane-E alleles revealed an increased number of polymorphic sites compared with human HLA-E alleles. Phylogenetic analyses of MHC-E alleles from pig-tailed macaque, rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) and cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) demonstrated that the three macaque species shared six families of macaque MHC-E alleles and indicated that these families existed in the common ancestor 5.5 million years ago. Polymorphic Mane-E sites were not concentrated within the peptide-binding pockets, but were distributed throughout the entire ORF. The peptide-binding domain of Mane-E is similar to its human analogue, and peptide substrates theoretically capable of binding to Mane-E molecules were found in the leader sequence of classical Mane-A and -B molecules. Additionally, the polymorphic amino acids located in the alpha(1) and alpha(2) domains of Mane-E molecules have side chains expected to be oriented toward solvent and away from the peptide-binding groove, suggesting that some of them (positions 19, 73, 79 and 145) might be available for interaction with polymorphic receptors of natural killer cells.
