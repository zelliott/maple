In order to detect human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in invasive cervical cancers, three different polymerase chain reactions to amplify different subgenomic fragments of HPV DNA were carried out on DNA extracted from 93 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. This study detected HPV DNA in 54 cases (58.1%), which broke down to HPV 16 in 39 (41.9%) cases, HPV 18 in six (6.4%), HPV 52 in three, HPV 33 in one and unclassified HPV type in the remainder. Histopathologically, squamous cell carcinomas frequently contained HPV 16, whereas, HPV 18 was present in adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma of the cervix. Clinicopathological study revealed that HPV 16 and 18 DNA found were more frequently than other HPV subtypes in premenopausal patients. Moreover, HPV 18 DNA-positive cancers had a relatively high recurrence rate. These results indicate that cervical cancers might be clinically influenced by the difference in subtypes of the infecting HPV.
