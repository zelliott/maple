The two minor dsRNA bands, previously detected in symptomatic leaves of Raphanus sativus-root cv. Yidianhong [corrected] were subjected to further analysis. cDNA cloning and sequencing revealed that the smaller of the two dsRNA bands is actually a doublet consisting of two co-migrating dsRNA segments and the resulting three segments were designated as RasR 3, RasR 4, and RasR 5. RasR 3 was 1717 bp in length and potentially encoded a protein of about 55.3 kDa, containing all of the six conserved motifs shared by the RNA dependent RNA polymerases of members of the family Partitiviridae. RasR 4 and RasR 5, which co-migrated in the 5% polyacrylamide gel, were 1521 and 1485 bp in length and each encoded a putative protein of unknown function. Their molecular masses, as calculated from the deduced amino acid, were 38.2 and 38.8 kDa, respectively. The 5' UTRs of all three segments shared regions of high sequence similarities, but were distinct from those of the RasR 1 and RasR 2. Taken together, these results along with those described in the previous report, suggest that more than one partitivirus was co-infecting radish leaves.
