A new species, Thozetella pinicola, was isolated from leaf litter of Pinus elliottii Engelm. in Hong Kong. This taxon is described and compared with existing species in the genus. It occurs on the substrate as creamy white sporodochia and has short black conidiophores. Morphological characters are typical of Thozetella and it most closely resembles Thozetella falcata, Thozetella gigantea and Thozetella nivea, but may be distinguished by its distinct microawns and different conidial size. To gain further taxonomic insight into the phylogenetic relationships of our new taxon and its allies, we sequenced and analysed 6 different regions of 3 genes (ribosomal DNA and protein coding genes: RNA polymerase II largest subunit (RBP2) and b-tubulin). Resulting phylogenies are compared with existing morphological information. Molecular data support the relationship between Thozetella species and the Chaetosphaeriaceae (Chaetosphaeriales, Sordariomycetes). In addition, we recovered a new phylogenetic lineage (or group) within the existing phylogenetic framework of Thozetella as previously proposed. In particular, there is a close association between T. pinicola and T. nivea, which is strongly supported. The affinities of these 2 newly sequenced taxa are discussed in light of morphological and molecular characters.
