The blood of the adult blackbird contains one major hemoglobin component (HbA = alpha A2, beta 2, ca. 80%) and one minor one (HbD = alpha D2 beta 2, ca. 20%). The Hb-components were separated by FPLC on a TSK SP-5 PW column, and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient, while the globin chains were purified on a cation exchange (CM-Cellulose). Tryptic peptides from the globin chains were separated by HPLC on an RP-2 Lichrosorb column. The complete amino acid sequence was determined by automatic Edman degradation, using film and gas phase methods. For the alpha A-, alpha D- and beta-chains, peptide alignment was carried out relative to the corresponding chains of the greylag goose (Anser anser). The close phylogenetic relationship between blackbird, tree sparrow and starling is verified by the hemoglobin sequence. The O2-affinities of the major and minor hemoglobin components of the blackbird are not yet known. Thus, the results were interpreted on the basis of primary structure. Substitutions of possible structural significance were examined with the help of molecular graphics/modelling.
