Tail-anchored (TA) proteins provide an ideal model for studying post-translational integration at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotes. There are multiple pathways for delivering TA proteins from the cytosol to the ER membrane yet, whereas an ATP-dependent route predominates, none of the cytosolic components involved had been identified. In this study we have directly addressed this issue and identify novel interactions between a model TA protein and the two cytosolic chaperones Hsp40 and Hsc70. To investigate their function, we have reconstituted the membrane integration of TA proteins using purified components. Remarkably, we find that a combination of Hsc70 and Hsp40 can completely substitute for the ATP-dependent factors present in cytosol. On the basis of this in vitro analysis, we conclude that this chaperone pair can efficiently facilitate the ATP-dependent integration of TA proteins.
