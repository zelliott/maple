The structures of 14-residue head-to-tail cyclic gramicidin S peptides have been investigated to develop the structural rationale for their antimicrobial and hemolytic profiles. The basis for these studies is GS14 (cyclo(VKLKVdYPLKVKLdYP)), designed as an extension of the naturally occurring antimicrobial peptide. The structure of GS14 has been determined using NMR methods and was found to exist in a highly amphipathic antiparallel beta-sheet conformation. Systematic enantiomeric substitutions within the framework of the GS14 peptide were found to decrease the amphipathicity of this molecule. These results indicated that there was a direct correlation between the high amphipathic character and potent hemolytic activity in the diastereomers, whereas an inverse correlation existed between amphipathicity and antimicrobial function. To define the structural consequences of changing the amphipathic nature of GS14 analogs to maximize antimicrobial activity and to minimize hemolysis, NMR structures were determined in water and the membrane-mimetic solvent trifluoroethanol. The structures show that these attributes are the result of induction of the beta-sheet character in a membrane environment and the positioning of charged side chains on the hydrophobic face of the cyclic framework, thus decreasing the amphipathicity and directed hydrophobicity of these molecules. Implications for the design of more effective antimicrobials are discussed.
