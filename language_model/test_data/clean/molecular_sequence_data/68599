The possible functions of two recently described flagellar genes, fliU and fliV, have been examined. Introduction of gene fliC, encoding the bacterial flagellin protein, into a number of flagellin-deficient Salmonella and Escherichia coli strains failed to complement the mutations in these strains, and the FliC flagellin was accumulated in the bacterial cytoplasm. Complementation with fliU and fliV, which map downstream of fliC, restored motility to some of the mutants which became flagellated. After inactivation of either fliU or fliV, such complementation no longer occurred and the flagellin protein accumulated in the cytoplasm, which suggested that both genes are required for the secretion of flagellin and expression of motility. Expression of these genes from high copy number plasmids resulted in the synthesis of exceptionally long flagella and in detection of the FliV protein on polyacrylamide gels.
