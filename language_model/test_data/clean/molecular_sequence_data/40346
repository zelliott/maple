A novel halophilic, filamentous actinobacterium, designated TRM 40136(T), was isolated from a hypersaline habitat in Xinjiang Province, north-west China. The strain is aerobic, Gram-positive, halophilic, and the optimum NaCl concentration for growth is 10-15% (w/v). The whole-cell sugar pattern consists of xylose, glucose and arabinose. The predominant menaquinone is MK-6 (51.2%) and the major fatty acids are anteiso-C15:0 (35.2%), anteiso-C17:0 (15.9%) and iso-C15:0 (13.7%). The phospholipid pattern consists of phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine and two unknown phospholipids. The G + C content of the genomic DNA is 68.9 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis showed that strain TRM 40136(T) had 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 96.1% with the closest described species Actinopolyspora mortivallis, and it can be distinguished from all species in the genus Actinopolyspora by using these data of polyphasic taxonomy study. On the basis of the polyphasic evidence, the strain TRM 40136(T) should be designated as a novel species of the genus Actinopolyspora for which the name Actinopolyspora xinjiangensis sp.nov. is proposed. The type strain is TRM 40136(T) (=CCTCC AA 209080(T) = KCTC 19656(T)).
