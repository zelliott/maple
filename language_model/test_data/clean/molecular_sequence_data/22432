PTHrP is an oncofetal protein with distinct proliferative and antiapoptotic roles that are affected by nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The protein's nuclear export is sensitive to leptomycin B, consistent with a chromosome region maintenance protein 1-dependent pathway. We determined that the 109-139 region of PTHrP was involved in its nuclear export by demonstrating that a C-terminal truncation mutant, residues 1-108, exports at a reduced rate, compared with the wild-type 139 amino acid isoform. We searched for potential nuclear export sequences within the 109-139 region, which is leucine rich. Comparisons with established nuclear export sequences identified a putative consensus signal at residues 126-136. Deletion of this region resulted in nuclear export characteristics that closely matched those of the C-terminal truncation mutant. Confocal microscopic analyses of transfected 293, COS-1, and HeLa cells showed that steady-state nuclear levels of the truncated and deletion mutants were significantly greater than levels of wild-type PTHrP and were unaffected by leptomycin B, unlike the wild-type protein. In addition, both mutants demonstrated greatly reduced nuclear export with assays using nuclear preparations and intact cells. Based on these results, we conclude that the 126-136 amino acid sequence closely approximates the structure of a chromosome region maintenance protein 1-dependent leucine-rich nuclear export signal and is critical for nuclear export of PTHrP.
