The ubiquitous human transcription factor Ini1 has been shown to interact with HIV-1 integrase (IN) and to stimulate in vitro the reactions catalyzed by this enzyme. We have previously used a yeast model to study the effect of HIV-1 IN expression (Caumont, A.B., Jamieson, G.A., Pichuantes, S., Nguyen, A.T., Litvak, S., Dupont, C. -H., 1996. Expression of functional HIV-1 integrase in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae leads to the emergence of a lethal phenotype: potential use for inhibitor screening. Curr. Genet. 29, 503-510). Here, we describe the effect of the inactivation of the gene encoding for SNF5, a yeast transcription factor homologous to Ini1, on the lethality induced by the expression of HIV-1 IN in yeast. We observed that the retroviral IN was unable to perform its lethal activity in cells where the SNF5 gene has been disrupted, suggesting that SNF5 may play a role in the lethal effect induced by IN in yeast. SNF5 inactivation affects neither yeast viability nor expression of HIV-1 IN. Given the homology between SNF5 and its human counterpart Ini1, our results suggest that this factor may be important for IN activity in infected cells. Moreover, given the important role proposed for this transcription factor in the integration step and the fact that it is dispensable for cell viability, the interaction between Ini1/ySNF5 and HIV-1 IN should become a potential target in the search for new antiretroviral agents.
