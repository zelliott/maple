The single actin gene from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans has been isolated and characterized. The only other organism reported to contain just one actin gene is another Ascomycete, the budding yeast Saccharomyces. The nucleotide sequence of the A. nidulans actin gene predicts a polypeptide containing the N-terminal sequence identifying the gamma-actin isotype. Until now this characteristic N terminus has only been reported to occur in vertebrate actin sequences. A monospecific anti-gamma-actin antiserum recognizes a single 42-kDa band in immunoblots of total Aspergillus protein. None of the six introns in the A. nidulans actin gene sequence aligns precisely with those found in other actin genes. One, unlike other known actin introns, is located in the 3'-untranslated region of the gene. The 5' and 3' ends of the gene have been characterized. The Aspergillus actin gene has a heterogeneous transcript size due to the presence of several different 3' termini. Of four characterized polyadenylated transcripts, only the longest contains a typical AATAAA polyadenylation signal near its 3' terminus. Using an integrative plasmid containing Aspergillus actin sequences and the pyr4 gene from Neurospora, the A. nidulans actin gene has been mapped to the first chromosome.
