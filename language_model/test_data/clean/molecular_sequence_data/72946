Twenty-six strains of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis for assessing the sequence divergence of rpoD gene encoding the primary sigma factor. Four and five RFLP patterns were observed from two fragments of rpoD gene. Sequence analysis of a subgenic fragment covering region 1 through 4 from 13 strains of Borrelia burgdorferi s. 1. revealed that 21 of 450 deduced amino acid residues were diverged. These results indicate that the sequence heterogeneity of rpoD is present in different strains of Borrelia burgdorferi s. 1., and agreed well with the current classification of genospecies.
