Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is essential for the physiologic maintenance of mineral homeostasis. PTH regulates the mineral transport in bone and kidney and through its secondary actions on mineral transport in intestine (mediated by 1.25 (OH)2D). Calcitonin, in many ways, acts as a physiologic antagonist to PTH. Recently the techniques of molecular biology have been applied to the study of these hormones and more precise mechanism of action of these hormones has been elucidated. Last year both PTH receptor and calcitonin receptor were cloned. This review briefly summarizes new informations about their biosynthesis, secretion, metabolism, action, and structures of their receptors.
