Mutations in the Drosophila gene Kr√ºppel (Kr) cause deletions of segments in the embryo and also affect Malpighian tubule development. In the hypomorphic Kr alleles that were analyzed, the defects in the segment pattern and the Malpighian tubules are parallel in strength. We have sequenced the DNA of four Kr alleles that show normal spatial and temporal patterns of Kr-encoded protein expression. Three of the four alleles have single base pair mutations that result in a single amino acid change. The exchanges occur in the putative DNA-binding domain of the Kr protein, which is characterized by four repeats of the zinc finger motif. Sequence comparison of the finger motifs helped to define the structural requirements for the folding of the finger domain to some extent. Our data on the Kr mutants support the view that has emerged from the evolutionary analysis.
