We report here a likely case of Diphyllobothrium nihonkaiense contracted in France through the consumption of a Pacific salmon imported from Canada. The species diagnosis was made by molecular analysis of two mitochondrial genes (COI & ND3). This case is rather unusual in that D. nihonkaiense has never been reported along the Pacific coast of North America.
