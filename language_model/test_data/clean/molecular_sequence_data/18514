The detection of low-abundant microorganism is difficult when in a sample in which a specific microorganism represents an overwhelming majority using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. A modified CO-amplification at Lower Denaturation temperature PCR (mCOLD-PCR) method was developed to detect low-abundant microorganisms using a double-strand RNA probe to inhibit the amplification of the sequence of a major microorganism. Combining the mCOLD-PCR and downstream application (e.g., denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and next-generation sequencing (NGS)), low-abundant microorganisms were detected more efficiently, even when a specific microorganism represents an overwhelming majority of the sample. We demonstrated that mCOLD-PCR-DGGE enabled us to detect Schizosaccharomyces pombe in a model sample coexisting with 10,000 times as many Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When mCOLD-PCR-DGGE was applied in the microbiota analysis of a fermenting white wine, Candida sp. and Cladosporium sp., which were not detected by conventional PCR, were detected. According to the NGS analysis after mCOLD-PCR of a fermenting red wine, the detection ratio of Saccharomyces was decreased dramatically, and the detection ratios of other microorganisms and the numbers of genera detected were increased compared with the conventional PCR. Thus, the application of mCOLD-PCR will reveal comprehensive microbiota of fermented foods, beverages, and so on.
