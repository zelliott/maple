We report the three-dimensional structure of YggX from Salmonella enterica, determined by solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy from protein labeled with carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 produced by Escherichia coli cells. The protein has a beta1beta2alpha1alpha2alpha3 fold that is unique to YggX and one of its homologs, a protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa with 45% sequence identity whose X-ray structure [Protein Data Bank (PDB) 1T07] was determined by a structural genomics center. The NMR structure, which revealed that the C-terminal region of YggX is dynamically disordered, explains why electron density from the corresponding region was missing in the X-ray structure of the Pseudomonas protein. Because it has been hypothesized that YggX has a role in iron trafficking, we investigated the influence of Fe(II) on the (1)H-(15)N NMR fingerprint region of nitrogen-15-labeled YggX. Several signals shifted or broadened upon the addition of excess Fe(II) under anoxic conditions, with His81 showing the largest effect. These results indicate that Fe(II) binds weakly to this protein at a region of the sequence conserved only in the subset of the YggX proteins from organisms similar to Salmonella. The finding that iron binds only weakly to YggX, and not to a highly conserved region of the structure, suggests that the role of this protein in iron homeostasis is more complex than previously thought.
