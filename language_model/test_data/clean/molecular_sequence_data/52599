Hepatitis delta virus (HDV), a single-stranded RNA virus, bears a single coding region whose product, the hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), is expressed in two isoforms, small (S-HDAg) and large (L-HDAg). S-HDAg is required for replication of HDV, while L-HDAg inhibits viral replication and is required for the envelopment of the HDV genomic RNA by hepatitis B virus proteins. Here we have examined the spatial distribution of HDV RNA and proteins in infected nuclei, with particular reference to specific nuclear domains. We found that L-HDAg was aggregated in specific nuclear domains and that over half of these domains were localized beside nuclear domain 10 (ND10). At later times, ND10-associated proteins like PML were found in larger HDAg complexes that had developed into apparently hollow spheres. In these larger complexes, PML was found chiefly in the rims of the spheres, while the known ND10 components Sp100, Daxx, and NDP55 were found in the centers of the spheres. Thus, ND10 proteins that normally are closely linked separate within HDAg-associated complexes. Viral RNA of antigenomic polarity, whether expressed from genomic RNA or directly from introduced plasmids, colocalizes with L-HDAg and the transcriptional repressor PML. In contrast, HDV genomic RNA was distributed more uniformly throughout the nucleus. These results suggest that different host protein complexes may assemble on viral RNA strands of different polarities, and they also suggest that this RNA virus, like DNA viruses, can alter the distribution of ND10-associated proteins. The fact that viral components specifically linked to repression of replication can associate with one of the ND10-associated proteins (PML) raises the possibility that this host protein may play a role in the regulation of HDV RNA synthesis.
