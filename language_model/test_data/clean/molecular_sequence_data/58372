Although glutamatergic receptors are localized throughout the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), the specific cellular localization of the various glutamatergic receptor subtypes throughout human brain remains largely unknown. PCR fragments to human GluR1, GluR2, and GluR3 receptor subtypes were cloned and used as probes for in situ hybridization in order to examine the anatomical and cellular localization of glutamate receptor subtype gene expression in dissected regions of human postmortem brain tissue. Although hybridization was observed throughout the CNS, results indicated that the highest levels of hybridization were in the hippocampus, with localization primarily to cells in the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1-CA3 region, and the granular cells of the dentate gyrus. Prominent hybridization also was observed in the medium to large neurons of the cingulate cortex, temporal lobe, septum, and amygdala, as well as in scattered neurons in the thalamus, cerebral cortex, and medulla. A striking pattern of differential hybridization was observed within the cerebellum. GluR1 demonstrated light hybridization along the Purkinje/Bergmann glia layer, with GluR2 and GluR3 demonstrating hybridization to Purkinje cells, and GluR3 also to cells within the molecular layer, previously identified as stellate-basket cells. Changes in glutamate receptor function have been shown to be important in the pathogenesis of a number of neurological disorders. Therefore, an examination of glutamatergic receptor expression in human postmortem brain tissue may provide important information on the molecular basis of a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders of the CNS.
