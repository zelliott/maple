T cell recognition of foreign antigens is a result of a ternary complex between T cell receptor, nominal peptide and major histocompatibility complex molecule. It has been proposed that the nominal peptide, which is presented by accessory cells to T cells, has a characteristic structure which can be predicted on the basis of physicochemical criteria. To further study this aspect, we stimulated T cells from normal human blood donors with synthetic peptides (each of approximately 15 amino acids in length) from the heat shock protein 65 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-M. bovis. We found that while the characterization of certain epitopes follows commonly used predictions, other epitopes cannot be predicted by known methods.
