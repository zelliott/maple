Twenty strains of P2/Sabin-related polioviruses isolated in Brazil were analyzed; ten from persistent paralytic poliomyelitis cases, three from suspected polio cases with transient paralysis, and seven from healthy contacts. The serotypes of the viral isolates were identified by the neutralization test with hyperimmune equine sera. The relationship of the isolates to the P2/Sabin strain was demonstrated by molecular hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Partial sequencing demonstrated mutations at nucleotide 481 in the 5' noncoding region and at amino acid 143 of the capsid protein VP1 in most of these isolates from vaccine-associated cases in Brazil. These data support previous studies on the importance of mutations at these attenuated determinants in the establishment of the disease. However, the existence of isolates without mutations at these positions suggests that they are not essential. The results also strengthen the possibility of the participation of a mutation at nucleotide 398 in the establishment of the disease, and suggest that a mutation at nucleotide 491 or 500 may also be involved in this process. The isolates from healthy contacts presented the same mutations as the isolates from vaccine-associated cases with which they were in contact. This strengthens the observation that, although mutations in the genome of the P2/Sabin strain are important for the establishment of the disease, host factors are also involved.
