Abnormal brain serotonin function may be characteristic of several neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, it is important to identify polymorphic genes and screen for functional variants at loci coding for genes that control normal serotonin functions. 5-HT1D beta is a terminal serotonin autoreceptor which may play a role in regulating serotonin synthesis and release. Using an SSCP technique we screened for 5-HT1D beta coding sequence variants in psychiatrically interviewed populations, which included controls, alcoholics, and alcoholic arsonists and alcoholic violent offenders with low CSF concentrations of the main serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA. A common polymorphism was identified in the 5-HT1D beta gene with allele frequencies of 0.72 and 0.28. The SSCP variant was caused by a silent G to C substitution at nucleotide 861 of the coding region. This polymorphism could also be detected as a HincII RFLP of amplified DNA. DNAs from informative CEPH families were typed for the HincII RFLP and analyzed with respect to 20 linked markers on chromosome 6. Multipoint analysis placed the 5-HT1D beta receptor gene between markers D6S286 and D6S275. A maximum two-point lod score of 10.90 was obtained to D6S26, which had been previously localized on 6q14-15. Chromosomal aberrations involving this region have been previously shown to cause retinal anomalies, developmental delay, and abnormal brain development. This region also contains the gene for North Carolina-type macular dystrophy.
