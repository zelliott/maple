We present here the first report of a group of alpha-1,4-glucan lyases (EC 4.2.2.13) and their genes. The lyases produce 1, 5-anhydro-D-fructose from starch and related oligomers and polymers. The enzymes were isolated from the red alga Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis from the Pacific coasts of China and USA, and the Atlantic Coast of Venezuela. Three lyase isozymes (GLq1, GLq2 and GLq3) from the Chinese subspecies, two lyase isozymes (GLs1 and GLs2) from the USA subspecies and one lyase (GLa1) from the Venezuelan subspecies were identified and investigated. GLq1, GLq3, GLs1 and GLa1 were purified and partially sequenced. Based on the amino acid sequences obtained, three lyase genes or their cDNAs (GLq1, GLq2 and GLs1) were cloned and completely sequenced and two other genes (GLq3 and GLs2) were partially sequenced. The coding sequences of the lyase genes GLq1, GLq2 and GLs1 are 3267, 3276 and 3279 bp, encoding lyases of 1088, 1091 and 1092 amino acids, respectively. The deduced molecular masses of the mature lyases from the coding sequences are 117030, 117667 and 117790 Da, respectively, close to those determined by mass spectrometry using purified lyases. The amino acid sequence identity is more than 70% among the six algal lyase isozymes. The algal GLq1 gene was expressed in Pichia pastoris and Aspergillus niger, and the expression product was identical to the wild-type enzyme.
