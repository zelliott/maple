A panel of T-cell clones was generated that was specific for amino acid residues 4-13 of the mycobacterial 65-kd stress protein. All the clones were found to express a member of the V beta 5 family, as defined by PCR. However, the clones could be differentiated on the basis of different staining characteristics with the mAb 42/1C1. This antibody is known to recognize both V beta 5.2 and V beta 5.3, as was the PCR primer pair used in the analysis. Sequencing of the TCRs revealed that those clones which were not stained by 42/1C1 expressed a previously unidentified member of the V beta 5 family. By comparing the sequences of the V beta 5 family members that are recognized by 42/1C1 with those that are not, we were able to identify a probable epitope for the antibody. It is also clear from our data that the TCRs of T cells recognizing identical MHC-peptide combinations, although very similar, may be differentiated by mAbs, thereby posing potential problems in any proposed disease therapy involving treatment with monoclonals.
