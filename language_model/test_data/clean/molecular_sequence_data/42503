The pathogenic, Gram-negative bacteria, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae, secrete immunoglobulin A1 proteases into their extracellular surroundings. An extraordinary feature in the secretory pathway of these putative virulence factors is a self-directed outer membrane transport step allowing the proteins to be secreted autonomously, even from foreign Gram-negative host cells like Escherichia coli. Here we summarize recent achievements in the understanding of IgA protease outer membrane translocation.
