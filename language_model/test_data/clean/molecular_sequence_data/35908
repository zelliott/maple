The murine ribosomal protein (rp) L32 gene contains essential promoter sequences located both upstream and downstream of the cap site. A combination of gel mobility shift, UV cross-linking, and cell-free transcription assays were used to analyze the interaction of factors binding to a downstream element (located at position +25 to +37). The rpL32 downstream element identified polypeptides (transcription factors) ranging in size from 45 to 25 kilodaltons (kDa). Four base pair changes in the wild-type sequence of the downstream element eliminated binding. An oligonucleotide containing the glucocorticoid responsive element sequence competed specifically for the 45-kDa protein in both the gel mobility shift assay and in the UV cross-linking studies. Our data also indicate that the downstream binding factors contribute to cell-free transcription of the rpL32 gene.
