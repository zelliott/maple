The therapeutic principles in the management of endocrine gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) tumours include surgical extirpation of the primary tumour in the absence of metastases and medical control of symptoms in the preoperative phase. In the presence of metastases only palliative procedures are available. Tumour growth might be controlled by surgical procedures as debulking of tumour masses, medically by chemotherapy and more recently by new developments as a long-acting somatostatin analogue (SMS 201-995) and alpha-interferon. Their efficacy is currently evaluated in prospective studies. In contrast to inhibition of growth symptoms derived from excessive hormone production by GEP tumours can be well controlled. SMS 201-995 effectively prevents or at least improves flush and diarrhoea in the carcinoid syndrome, disabling diarrhoea in the Verner-Morrison syndrome and migratory erythema in the glucagonoma syndrome. SMS acts by inhibition of hormone release from the tumour and by a direct mechanism at the site of the target cell via SMS receptors present on tumour and target cells. For control of acid hypersecretion in gastrinoma patients omeprazole is superior to all former and present alternatives and replaced total gastrectomy completely. A similarly effective drug to prevent hypoglycaemia due to uncontrolled insulin release from insulinomas is not available since neither SMS nor diazoxide are effective in every insulinoma patient.
