In humans, the 30,000 M(r) Rhesus (Rh) polypeptide D (RhD) is a dominant antigen (Ag) of the Rh blood group system. To date, an Rh-like protein has been found in chimpanzees, gorillas, gibbons, and rhesus monkeys. Related to the 30,000 M(r) Rh Ag protein are two polypeptides of 50,000 M(r), the human 50,000 M(r) Rh Ag and the RhD-like protein from Caenorhabditis elegans. The function of all these proteins is not sufficiently known. Here we characterize a cDNA clone (GCRH) encoding a putative 57,000 M(r) polypeptide from the marine sponge Geodia cydonium, which shares sequence similarity both to the RhD Ag and the Rh50 glycoprotein. The sponge Rh-like protein comprises 523 aa residues; hydropathy analysis hints at the presence of ten transmembrane domains. An N-terminal hydrophobic cleavage signal sequence is missing, suggesting that the first membrane-spanning domain of the sponge Rh-like protein acts as a signal-anchor sequence. The sponge Rh-like protein, like the human Rh50, lacks the CLP motif which is characteristic of the 30,000 M(r) RhD. In addition, the hydropathy profile of the sponge Rh-like protein is of a similar size and shape as that of human Rh50. This data indicates that the RhD and its structurally related Rh50 glycoprotein, which are highly immunogenic in humans, share a common ancestral molecule with the G. cydonium Rh-like protein.
