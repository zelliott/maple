We have utilized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to quantitate PCR-amplified DNA. This method was used to measure mRNA for the vitamin D-binding protein (Gc), beta-actin and the transferrin receptor (TR) gene in the Hep3B cell line. Total RNA from Hep3B cells was reverse transcribed to obtain cDNA, which was amplified in the presence of digoxigenin-dUTP by PCR. The PCR products were then hybridized in liquid phase to a biotinylated, nested capture probe for the respective sequences. The hybridized products were bound to a streptavidin-coated ELISA plate and were detected by an alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated antibody to digoxigenin. ELISA standard curves for Gc and control genes, beta-actin and TR, were obtained after PCR amplification of serial dilutions of Hep3B total RNA. As an external standard, an ELISA standard curve for Gc was obtained after PCR amplification of serial dilutions of a full-length Gc cDNA insert obtained from a recombinant plasmid. Thus, we were able to develop a non-isotopic quantitation assay for PCR-amplified DNA that is highly sensitive and has the specificity of hybridization-based methods.
