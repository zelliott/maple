Bacteriophage N4 minivirion RNA polymerase (mini-vRNAP), the RNA polymerase (RNAP) domain of vRNAP, is a member of the T7-like RNAP family. Mini-vRNAP recognizes promoters that comprise conserved sequences and a 3-base loop-5-base pair (bp) stem DNA hairpin structure on single-stranded templates. Here, we defined the DNA structural and sequence requirements for mini-vRNAP promoter recognition. Mini-vRNAP binds a 20-nucleotide (nt) N4 P2 promoter deoxyoligonucleotide with high affinity (K(d) = 2 nM) to form a salt-resistant complex. We show that mini-vRNAP interacts specifically with the central base of the hairpin loop (-11G) and a base at the stem (-8G) and that the guanine 6-keto and 7-imino groups at both positions are essential for binding and complex salt resistance. The major determinant (-11G), which must be presented to mini-vRNAP in the context of a hairpin loop, appears to interact with mini-vRNAP Trp-129. This interaction requires template single-strandedness at positions -2 and -1. Contacts with the promoter are disrupted when the RNA product becomes 11-12 nt long. This detailed description of vRNAP interaction with its promoter hairpin provides insights into RNAP-promoter interactions and explains how the injected vRNAP, which is present in one or two copies, recognizes its promoters on a single copy of the injected genome.
