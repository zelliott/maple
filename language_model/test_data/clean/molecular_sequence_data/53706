A proline 4-hydroxylase gene, which was cloned from Dactylosporangium sp. RH1, was overexpressed in Escherichia coli W1485 on a plasmid under a tryptophan tandem promoter after the codon usage of the 5' end of the gene was optimized. The proline 4-hydroxylase activity was l600-fold higher than that in Dactylosporangium sp. RH1. trans-4-Hydroxy-L-proline(Hyp) was produced and accumulated to 41 g/L (87% yield from L-proline) in 100 h when the recombinant E. coli was cultivated in a medium containing L-proline and glucose. 2-Oxoglutarate, which is necessary for the hydroxylation of L-proline by proline 4-hydroxylase, was apparently supplied from glucose through the cellular metabolic pathway. The putA mutant of W1485, which is not able to degrade L-proline, has allowed the quantitative conversion of L-proline to Hyp. The formation of other isomers of hydroxyproline was not observed. Productivity of Hyp was almost the same in a larger-scale culture. The method of manufacturing Hyp from L-proline was established.
