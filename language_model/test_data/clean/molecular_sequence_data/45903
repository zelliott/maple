Hymenoptera venoms each contain a variety of protein allergens. The major components have all been characterized, and most of the amino acid sequences are known. This article concentrates on the use of contemporary techniques including cloning, mass spectrometry and genomics in the characterization of venom allergens, and newer separation techniques for protein isolation. Examples of the use of these techniques with venom proteins are presented.
