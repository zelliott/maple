The Brucella BhuQ protein is a homolog of the Bradyrhizobium japonicum heme oxygenases HmuD and HmuQ. To determine if this protein plays a role in the ability of Brucella abortus 2308 to use heme as an iron source, an isogenic bhuQ mutant was constructed and its phenotype evaluated. Although the Brucella abortus bhuQ mutant DCO1 did not exhibit a defect in its capacity to use heme as an iron source or evidence of increased heme toxicity in vitro, this mutant produced increased levels of siderophore in response to iron deprivation compared to 2308. Introduction of a bhuQ mutation into the B. abortus dhbC mutant BHB2 (which cannot produce siderophores) resulted in a severe growth defect in the dhbC bhuQ double mutant JFO1 during cultivation under iron-restricted conditions, which could be rescued by the addition of FeCl(3), but not heme, to the growth medium. The bhuQ gene is cotranscribed with the gene encoding the iron-responsive regulator RirA, and both of these genes are repressed by the other major iron-responsive regulator in the alphaproteobacteria, Irr. The results of these studies suggest that B. abortus 2308 has at least one other heme oxygenase that works in concert with BhuQ to allow this strain to efficiently use heme as an iron source. The genetic organization of the rirA-bhuQ operon also provides the basis for the proposition that BhuQ may perform a previously unrecognized function by allowing the transcriptional regulator RirA to recognize heme as an iron source.
