We have previously identified TGSGP as a gene specific to the Trypanosoma brucei gambiense subspecies. TGSGP is a truncated VSG-like telomeric gene transcribed by RNA polymerase II. The TGSGP protein localizes to the flagellar pocket, and exhibits features compatible with a role as surface receptor. Here we show that TGSGP is physically linked to a truncation of a gene homologous to yeast AUT1 (APG3), a gene involved in internal vesicular formation. Further analysis indicated that T. b. gambiense is heterozygous for AUT1 (AUT1/aut1), with each allele located on independent chromosome II homologues. In 18 T. b. gambiense isolates from distinct geographical origins and different hosts, this genomic rearrangement was conserved. The size of the intergenic region between TGSGP and truncated aut1 varied among isolates but was similar in isolates of the same geographical area, and this observation may be used in epidemiology to trace the geographical origin of T. b. gambiense isolates.
