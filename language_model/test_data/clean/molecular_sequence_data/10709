While Honduras is home to only 15% of Central America's population, it has 60% of the region's AIDS cases.  There have been 4973 reported cases of full-blown AIDS in the country and the Health Ministry reports that more than 8000 Hondurans have been infected with HIV since the first Honduran case was diagnosed in 1985.  995 people with AIDS have since died.  The authors conducted an investigation to determine which HIV-1 subtype is present in Honduras and the degree of genetic variation among HIV-1 strains by analyzing viral nucleotide sequences from the envelope region of HIV-1 isolates obtained from the two most affected regions of the country.  They determined the predominant HIV-1 subtype among 27 HIV-1-infected patients attending sexually transmitted disease clinics in San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa by sequencing and analyzing the C2V3 regions of the envelope glycoprotein gp 120.  Genomic DNA was isolated from patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  Phylogenetic analysis determined that all 27 Honduran sequences clustered with known subtype B sequences.
