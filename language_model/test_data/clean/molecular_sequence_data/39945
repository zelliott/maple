Evidence suggests that amino terminal extensions of CCK-8 affect the carboxyl terminal bioactive region of CCK. Cat CCK-58 was purified by low pressure reverse phase and ion-exchange chromatography steps and several reverse phase HPLC steps. The purified peptide and its tryptic fragments were characterized by mass spectral analysis and microsequence analysis. The structure of cat CCK-58 is: AVQKVDGEPRAHLGALLARYIQQARKAPSGRMSVIKNLQSLDPSHRISDRDY(SO3) MGWMDF-amide. Cat and dog CCK-58 are identical except for position 40 which is serine in cat and asparagine in dog. Radioimmunoassay detected cat CCK-58 about 1/10th as well as dog CCK-58, indicating a marked effect on C-terminal immunoreactivity. Cat CCK-58 with a serine at position 40, the same residue found in pig, mouse, cow and rabbit CCK-58, can be used as a unique bioprobe for defining how amino terminal amino acids influence the structure and bioactivity of the carboxyl terminal region of CCK.
