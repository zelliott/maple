We show, using gel retardation, that crude Escherichia coli cell extracts contain a protein which binds specifically to DNA fragments carrying either end of the phage Mu genome. We have identified this protein as Fis, a factor involved in several site-specific recombinational switches. Furthermore, we show that induction of a Mucts62 prophage in a fis lysogen occurs at a lower temperature than that of a wild-type strain, and that spontaneous induction of Mucts62 is increased in the fis mutant. DNasel footprinting using either crude extracts or purified Fis indicate that binding on the left end of Mu occurs at a site which overlaps a weak transposase binding site. Thus, Fis may modulate Mu growth by influencing the binding of transposase, or other proteins, to the transposase binding site(s), in a way similar to its influence on Xis binding in phage lambda.
