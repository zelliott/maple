The complete primary structure of the largest mammalian neurofilament component, NF-H, is predicted from mouse cDNA and genomic clones, revealing a protein of molecular weight ca. 115,000. A central filament-forming domain structurally typical of all intermediate filament proteins is present, but anomalies are noted which may place constraints on the mechanism of NF-H assembly into filaments. The COOH-terminal portion of the protein is extremely long (661 amino acids) by comparison to non-neuronal intermediate filament components and has a remarkably monotonous, highly charged composition (Glu and Lys at 20% each). Its most remarkable feature is a tandem repeat of a 6 amino acid sequence containing the motif Lys-Ser-Pro that extends for more than half the length of the COOH-terminus. The Lys-Ser-Pro motif appears 48 times and since it is now known that the serine therein is a target for in vivo kinases, the massive axonal phosphorylation of NF-H is explained. Comparison of mouse and human NF-H reveals that otherwise conserved proteins have been subjected to evolutionary mutation within their multiphosphorylation repeat domains, although the Lys-Ser-Pro motif has been conserved.
