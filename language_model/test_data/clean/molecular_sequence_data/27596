A new approach to synthesis of oligoribonucleotides is suggested, based on transcription by E. coli RNA polymerase of synthetic immobilized DNA-templates with AUG as primer. The approach has been experimentally verified by synthesis of two oligonucleotides, viz., a RNA fragment of the fr phage (16 nucleotides long) and a RNA fragment of the tickborne encephalitis virus (18 nucleotides long). Fraction of the synthesized RNA fragments in the whole nucleotide material is about 20%. The templates can be used repeatedly. Sequences of the oligoribonucleotides were confirmed. Advantages of this approach and its usefulness for SP6 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase are discussed.
