Solvent conditions where human insulin could be studied by high-resolution NMR were determined. Both low pH and addition of acetonitrile were required to overcome the protein's self-association and to obtain useful spectra. Two hundred eighty-six 1H resonances were located and assigned to specific sites on the protein by using two-dimensional NMR methods. The presence and position of numerous dNN sequential NOE's indicate that the insulin conformation seen in crystallographic studies is largely retained under these solution conditions. Slowly exchanging protons were observed for seven backbone amide protons and were assigned to positions A15 and A16 and to positions B15-B19. These amides all occur within helical regions of the protein [Chawdhury, S.A., Dodson, E.J., Dodson, G.G., Reynolds, C.D., Tolley, S.P., Blundell, T.L., Cleasby, A., Pitts, J.E., Tickle, I.J., & Wood, S.P.
