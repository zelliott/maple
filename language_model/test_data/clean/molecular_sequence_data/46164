The Alpine lake whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) species complex is a classic example of a recent radiation, associated with colonization of the Alpine lakes following the glacial retreat (less than 15 kyr BP). They have formed a unique array of endemic lake flocks, each with one to six described sympatric species differing in morphology, diet and reproductive ecology. Here, we present a genomic investigation of the relationships between and within the lake flocks. Comparing the signal between over 1000 AFLP loci and mitochondrial control region sequence data, we use phylogenetic tree-based and population genetic methods to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of the group and to delineate the principal centres of genetic diversity within the radiation. We find significant cytonuclear discordance showing that the genomically monophyletic Alpine whitefish clade arose from a hybrid swarm of at least two glacial refugial lineages. Within this radiation, we find seven extant genetic clusters centred on seven lake systems. Most interestingly, we find evidence of sympatric speciation within and parallel evolution of equivalent phenotypes among these lake systems. However, we also find the genetic signature of human-mediated gene flow and diversity loss within many lakes, highlighting the fragility of recent radiations.
