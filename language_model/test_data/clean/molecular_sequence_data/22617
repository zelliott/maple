The plasmid ColE2-P9 origin is a 32-bp region which is specifically recognized by the plasmid-specified Rep protein to initiate DNA replication. We analyzed the structural and functional organization of the ColE2 origin by using various derivatives carrying deletions and single-base-pair substitutions. The origin may be divided into three subregions: subregion I, which is important for stable binding of the Rep protein; subregion II, which is important for binding of the Rep protein and for initiation of DNA replication; and subregion III, which is important for DNA replication but apparently not for binding of the Rep protein. The Rep protein might recognize three specific DNA elements in subregions I and II. The relative transformation frequency of the autonomously replicating plasmids carrying deletions in subregion I is lower, and nevertheless the copy numbers of these plasmids in host bacteria are higher than those of the wild-type plasmid. Efficient and stable binding of the Rep protein to the origin might be important for the replication efficiency to be at the normal (low) level. Subregion II might be essential for interaction with the catalytic domain of the Rep protein for primer RNA synthesis. The 8-bp sequence across the border of subregions II and III, including the primer sequence, is conserved in the (putative) origins of many plasmids, the putative Rep proteins of which are related to the ColE2-P9 Rep protein. Subregion III might be required for a step that is necessary after Rep protein binding has taken place.
