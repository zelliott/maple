Gonadotropins are made up of two glycoproteic subunits bound by non-covalent linkages. One subunit, named alpha, is common in all glycoprotein hormones; the second subunit, named beta, is specific for each hormone. This review present our recent results on dependence of activity on quaternary structures, on affinity and specificity of the binding of gonadotropins to their receptors and stimulation efficiency of gonadotropins.
