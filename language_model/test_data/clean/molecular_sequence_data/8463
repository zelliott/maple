The nucleotide sequence of a 29.425 kb fragment localized on the left arm of chromosome XV from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been determined. The sequence contains 13 open reading frames (ORFs) of which four encode the known genes ADH1, COQ3, MSH2 and RCF4. Predictions are made concerning the functions of the unknown ORFs. Some of the ORFs contain sequences similar to expressed sequence tags (EST) found in the database made available by TIGR. In particular, the highly expressed ADH1 gene is represented in this database by no less than 20 EST sequences. Two ARS sequences and a putative functional GCN4 motif have also been detected. One ORF (O0953) containing nine putative transmembrane segments is similar to a hypothetical membrane protein of Arabidopsis thaliana. Characteristic features of the other ORFs include ATP/GTP binding sites, a fungal Zn(2)-Cys(6) binuclear centre, an endoplasmic reticulum targeting sequence, a beta-transducin repeat signature and in two instances, good similarity to the prokaryotic lipoprotein signal peptide motif.
