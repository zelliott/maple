A novel red-pigmented, Gram-negative, motile, fluorescent, rod-shaped strain, DZ0503SBS1(T), with a single lateral flagellum, was isolated from the intestine of the nematode Heterorhabditidoides chongmingensis. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the strain is a member of the genus Serratia, sharing highest sequence similarities with Serratia marcescens subsp. sakuensis JCM 11315(T) (99.8 %), S. marcescens subsp. marcescens DSM 30121(T) (99.5 %) and Serratia ureilytica LMG 22860(T) (98.3 %). Similarities between the rpoB gene sequence of strain DZ0503SBS1(T) and those of S. marcescens subsp. sakuensis JCM 11315(T), S. marcescens subsp. marcescens DSM 30121(T) and S. ureilytica LMG 22860(T) were 98.0, 97.4 and 98.3 %, respectively. DNA-DNA hybridization values of strain DZ0503SBS1(T) with S. marcescens subsp. sakuensis JCM 11315(T), S. marcescens subsp. marcescens DSM 30121(T) and S. ureilytica LMG 22860(T) were 68.2, 65.1 and 53.0 %, respectively. The major isoprenoid quinone of strain DZ0503SBS1(T) was Q-8 and the predominant fatty acids were C(16 : 0) (34.76 %), cyclo-C(17 : 0) (20.03 %) and cyclo-C(19 : 0)omega8c (17.24 %). The cyclo-C(19 : 0)omega8c content (17.24 %) was significantly different from those found in S. marcescens subsp. sakuensis JCM 11315(T) and S. marcescens subsp. marcescens DSM 30121(T). Some characteristics of strain DZ0503SBS1(T), i.e. fluorescence and its symbiotic association with nematodes, have not been reported previously in any species of the genus Serratia. Phenotypic and biochemical characteristics and molecular data show that strain DZ0503SBS1(T) represents a novel species, for which the name Serratia nematodiphila sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is DZ0503SBS1(T) (=KCTC 22130(T) =CGMCC 1.6853(T)).
