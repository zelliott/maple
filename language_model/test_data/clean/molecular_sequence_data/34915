GluR0 from Nostoc punctiforme (NpGluR0) is a bacterial homologue of the ionotropic glutamate receptor. The ligand-binding core of NpGluR0 was crystallized at 294 K using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The L-glutamate-complexed crystal belongs to space group C222(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 78.0, b = 145.1, c = 132.1 A. The crystals contain three subunits in the asymmetric unit, with a VM value of 2.49 A3 Da(-1). The diffraction limit of the L-glutamate complex data set was 2.1 A using synchrotron X-ray radiation at beamline BL-4A of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (Pohang, Korea).
