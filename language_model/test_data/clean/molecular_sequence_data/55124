Activating mutations and overexpression of classical Ras subfamily members (K-Ras, N-Ras and H-Ras) have been widely investigated as key events in the development of human cancers. The role in cancer of its closest relatives, the Ras-related (RRas) subfamily members, has been less studied despite the fact that one of its members (TC21 or RRas2) is strongly transforming in vitro. Nevertheless, and in spite the paucity of publications, several studies have shown that wild type TC21 is overexpressed in different types of carcinomas and lymphomas. If the study of RRas members in cancer is still in its infancy, their role in physiological functions is even behind. For instance, T and B cell immunologists still use the vague term "Ras activation" without indication of what Ras family molecule is indeed intervening. In this view, we discuss the participation of TC21 in the specific process of T cell antigen receptor internalization from the immunological synapse and acquisition of membrane fragments from the antigen presenting cells by phagocytosis.
