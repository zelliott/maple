Decreased immune reactivity of isoforms of major allergens has been reported. However, such claims have always been based on experiments with recombinant proteins. This work describes the molecular and physicochemical characterization of a hevein (Hev b 6.0201) natural isoform (Hev b 6.0202), which is present in rubber latex from Hevea brasiliensis. The isoallergen has a single substitution Asn14Asp, which gives rise to local differences in the surface potential, as observed from the crystal structure presented here. Besides, ELISA inhibition using serum pools of adult and pediatric patients showed reduced IgE-binding capacity ( approximately 27%) with the isoallergen. Overall, these results are relevant to delineate crucial residues involved in this dominant discontinuous epitope.
