Bazooka (Par-3) is a conserved polarity regulator that organizes molecular networks in a wide range of cell types. In epithelia, it functions as a plasma membrane landmark to organize the apical domain. Bazooka is a scaffold protein that interacts with proteins through its three PDZ (postsynaptic density 95, discs large, zonula occludens-1) domains and other regions. In addition, Bazooka has been shown to interact with phosphoinositides. Here we show that the Bazooka PDZ domains interact with the negatively charged phospholipid phosphatidic acid immobilized on solid substrates or in liposomes. The interaction requires multiple PDZ domains, and conserved patches of positively charged amino acid residues appear to mediate the interaction. Increasing or decreasing levels of diacylglycerol kinase or phospholipase D-enzymes that produce phosphatidic acid-reveal a role for phosphatidic acid in Bazooka embryonic epithelial activity but not its localization. Mutating residues implicated in phosphatidic acid binding revealed a possible role in Bazooka localization and function. These data implicate a closer connection between Bazooka and membrane lipids than previously recognized. Bazooka polarity landmarks may be conglomerates of proteins and plasma membrane lipids that modify each other's activities for an integrated effect on cell polarity.
