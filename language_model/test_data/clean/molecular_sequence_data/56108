Nucleotide sequences of heavy (VH) and light (VL) chain variable region complementarity determining regions have been determined from in vitro amplified mRNA isolated from a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) raised to a synthetic 34mer peptide representing the N-terminal portion of human parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP or parathyrin) reported to contain an immunodominant epitope. These mAb vary in affinity for the synthetic peptide and native PTHrP (Ka between 5.9 x 10(8) and 1.9 x 10(11)l/M). All 10 mAb studied were found were found to utilized restricted VH2, V kappa 2, JH4 and J kappa 1 family genes. Significant differences in the length and sequence of D elements were found; however 9/10 mAb utilize members of the DSP2 family. Significantly, two broad ranges of affinity could be determined based on the presence of Asp or Ala at residue 101 in JH.
