A novel alpha-chemokine, designated KS1, was identified from an EST database of a murine immature keratinocyte cDNA library. The EST has 94% similarity to a recently cloned human gene, BRAK, that has no demonstrated function. Northern analysis of mouse and human genes showed detectable mRNA in brain, intestine, muscle and kidney. Tumour panel blots showed that BRAK was down-regulated in cervical adenocarcinoma and uterine leiomyoma, but was up-regulated in breast invasive ductal carcinoma. KS1 bound specifically to B cells and macrophages, as well as two B cell lines, CESS and A20, and a monocyte line, THP-1. KS1 showed no binding to naive or activated T cells. In addition, KS1 stimulated the chemotaxis of CESS and THP-1 cells but not T cells. The s.c. injection of KS1 creates a mixed inflammatory response in Nude and C3H/HeJ mice. The above data indicates that KS1 and its human homologue represents a novel non-ELR alpha-chemokine that may have important roles in trafficking of B cells and monocytes. We propose the name B cell- and monocyte-activating chemokine (BMAC) for this molecule to reflect the described biological functions.
