Variation in the DNA sequence and level of alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster have been studied to determine what types of DNA polymorphisms contribute to phenotypic variation in natural populations. The Adh gene, like many others, shows a high level of variability in both DNA sequence and quantitative level of expression. A number of transposable element insertions occur in the Adh region and one of these, a copia insertion in the 5' flanking region, is associated with unusually low Adh expression. To determine whether this insertion (called R142) causes the low expression level, the insertion was excised from the cloned R142 Adh gene and the effect was assessed by P-element transformation. Removal of this insertion causes a threefold increase in the level of ADH, clearly showing that it contributes to the naturally occurring variation in expression at this locus. Removal of all but one LTR also causes a threefold increase, indicating that the mechanism is not a simple sequence disruption. Furthermore, this copia insertion, which is located between the two Adh promoters and their upstream enhancer sequences, has differential effects on the levels of proximal and distal transcripts. Finally, a test for the possible modifying effects of two suppressor loci, su(wa) and su(f), on this insertional mutation was negative, in contrast to a previous report in the literature.
