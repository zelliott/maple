Two Gram-negative, motile, non-spore-forming and rod-shaped bacterial strains, DS-123T and DS-140, were isolated from soil and their taxonomic positions were investigated by a polyphasic study. Strains DS-123T and DS-140 grew optimally at 30 degrees C and pH 6.5 without NaCl. They contained Q-8 as the predominant ubiquione and iso-C(17 : 1)omega9c, iso-C(17 : 0) and iso-C(15 : 0) as the major fatty acids. Major polar lipids detected in the two strains were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and an amino-group-containing lipid that was ninhydrin-positive. Their DNA G+C contents were 71.0 mol%. Strains DS-123T and DS-140 exhibited no difference in their 16S rRNA gene sequences and possessed a mean DNA-DNA relatedness level of 92 %. Phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strains DS-123T and DS-140 formed a distinct evolutionary lineage within the Gammaproteobacteria. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains DS-123T and DS-140 exhibited similarity values of less than 94.1 % to members of the Gammaproteobacteria. Strains DS-123T and DS-140 were distinguished from phylogenetically related genera by differences in some phenotypic properties. On the basis of phenotypic, phylogenetic and genetic data, it is proposed that strains DS-123T (= KCTC 12396T = DSM 17203T) and DS-140 be classified in a novel genus and species, Dokdonella koreensis gen. nov., sp. nov.
