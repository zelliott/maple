The two replication origins of plasmid pUB110 have been characterized. The site of initiation of DNA replication at the plus origin was mapped to within an 8-base-pair sequence. DNA synthesis initiated at the origin was made to terminate precociously in an inserted sequence of 18 base pairs that is homologous to a sequence in the origin. This suggests that pUB110 replicates as a rolling circle. The minus origin of plasmid pUB110 has been characterized, and the minimal sequence required for function has been determined. As with other minus origins, activity is orientation specific with respect to the direction of replication. Its activity is sensitive to rifampin in vivo, suggesting that RNA polymerase catalyzes single-strand to double-strand conversion. Unlike all other plasmids of gram-positive bacteria thus far described, the pUB110 minus origin is functional in more than one host.
