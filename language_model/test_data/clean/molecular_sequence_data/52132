An approach utilizing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was devised to clone members of a family of cDNAs encoding the alpha subunit of G proteins in the cochlea. RNA was extracted from the whole cochlea of the mouse and from the organ of Corti or the lateral wall of the cochlea microdissected from the guinea pig cochlea. The RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA which was selectively amplified by PCR using degenerate primers corresponding to two conserved regions of the G protein coding sequence. PCR products were cloned into a plasmid for sequencing. The following seven cDNA clones of particular interest were obtained: three clones putatively coding for part of the alpha-subunit of a stimulatory G protein (Gs), one clone putatively coding for part of the alpha-subunit of an inhibitory G protein (Gi) and three clones putatively coding for part of the alpha-subunit of a transducin (Gi)-like protein. Possible functions in the cochlea of putative G proteins with alpha-subunits partly encoded by these cDNA clones are briefly discussed and future studies are suggested.
