Seven triterpene saponins were isolated from n-butanol fractions of blue cohosh (Caulophyllum thalictroides) roots and rhizomes. Their structures were established by spectral ((1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, 2D-NMR, and APCI-MS) techniques and chemical reactions as hederagenin 3-O-alpha-L-arabinopyranoside (1); caulophyllogenin 3-O-alpha-L-arabinopyranoside (2); hederagenin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranoside (3); 3-O-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-hederagenin 28-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->4)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4); 3-O-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl- caulophyllogenin 28-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->4)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (5); 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl- echinocystic acid 28-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->4)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (6); 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-hederagenin 28-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->4)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (7). All seven compounds were identified in this species for the first time.
