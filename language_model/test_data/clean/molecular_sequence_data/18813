We here characterize a novel bacteriophage (NBR1) that is lytic for Nocardia otitidiscaviarum and N. brasiliensis. NBR1 is a member of the family Siphoviridae and appears to have a structurally more complex tail than previously reported Siphoviridae phages. NBR1 has a linear genome of 46,140 bp and a sequence that appears novel when compared to those of other phage sequences in GenBank. Annotation of the genome reveals 68 putative open reading frames. The phage genome organization appears to be similar to other Siphoviridae phage genomes in that it has a modular arrangement.
