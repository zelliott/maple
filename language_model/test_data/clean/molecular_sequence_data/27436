ING4, a new member of the ING (inhibitor of growth) family of tumour suppressor genes, has been found to be deleted or down-regulated in gliomas, breast tumours, and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether the expression and alternative splicing of ING4 transcripts are involved in the initiation and progression of stomach adenocarcinoma. ING4 mRNA and protein expression was examined in gastric adenocarcinoma tissues and human gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines by RT-PCR, real-time RT-PCR, tissue microarray immunohistochemistry, and western blot analysis. Alterations in ING4 transcripts were determined through sequence analysis of ING4 cDNA. Our data showed that ING4 mRNA and protein were dramatically reduced in stomach adenocarcinoma cell lines and tissues, and significantly less in female than in male patients. We also found that reduced ING4 mRNA expression correlated with the stage of the tumour. Interestingly, by sequence analysis, we discovered five novel aberrantly spliced variant forms of ING4_v1 and ING4_v2. These variants cause a codon frame-shift and, eventually, deletion of the NLS or PHD domain contributing to the mislocalization of p53 and/or HAT/HDAC complexes and, subsequently, altered gene expression in gastric adenocarcinoma. These results suggest that attenuated and aberrant ING4 expression may be involved in the initiation and progression of stomach adenocarcinoma.
