The yeast nuclear gene MSD1 coding for mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase has been cloned and sequenced. The identity of the gene is confirmed by the following evidence. (i) The primary structure of the protein derived from the gene sequence is similar to that of the yeast cytoplasmic aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. (ii) In situ disruption of MSD1 in a respiratory-competent haploid strain of yeast induces a pleiotropic phenotype consistent with a lesion in mitochondrial protein synthesis. (iii) Mitochondria from a mutant with a disrupted chromosomal copy of MSD1 are unable to acylate mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA. The primary structures of the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetases are similar to the yeast cytoplasmic lysyl-tRNA synthetase, suggesting that the two types of synthetases may have a common evolutionary origin. Searches of the current protein banks also have revealed a high degree of sequence similarity of the lysyl-tRNA synthetase to the product of the Escherichia coli herC gene and to the partial sequence of a protein encoded by an unidentified reading frame located adjacent to the E. coli frdA gene. Based on the sequence similarities and the map positions of the herC and frdA loci, we propose herC to be the structural gene of the constitutively expressed lysyl-tRNA synthetase of E. coli and the unidentified reading frame to be the structural gene of the heat-inducible lysyl-tRNA synthetase.
