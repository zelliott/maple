In this study, we report one lytic Myoviridae bacteriophage (phage) infecting Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. The phage (named as phiAS5) was isolated from environmental river waters in Korea, and showed broad infectivity to other bacterial species in the family Aeromonadaceae as well as antibiotic-resistant A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida strains. The biological properties and complete genome of phiAS5 were simultaneously investigated. The complete genome of phiAS5 composed of linear double-stranded DNA of 225,268 bp with G+C content of 43.0%, and encoded 343 putative ORFs, 69 putative promoters, 33 transcriptional terminator regions and 24 tRNA-encoding genes. A high degree of similarity to other T4-like Aeromonas phage was found in most ORFs of phiAS5. Therefore, the genome of phiAS5 was further compared with T4 phage and the closest relative, Aeromonas phage Aeh1, and the result demonstrated that it could be classified as a new member of the T4-like group. The bacteriolytic activity of phiAS5 against A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida was evaluated at different doses of multiplicity of infection using one each of virulent strain that possesses the ascV gene and multi-drug resistant strain, and the results proved to be efficient for the reduction of bacterial growth. Based on these results, phiAS5 may have the potential for reducing the impacts of virulent or antibiotic-resistant A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida in aquaculture and may also advance our understanding of the biodiversity of T4-like Aeromonas phages.
