A palindromic hairpin duplex containing the inverted terminal repeat sequence of adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV) DNA was used as a substrate in gel retardation assays to detect putative proteins that specifically interact with the AAV hairpin DNA structures. Nuclear proteins were detected in extracts prepared from human KB cells coinfected with AAV and adenovirus type 2 that interacted with the hairpin duplex but not in nuclear extracts prepared from uninfected, AAV-infected, or adenovirus type 2-infected KB cells. The binding was specific for the hairpin duplex, since no binding occurred with a double-stranded DNA duplex with the identical nucleotide sequence. Furthermore, in competition experiments, the binding could be reduced with increasing concentrations of the hairpin duplex but not with the double-stranded duplex DNA with the identical nucleotide sequence. S1 nuclease assays revealed that the binding was sensitive to digestion with the enzyme, whereas the protein-bound hairpin duplex was resistant to digestion with S1 nuclease. The nucleotide sequence involved in the protein binding was localized within the inverted terminal repeat of the AAV genome by methylation interference assays. These nuclear proteins may be likely candidates for the pivotal enzyme nickase required for replication or resolution (or both) of single-stranded palindromic hairpin termini of the AAV genome.
