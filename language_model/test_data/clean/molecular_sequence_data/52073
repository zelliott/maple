Crystal structure analysis of proline-containing alpha-helices in proteins has been carried out. High resolution crystal structures were selected from the Protein Data Bank. Apart from the standard internal parameters, some parameters which are specifically related to the bend in the helix due to proline have been developed and analyzed. Finally the position and nature of these helices and their interactions with the rest of the protein have been analyzed.
