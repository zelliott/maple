Normal human gastric epithelial cells were examined by electron microscopy using each of five biotinylated lectins [Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-I), peanut agglutinin (PNA), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), soybean agglutinin (SBA) and Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA)] as a probe. We employed 35 gastric surgical specimens removed from complicated peptic disease. The lectin-binding sites were revealed with streptavidin-colloidal gold complex. All specimens were embedded in Spurr and LR White resins. In superficial foveolar epithelial cells, the lectins used were generally positive in all cell types (mainly UEA-1 and PNA) on the Golgi region and mucus cytoplasmic vacuoles, with many variations among cells in the same case. On the other hand, extracellular mucus was negative for WGA. Labelling with PNA revealed a biphasic pattern (peripheral positivity) on mucous droplets in surface and foveolar cells. The cis side of the Golgi apparatus was labelled with SBA and PNA and rough endoplasmic reticulum with SBA (only five cases). Lectin-binding variability could be related to heterogeneous composition of gastric mucus. Our results with SBA suggest initiation of O-glycosylation at the Golgi apparatus; however a role of the rough endoplasmic reticulum cannot be excluded (N-glycosylation). We propose the following sequence of sugar addition to the carbohydrate side-chains of gastric glycoproteins: (1) GaNAc (Golgi apparatus cis-side), (2) GlcNAc (Golgi apparatus intermediate face), (3) GalNac or Gal, alpha-L-fucose (Golgi apparatus trans-side).
