The SFP2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been characterized. The deduced amino acid sequence contained twelve highly hydrophobic domains and showed 50, 47, 44 and 48% homologies to Neurospora crassa sulfate permease II (CYS14), soybean GMAK170 nodulin, human colon mucosa protein (DRA) and a putative open reading frame (ORF) downstream of Escherichia coli prs (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphatate synthetase) gene, respectively, in the aligned regions. Cells lacking SFP2 were viable and displayed no obvious decrease in their growth rate. Southern blot analysis revealed that SFP2 exists as a single copy in haploid genome. Northern blot analysis showed that SFP2 produced a 2.8-kb transcript which was highly expressed under sulfur derepressing condition. SFP2 mRNA was found to turn over with a half-life of approximately 15 min, which may contribute to the regulation of sulfate permease function, and reached its maximal level in about 22 h after depression.
