The regulation of the gene expression of the atrial natriuretic peptide receptor (ANPR) subtypes, ANPR-A, ANPR-B, and ANPR-C, was investigated in a murine thymic stromal cell line, MRL 104.8a. When MRL 104.8a cells were cultured with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, [125I]ANP binding sites increased with increasing dose of TGF-beta1. These binding sites were identified as ANPR-C by a displacement experiment with ANPR-C-specific ligand, C-ANF, and by the affinity cross-linking of the [125I]ANP binding sites with a chemical cross-linker to determine the molecular weight of the ANPR. This augmentation of the ANPR-C expression was elucidated to occur at the transcriptional level by Northern blot experiment, comparison of the relative amounts of mRNA by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and in vitro nuclear transcription assay. Conversely, the expression of the ANP biological receptors, ANPR-A and ANPR-B, was shown to be down-regulated by TGF-beta1. These data suggest that TGF-beta1 regulates the gene expression of ANPRs in the thymic stromal cells and that ANP and TGF-beta1 might affect the thymic stromal cell functions.
