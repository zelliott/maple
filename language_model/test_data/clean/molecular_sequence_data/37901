The recruitment of neutrophil granulocytes to sites of tissue injury is one of the earliest events during host defense. Several chemotactic cytokines belonging to the CXC subfamily of chemokines are thought to be implicated in this kind of response. Especially those CXC chemokines that are stored in blood platelets and become immediately released upon activation are likely to dominate neutrophil-dependent host defense at the onset of inflammation. The major platelet-derived CXC chemokines are the beta-thromboglobulins and platelet factor 4 (PF-4), which are both released into the blood at micromolar concentrations. The availability as well as the functional activity of these mediators appear to be subject to tight control by diverse regulatory mechanisms. These include proteolytic processing of chemokine precursors, oligomer formation, and the differential usage of neutrophil-expressed receptors. Herein we review our work on early neutrophil regulation by PF-4, the beta-thromboglobulin neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2) and its major precursor connective tissue-activating peptide III (CTAP-III). We moreover propose a model to assess the contribution by either of these chemokines to coordinated recruitment and activation of neutrophils in response to acute tissue injury.
