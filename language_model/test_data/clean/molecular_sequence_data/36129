A 300-fold adriamycin resistant variant (DLKP-A) of the human lung squamous cell carcinoma line DLKP was established by stepwise selection in increasing concentrations of adriamycin. Different levels of cross-resistance were observed towards VP-16, VM-26, colchicine, vincristine and, somewhat unexpectedly, cis-platin. Resistance was stable for at least 3 months in culture in the absence of drug. P-glycoprotein overexpression was detected by immunofluorescence and Western Blotting, and a direct causal role for P-glycoprotein overexpression in the resistant phenotype was established by transfection with an mdr1 specific antisense oligonucleotide. A modified cryopreservation procedure was necessary for the resistant variant line. The resistant population displays clonal heterogeneity with respect to resistance level. A higher frequency of double minute chromosomes was observed in DLKP-A when compared with the parental cell line.
