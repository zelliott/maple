Pentoxifylline modulates multiple activities of stimulated polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), including the respiratory burst response and membrane transport of certain substances (e.g., nucleosides). We found that several weakly basic antibiotics are highly concentrated by human PMNs and that these drugs also inhibit the respiratory burst response (by a mechanism different from that of pentoxifylline). Since both pentoxifylline and antibiotics will be administered to some patients with serious infections, we have evaluated several types of interactions between these drugs and human PMNs and have attempted to identify the mechanisms that produce alterations in cellular function. Roxithromycin, dirithromycin, and clindamycin were avidly concentrated by PMNs. Pentoxifylline and two derivatives (HWA-448 [torbafylline] and HWA-138 [albifylline]) increased the uptake of these antibiotics by PMNs, both in the resting state and during phagocytosis. Pentoxifylline, HWA-448, HWA-138, and the highly concentrated antibiotics each exerted an inhibitory effect on the stimulated respiratory burst response in PMNs. The combination of both pentoxifylline and a modulatory antibiotic (roxithromycin or clindamycin) inhibited superoxide production to a greater extent than either agent alone. This additive effect might be expected, since pentoxifylline and the modulatory antibiotics influence the respiratory burst activation pathway at different sites. The ability of pentoxifylline to augment the entry of antibiotics into neutrophils has important therapeutic implications. The consequences of this phenomenon might include improved intracellular bactericidal activity as well as efficient antibiotic delivery and release at sites of infection.
