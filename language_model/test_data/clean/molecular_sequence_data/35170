The total antioxidative activity of L. ingluviei ADK10 isolated from chicken intestine intact cells and cell free culture supernatant (CFCS) was 54- 67.95%. The ability to scavenge a,a-Diphenyl-b-Picrylhydrazyl free radical ranged from 71 and 64% in intact cells and CFCS respectively. Total reducing activity of bacteria was equivalent to 290 microM/L of cysteine. Reducing glutathione activity was equivalent to 93.95 microg/mL. Oral administration of the strain at a dose of 10(9) cfu/kg body weight to acetaminophen induced oxidative stress in rats increased catalase, glutathione and superoxide dismutase activity in the blood, liver and kidney and lowered malondialdehyde level. The results indicate that L. ingluviei ADK10 has potential free radical scavenging activity for the treatment of oxidative stress related disease.
