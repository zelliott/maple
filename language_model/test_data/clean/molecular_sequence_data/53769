Vaccinia topoisomerase forms a covalent DNA-(3'-phosphotyrosyl)-enzyme intermediate at sites containing the sequence 5'-CCCTT downward arrow. The covalently bound topoisomerase can religate the CCCTT strand to a 5'-OH-terminated polynucleotide or else transfer the strand to a non-DNA nucleophile such a water or glycerol. Here, we report that vaccinia topoisomerase also catalyzes strand transfer to hydrogen peroxide. The observed alkaline pH-dependence of peroxidolysis is consistent with enzyme-mediated attack by peroxide anion on the covalent intermediate. The reaction displays apparent first-order kinetics. From a double-reciprocal plot of k(obs) versus [H(2)O(2)] at pH 10, we determined a rate constant for peroxidolysis of 6.3 x 10(-)(3) s(-)(1). This rate is slower by a factor of 200 than the rate of topoisomerase-catalyzed strand transfer to a perfectly aligned 5'-OH DNA strand but is comparable to the rate of DNA strand transfer across a 1-nucleotide gap. Strand transfer to 2% hydrogen peroxide is 300 times faster than strand transfer to 20% glycerol and approximately 2000 times faster than topoisomerase-catalyzed hydrolysis of the covalent intermediate. Hydroxylamine is also an effective nucleophile in topoisomerase-mediated strand transfer (k(obs) = 6.4 x 10(-)(4) s(-)(1)). The rates of the peroxidolysis, hydroxylaminolysis, glycerololysis, and hydrolysis reactions catalyzed by the mutant enzyme H265A were reduced by factors of 100-700, in accordance with the 100- to 400-fold rate decrements in DNA cleavage and religation by H265A. We surmise that vaccinia topoisomerase catalyzes strand transfer to DNA and non-DNA nucleophiles via a common reaction pathway in which His-265 stabilizes the scissile phosphate in the transition state rather than acting as a general acid or base.
