Golgin-97, RanBP2alpha, Imh1p and p230/golgin-245 (GRIP) domain golgins are targeted to the Golgi membrane through their GRIP domains. By analyzing more than 30 mutants of golgin-97 and golgin-245 GRIP domains for their properties of dimerization, interaction with ARF like protein 1 (Arl1)-GTP and Golgi targeting, we found hierarchically organized three-tier interactions governing the Golgi targeting of GRIP domain golgins. GRIP domain self-dimerization is necessary for bivalent interaction with Arl1-GTP. Unexpectedly, however, these two interactions are not sufficient for Golgi targeting, as a third group of residues, including positive-charged arginine between alpha1 and alpha2 and hydrophobic residues C-terminal to the GRIP domain, turn out to be essential. Surface plasmon resonance analysis indicates that GRIP domain interacts directly with membrane lipid, partially through the third group of residues such as W744 of golgin-97. This third tier of interaction with the membrane could be mediated by non-specific hydrophobic and electrostatic forces.
