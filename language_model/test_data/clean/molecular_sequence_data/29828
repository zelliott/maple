The complete genome of spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) was cloned and the sequence of 11019 nucleotides was determined. It contains five open reading frames (ORF's) encoding for the nucleoprotein N; phosphoprotein P; matrix protein M; glycoprotein G; and the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase L. Genes are organised in the order typical for rhabdoviruses: 3'-N-P-M-G-L-5'. The short leader and trailer regions of SVCV exhibit inverse complementarity and are similar to the respective 3' and 5' ends of the genome of vesicular stomatitis virus. To verify the predicted open reading frames proteins were expressed in bacteria and analysed with a polyclonal anti-SVCV serum. Furthermore, monospecific antisera against the distinct viral proteins were generated. Comparison of genome and protein confirm the assignment of SVCV to the genus Vesiculovirus.
