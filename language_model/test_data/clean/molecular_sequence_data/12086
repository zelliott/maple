A detailed restriction map of the murine TGF-beta 1 locus (encoding transforming growth factor beta 1) was established and the precise junctional sequences of its seven exons and corresponding introns were elucidated. While the exons ranged in size from 78 to 357 bp, the introns ranged from about 1 to 6.5 kb. The promoter-proximal segment contains many putative regulatory motifs which may dictate TGF-beta 1 gene transcription in response to varied pathophysiological stimuli.
