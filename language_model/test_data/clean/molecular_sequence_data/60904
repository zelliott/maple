By screening a cDNA library and 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, the cDNA for a non-receptor type protein tyrosine kinase from the sea urchin Anthocidaris crassispina was analyzed. The deduced protein (AcSrc1) with the highest identity of about 60% to mammalian Src family kinases shows the characteristic features of the Src family. AcSrc1 mRNA is maternally expressed in unfertilized eggs, while zygotic expression is first detected in blastulae and continues through the pluteus stage. Zygotic mRNA expression, visualized by in situ hybridization, is detected specifically in archenteron at the gastrula stage, while it is restricted in plutei to the midgut and hindgut, suggesting specific roles for AcSrcl in the formation and/or functions of the digestive tract. Meanwhile, western blot analysis has shown that the AcSrc1 protein is constantly expressed throughout embryogenesis. By immunostaining, it was found that the protein (distributed evenly in the cytoplasm of unfertilized eggs) is translocated to the membrane after fertilization. All through the following development, AcSrcl was localized to the peripheries of different embryonic cells, although at a relatively low level of localization at the boundaries between adjacent cells.
