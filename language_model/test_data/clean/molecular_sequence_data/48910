We report here a case of non-healing ulcer due to Trichosporon loubieri in an apparently immunocompetent female. The identity of isolate was confirmed by DNA sequencing of D1/D2 region of 26S rDNA. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the isolate were amphotericin B-0.5 μg/ml; fluconazole-4 μg/ml; posaconazole-0.25 μg/ml; voriconazole-0.06 μg/ml. The patient was managed by extensive debridement and oral fluconazole 150 mg daily for 6 weeks. She responded to therapy. To the best of our knowledge, till date, this is the fourth report of human infection due to T. loubieri and the first of its kind in an immunocompetent host. A review of published literature on infections due to T. loubieri is also included.
