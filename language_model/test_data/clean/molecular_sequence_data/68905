We developed a parallel denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) protocol to maximize the detection of nucleotide variants in the DNA sequence coding for the mature insulin receptor and in splice site junctions. The melting behaviours of exons 2 to 22 and flanking intronic sequences were computer-simulated using two programs, MELT87 and SQHTX. The data obtained from computer analysis were used to select primers for amplification by polymerase chain reaction and optimal electrophoretic conditions. The ability of this protocol to detect nucleotide changes at the insulin-receptor locus was assessed by studying amplified DNA of a patient with leprechaunism whose insulin-receptor mutations were known and by screening the insulin-receptor gene for polymorphisms in a population of unrelated caucasian individuals. Our results demonstrate that this DGGE protocol is sensitive since it detected (1) sequence variants reported to be undetectable by means of parallel DGGE, (2) previously characterized insulin-receptor nucleotide variants, and (3) unreported polymorphisms at the insulin-receptor locus of caucasian individuals. It is also simple as perpendicular denaturing gradient gels are not required. Application of this protocol will facilitate the search for molecular defects underlying the pathogenesis of insulin resistance observed in genetic syndromes of severe insulin resistance as well as in other metabolic disorders. In addition, its ability to detect several regions of the insulin-receptor gene displaying a number of common polymorphic sites and being multiallelic will contribute to linkage studies in families with diabetic and/or insulin-resistant subjects.
