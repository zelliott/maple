The peroxin Pex3p has been identified as an integral peroxisomal membrane protein in yeast where pex3 mutants lack peroxisomal remnant structures. Although not proven in higher organisms, a role of this gene in the early peroxisome biogenesis is suggested. We report here the cDNA cloning and the genomic structure of the mouse PEX3 gene. The 2 kb cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 372 amino acids (42 kDa). The gene spans a region of 30 kb, contains 12 exons and 11 introns and is located on band A of chromosome 10. The putative promoter region exhibits characteristic housekeeping features. PEX3 expression was identified in all tissues analyzed, with the strongest signals in liver and in testis, and could not be induced by fenofibrate. The data presented may be useful for the generation of a mouse model defective in PEX3 in order to clarify the yet unknown functional impact of disturbances in early peroxisomal membrane assembly.
