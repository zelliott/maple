Human salivary histatins (Hsns) have been known to be potent antifungal agents against Candida albicans for more than a decade. Here, we report that Hsns are also effective in killing another medically important opportunistic fungal pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans, which has become a new threat among the immunocompromised patients, especially AIDS patients. In fact, the cidal activity of Hsn-5 against C. neoformans is as high as that against C. albicans.
