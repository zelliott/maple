The 3' terminal 1.4 kb segment of potato virus M (PVM) genomic RNA was cloned and sequenced. This part of the viral genome encodes the capsid protein CP as well as a 12 kDa protein of as yet unknown function. Both proteins were expressed in bacteria and their nucleic acid-binding properties studied. The 12 kDa protein (pr12), but not the capsid protein bound single- and double-stranded nucleic acids. This property of pr12 in conjunction with a zinc finger motif located adjacent to a basic region of the 12 kDa protein suggests that it may act as a regulatory factor during virus replication.
