During malaria parasite invasion of red blood cells, merozoite proteins bind receptors on the surface of the erythrocyte. Two candidate Plasmodium yoelii adhesion proteins are apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) and the 235-kDa rhoptry proteins (P235). Previously, we have demonstrated that passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 45B1 and 25.77 against AMA1 and P235, respectively, protects against a lethal challenge infection with P. yoelii YM. We show that MAb 45B1 recognizes an epitope located on a conserved surface of PyAMA1, as determined by phage display and analysis of the three-dimensional structure of AMA1, in a region similar to that bound by the P. falciparum AMA1-specific inhibitory antibody 4G2. The epitope recognized by 25.77 could not be assigned. We report here that MAbs 45B1 and 25.77 also protect against challenge with the nonlethal parasite line 17X, in which PyAMA1 has a significantly different amino acid sequence from that in YM. When administered together, the two MAbs acted at least additively in providing protection against challenge with the virulent YM parasite. These results support the concept of developing a multicomponent blood-stage vaccine and the inclusion of polymorphic targets such as AMA1, which these results suggest contain conserved domains recognized by inhibitory antibodies.
