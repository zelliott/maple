Modern lager brewing yeasts used in beer production are hybrid strains consisting of at least two different genomes. To obtain information on the identity of the parental strains that gave rise to industrial lager yeasts, we used two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis and analysed the proteomes of different Saccharomyces species isolated from breweries. We found that the proteome of lager brewing yeasts and of the type strains of S. carlsbergensis, S. monacensis and S. pastorianus can be interpreted as the superimposition of two elementary patterns. One originates from proteins encoded by a S. cerevisiae-like genome. The other corresponds to a divergent Saccharomyces species whose best representative is a particular S. pastorianus strain, NRRL Y-1551. A map of industrial lager brewing yeasts has been established, with the individual origin of proteins and with identification of protein spots by comparison to known S. cerevisiae proteins. This 2-D map can be accessed on the Lager Brewing Yeast Protein Map server through the World Wide Web. This study provides the first example of the use of proteome analysis for investigating taxonomic relationships between divergent yeast species.
