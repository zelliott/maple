Metal ions facilitate the folding of the hairpin ribozyme but do not participate directly in catalysis. The metal complex cobalt(III) hexaammine supports folding and activity of the ribozyme and also mediates specific internucleotide photocrosslinks, several of which retain catalytic ability. These crosslinks imply that the active core structure organized by [Co(NH3)6]3+ is different from that organized by Mg2+ and that revealed in the crystal structure [Rupert, P. B., and Ferre-D'Amare, A. R. (2001) Nature 410, 780-786] (1). Residues U+2 and C+3 of the substrate, in particular, adopt different conformations in [Co(NH3)6]3+. U+2 is bulged out of loop A and stacked on residue G36, whereas the nucleotide at position +3 is stacked on G8, a nucleobase crucial for catalysis. Cleavage kinetics performed with +2 variants and a C+3 U variant correlate with the crosslinking observations. Variants that decreased cleavage rates in magnesium up to 70-fold showed only subtle decreases or even increases in observed rates when assayed in [Co(NH3)6]3+. Here, we propose a model of the [Co(NH3)6]3+-mediated catalytic core generated by MC-SYM that is consistent with these data.
