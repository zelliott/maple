The tobacco retrotransposon Tnt1 can transpose through an RNA intermediate in the heterologous host Arabidopsis thaliana. We report here the identification and characterization of extrachromosomal linear and circular DNA forms of Tnt1 in this heterologous host. Our results demonstrate that Tnt1 linear intermediates possess two extra base pairs at each end compared with Tnt1's integrated forms. Prior to integration into the host genome, the two terminal nucleotides at the 3' end of these linear intermediates are removed, as in the case of the yeast Ty3 retrotransposon and of retroviruses. Our data, together with those from recent studies of Ty3, reinforce the idea that 3' dinucleotide cleavage is not restricted to retroviral integrases and is probably a feature shared by many different retrotransposons' enzymes.
