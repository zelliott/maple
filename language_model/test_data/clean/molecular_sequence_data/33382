Replicative DNA polymerases possess a canonical C-terminal proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-binding motif termed the PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) box. We investigated the role of the PIP box on the functional interactions of the two DNA polymerases, PabPol B (family B) and PabPol D (family D), from the hyperthermophilic euryarchaeon Pyrococcus abyssi, with its cognate PCNA. The PIP box was essential for interactions of PabPol B with PCNA, as shown by surface plasmon resonance and primer extension studies. In contrast, binding of PabPol D to PCNA was affected only partially by removing the PIP motif. We identified a second palindromic PIP box motif at the N-terminus of the large subunit of PabPol D that was required for the interactions of PabPol D with PCNA. Thus, two PIP motifs were needed for PabPol D for binding to PabPCNA. Moreover, the C-terminus of PabPCNA was essential for stimulation of PabPol D activity but not for stimulation of PabPol B activity. Neither DNA polymerase interacted with the PabPCNA interdomain connecting loop. Our data suggest that distinct processes are involved in PabPol D and PabPol B binding to PCNA, raising the possibility that Archaea require two mechanisms for recruiting replicative DNA polymerases at the replication fork.
