To clarify the stability of the BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) genome in renal transplant (RT) recipients, three to five complete BKPyV genomes from each of six RT recipients with surviving renal allografts were molecularly cloned. The complete sequences of these clones were determined and compared in each patient. No nucleotide difference was detected among clones in two patients, and a few nucleotide variations were found among those in four patients. In each of these patients a parental sequence (usually the major sequence), from which variant sequences (usually minor sequences) with nucleotide substitutions would have been generated, were identified. A comparison between the parental and variant sequences in each patient identified a single nucleotide substitution in each variant sequence. From these findings, it was concluded that the genome of BKPyV is stable in RT recipients without nephropathy, with only minor nucleotide substitutions in the coding region.
