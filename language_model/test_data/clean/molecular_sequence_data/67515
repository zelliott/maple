Aspergillus oryzae strains express α-amylases abundantly, and the genome reference strain RIB40 has three α-amylase genes (amyA, amyB, and amyC). However, there is no information on the contribution ratios of individual α-amylase genes to total expression. In this study, we generated single, double, and triple disruptants of α-amylase genes by employing a strain (ΔligD) with high gene-targeting efficiency and pyrG marker recycling in A. oryzae. All the disruptants showed reduced activities of α-amylases, and the triple disruptant completely lost activity. Comparative analyses of the activities and mRNA amounts of the α-amylases suggest that the contribution of amyA to the α-amylase expression is smaller than those of amyB and amyC. The present study suggests that the ability to express a large amount of α-amylases in A. oryzae is attributed to gene duplication of genes such as amyB and amyC.
