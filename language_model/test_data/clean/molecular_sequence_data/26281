From cell extracts of the archaebacterium Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum 11 putative precursors of the pseudomurein were isolated and characterized. On the basis of the isolated intermediates, a biosynthetic pathway of the pseudomurein is proposed. Compared to the eubacterial murein the biosynthetic stages follow different pathways as indicated by the occurrence of a nucleotide-activated disaccharide and nucleotide-activated peptides.
