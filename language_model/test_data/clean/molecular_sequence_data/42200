High-level tetracycline-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae (TRNG) has been associated with the presence of a plasmid approximately 25.2 MDa in size which carries a Tet M tetracycline resistance determinant. Two different plasmid types, American and Dutch, have previously been described, based on the restriction endonuclease digestion pattern. In this study, the tet(M) genes from the two plasmid types have been amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and then sequenced. The gene sequences from the two plasmids shared 96.8% identity, and showed similarities with different segments of the tet(M) gene sequences from Tn1545, Tn916 and Ureaplasma urealyticum. The data suggest that it is highly likely that the Tet M determinant found in the American type plasmid has a different origin from that present in the Dutch plasmid.
