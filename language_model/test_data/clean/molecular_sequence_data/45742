We isolated and characterized four new PKCdelta isoforms, PKCdeltaIV, deltaV, deltaVI, and deltaVII, specifically expressed in the mouse testis. These isoforms possess neither V1 nor C2-like domains. Moreover, PKCdeltaVI and deltaVII have a different last exon as their V5 domain. The transcription of PKCdeltaIV, deltaV, deltaVI, and deltaVII is initiated from the same site in the upstream region of exon4 of the PKCdelta gene. They are expressed exclusively in the testis in an age-dependent manner. PKCdeltaIV and deltaV are expressed in spermatids with sperm maturation stage-specific manner, and that PKCdeltaVI and deltaVII are expressed in spermatogonia and spermatocytes.
