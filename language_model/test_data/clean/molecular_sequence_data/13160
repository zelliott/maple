Human neutrophil elastase (HNE) is a serine proteinase capable of degrading a number of connective tissue macromolecules and has been implicated in the destructive processes associated with several chronic inflammatory diseases. A large series of peptidyl electrophilic ketones have been shown to be potent inhibitors of HNE in vitro and in vivo. We report the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of selected inhibitors from this series. MDL 101, 146, MDL 102, 111, MDL 102,823 and MDL 100,948A are -Val-Pro-Val-pentafluoroethylketones with various amino-terminal protecting groups. Although their Ki values varied considerably, (25-170 nM), these compounds demonstrated similar ED50 values after oral administration in the HNE-induced hemorrhage model in hamsters and rats. The duration of action of MDL 102,111 was shorter than that of the other analogs in the HNE-induced pulmonary hemorrhage model in both species. The duration of action of all of the compounds was longer in the rat than in the hamster. Isolated sections of rat jejunum were used to determine the in situ absorption of these compounds. MDL 102,111 showed the greatest extent of absorption, with MDL 102,823, MDL 100,948A and MDL 101,146 following in descending rank order. The comparative metabolic stability of these analogs was measured over a 2-hr incubation period using rat liver homogenates. MDL 101,146 was the most stable, followed by MDL 102,823, MDL 102,111 and MDL 100,948A. MDL 101,146 was more stable in a liver homogenate from rats compared with a liver homogenate from hamsters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
