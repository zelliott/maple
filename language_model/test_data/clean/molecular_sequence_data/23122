Analyses of unionoidean bivalve male-transmitted (M) mtDNA genomes revealed an approximately 555 bp 3' coding extension to cox2. An antibody was generated against this predicted C-terminus extension to determine if the unique cox2 protein is expressed. Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses demonstrated that the protein was predominantly expressed in testes. Weak expression was detected in other male tissues but the protein was not detected in female tissues. This is the first report documenting the expression of a cox2 protein with a long C-terminus in animals. Its universal presence in unionoidean bivalve testes suggests a functional significance for the protein.
