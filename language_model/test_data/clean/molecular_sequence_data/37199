Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are catalytic subunits of multiprotein complexes that are targeted to specific promoters through their interaction with different transcriptional repressors causing silencing of the corresponding genes. This study describes the isolation of dHDAC4, a novel, catalytically active class II Drosophila histone deacetylase, and the analysis of its role in embryonic development. In early embryos, dHDAC4 is expressed in several phases. Initial ubiquitous expression becomes localized to an anterior domain, then evolves into a pair-rule-like and finally into a segment-polarity-like pattern. Suppression of dHDAC4 during early embryogenesis by double-stranded RNA interference led to segmentation defects. Analysis of dHDAC4 expression in gap and pair-rule gene mutants demonstrated that hunchback, knirps, and giant activate, while even-skipped suppresses dHDAC4 expression. These data revealed dHDAC4 involvement in the segmentation regulatory pathway and suggested complex transcriptional regulation as a potential mechanism that controls its expression.
