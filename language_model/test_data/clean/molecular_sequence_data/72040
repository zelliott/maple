Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) is supposed to play a regulatory role in the cell-mediated activation of progelatinase A. To investigate the mechanism of the regulation, we prepared and characterized a chemically modified TIMP-2, and examined its effects on the activation of progelatinase A. We found that treatment of TIMP-2 with cyanate ion led to loss of inhibitory activity toward matrilysin or gelatinase A. Structural and functional analyses of the modified TIMP-2 showed that carbamylation of the alpha-amino group of the NH2-terminal Cys1 of TIMP-2 led to complete loss of the inhibitory activity. When the reactive-site modified TIMP-2 was added to culture medium of concanavalin A-stimulated HT1080 cells, the conversion of endogenous progelatinase A to the intermediate form was partially inhibited, whereas that of the intermediate form to the mature one was strongly inhibited. The reactive site-modified TIMP-2 also prevented an accumulation of active gelatinase A on the cell surface. We speculate that occupation of the hemopexin-like domain of gelatinase A by the reactive site-modified TIMP-2 makes it unable for gelatinase A to be retained on the cell surface, thus preventing the autocatalytic conversion of the intermediate form of gelatinase A to its mature form.
