We have previously identified a monoclonal antibody, T8/2T8-5H7, which clustered serologically with CD8 monoclonal antibodies, but lacked reactivity with L cell transfectants expressing the human CD8 molecule (Lyt-2 homologue). Based on these observations, we postulated that T8/2T8-5H7 might recognize the human Lyt-3 gene product. To test this hypothesis, we have isolated a full-length cDNA encoding the human Lyt-3 molecule and have characterized its product in additional transfection experiments. The results of these studies indicate that the human Lyt-3 cDNA encodes a product recognized by the antibody T8/2T8-5H7. Interestingly, the human Lyt-3 molecule cannot be expressed alone, but requires the human Lyt-2 homologue for efficient cell surface expression. A heterodimer composed of the human Lyt-2 and Lyt-3 molecules may have importance in T cell-target cell interactions.
