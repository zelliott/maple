Expression in Escherichia coli of the genes that encode the major outer membrane porin proteins (OmpF and OmpC) is regulated by the transcription activator protein OmpR and the receptorlike protein EnvZ, which is located in the inner membrane. Using synthesized oligonucleotide fragments containing the OmpR-binding site of ompF, we show that soluble extracts and partially purified OmpR derived from both the parent strain grown in nutrient broth plus 20% sucrose and the envZ11 strain grown in nutrient broth produced high-affinity DNA-binding activity, whereas soluble extracts from the parent strain grown in nutrient broth produced low-affinity binding. We also show that the soluble extracts from the envZ22(Am) strain grown in nutrient broth did not produce detectable bound forms of the ompF fragments, but low levels of DNA binding were detected with soluble extracts of the envZ22 strain grown in nutrient broth plus sucrose. In addition, the time course of the repression of OmpF synthesis produced by a shift to high-osmolarity growth medium was correlated with an increase in the DNA-binding affinity of soluble extracts to the ompF fragment. These results provide evidence that envZ function influences the DNA-binding activity of OmpR and suggest that high-affinity binding of OmpR to the upstream sequences of ompF is correlated with the repression of OmpF production.
