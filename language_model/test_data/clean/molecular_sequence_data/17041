Dissociation of protonated peptides via infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) provides more extensive sequence information than is obtained with collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) in a quadrupole ion trap due to the lack of the CAD low m/z cutoff and the ability to form secondary and higher order fragments with the non-resonant photoactivation technique. In addition, IRMPD is shown to be useful for the selective dissociation of phosphopeptides over those which are not phosphorylated because the greater photon absorption efficiency of the phosphorylated peptides leads to their more rapid dissociation. Finally, the selectivity of the IRMPD technique for phosphorylated species in complex mixtures is confirmed with the analysis of a mock peptide mixture and a tryptic digest of alpha-casein.
