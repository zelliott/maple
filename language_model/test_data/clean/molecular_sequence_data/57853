Two new flavone diglycosides along with 7,4'-O-dimethylscuttelarein 6-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, a known glycoside, were isolated from the seeds of Gelonium multiflorum and their structures were elucidated as 7,4'-O-dimethylscuttelarein 6-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranoside and 6-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl(1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranoside.
