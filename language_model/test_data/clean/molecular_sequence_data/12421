Pseudomonas aeruginosa 455, isolated in Ankara, Turkey, produced a pI 6.2 beta-lactamase determined by plasmid pMLH53 and resisted all beta-lactams except carbapenems. This beta-lactamase, named OXA-14, corresponded to OXA-10 (PSE-2) except that aspartate replaced glycine at position 157 and thus is intermediate between OXA-10 and OXA-11, which has aspartate at position 157 and a further substitution at position 143.
