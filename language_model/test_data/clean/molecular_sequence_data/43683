Our understanding of protein export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm has been advanced recently by the discovery of active, signal-mediated export pathways. Nuclear export signals have been identified in several proteins, the majority of which are RNA-binding proteins. Nuclear export of RNA molecules is likely to be driven by protein-based nuclear export signals.
