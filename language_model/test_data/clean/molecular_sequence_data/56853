The primary structure of hemoglobins of Tetrahymena thermophila and T. pyriformis was determined by peptide and cDNA sequence analysis. Their sequences were 83.5% identical to each other and homologous to other protozoan and cyanobacteria hemoglobins, but not to proteins of the globin family. An intron was not present in the T. thermophila hemoglobin gene.
