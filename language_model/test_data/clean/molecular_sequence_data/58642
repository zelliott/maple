A novel cDNA clone was isolated from a human adult heart cDNA library. This cDNA clone is similar to the small heat shock protein (smhsp) in both DNA and amino acid sequences, especially in the conserved region. Sequence analysis has shown that the putative novel smhsp, named 27 kDa heat-shock-protein-like protein (HSPL27) is a protein of 241 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 26.7 kDa and a deduced pI of 8.0. We have expressed the HSPL27 in E. coli and the expressed protein was found to be present in the soluble fraction of the bacterial cell lysate. Chromosomal mapping data shows that the HSPL27 gene is located at human chromosome 5q11.2.
