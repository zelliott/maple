We have characterized galectin family proteins in adult tissues of Xenopus laevis and purified 14-kDa and 36-kDa proteins from the liver. The liver galectins showed comparable hemagglutination activities to those of mammalian galectins. Furthermore, we isolated five galectin cDNAs from a Xenopus liver library. These cDNAs revealed that X. laevis galectins (xgalectins) form a family consisting of at least proto and tandem repeat types based on their domain structures, like the mammalian galectin family. Two proto-type xgalectins, -Ia and -Ib, exhibited a high sequence identity (91%) with each other at the amino acid level and were most similar (49-50% identity) to human galectin-1. From their sequence similarity and ubiquitous tissue distributions, xgalectins-Ia and -Ib both seemed to be Xenopus homologues of mammalian galectin-1. Three tandem repeat-type xgalectins were newly identified. Two of them, xgalectins-IIa and -IIIa, seemed to be homologous to human galectins-4 and -9, respectively, judging from their high sequence similarities (42-50% identity). However, xgalectin-IVa seemed to be a novel type. Distributions of mRNAs of xgalectins were analyzed by northern hybridization. In addition to adult tissues, either of three tandem repeat-type xgalectins were expressed in whole embryos. Moreover, amino acid sequence analysis of liver proteins indicated that xgalectins-Ia, -IIa, and -IIIa are produced as abundant galectins in the adult liver.
