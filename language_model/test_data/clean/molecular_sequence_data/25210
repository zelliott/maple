The secondary RNA polymerase sigma factor sigma H is essential for endospore development in Bacillus subtilis. However, only a few promoters that are used by RNA polymerase containing sigma H (E sigma H) have been identified. We used in vitro transcription of random cloned fragments of B. subtilis chromosomal DNA to identify a promoter that is used by E sigma H. This promoter is active before the onset of sporulation.
