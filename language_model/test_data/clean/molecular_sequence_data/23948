In vertebrates, sex is determined essentially by two means, genetic factors located on sex chromosomes and epigenetic factors such as temperature experienced by the individual during development. Steroids, especially estrogens, are clearly involved in gonadal differentiation in non-mammalian vertebrates. In this regard, the expression of the estrogen-producing enzyme, aromatase, has been shown to be temperature-sensitive in species where temperature can reverse sex differentiation, especially in our model, the amphibian Pleurodeles waltl. We investigated here the regulation of aromatase expression in the brain during sex differentiation in Pleurodeles. We first isolated a brain isoform of aromatase mRNA which differs in its 5' untranslated region from the isoform previously isolated from adult gonads. In adult Pleurodeles, the brain isoform is mainly expressed in brain tissue while the other isoform is gonad specific. Thus, regulation of aromatase expression in P. waltl could occur by alternative splicing of non-coding exon 1 as previously described in mammals. We then investigated aromatase expression in the brain of male and female larvae and found no differences with regard to sex. Measures of aromatase activity in the brain also showed no differences between sexes at larval stages whereas activity markedly increases in the ovary concomitant with the start of gonadal differentiation. These results support the hypothesis that aromatase could be a target of a temperature-sensitive sex-reversing effect in the gonads but not in the brain.
