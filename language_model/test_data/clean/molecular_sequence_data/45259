The freshwater sponge Lubomirskia baicalensis (from Lake Baikal) is characterized by a body plan composed of serial modules which are arranged along an apical-basal axis. In shallow water, the sponge occurs only encrusting, while in deeper environment (>3 m), this species forms branches and grows in an arborescent manner. Each module is stabilized by bundles of spined oxeas (amphioxeae spicules). The spicules are surrounded by an organic matrix. cDNAs for structural proteins (silicatein and mannose-binding lectin (MBL)) as well as for one regulatory protein (mago nashi) were isolated from L. baicalensis. Surprisingly the silicatein alpha molecule exists in several, at least four, isoforms (a1 to a4). Expression studies revealed that the steady-state levels of transcripts for the silicateins, the mannose-binding lectin, and mago nashi are highest at the top of the branches, while only very low levels are found in cells at the base. Based on in situ hybridization studies, evidence is presented that the spicule formation (1) starts and is completed inside of the bundles, and (2) occurs together with the mannose-binding lectin from the surfaces of the bundles. The data suggest that the modules are sequentially formed. It is speculated that the expression of the silicateins and the mannose-binding lectin might be (partially) controlled by mago nashi.
