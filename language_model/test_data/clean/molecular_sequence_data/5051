It is demonstrated with glycopeptides of the polymorphic epithelial mucin (MUC1) that post-source decay matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (PSD-MALDI) is a fast, highly sensitive, and reproducible method for the localization of O-glycosylation sites by reflectron time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry. We have analyzed GalNAc-carrying peptides of up to 25 amino acids, and could distinguish even neighboring glycosylation sites. This method was also able to localize and characterize disaccharides (e.g., the Thomsen-Friedenreich disaccharide) on MUC1 derived peptides. PSD-MALDI-MS fragment ion patterns were recorded in the positive ion mode from the synthetic peptide TAP25 [(T1aAPPAHGVT9S10APDT14RPAPGS20) T1bAPPA], an overlapping sequence of MUC1 tandem repeats, which was glycosylated with GaINAc in vitro. The glycosylation sites found were either Thr9 or Thr1b in the monoglycosylated, Thr9 and Thr1b in the diglycosylated, and Thr9, Thr1b, and Ser20 in the triglycosylated peptide. A single PSD-MALDI-MS spectrum of the underivatized and uncleaved di- or triglycosylated TAP25 peptide was sufficient to identify the glycosylation sites, thereby distinguishing six potential, partly adjacent, glycosylation sites. The monoglycosylated fraction was found to consist of a mixture of two glycosylated species with the same molecular weight. This was shown by the analysis of proteolytic digests. PSD-MALDI-MS of the resulting peptides right out of the digestion probe was sufficient to identify the Gal-NAc-glycosylation sites as either Thr9 or Thr1b, respectively. Beyond the methodical aspects the results revealed that in vitro glycosylation of the TAP25 peptide with a transferase system from human milk differs from that obtained with a breast cancer cell transferase system.
