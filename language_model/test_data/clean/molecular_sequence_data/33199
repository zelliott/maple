A Gram-positive-staining, non-motile and rod-shaped bacterium, strain ON10(T), was isolated from soil around a wastewater treatment plant in Korea and its taxonomic position was investigated by using a polyphasic approach. Strain ON10(T) grew optimally at pH 6.5-7.0 and 30 degrees C in the presence of 0.5 % (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain ON10(T) clustered with the clade comprising Terrabacter species, with which it exhibited 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of 98.4-98.8 %. The cell-wall peptidoglycan type was based on ll-diaminopimelic acid and the cell-wall sugars were glucose, mannose, arabinose and xylose. The predominant menaquinone was MK-8(H(4)). The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, an unidentified phospholipid and an unidentified lipid. The major fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0) and iso-C(14 : 0). The DNA G+C content was 71.6 mol%. Strain ON10(T) exhibited DNA-DNA relatedness levels of 17-28 % to the type strains of Terrabacter species and could also be differentiated from these species by differences in phenotypic characteristics. On the basis of the data obtained, strain ON10(T) was considered to represent a novel species of the genus Terrabacter, for which the name Terrabacter terrigena sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is ON10(T) (=KCTC 19602(T)=CCUG 57508(T)).
