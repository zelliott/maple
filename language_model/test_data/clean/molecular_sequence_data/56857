Two cDNAs encoding different signal peptides (61 and 66 amino acid residues) and the same mature protein have been cloned from a human cDNA library with a rat subunit c cDNA. The amino acid sequence of the mature human subunit c of mitochondrial H(+)-ATP synthase was completely identical with those of the mature bovine, sheep and rat subunit c.
