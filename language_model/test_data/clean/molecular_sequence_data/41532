Growth of soil bacteria is often limited by the availability of essential nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphate. The reaction to a specific nutrient starvation triggers interconnected responses to equilibrate the metabolism. It is known that PhoP (response regulator involved in phosphate control) specifically binds to several promoters of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism which are also regulated by GlnR (regulator involved in nitrogen control). In this article we report a novel cross-talk between GlnR and the SARP-like regulator, AfsR. AfsR binds to some PhoP-regulated promoters including those of afsS (a small regulatory protein of secondary metabolism), pstS (a component of the phosphate transport system) and phoRP (encoding the two component system itself). We have characterized the regulation exerted upon the nitrogen regulator glnR gene by AfsR, using EMSA and DNase I footprinting assays as well as in vivo expression studies with ΔphoP, ΔafsR and ΔafsR-ΔphoP mutants. Both PhoP and AfsR proteins are able to bind to overlapping regions within the glnR promoter producing different effects. This work demonstrates a cross-talk of three different regulators of both primary and secondary metabolism.
