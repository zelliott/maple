A novel human chromosome locus-specific repetitive sequence was identified and characterized using arbitrary PCR. The repeat monomer consensus sequence is 100 bp long, and there are a minimum of 140 to 160 copies of the repetitive sequence per haploid human genome. The repetitive sequence is highly clustered on 20q12 within a 200- to 400-kb region. The highly polymorphic repeat array is inherited in a stable Mendelian fashion. Hybridization analysis revealed detectable conservation of the repeated element only among hominoids and Old World monkeys, where repeat arrangements are also polymorphic.
