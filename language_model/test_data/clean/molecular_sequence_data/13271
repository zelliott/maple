We characterized 12 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae with various levels of susceptibility of penicillin and extended-spectrum cephalosporins by antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, serotypes, ribotypes, chromosomal DNA restriction patterns by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multilocus enzyme electrophoresis patterns, penicillin-binding protein (PBP) profiles, and DNA restriction endonuclease cleavage profiles of pbp1a, pbp2x, and pbp2b. Seven cefotaxime-resistant (MIC, > or = 2 micrograms/ml) serotype 23F isolates were related on the basis of ribotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, but they had two slightly different PBP patterns: one unique to strains for which the MIC of penicillin is high (4.0 micrograms/ml) and one unique to strains for which the MIC of penicillin is low (0.12 to 1.0 micrograms/ml). The pbp1a and pbp2x fingerprints were identical for the seven isolates; however, the pbp2b fingerprints were different. An eighth serotype 23F isolate with high-level resistance to cephalosporins was not related to the other seven isolates by typing data but was a variant of the widespread, multiresistant serotype 23F Spanish clone. The PBP profiles and fingerprints of pbp1a, pbp2x, and pbp2b were identical to those of the Spanish clone isolate. An additional serotype 6B isolate with high-level resistance to cephalosporins had unique typing profiles and was unrelated to the serotype 23F cephalosporin-resistant isolates but was related on the basis of genetic typing methods to a second serotype 6B isolate that was cephalosporin susceptible. The serotype 6B isolates had different PBP profiles and fingerprints for pbp1a, but the fingerprints for pbp2x and pbp2b were the same.
