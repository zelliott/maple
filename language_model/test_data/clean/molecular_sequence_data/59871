Cyclin D-Cdk4/6 and cyclin A/E-Cdk2 are suggested to be involved in phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) during the G1/S transition of the cell cycle. However, it is unclear why several Cdks are needed and how they are different from one another. We found that the consensus amino acid sequence for phosphorylation by cyclin D1-Cdk4 is different from S/T-P-X-K/R, which is the consensus sequence for phosphorylation by cyclin A/E-Cdk2 using various synthetic peptides as substrates. Cyclin D1-Cdk4 efficiently phosphorylated the G1 peptide, RPPTLS780PIPHIPR that contained a part of the sequence of pRB, while cyclins E-Cdk2 and A-Cdk2 did not. To determine the phosphorylation state of pRB in vitro and in vivo, we raised the specific antibody against phospho-Ser780 in pRB. We confirmed that cyclin D1-Cdk4, but not cyclin E-Cdk2, phosphorylated Ser780 in recombinant pRB. The Ser780 in pRB was phosphorylated in the G1 phase in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that pRB phosphorylated at Ser780 cannot bind to E2F-1 in vivo. Our data show that cyclin D1-Cdk4 and cyclin A/E Cdk2 phosphorylate different sites of pRB in vivo.
