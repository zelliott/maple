Intraspecific sequence variation in a portion of the gene coding for cytochrome b in the dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus Lowe 1834), an endangered fish species in various regions of the Mediterranean sea, was examined in 29 individuals from the western Mediterranean sea. Sixty-four phylogenetically informative nucleotide positions were present in a 353-base pair cytochrome b sequence, amplified using the polymerase chain reaction. Statistical analysis of the sequence data using a variety of tree-building algorithms separated the taxa into one group of dusky groupers corresponding to some of the Algerian individuals and another regrouped set of fishes originating in France, Tunisia and the remaining Algerian specimens. Although, on the basis of their morphology, E. marginatus are now considered as a single species, our results suggest that a subgroup of the Algerian dusky grouper constitutes a cryptic (undescribed) species. These results suggest that morphological and genetic evolution may be uncoupled in dusky grouper, resulting in morphological similarity between species despite extensive genetic divergence. In addition, we cannot rule out the possibility of gene introgression with other species of grouper. A more in depth phylogenetic analysis (i.e. between and within the different Epinephelus species) would likely affect many conservation management decisions about this assemblage of groupers.
