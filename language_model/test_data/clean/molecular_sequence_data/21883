A previously undescribed, rapid-growing, non-chromogenic Mycobacterium isolate from a goat lung lesion in Algeria is reported. Biochemical and molecular tools were used for its complete description and showed its affiliation to the Mycobacterium terrae complex. 16S rRNA, rpoB and hsp65 gene sequences were unique. Phylogenetic analyses showed a close relationship with M. terrae sensu stricto and Mycobacterium senuense. Culture and biochemical characteristics were generally similar to those of M. terrae and M. senuense. However, in contrast to M. terrae and M. senuense, the isolate was positive for urease production and had faster growth. The mycolic acid profile was distinct from those of M. terrae and M. senuense, thus further supporting the new taxonomic position of the isolate. We propose the name Mycobacterium algericum sp. nov. for this novel species. The type strain is TBE 500028/10(T) ( = Bejaia(T) = CIP 110121(T) = DSM 45454(T)).
