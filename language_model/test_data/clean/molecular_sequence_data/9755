Phospholamban is a key regulatory protein that defines diastolic function. Proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) can depress contractility and intracellular Ca2+ currents and transients. An alteration in phospholamban expression is a possible pathway by which these cytokines modulate cardiac function. To test this hypothesis, primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were incubated with IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, or both, and the level of phospholamban transcripts was examined by Northern blot analyses. Phospholamban transcript levels were decreased approximately equal to 50% (P < .0001) in cells exposed to 2 ng/mL IL-1 beta (20 hours), whereas TNF-alpha had no effect. Western blot analyses showed that IL-1 beta also reduced phospholamban protein levels (60% of control, P < .0001). The effects on transcript levels were gene specific; IL-1 beta induced transcripts for inducible NO synthase (iNOS), did not alter GAPDH transcripts, and reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (65% of control, P < .001) transcripts. Cardiomyocytes treated with IL-1 beta showed no alterations in basal contractile parameters (maximum velocity of contraction and relaxation and maximal amplitude of contraction) but were unresponsive to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Studies performed in the presence of second-messenger inhibitors showed that the effect of IL-1 beta on phospholamban transcript levels was blocked by dexamethasone, was insensitive to inhibitors of iNOS, cyclooxygenase, or tyrosine kinases, but was enhanced by the addition of the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine. These data demonstrate that IL-1 beta alters the expression of phospholamban, a key regulator of cardiac contractility, at both the transcript and protein levels. The results suggest novel mechanisms by which IL-1 beta may modify cardiac function.
