In the past decade, the small polyphenol resveratrol has received widespread attention as either a potential therapy or as a preventive agent for numerous age-related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular atherosclerosis, cancer, hypertension, and diabetes, but the biological processes and molecular pathways by which resveratrol induces these beneficial effects, as well as its safety and toxicology remain largely undefined. To explore the molecular mechanisms of resveratrol involved in the amelioration of endothelial dysfunction and vascular disease, in the present study the protein profile changes of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in response to resveratrol treatment were investigated using proteomics approaches (2-DE combined with MS/MS). As a result, four down-regulated protein species named elongation factor 2 (EEF2), carboxymethyl-cofilin-1 (cofilin-1), acetyl-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A-1 (acetyl-EIF5A) and barrier-to-autointegration factor, and five up-regulated protein species named heat shock protein beta-1 (HSP27), phospho-HSP27, phospho-stathmin, Nicotinate-nucleotide pyrophosphorylase and 1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentene dioxygenase were identified. Among them, two translation-related protein species (EEF2 and acetyl-EIF5A) were the most significantly changed (over tenfold). Phospho-EEF2 was further verified to be dramatically up-regulated by immunoblot assays. It is notable that in the present study several protein species with post-transcriptional modification (carboxymethyl-, acetyl-, and phospho-) were found to be altered following exposure to resveratrol. These findings may improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic effects of resveratrol on endothelial cells.
