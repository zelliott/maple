According to the multiple alignment of various dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenases (E3s) sequences, three human mutant E3s of the conserved residues in the center domain, N286D, N286Q, and D320N were created, over-expressed and purified. We characterized these mutants to investigate the reaction mechanism of human dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenases. The specific activities of N286D, N286Q, and D320N are 30.84%, 24.57% and 48.60% to that of the wild-type E3 respectively. The FAD content analysis indicated that these mutant E3s about 96.0%, 99.4% and 82.7% of FAD content compared to that of wild-type E3 respectively. The molecular weight analysis showed that these three mutant proteins form the dimer. Kinetic's data demonstrated that the K(cat) of both forward and reverse reactions of these mutant proteins were decreased. These results suggest that N286 and D320 play a role in the catalytic function of the E3.
