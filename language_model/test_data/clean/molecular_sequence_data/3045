The structural characterisation of adducts formed by the in vitro reaction of haemoglobin (Hb) with styrene oxide (SO), the most reactive metabolite of the industrial reagent styrene, was obtained by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (LC/ES-MS) analysis of modified tryptic peptides of human Hb chains. The reactive sites of human Hb towards SO were identified through characterisation of alkylated tryptic peptides by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation with tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS/MS). A procedure was set up based on this characterisation, allowing Hb modification to be assessed by monitoring SO/Hb adducts using HPLC with selected ion recording (SIR) mass spectrometry. By this methodology it was also possible to compare advantages and disadvantages of presently available strategies for the measurement of Hb adducts with SO. The results obtained could most plausibly lead to the optimisation of molecular dosimetry of SO adducts, and the analytical procedure described herein could be applied to the biological monitoring of styrene exposure in the workplace.
