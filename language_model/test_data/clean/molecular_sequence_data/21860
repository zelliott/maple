A synthetic pyrethroid (SP)-degrading bacterial strain, designated JZ-1(T), was isolated from activated sludge of a SP-manufacturing wastewater treatment facility and studied using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain JZ-1(T) belonged to the genus Sphingobium, showing highest sequence similarities to Sphingobium faniae DSM 21829(T) (98.6 %), Sphingobium cloacae JCM 10874(T) (98.5 %), Sphingobium vermicomposti DSM 21299(T) (97.4 %) and Sphingobium ummariense CCM 7431(T) (96.9 %). The polar lipid pattern, the presence of spermidine and ubiquinone Q-10, the predominance of the cellular fatty acids C(18 : 1)ω7c, C(19 : 0) cyclo ω8c, 11 methyl C(18 : 1)ω7c, C(16 : 0) and C(14 : 0) 2-OH, and the G+C content of the genomic DNA also supported the affiliation of the strain with the genus Sphingobium. Strain JZ-1(T) showed low DNA-DNA relatedness values with S. faniae DSM 21829(T) (30.2 %), S. cloacae JCM 10874(T) (23.3 %), S. vermicomposti DSM 21299(T) (10.9 %) and S. ummariense CCM 7431(T) (7.9 %). Based on its phylogenetic position and its phenotypic and genotypic properties, strain JZ-1(T) represents a novel species of the genus Sphingobium, for which the name Sphingobium wenxiniae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is JZ-1(T) ( = CGMCC 1.7748(T)  = DSM 21828(T)).
