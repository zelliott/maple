We isolated and sequenced both genomic DNA and cDNA clones, which encoded a putative GT1-like protein with 385 amino acids, from cultivated rice (Oryza sativa ssp. indica). This protein shows significant amino acid sequence similarities with trihelix DNA-binding GT-1a/B2F and GT-1 factors that were identified in dicot plants. Northern blotting analysis indicated that the transcript of the rice GT-1 factor in seedling was up-regulated by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea, down-regulated by various continuous light conditions and expressed rhythmically in light/dark cycles. This GT1-like factor gene was therefore designated as rml1 (rice gene regulated by M. grisea and light). The putative RML1 protein, encoded by this single copy gene, is thus identified as a new member of the plant-specific GT family of transcription factors in rice.
