1H-N.m.r. and 13C-n.m.r. spectral assignments for synthetic beta-D-Xyl-(1----2)-beta-D-Man-OMe, beta-D-Xyl-(1----2)-[alpha-D-Man-(1----3)]-beta-D-Man-OMe, beta-D-Xyl-(1----2)-[alpha-D-Man-(1----6)]-beta-D-Man-OMe, and beta-D-Xyl-(1----2)-[alpha-D-Man-(1----3)]-[alpha-D-Man-(1----6)]- beta-D-Man-OMe, which are structural elements of xylose-containing carbohydrate chains from N-glycoproteins, have been made on the basis of 1D and 2D (DQF 1H-1H COSY, HOHAHA) 500-MHz 1H-n.m.r. spectroscopy and 1D 50-MHz 13C-n.m.r. spectroscopy, respectively.
