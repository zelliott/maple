This report describes a case series of septicaemia caused by infection with Aerococcus viridans in immunodeficient NOD/LtSz-Prkdc(scid) (NOD/SCID) mice. During a period of 3 weeks more than 40 animals died or became ill with clinical signs of ruffled coat, weight loss, laboured breeding, and distended abdomen. At necropsy it was found that the animals displayed symptoms of sepsis with widespread abscesses in the liver, heart, lungs or pyogenic peritonitis. A Gram-positive coccus was isolated in pure culture from the abscesses or peritoneum from affected animals. According to phenotypic and phylogenetic characterization, the isolate was identified as A. viridans. This is the first report of a spontaneous outbreak of septicaemia caused by A. viridans infection in immunodeficient laboratory mice and we conclude that A. viridans should be considered as a pathogen in immunodeficient mice.
