A rice PAL (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) gene sequence ( rPAL-P5), which is highly similar to and likely the same as a previously described rice ZB8PAL gene, including the 5'-upstream and exon I coding regions of PAL, was isolated using PCR amplification. The expression of several PALs, including rPAL-P5, was strongly induced following inoculation with Pyricularia oryzae or treatment with a P. oryzae elicitor. To identify the promoter region induced by the P. oryzae elicitor, we constructed and subsequently transformed rPAL-P5 promoter deletion series into rice calli using particle bombardment. Results from both elicitor-inducible reporter gene and gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that the sequence -349 to -256 of the rPAL-P5 promoter includes a cis-element involved in the induction of P. oryzae.
