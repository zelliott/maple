Somatic cell-derived nuclear transfer (scNT) is a method of animal cloning in which the oocyte reprograms a somatic cell nucleus to divide and execute developmental programs. Despite many successes in this field, cloning by scNT remains very inefficient. Unlike other cloned animals, pigs derived by scNT have placentas with severe villous hypoplasia. To obtain a better understanding of the protein networks involved in this phenomenon, we assessed global protein expression profiles in term placentas from scNT-derived and control animals. Proteomic analysis of term placentas from scNT-derived animals identified 43 proteins that were differentially expressed compared to control animals. Among them, 14-3-3 proteins and Annexin V, which are closely involved in the apoptotic signaling pathway, were significantly down- and up-regulated, respectively. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry indicated that down-regulation of 14-3-3 proteins in scNT-derived placentas induced apoptosis of cytotrophoblast cells via mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, our results suggest that placental insufficiency in scNT-derived placentas may be due to apoptosis, induced in part by the down-regulation of 14-3-3 proteins and up-regulation of Annexin V. They also indicate that proteomic maps represent an important tool for future studies of placental insufficiency and pathology.
