A simple and rapid method for identification of alleles at the human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQA1 locus is described. The polymorphic second exon of the HLA-DQA1 locus was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The amplified DNA was analyzed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and restriction enzyme cleavage assay. Using this method, the eight known DQA1 alleles could be distinguished from each other. This paper suggests that the method can be used for quick genotyping of DQA1 alleles, but detecting point mutations at various positions in a fragment as well as new HLA-DQA1 genotypes should also be possible.
