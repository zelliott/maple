In a search for new protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in early hemopoietic cells, we have identified a sequence closely related to the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) family. A cDNA isolated from a mouse embryo library was 89% identical to FGFR-3 in both its coding and 3' untranslated regions. However, the region homologous to exons 5 to 9 of FGFR-3 was missing. In addition, the ORF was interrupted by several stop codons and frame shifts, indicating that this sequence is not functional. These transcripts were therefore copied from a novel FGFR-3 pseudogene, that we called psiFGFR-3. Partial analysis of this gene showed the absence of introns, which is a characteristic feature of a processed pseudogene. psiFGFR-3 gene was localized on Chromosome 1H4-6. Its transcription was shown to be antisense and its expression was restricted to fetal tissues. These results indicate that psiFGFR-3 has been inserted in Chromosome 1 in antisense orientation close to a heterologous promoter.
