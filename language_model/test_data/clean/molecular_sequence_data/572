Mrs3p and Mrs4p (Mrs3/4p) are yeast mitochondrial iron carrier proteins that play important roles in ISC (iron-sulphur cluster) and haem biosynthesis. At low iron conditions, mitochondrial and cytoplasmic ISC protein maturation is correlated with MRS3/4 expression. Zebrafish mitoferrin1 (mfrn1), one of two MRS3/4 orthologues, is essential for erythropoiesis, but little is known about the ubiquitously expressed paralogue mfrn2. In the present study we identified a single mitoferrin gene (dmfrn) in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster, which is probably an orthologue of mfrn2. Overexpression of dmfrn in the Drosophila l(2)mbn cell line (mbn-dmfrn) resulted in decreased binding between IRP-1A (iron regulatory protein 1A) and stem-loop RNA structures referred to as IREs (iron responsive elements). mbn-dmfrn cell lines also had increased cytoplasmic aconitase activity and slightly decreased iron content. In contrast, iron loading results in decreased IRP-1A-IRE binding, but increased cellular iron content, in experimental mbn-dmfrn and control cell lines. Iron loading also increases cytoplasmic aconitase activity in all cell lines, but with slightly higher activity observed in mbn-dmfrn cells. From this we concluded that dmfrn overexpression stimulates cytoplasmic ISC protein maturation, as has been reported for MRS3/4 overexpression. Compared with control cell lines, mbn-dmfrn cells had higher Fer1HCH (ferritin 1 heavy chain homologue) transcript and protein levels. RNA interference of the putative Drosophila orthologue of human ABCB7, a mitochondrial transporter involved in cytoplasmic ISC protein maturation, restored Fer1HCH transcript levels of iron-treated mbn-dmfrn cells to those of control cells grown in normal medium. These results suggest that dmfrn overexpression in l(2)mbn cells causes an 'overestimation' of the cellular iron content, and that regulation of Fer1HCH transcript abundance probably depends on cytoplasmic ISC protein maturation.
