Woronin bodies (WBs) are dense-core organelles that are found exclusively in filamentous fungi and that seal the septal pore in response to wounding. These organelles consist of a membrane-bound protein matrix comprised of the HEX protein and, although they form from peroxisomes, their biogenesis is poorly understood. In Neurospora crassa, we identify Woronin sorting complex (WSC), a PMP22/MPV17-related membrane protein with dual functions in WB biogenesis. WSC localizes to large peroxisome membranes where it self-assembles into detergent-resistant oligomers that envelop HEX assemblies, producing asymmetrical nascent WBs. In a reaction requiring WSC, these structures are delivered to the cell cortex, which permits partitioning of the nascent WB and WB inheritance. Our findings suggest that WSC and HEX collaborate and control distinct aspects of WB biogenesis and that cortical association depends on WSC, which in turn depends on HEX. This dependency helps order events across the organellar membrane, permitting the peroxisome to produce a second organelle with a distinct composition and intracellular distribution.
