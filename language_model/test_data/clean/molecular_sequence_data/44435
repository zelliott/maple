Retinal gamma-aminobutyric acid type C (GABAC) receptors are believed to be composed of rho subunits. Although rho 1 and rho 2 are over 80% similar, the whole-cell currents generated by rho 1 receptors in Xenopus oocytes are significantly greater than those generated by rho 2 receptors. In this study, chimeric subunits containing different portions of human rho 1 and human rho 2 were created to localize sequences facilitating robust rho 1 expression. Our results indicate that these sequences reside in a 100 amino acid domain in the N-terminus of rho 1, and may involve N-linked glycosylation. Since the N-terminus also contains subunit assembly signals, rho 1 receptors may be formed more efficiently than rho 2 receptors. Therefore, this study furthers our understanding of the molecular basis of GABA-mediated inhibition in the retina.
