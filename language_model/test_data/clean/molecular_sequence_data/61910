Lentiviral Gag proteins contain a short spacer sequence that separates the capsid (CA) from the downstream nucleocapsid (NC) domain. This short spacer has been shown to play an important role in the assembly of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). We have now extended this finding to the CA-NC spacer motif within the Gag protein of bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV). Mutation of this latter spacer sequence led to dramatic reductions in virus production, which was mainly attributed to the severely disrupted association of the mutated Gag with the plasma membrane, as shown by the results of membrane flotation assays and confocal microscopy. Detailed mutagenesis analysis of the BIV CA-NC spacer region for virus assembly determinants led to the identification of two key residues, L368 and M372, which are separated by three amino acids, 369-VAA-371. Incidentally, the same two residues are present within the HIV-1 CA-NC spacer region at positions 364 and 368 and have also been shown to be crucial for HIV-1 assembly. Regardless of this conservation between these two viruses, the BIV CA-NC spacer could not be replaced by its HIV-1 counterpart without decreasing virus production, as opposed to its successful replacement by the CA-NC spacer sequences from the nonprimate lentiviruses such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), equine infectious anemia virus and visna virus, with the sequence from FIV showing the highest effectiveness in this regard. Taken together, these data suggest a pivotal role for the CA-NC spacer region in the assembly of BIV Gag; however, the mechanism involved therein may differ from that for the HIV-1 CA-NC spacer.
