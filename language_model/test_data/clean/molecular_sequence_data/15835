We purified two pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitors (PSTI-I and PSTI-II) from rat pancreatic juice. PSTI-I consisted of 61 and PSTI-II of 56 amino-acid residues. Their amino-acid sequences were similar (40 out of 56 amino acid residues of PSTI-II being identical with those of PSTI-I), but PSTI-I and PSTI-II appeared to be translation products of different genes. There was no difference in inhibitory properties between PSTI-I and PSTI-II.
