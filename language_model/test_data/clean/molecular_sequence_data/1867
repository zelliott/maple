Ligand-gated ion channel receptors mediate the response of fast neurotransmitters by opening in less than a millisecond. Here, we investigated the activation mechanism of a serotonin-gated receptor (5-HT(3A)) by systematically introducing cysteine substitutions throughout the pore-lining M1-M2 loop and M2 transmembrane domain. We hypothesized that multiple cysteines in the narrowest region of the pore, which together can form a high affinity binding site for metal cations, would reveal changes in pore structure during gating. Using cadmium (Cd2+) as a probe, two cysteine substitutions in the cytoplasmic selectivity filter, S2'C and, to a lesser extent, G-2'C, showed high affinity inhibition with Cd2+ when applied extracellularly in the open state. Cd2+ inhibition in S2'C was attenuated if applied in the presence of an open-channel inhibitor and showed voltage-dependent recovery, indicating a direct effect of Cd2+ in the pore. When applied intracellularly, Cd2+ appeared to bind S2'C receptors in the closed state. The ability of cysteine side chains at the 2' and -2' positions to coordinate Cd2+ in both the native open and closed states of the channel suggests that the cytoplasmic selectivity filter of 5-HT(3A) receptors maintains a narrow pore during channel gating.
