Using reporter gene constructs, consisting of the bacterial uidA (GUS) coding region flanked by the 5' and 3' regions of the Chlamydomonas rbcL and psaB genes, respectively, we studied the degradation of mRNAs in the chloroplast of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in vivo. Extending the 5' terminus of transcripts of the reporter gene by more than 6 nucleotides triggered rapid degradation. Placing a poly(G) tract, known to pause exoribonucleases, in various positions downstream of the 5' terminus blocked rapid degradation of the transcripts. In all these cases the 5' ends of the accumulating GUS transcripts were found to be trimmed to the 5' end of the poly(G) tracts indicating that a 5' → 3' exoribonuclease is involved in the degradation process. Several unstable variants of the GUS transcript could not be rescued from rapid degradation by a poly(G) tract showing that sequence/structure-dependent modes of mRNA breakdown exist in the Chlamydomonas chloroplast. Furthermore, degradation of poly(G)-stabilized transcripts that accumulated in cells maintained in the dark could be augmented by illuminating the cells, implying a photo-activated mode of mRNA degradation that is not blocked by a poly(G) tract. These results suggest sequence- and condition-dependent 5' → 3' mRNA-degrading pathways in the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii.
