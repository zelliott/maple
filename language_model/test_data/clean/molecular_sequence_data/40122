Numerous diseases have been linked to the malfunction of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Their adequate treatment requires rational design of new high-affinity and high-selectivity drugs targeting these receptors. In this work, we report three-dimensional models of the human MT(1) and MT(2) melatonin receptors, members of the GPCR family. The models are based on the X-ray structure of bovine rhodopsin. The computational approach employs an original procedure for optimization of receptor-ligand structures. It includes rotation of one of the transmembrane alpha-helices around its axis with simultaneous assessment of quality of the resulting complexes according to a number of criteria we have developed for this purpose. The optimal geometry of the receptor-ligand binding is selected based on the analysis of complementarity of hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties between the ligand and its protein environment in the binding site. The elaborated "optimized" models are employed to explore the details of protein-ligand interactions for melatonin and a number of its analogs with known affinity to MT(1) and MT(2) receptors. The models permit rationalization of experimental data, including those that were not used in model building. The perspectives opened by the constructed models and by the optimization procedure in the design of new drugs are discussed.
