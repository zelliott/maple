Two novel actinomycetes, designated strains NEAU-ZJ3(T) and NEAU-yn31(T), were isolated from soils in China and their taxonomic positions determined by a polyphasic approach. Key morphological and chemotaxonomic properties of the two strains were consistent with the description of the genus Nonomuraea. The G+C contents of strains NEAU-ZJ3(T) and NEAU-yn31(T) were determined to be 67.4 and 68.0 %, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the two strains should be classified in the genus Nonomuraea. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain NEAU-ZJ3(T) showed it to be most closely related to Nonomuraea salmonea DSM 43678(T) (98.27 %), Nonomuraea endophytica YIM 65601(T) (98.23 %) and Nonomuraea candida HMC10(T) (98.08 %), and that of strain NEAU-yn31(T) to Nonomuraea ferruginea IFO 14094(T) (99.08 %) and N. candida HMC10(T) (98.01 %). Furthermore, a combination of DNA-DNA hybridization results and some phenotypic characteristics indicated that the two strains can be distinguished from each other and their phylogenetically closest relatives. Thus, strains NEAU-ZJ3(T) and NEAU-yn31(T) represent two novel species of the genus Nonomuraea, for which the names Nonomuraea guangzhouensis sp. nov. and Nonomuraea harbinensis sp. nov. are proposed. The type strains are NEAU-ZJ3(T) (=CGMCC 4.7101(T) = DSM 45889(T)) and NEAU-yn31(T) (=CGMCC 4.7106(T) = DSM 45887(T)), respectively.
