RanGAP1 is the activator of the Ras-related nuclear GTPase Ran, which is involved in the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of both, proteins and mRNAs, and also in cell cycle regulation. Here, we report a 2970-bp cDNA clone of RanGAP1 isolated from a HeLa lambda gt11 cDNA library. It contains a 215-bp 5' untranslated region (UTR) with a G + C-content of 68%, followed by a 1764-bp open reading frame and a 989-bp 3' UTR preceding a 77-bp poly(A)+ tail. RanGAP1 shows differential patterns of expression in human tissues. In addition to the 3.5-kb transcript present in all tissues and highly expressed in brain, thymus and testis, we found a second transcript of 2.8 kb in testis. In order to analyze this shorter transcript, we screened a human testis lambda gt10 cDNA library and cloned an alternatively polyadenylated RanGAP1 transcript. Taking the 3' UTR of RanGAP1, which lies downstream of the first polyadenylation signal, as a probe in Northern blot analysis, we confirmed that this second transcript found in testis results from a distinct 3' UTR.
