The pac gene, encoding the penicillin G acylase from Escherichia coli W, is regulated by the PaaX repressor of the phenylacetate catabolic pathway. pac expression depends on the synthesis of phenylacetyl-coenzyme A. PaaX and the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) bind in vitro to the Ppac promoter region. A palindromic sequence proposed as the PaaX operator is located upstream of the -35 box overlapping a CRP binding site, an unusual position that suggests a novel regulatory mechanism.
