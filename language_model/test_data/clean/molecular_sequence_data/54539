RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs) play an important role in RNA silencing, antiviral and developmental progress. Here, we firstly isolated the full-length cDNA, genomic DNA and 5'-flanking region of RDR6 from Nicotiana glutinosa (NgRDR6). Sequences analysis revealed that the cDNA of NgRDR6 was 3,921 bp in length, and the deduced protein consisted of 1,197 amino acids, containing all highly conserved sequence motifs that are present among all RDRs families. Moreover, two introns were detected in the genomic sequences. We also firstly investigated the expression profiles of plant RDR6 under the treatments of gibberellin A (GA), H(2)O(2,) methyl jasmonate (MeJA), Potato virus Y (PVY), Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Rhizoctonia Solani and Colletotrichum nicotianae. In addition, the expression patterns of RDR6 in Nicotiana glutinosa under the treatments of salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA) were also been analyzed. The results indicated that the NgRDR6 mRNA accumulation could be induced by ABA, GA, MeJA, CMV, Rhizoctonia Solani and Colletotrichum nicotianae. In contrast, the expression level of NgRDR6 exhibited no remarkable difference under the treatments of PVY, TMV, H(2)O(2) and SA. Further investigation suggested several potential cis-acting elements were found in the 5'-flanking sequence of NgRDR6, which might be responsible for the enhanced response to phytohormones.
