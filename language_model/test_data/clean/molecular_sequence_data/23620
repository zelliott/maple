The structure of the core part of the LPS from Geobacter sulfurreducens was analysed. The LPS contained no O-specific polysaccharide (O-side chain) and upon mild hydrolysis gave a core oligosaccharide, which was isolated by gel chromatography. It was studied by chemical methods, NMR and mass spectrometry, and the following structure was proposed. [carbohydrate structure: see text] where Q = 3-O-Me-alpha-L-QuiNAc-(1-->or H (approximately 3:2).
