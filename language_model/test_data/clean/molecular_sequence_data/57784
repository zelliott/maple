Prediction of protein secondary structure is an old problem and progress has been slow. Recently, spectacular success has been claimed in the blind prediction of the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. When predictions in this and other test cases are assessed critically, some claims of prediction success turn out to be exaggerated, but a kernel of real progress remains: protein structure prediction can be improved substantially when a family of related sequences is available. Enough so that molecular biologists equipped with a new amino acid sequence and a multiple sequence alignment in hand may be tempted to test the new prediction methods.
