Cloning and characterization of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene led to the identification and isolation of cDNA and genomic sequences that cross-hybridized to the first nucleotide binding fold of CFTR. DNA sequence analysis of these clones showed that the cross-hybridizing sequences corresponded to CFTR exon 9 and its flanking introns, juxtapositioned with two segments of LINE1 sequences. The CFTR sequence appeared to have been transcribed from the opposite direction of the gene, reversely transcribed, and co-integrated with the L1 sequences into a chromosome location distinct from that of the CFTR locus. Based on hybridization intensity and complexity of the restriction fragments, it was estimated that there were at least 10 copies of the "amplified" CFTR exon 9 sequences in the human genome. Furthermore, when DNA segments adjacent to the insertion site were used in genomic DNA blot hybridization analysis, multiple copies were also detected. The overall similarity between these CFTR exon 9-related sequences suggested that they were derived from a single retrotransposition event and subsequent sequence amplification. The amplification unit appeared to be greater than 30 kb. Physical mapping studies including in situ hybridization to human metaphase chromosomes showed that multiple copies of these amplified sequences (with and without the CFTR exon 9 insertion) were dispersed throughout the genome. These findings provide insight into the structure and evolution of the human genome.
