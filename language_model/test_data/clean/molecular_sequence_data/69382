We have successfully limited the level of hepatitis delta viraemia occurring after superinfection of hepadna-virus infected woodchucks by prior immunisation with the short form of the hepatitis delta virus antigen expressed by a recombinant baculovirus or vaccinia virus. This phenomenon occurred in the absence of detectable circulating antibody to hepatitis delta virus antigen and in the absence of evidence of priming of the humoral immune response and may reflect the induction of a cytotoxic T-cell response. The latter would control viraemia by rapid lysis of delta antigen expressing hepatocytes. It is suggested that the T-cell epitopes involved may be located on the carboxyl end of the delta protein (amino acids 77-195).
