TRAP and LRAP amelogenin components were isolated by size-exclusion and reversed-phase HPLC from developing dental enamel. Porcine developing enamel contains TRAP and LRAP components analogous to those of bovine. Amino acid composition and mass spectrographic analyses established that, in both species, the carboxy-terminal sequences of the LRAP components are two residues longer than previously reported for bovine LRAP, and that both the TRAPs and LRAPs contained a single phosphorylated residue. These amelogenin polypeptides were the principal components of the enamel protein lower molecular weight fraction. The LRAP sequence data for both species suggests that the mechanism of amelogenin carboxy-terminal processing may differ significantly from that previously suggested.
