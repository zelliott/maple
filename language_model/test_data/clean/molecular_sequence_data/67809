A three-year-old Sri Lankan boy residing in Japan developed a nodule on his scalp after visiting Sri Lanka. Two months later, the lesion increased in size to 22 Ã— 19 mm(2), and was identified as an erythematous nodule with alopecia. Direct examination of the infected hair shafts indicated fungal hyphae outside the shafts. The fungus was identified as Microsporum gypseum following mycological examination. The sequence of the internal transcribed spacer 1 region of ribosomal RNA gene (ITS1 rDNA) exhibited 95.7-100.0% homology with that of Arthroderma incurvatum. The patient was successfully treated with a 6-week itraconazole course. We also examined DNA samples from eight clinical isolates of A. incurvatum. Alignments of ITS1 sequences of these strains and our isolate, showed gaps in the 64-bp positions 140-142 and 141-143 of the 205-207-bp ITS1 alignment. We performed phylogenetic analysis using the neighbor-jointing (NJ) method based on the ITS1 sequences of the present isolate and twenty related strains. Fifteen A. incurvatum strains were divided into East Asia and non-East Asia clusters. The present isolate belonged to the non-East Asia cluster, suggesting that the patient was infected outside Japan. Moreover, the trees suggested area-dependent genetic polymorphism of A. incurvatum.
