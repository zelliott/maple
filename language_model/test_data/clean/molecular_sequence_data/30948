Spi-1 is a putative proto-oncogene involved in murine virus-induced acute erythroleukemias. We report here the identification of the human homologue of Spi-1 and its expression in normal and tumorigenic human tissues. Characterization of cDNA clones revealed that the human Spi-1 gene encodes a 216 amino acids protein showing 85% identity with the murine counterpart. By sequencing genomic clones, five exons were identified. To investigate the possible role of Spi-1 gene in human cancers, we studied its expression in a panel of human tumors by Northern blot analysis. Spi-1 expression was detected in all the tumors examined. There was no noticeable evidence of messenger RNA alteration as compared to normal tissues.
