The S-antigen from the Palo Alto isolate of Plasmodium falciparum has been characterized. The partial sequence for the gene coding for this antigen (clone 281) reveals the presence of tandem repeats of eight amino acids which defines a new S-antigen serotype. Antibodies raised against the 281 recombinant clone reacted with a 140 kDa antigen by immunoblotting with parasite extracts and culture supernatants. The 140 kDa peptide was also identified by immunoprecipitation of metabolic labelled parasites. The 281 mouse antiserum was used to localize the antigen on parasite smears by indirect immunofluorescence assay and more precisely by immunoelectron microscopy. The S-antigen is localized within the parasitophorous vacuole. Furthermore, different isolates were examined for the presence of the Palo Alto S-antigen specificity.
