Pf72/Hsp70-1, a heat-shock protein of m.w. 72 kDa from Plasmodium falciparum is one of the Ag of interest to be included in a polyvalent vaccine against malaria. It is one of the major immunogens present in a fraction of purified blood stage parasites that elicited protection against experimental infection of Saimiri monkeys with blood stages of P. falciparum. It is present at all blood stages and one of its B cell epitopes is also detected on the surface of the infected hepatocyte. Moreover, Pf72 appears to be well conserved among different isolates of P. falciparum. We have examined the immune response against Pf72/Hsp70-1 in individuals from different age groups living in a holoendemic area (West Africa). The immune response against the native Ag (purified from schizonts and called Pf/Hsp70) was analyzed both at the humoral level by ELISA and at the cellular level by assessing in vitro proliferation and IFN-gamma production of PBMC. Of the individuals studied 52% had a statistically significant level of anti-Pf/Hsp70 antibodies as compared with unexposed individuals. These positive individuals showed a heterogeneous distribution because significant levels of antibodies were found in 70% of the adults but in only 26% of the children. The presence of Pf/Hsp70-specific reactive T cells in the blood was detected in 32% of the individuals. The total anti-Pf/Hsp70 antibody level (IgG+IgM) appeared strongly age related and correlated positively with parasite exposure, whereas the T cell response failed to correlate either with the antibody level or with age. Moreover, PBMC of donors responded to the Pf/Hsp70 in a dissociated way, namely, by either T cell proliferation or IFN-gamma production. Ten synthetic peptides based on sequences found in the C-terminal part of Pf72/Hsp70-1 were further tested as potential T cell epitopes. The proliferative response of PBMC from individuals continuously exposed to the parasite showed that three peptides more frequently trigger significant T cell proliferation (in 21% to 27% of the individuals) and three others less frequently (10%). None of these peptides allowed detection of reactive T cells in PBMC of Europeans with no previous exposure to malaria. Some of the stimulating peptides are highly similar to human heat-shock Hsc and Hsp70 with large stretches of identical amino acids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
