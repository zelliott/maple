The diptera Rhynchosciara americana (sciaridae) is an important model organism in polyteny and gene amplification research, but up to now a limited amount of data regarding DNA sequences and molecular aspects of this species is available. Considering the importance of going further on the DNA puffs biological meaning, we proposed to generate EST sequences from a DNA library constructed from salivary glands. After their categorization in gene ontology terms, they were used to construct an 'electronic Northern' that represents a general view of the salivary gland metabolic status in an important phase of larval development: the spinning of communal cocoon. In this phase occurs the last polytene DNA replication cycle concomitantly with the specific loci amplification related to protein secretion.
