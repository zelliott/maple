A missing link in the understanding of the mechanisms of transport of the mannose 6-phosphate receptors has recently been discovered, following the identification of the protein TIP47. In association with Rab9-GTP, this protein is responsible for the return of the receptors from the late endosomes back to the trans-Golgi network. Curiously, the same protein called PP17b, was described as a placental protein twenty years ago, and more recently, as a blood marker for human uterine cervical cancer. The sequence of PP17b/TIP47 displays not only a strong homology with those of adipophilin and the perilipins, two proteins known to be involved in the intracellular traffic of lipid droplets but also PP17b/TIP47 is associated with the later. How this ubiquitous protein could participate in processes as different as the mannose 6-phosphate receptors traffic and the formation and/or traffic of lipid droplets? A tentative hypothesis is put forward.
