During an epidemiologic survey of rotavirus infections established to monitor the prevalent G serotypes circulating in the United States, human P[6]G9, subgroup I rotavirus strains causing symptomatic infections were identified as the fourth most common serotype. In this report we describe the molecular and antigenic characterization of one of these P[6]G9 isolates (US1205). Neutralization and sequencing studies have demonstrated that both outer capsid proteins, VP7 and VP4, of US1205 are closely related to but genetically and antigenically distinguishable from those of standard G9 strains (e.g., F45, WI61) and standard P2A[6] strains (e. g., ST3, M37). Thus the complete antigenic type of US1205 is P2A[6]G9, subgroup I. Sequence analysis of the VP6 and NSP4 genes of US1205 indicates that strain US1205 possessed VP6 subgroup I and NSP4A genotype specificities. Finally, Northern hybridization studies suggest that the P[6]G9 strains are closely related to members of the DS-1 genogroup except for their P[6] VP4 gene, which has been commonly identified in strains of both major human genogroups, and their G9 VP7 gene, which may have been derived by reassortment with a Wa genogroup strain. Examination of historic collections and prospective surveillance of strains will be needed to determine whether this strain has been present for some time or if it is emerging to compete with the other common serotypes of rotavirus.
