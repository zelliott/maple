Immunohistochemical localization of bovine decorin was examined with its biological analysis in the fetal bovine rumen. By immunohistochemical staining, monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2B6, which recognizes chondroitin 4-sulfate and/or dermatan sulfate (DS), reacted specifically to the lower mesenchymal region in the developing ruminal wall. Biochemical analysis of the extract from the developing rumen revealed that molecule detected immunohistochemically by mAb 2B6 was small DS proteoglycan, bovine decorin. These results support the view that bovine decorin is involved in organization of the fetal bovine ruminal mesenchyme as a collagenous tissue.
