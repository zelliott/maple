Several members of the ABC family of proteins have been implicated in multidrug resistance associated with cancer therapies. A novel member of this gene family, designated pABC11, has been identified using degenerate polymerase chain reaction. The full-length cDNA spans 5881 base pairs and encodes an open reading frame of 1437 amino acids predicted to contain two sets of transmembrane domains and two nucleotide binding domains characteristic of ABC proteins. The nucleotide sequence described herein extends that of three recently reported sequences, MRP5 (Kool, M., de Haas, M., Scheffer, G., Scheper, R., van Eijk, M., Juijn, J., Baas, F., and Borst, P. (1997) Cancer Res. 57, 3537-3547), SMRP (Suzuki, T., Nishio, K., Sasaki, H., Kurokawa, H., Saito-Ohara, F., Ikeuchi, T., Tanabe, S., Terada, M., and Saijo, N. (1997) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 238, 790-794), and MOAT-C (Belinsky, M., Bain, L., Balsara, B., Testa, J., and Kruh, G. (1998) J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 90, 1735-1741), in the 5' direction. Northern blot analysis detected five transcripts that were differentially expressed in several tissue types, and the gene encoding pABC11 was mapped to chromosome 3. Confocal imaging of HEK293 cells expressing a green fluorescent protein-pABC11 construct confirmed plasma membrane localization of the fusion protein. Overexpression of pABC11 resulted in reduced labeling with the fluorochromes 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate, fluorescein diacetate, and 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5 (and-6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester but not with calcein or rhodamine derivatives, consistent with pABC11 being an anion transporter. Fluorochrome export was ATP-dependent but glutathione-independent. We also show that this export pump does not confer resistance to various classes of cytotoxic drugs but does provide small but significant resistance to CdCl(2) and potassium antimonyl tartrate.
