An intracellular organism was isolated from the tissues of an Oriental white-backed vulture (Gyps bengalensis) in chicken embryo fibroblast cell cultures. Biochemical and physical properties, ultrastructural features, and 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing classified this organism as a new taxon of mycoplasma, for which the name "Mycoplasma vulturii" is proposed.
