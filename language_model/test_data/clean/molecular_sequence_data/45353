A gas vacuolate bacterium, designated strain 37T, was isolated from a sea ice core collected from Point Barrow, Alaska, USA. Cells of strain 37T were large (6-14 microm in length), rod-shaped, contained gas vacuoles of two distinct morphologies, and grew well at NaCl concentrations of 1-10 % and at temperatures of -12 to 10 degrees C. The DNA G+C content was 40 mol%. Whole-cell fatty acid analysis showed that 16 : 1omega7c comprised 67 % of the total fatty acid content. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that this bacterium was closely related to members of the genus Psychromonas, with highest sequence similarity (96.8 %) to Psychromonas antarctica. Phenotypic analysis differentiated strain 37T from P. antarctica on the basis of several characteristics, including cell morphology, growth temperature range and the ability to hydrolyse polymers. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed a level of relatedness of 37 % between strain 37T and P. antarctica, providing further support that it represents a distinct species. The name Psychromonas ingrahamii sp. nov. is proposed for this novel species. The type strain is 37T (=CCUG 51855T=CIP 108865T).
