Mapping of the plasmid-encoded RNA of the intracellular parasite, Chlamydia trachomatis revealed that the upstream control elements are different from those of other Gram-negative bacteria. A tetranucleotide, AYAA was found near the -10 position, in 5 out of 8 upstream sequences described so far. The plasmid also has a developmentally regulated promoter. The chlamydial upstream elements do not function as promoters in E. coli and vice versa. An E. coli promoter-like sequence has been found to occur fortuitously upstream from the plasmid-encoded dnaB gene. Such sequences may be evolutionary relics.
