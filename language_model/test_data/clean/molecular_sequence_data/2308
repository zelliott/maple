The relationship between transcription of alpha and beta interferon (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta) genes and the interaction of IFN promoter-binding transcription factors has been examined in monoblastoid U937 cells following priming with recombinant IFN-alpha 2 (rIFN-alpha 2) and Sendai virus induction. Pretreatment of U937 cells with rIFN-alpha 2 prior to Sendai virus infection increased the mRNA levels of IFN-alpha 1, IFN-alpha 2, and IFN-beta as well as the final yield of biologically active IFN. Analysis of nuclear protein-IFN promoter DNA interactions by electrophoretic mobility-shift assays demonstrated increased factor binding to IFN-alpha 1 and IFN-beta regulatory domains, although no new induction-specific complexes were identified. On the basis of competition electrophoretic mobility-shift assay results, factors interacting with the IFN-alpha 1 and IFN-beta promoters appear to be distinct DNA-binding proteins. U937 factor binding was localized to the P2 domain (-64 to -55) of the IFN-beta regulatory element, a sequence motif with 80% homology to the recognition site of transcription factor NF-kappa B. Protein-DNA interactions within the IFN-beta P2 domain were, in fact, specifically competed by either excess homologous P2 fragment or the human immunodeficiency virus enhancer element which contains two duplicated NF-kappa B recognition sites. Hybrid promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion plasmids, containing either the IFN-beta regulatory element or the human immunodeficiency virus enhancer element linked to the simian virus 40 promoter, were analyzed for virus and phorbol ester inducibility in epithelial and lymphoid cells, respectively. In the 293 cell line, both plasmids were constitutively expressed but not virus inducible, while in Jurkat cells, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity from these plasmids was induced by tumor-promoting agent treatment. These experiments suggest that induction of IFN gene expression may be controlled in part by transcription regulatory proteins binding to an NF-kappa B-like site within the IFN-beta promoter.
