Previous staining studies with TCR V alpha 11-specific mAbs showed that V alpha 11.1/11.2 (AV11S1 and S2) expression was selectively favored in the CD4+ peripheral T cell population. As this phenomenon was essentially independent of the MHC haplotype, it was suggested that AV11S1 and S2 TCRs exert a preference for recognition of class II MHC molecules. The V alpha segment of the TCR alpha-chain is suggested to have a primary role in shaping the T cell repertoire due to selection for class I or II molecules acting through the complementarity determining regions (CDR) 1 alpha and CDR2 alpha residues. We have analyzed the repertoire of V alpha 11 family members expressed in C57BL/6 mice and have identified a new member of this family; AV11S8. We show that, whereas AV11S1 and S2 are more frequent in CD4+ cells, AV11S3 and S8 are more frequent in CD8+ cells. The sequences in the CDR1 alpha and CDR2 alpha correlate with differential expression in CD4+ or CD8+ cells, a phenomenon that is also observed in BALB/c mice. With no apparent restriction in TCR J alpha usage or CDR3 alpha length in C57BL/6, these findings support the idea of V alpha-dependent T cell repertoire selection through preferential recognition of MHC class I or class II molecules.
