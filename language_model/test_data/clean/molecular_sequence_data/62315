The prototypic non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl is implicated in various cellular processes. Its oncogenic counterpart, the Bcr-Abl fusion protein, causes certain human leukaemias. Recent insights into the structure and regulation of the c-Abl and Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinases have changed the way we look at these enzymes.
