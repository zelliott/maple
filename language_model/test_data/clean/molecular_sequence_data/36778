Combinatorial cassettes based on a phylogenetic "target set" were used to simultaneously mutagenize seven amino acid residues on one face of a transmembrane alpha helix comprising a bacteriochlorophyll binding site in the light harvesting II antenna of Rhodobacter capsulatus. This pigmented protein provides a model system for developing complex mutagenesis schemes, because simple absorption spectroscopy can be used to assay protein expression, structure, and function. Colony screening by Digital Imaging Spectroscopy showed that 6% of the optimized library bound bacteriochlorophyll in two distinct spectroscopic classes. This is approximately 200 times the throughput (ca. 0.03%) of conventional combinatorial cassette mutagenesis using [NN(G/C)]. "Doping" algorithms evaluated in this model system are generally applicable and should enable simultaneous mutagenesis at more positions in a protein than currently possible, or alternatively, decrease the screening size of combinatorial libraries.
