U2AF is a heterodimeric splicing factor composed of a large (U2AF65) and a small (U2AF35) subunit. In humans, alternative splicing generates two U2AF35 variants, U2AF35a and U2AF35b. Here, we used RNA interference to specifically ablate the expression of each isoform in HeLa cells. Our results show that knockdown of the major U2AF35a isoform reduced cell viability and impaired mitotic progression, leading to accumulation of cells in prometaphase. Microarray analysis revealed that knockdown of U2AF35a affected the expression level of approximately 500 mRNAs, from which >90% were underrepresented relative to the control. Among mRNAs underrepresented in U2AF35a-depleted cells we identified an essential cell cycle gene, Cdc27, for which there was an increase in the ratio between unspliced and spliced RNA and a significant reduction in protein level. Furthermore, we show that depletion of either U2AF35a or U2AF35b altered the ratios of alternatively spliced isoforms of Cdc25B and Cdc25C transcripts. Taken together our results demonstrate that U2AF35a is essential for HeLa cell division and suggest a novel role for both U2AF35 protein isoforms as regulators of alternative splicing of a specific subset of genes.
