A new human leukocyte allele HLA-B*8102 has been identified in a cell provided by the UCLA International Cell Exchange scheme. The nucleotide sequences of exons 2 and 3 of the new allele are identical with HLA-B*8101. Four nucleotide differences, however, are observed in exon 1, three of them representing non-synonymous base changes.
