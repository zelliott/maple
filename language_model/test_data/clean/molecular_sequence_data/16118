The DNA sequence family micropia consists of repeated DNA sequences that occur dispersed in the genome of Drosophila hydei. Members of this DNA sequence family were recovered from two recombinant DNA clone banks obtained by microdissection of the two Y chromosomal lampbrush loop threads and pseudonucleolus from primary spermatocyte nuclei. Nucleotide sequence analysis of two of the recombinant DNA clones revealed homology to the DNA region coding for a reverse transcriptase-like protein in retroviruses and retrotransposons. Homologous tissue-specific transcripts of a size of 1.2 x 10(3) base-pairs were found in testes. Transcript in-situ hybridization shows that at least parts of these transcripts are synthesized in these Y chromosomal lampbrush loops, which were originally used for microdissection. Also the cytoplasm of primary spermatocytes contains homologous RNA species. These observations are discussed in the context of lampbrush loop function and evolution.
