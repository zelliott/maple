Two novel G-protein-coupled receptors, one from human, GPR72, and one from mouse, GPR73 have been isolated, sequenced and their genomic organisation determined. Non-isotopic in situ hybridisation and radiation hybrid mapping have identified GPR72 to be localised on human chromosome 11q21.1, and GPR73 on human chromosome 2p14. Interspecific mouse backcross mapping has localised the genes to mouse chromosomes 9 and 6, respectively. Northern analysis reveals GPR72 mRNA expression only in brain tissue. However, GPR73 mRNA can be found in heart, skeletal muscle and pancreas. Both receptors are closely related with 36 and 33% overall amino acid identity, respectively, to the Y-receptor family. However, although successful cell surface expression in a heterologous expression system can be achieved no specific binding to this ligand family can be detected, indicating that perhaps additional factors are required for binding.
