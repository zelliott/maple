We isolated a membrane-bound metallopeptidase, DINE (damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase), by differential display PCR using rat normal and axotomized hypoglossal nuclei. The most marked properties of DINE were neuron-specific expression and a striking response to axonal injury in both the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. For instance, cranial and spinal nerve transection, ischemia, corpus callosum transection, and colchicine treatment increased DINE mRNA expression in the injured neurons, whereas kainate-induced hyperexcitation, immobilization, and osmotic stress failed to up-regulate DINE mRNA. Expression of DINE in COS cells partially inhibited C2-ceramide-induced apoptosis, probably because of the activation of antioxidant enzymes such as Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, Mn-superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase through the proteolytic activity of DINE. These data provide insight into the mechanism of how injured neurons protect themselves against neuronal death.
