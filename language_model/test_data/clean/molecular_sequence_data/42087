Two novel triterpenoidal saponins, called calliandra saponins A and E, were isolated from the branches of Calliandra anomala (Kunth) Macbr. On the basis of the chemical and physiocochemical evidence, their structures were defined as 3-O-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1-->2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl++ +-(1-->6)-2- acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl echinocystic acid 28-O-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->3)-[beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->3)-beta-D - xylopyranosyl-(1-->4)]-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2)-[(6S)-2-trans- 2,6-dimethyl-6-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-2,7-octadienoyl-(1-->6)]-bet a-D- glucopyranosyl) ester (4) and 3-O-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1-->2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl++ +-(1-->6)-2- acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl echinocystic acid 28-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->3)-[beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->3)-beta-D - xylopyranosyl-(1-->4)]-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2)-[(6'S)-2'-trans- 2',6'-dimethyl-6'-O-(2-O-(6S)-2-trans-2,6-dimethyl-6-hydroxy-2,7-octa dienoyl)- beta-D-xylopyranosyl-2',7'-octadienoyl-(1-->6)]-beta-D-glucopyr ano syl] ester (5), respectively.
