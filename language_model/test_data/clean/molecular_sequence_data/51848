The amino acid sequence of the bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, follitropin beta-subunit has been determined by sequencing the intact protein (residues 1-39) and peptides originated by lysyl endopeptidase and pepsin. Twelve cysteine residues and two sugar chain binding sites at Asn-5 and Asn-22 are positional identities with bullfrog and mammalian beta-subunits. The bullfrog FSH beta-subunit is composed of 107 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 11,782 Da, including the six cystine bridges and excepting the sugar chain. The bullfrog FSH beta-subunit has approximately 60% sequence identity with that of mammals and 40% with the fish gonadotropin beta-subunit. Conserved sequences among mammals (residue numbers 33-55 and 66-71) extensively differed from those of the bullfrog.
