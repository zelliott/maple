CD36, a multifunctional adhesion receptor e.g. for thrombospondin and collagen, as well as a scavenger receptor for oxidized low density lipoprotein, is expressed e.g. on platelets and monocytes. By this dual role it might be involved in early steps of atherosclerosis like the recruitment of monocytes and formation of foam cells. We therefore studied the effects of n-3 fatty acids on CD36 expression in human monocytic cells. Incorporation of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6n-3) into cellular phospholipids resulted in a significant reduction of CD36 expression at the mRNA and protein level, whereas arachidonic acid (AA, C20: 4n-6) and linoleic acid (LA, C18:2n-6) tended to increase CD36 expression compared to the control. This specific down-regulation of CD36 by n-3 fatty acids in cells involved in the initiation and progression of atherogenesis and inflammation, represents a further mechanism that may contribute to the beneficial effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in these disorders.
