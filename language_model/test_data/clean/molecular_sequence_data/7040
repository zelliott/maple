Two approaches have been used to elucidate the role of the nuclear polymerizing NAD+:protein(ADP-ribosyl)-transferase (ADPRT): i) comparison of the primary structure of Dictyostelium discoideum ADPRT derived from a 2 kb, partial cDNA sequence with the mammalian, fish, amphibian and insect counterparts revealed an overall homology of 25%. Whereas the automodification domain was not conserved at all, the NAD+ binding domain (aa 859-908) showed more than 70% identical amino acids in all species. Together with the similar enzymatic properties of the ADPRTs the genetic conservation underlined the notion that ADPRT plays a major role in various cellular processes; and ii) inactivation of the ADPRT gene in murine embryonic stem cells by homologous recombination led to mouse strains with a complete lack of nuclear poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. These ADPRT mutant mice were viable and fertile indicating that ADPRT is dispensable in mouse development. Moreover, repair of UV and MNNG induced DNA damage was not affected in ADPRT/3T3 like fibroblasts, as measured by reactivation of in vitro damaged reporter plasmids and unscheduled DNA synthesis. However, about 30% of the ADPRT mutant mice developed pathological skin aberrations on a mixed 129/Sv x C57B1/6 genetic background. These mice will be extremely useful to define the precise biological role of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation.
