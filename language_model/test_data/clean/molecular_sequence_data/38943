In Drosophila, the maternally expressed mei-41 and grp genes are required for successful execution of the nuclear division cycles of early embryogenesis. In fission yeast, genes encoding similar kinases (rad3 and chk1, respectively) are components of a cell cycle checkpoint that delays mitosis by inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1. We have identified mutations in a gene encoding a Cdk1 inhibitory kinase, Drosophila wee1 (Dwee1). Like mei-41 and grp, Dwee1 is zygotically dispensable but is required maternally for completing the embryonic nuclear cycles. The arrest phenotype of Dwee1 mutants, as well as genetic interactions between Dwee1, grp, and mei-41 mutations, suggest that Dwee1 is functioning in the same regulatory pathway as these genes. These findings imply that inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1 by Dwee1 is required for proper regulation of the early syncytial cycles of embryogenesis.
