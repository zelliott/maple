Cytidine diphosphate (CDP)-diacylglycerol synthase (cytidine triphosphate:phosphatidate cytihyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.41) catalyzes the formation of CDP-diacylglycerol, which is the precursor of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, and cardiolipin. We report the first cloning, to our knowledge, of two plant cDNAs, StCDS1 and AtCDS1, coding for CDP-diacylglycerol synthase from potato (Solanum tuberosum) and Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively. The two proteins belong to the eukaryotic type of CDP-diacylglycerol synthase and contain eight predicted transmembrane-spanning domains. We analyzed gene expression in shoot and root tissues of potato plants and demonstrated enzyme activity by expression of N-terminally truncated, recombinant StCDS1 in Escherichia coli.
