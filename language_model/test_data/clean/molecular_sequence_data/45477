Mutants of Kluyveromyces lactis denominated vga (vanadate glycosylation affected) bear various combinations of glycosylation and cell-wall defects. The vga3 mutation of K. lactis was mapped in the KlOCH1 gene, encoding the functional homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiaealpha1,6-mannosyltransferase. Quantitative analysis of cell-wall components indicated a noticeable increase of chitin and beta1,6-glucans and a severe decrease of mannoproteins in the mutant cells as compared with the wild-type counterparts. Fine-structure determination of the beta1,6-glucan polymer indicated that, in the vga3-1 strain, the beta1,6-glucans are shorter and have more branches than in the wild-type strain. This suggests that cell-wall remodelling changes take place in K. lactis in the presence of glycosylation defects. Moreover, the vga3 cells showed a significantly improved capability of secreting heterologous proteins. Such a capability, accompanied by the highly reduced N-glycosylation, may be of biotechnological interest, especially when hyper-glycosylation of recombinant products must be avoided.
