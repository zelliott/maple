Phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on two isolates of an unidentified Gram-positive, anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that was isolated from human faeces. The organisms were catalase-negative, produced acetic and butyric acids as end products of metabolism and possessed a DNA G+C content of approximately 54 mol%. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that the two isolates were related closely to each other and formed a hitherto unknown sublineage within the Clostridium leptum rRNA cluster of organisms. Based on phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium should be classified in a novel genus as Anaerotruncus colihominis gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Anaerotruncus colihominis is WAL 14565(T)=CCUG 45055(T)=CIP 107754(T).
