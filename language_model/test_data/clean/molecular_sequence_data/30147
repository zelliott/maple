Human splenin (hSP) was synthesized by assembling eight peptide fragments followed by deprotection with 1M trifluoromethanesulfonic acid-thioanisole (molar ratios, 1:1) in trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of m-cresol and dimethylselenium. Finally, the deprotected peptide was incubated with dithiothreitol to reduce sulfoxide on the methionine side chain. Incubation of peripheral lymphocytes isolated from uremic patients with the synthetic hSP showed an enhancing effect on the reduced B-lymphocytes, but had no restoring effect on the impaired blastogenic response of T-lymphocytes.
