Inhibition of mollicutes by synthetic oligonucleotides and their analogs complementary to specific "signature" regions of 16S rRNA and corresponding sequences of ribosomal operon DNA was studied. It was shown that antisignature oligonucleotides inhibited transcription in vitro for above 79% interacting specifically with ribosomal operon and non-specific with DNA-dependent RNA-polymerase. The inhibition efficiency depended on oligonucleotide sequence and type of modification. Translation in vitro was suppressed most efficiently (up to 60%) by oligonucleotides complementary to 3'-end region of 16S rRNA, also depending on their modification. Translation in vivo was inhibited most efficiently (up to 73%) by thiophosphate analogs of oligonucleotides complementary to sequences 499-507 and 523-532 of 16S rRNA responsible for binding of ribosomal "core" protein S4 starting the assembly of 30S ribosome subunit. With the simultaneous use of the last two oligonucleotides, the growth of mollicutes in SM IMV-72 medium rich in exogenous sources of nucleosides was suppressed for over 90%. It is supposed that under conditions where mollicutes have no free access to starting materials for their own synthesis of nucleic acid these nucleotides could suppress microorganisms completely. Antisignature oligonucleotides are considered as superspecific agents not leading to the development of resistance of mollicutes and believed to be the main future remedy against diseased caused by microorganisms lacking the system of nucleoside synthesis.
