The complete nucleotide sequences of two copies of a putative insertion sequence IS1000 from Thermus thermophilus HB8 are presented. IS1000 is 1196 base pairs long, contains a long open reading frame which could code for a protein of 317 amino acids, and has imperfect terminal inverted repeats of 6 base pairs (confirmed by the terminal sequencing of 4.5 copies of IS1000), but does not cause a target site duplication. There are at least 6 copies of IS1000 in the genome of T. thermophilus HB8. A search of the GEN-EMBL data base revealed that the putative 317 amino acid protein had significant homology with open reading frames in the transposable elements IS110 of Streptomyces coelicolor and IS492 of Pseudomonas atlantica.
