To examine the relationship between structure and function of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) in fish, we undertook molecular cloning and modulation of G6Pase expression by starvation and refeeding on diets with different nutrient composition in the liver of the carnivorous fish, Sparus aurata. A cDNA encoding the full-length G6Pase catalytic subunit from the liver of S. aurata was isolated. This cDNA encodes a 350-amino acid protein, with low homology to the mammalian G6Pase, although it contains most of the key residues required for catalysis. Based on hydrophobicity and membrane structure prediction, we propose a model containing nine-transmembrane regions for S. aurata G6Pase. Northern blots showed that refeeding after a prolonged starvation rapidly reverses the glucose/glucose-6-phosphate substrate cycle flux in the fish liver through decreased G6Pase expression and strong glucokinase (GK) induction. The effect of refeeding different diets on G6Pase and GK expression, indicated that hepatic intermediary metabolism of fish fed diets with low protein/high carbohydrate diets is impelled towards utilization of dietary carbohydrates, by means of modulation of GK mRNA levels rather than G6Pase expression. These findings challenge the role attributed to dysregulation of G6Pase or GK expression in the low ability of carnivorous fish to metabolise glucose.
