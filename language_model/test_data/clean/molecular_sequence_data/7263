We have isolated and characterized genomic and cDNA recombinant plasmids that encode the Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd) ribosomal protein L3 (rpL3). Genomic plasmids were identified using a probe derived from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae TCM1 gene, that encodes the yeast rpL3. The DdL3 gene contains two introns and encodes a protein 398 amino acids in length that shows a high degree of homology to the conserved rpL3 protein of both lower and higher eukaryotes. During development, both the pattern of accumulation of DdL3 mRNA and changes in its translational activity are identical to those observed for other r-protein mRNAs.
