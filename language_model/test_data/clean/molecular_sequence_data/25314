A cytosolic protein, able to facilitate intermembrane movements of phospholipids in vitro, has been purified to homogeneity from sunflower seedlings. This protein, which has the properties of a lipid-transfer protein (LTP), is also able to bind oleoyl-CoA, as shown by FPLC chromatography. This finding, in addition to previous observations suggesting that a lipid-transfer protein from spinach leaves can bind oleic acid and that oat seedlings contain a fatty acid-binding protein with similar features than lipid transfer proteins, provides a clear demonstration that plant cells contain bifunctional fatty acid/lipid transfer proteins. These proteins can play an active role in fatty acid metabolism which involves movements of oleyl-CoA between intracellular membranes.
