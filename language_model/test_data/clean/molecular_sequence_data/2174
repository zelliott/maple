The nucleotide sequence of a 3,162-base-pair (bp) segment of DNA containing the FNR-regulated fumB gene, which encodes the anaerobic class I fumarase (FUMB) of Escherichia coli, was determined. The structural gene was found to comprise 1,641 bp, 547 codons (excluding the initiation and termination codons), and the gene product had a predicted Mr of 59,956. The amino acid sequence of FUMB contained the same number of residues as did that of the aerobic class I fumarase (FUMA), and there were identical amino acids at all but 56 positions (89.8% identity). There was no significant similarity between the class I fumarases and the class II enzyme (FUMC) except in one region containing the following consensus: Gly-Ser-Xxx-Ile-Met-Xxx-Xxx-Lys-Xxx-Asn. Some of the 56 amino acid substitutions must be responsible for the functional preferences of the enzymes for malate dehydration (FUMB) and fumarate hydration (FUMA). Significant similarities between the cysteine-containing sequence of the class I fumarases (FUMA and FUMB) and the mammalian aconitases were detected, and this finding further supports the view that these enzymes are all members of a family of iron-containing hydrolyases. The nucleotide sequence of a 1,142-bp distal sequence of an unidentified gene (genF) located upstream of fumB was also defined and found to encode a product that is homologous to the product of another unidentified gene (genA), located downstream of the neighboring aspartase gene (aspA).
