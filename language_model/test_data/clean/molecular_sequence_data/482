The genes Tektin A1 and axonemal protein 66.0 were successfully Isolated and characterized in the tropical abalone Haliotis asinina. The full-length cDNAs of Ha-TekA1 and Ha-Axp66.0 were 2166 and 2038 bp long, with ORFs of 1350 and 1683 bp, respectively. Both Ha-TekA1 and Ha-Axp66.0 were expressed in the testes but not in the ovaries or hemocytes of H. asinina adults. In addition, HaAxp66.0 was not expressed in H. asinina juveniles (2, 3, and 5 months old). A tissue expression analysis showed Ha-Axp66.0 to be expressed specifically in the testes, whereas Ha-TekA1 was expressed abundantly in the testes but weakly in the foot, gill, digestive gland, left hypobranchial gland, and mantle. The relative expression levels of Ha-TekA1 and Ha-Axp66.0 were significantly lower in undeveloped testes (stage I) than in developed testes (stages II, III, and IV) of H. asinina (P < 0.05).
