Oxidatively induced DNA damage is implicated in disease, unless it is repaired by DNA repair. Defects in DNA repair capacity may be a risk factor for various disease processes. Thus, DNA repair proteins may be used as early detection and therapeutic biomarkers in cancer and other diseases. For this purpose, the measurement of the expression level of these proteins in vivo will be necessary. We applied liquid chromatography/isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the identification and quantification of DNA repair proteins human 8-hydroxyguanine-DNA glycosylase (hOGG1) and Escherichia coli formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg), which are involved in base-excision repair of oxidatively induced DNA damage. We overproduced and purified (15)N-labeled analogues of these proteins to be used as suitable internal standards to ensure the accuracy of quantification. Unlabeled and (15)N-labeled proteins were digested with trypsin and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Numerous tryptic peptides of both proteins were identified on the basis of their full-scan mass spectra. These peptides matched the theoretical peptide fragments expected from trypsin digestion and provided statistically significant protein scores that would unequivocally identify these proteins. We also recorded the product ion spectra of the tryptic peptides and defined the characteristic product ions. Mixtures of the analyte proteins and their (15)N-labeled analogues were analyzed by selected-reaction monitoring on the basis of product ions. The results obtained suggest that the methodology developed would be highly suitable for the positive identification and accurate quantification of DNA repair proteins in vivo as potential biomarkers for cancer and other diseases.
