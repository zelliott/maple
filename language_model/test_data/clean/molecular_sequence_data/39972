Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens is the most active bacterial species in the biohydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the rumen. It needs to remove the unsaturated bonds in order to detoxify the PUFA to enable the growth of the bacterium. Here, we investigated the response of cell membrane-associated proteins in B. fibrisolvens to growth in the presence of PUFA. Numerous changes were observed in the cell membrane-associated proteome. One of the main modifications occurring when the 18:2 fatty acids, linoleic acid and conjugated linoleic acid, were added, was an increased expression of the molecular chaperone GroEL.
