Physiological and biochemical studies have suggested that the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase controls many important aspects of plant physiology, including growth, development, nutrient transport, and stomata movements. We have started the genetic analysis of this enzyme by isolating both genomic and cDNA clones of an H+-ATPase gene from Arabidopsis thaliana. The cloned gene is interrupted by 15 introns, and there is partial conservation of exon boundaries with respect to animal (Na+/K+)- and Ca2+-ATPases. In general, the relationship between exons and the predicted secondary and transmembrane structure of different ATPases with phosphorylated intermediate support a somewhat degenerate correspondence between exons and structural modules. The predicted amino acid sequence of the plant H+-ATPase is more closely related to fungal and protozoan H+-ATPases than to bacterial K+-ATPases or to animal (Na+/K+)-, (H+/K+)-, and Ca2+-ATPases. There is evidence for the existence of at least three isoforms of the plant H+-ATPase gene. These results open the way for a molecular approach to the structure and function of the plant proton pump.
