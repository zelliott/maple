Here we describe ISHp609 of Helicobacter pylori, a new member of the IS605 mobile element family that is novel and contains two genes whose functions are unknown, jhp960 and jhp961, in addition to homologs of two other H. pylori insertion sequence (IS) element genes, orfA, which encodes a putative serine recombinase-transposase, and orfB, whose homologs in other species are also often annotated as genes that encode transposases. The complete four-gene element was found in 10 to 40% of strains obtained from Africa, India, Europe, and the Americas but in only 1% of East Asian strains. Sequence comparison of 10 representative ISHp609 elements revealed higher levels of DNA sequence matches (99%) than those seen in normal chromosomal genes (88 to 98%) or in other IS elements (95 to 97% for IS605, IS606, and IS607) from the same H. pylori populations. Sequence analysis suggested that ISHp609 can insert at many genomic sites with its left end preferentially next to TAT, with no target specificity for its right end, and without duplicating or deleting target sequences. A deleted form of ISHp609, containing just jhp960 and jhp961 and 37 bp of orfA, found in reference strain J99, was at the same chromosomal site in 15 to 40% of the strains from many geographic regions but again in only 1% of the East Asian strains. The abundance and sequence homogeneity of ISHp609 and of this nonmobile remnant suggested a recent bottleneck and then rapid spread in H. pylori populations, possibly selected by the contributions of the elements to bacterial fitness.
