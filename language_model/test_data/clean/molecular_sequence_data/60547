Previous studies have shown that a synthetic, unglycosylated analogue of the N-terminal peptide from link protein can function as a growth factor and up-regulate proteoglycan biosynthesis in explant cultures of normal human articular cartilage from a wide age range of subjects (McKenna et al., Arthritis Rheum. 41 (1998) 157-162). The present work further shows that link peptide increased proteoglycan synthesis by cartilage cultured in both the presence and absence of serum, suggesting that the mechanism of up-regulation may be different from that of insulin-like growth factors. The proteoglycans synthesised during stimulation with link peptide were of normal hydrodynamic size and the ratio of core protein to glycosaminoglycan side chains and the proportions of the large proteoglycan aggrecan to the small proteoglycans, decorin and biglycan, remained constant. Aggrecan molecules were equally capable of forming aggregates as those from control tissues and the relative proportions of decorin and biglycan were unchanged showing that both were co-ordinately up-regulated. These results confirmed that this novel peptide is a potent stimulator of proteoglycan synthesis by articular cartilage and showed that the newly synthesised proteoglycans were of normal composition.
