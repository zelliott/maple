To test the effects of disruption of a conserved cysteine in the green cone opsin molecule on light-activated isomerization, transducin activation, folding, transport, and protein half-life.

Stable cell lines were established by transfecting 293-EBNA cells with a plasmid containing wild-type or mutant (C203R, C203S, C126S, C126S/C203S) green opsin cDNA molecules. The proteins were induced by culturing the cells in the presence of cadmium chloride and analyzed by spectra, transducin activation, Western blotting, pulse-labeling with immunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemistry.

The C203R mutation disrupts the folding and half-life of the green opsin molecule and its abilities to absorb light at the appropriate wavelength and to activate transducin. Similar disruption of folding, half-life, and light activation occurs when Cys203 or its presumed partner for formation of a disulfide bond (Cys126) is replaced by serine residues.

Like rhodopsin, the folding of the cone opsins appears to be dependent on the formation of a disulfide bond between the third transmembrane helix and the second extracellular loop. Disruption of this disulfide bond represents a cause of color vision deficiencies that is unrelated to spectral shifts of the photopigment.
