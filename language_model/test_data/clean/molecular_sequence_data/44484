The large number (59) of alleles now known at the HLA-A locus is a serious challenge to the existing methods for HLA typing, including many of the DNA based methods. Here, we describe a sequencing-based typing (SBT) protocol for typing of HLA-A alleles using a single A-locus-specific PCR. This reaction amplifies an 824 base pair product from cDNA, prepared from mRNA, covering exons 1-3 and most of exon 4. This product allows identification of all possible combinations of two alleles from this locus. The sequencing strategy used for allele assignment contains several improvements compared to those previously published. The enzyme AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase, FS, used, combines high-quality sequencing, i.e. long reads, low background, and uniform peak heights making the identification of heterozygous positions very reliable in a fast and easy protocol developed by determining the optima for a number of variables. Thus, this strategy meets most of the requirements for the use of sequencing in HLA typing. Furthermore, this method is very flexible. The use of a PCR primer-pair tailed with the recognition sites for two different sequencing primers allows the application of the same sets of fluorescent-labelled sequencing primers regardless of the amplified locus. Thus, the protocol can very easily be extended to cover the B- and C-locus too, simply by adding PCR reactions specific for these loci to the protocol. Using this protocol, we investigated a total of 65 cell lines and clinical samples, many of the latter chosen from samples difficult to type by serology. Our method gave in all cases unambiguous results and proved functional for work requiring the highest resolution.
