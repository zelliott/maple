A bacterial strain which is able to degrade pyridine was previously isolated from the oxic zone of an oil shale column and described as Pimelobacter sp. strain OS4T. However, Pimelobacter species have been transferred to the genera Nocardioides and Terrabacter. Strain OS4T was identified as a member of the genus Nocardioides on the basis of chemotaxonomic analysis and phylogenetic inference based on 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence analysis. The G+C content of strain OS4T is 72.5 mol%. The cell wall peptidoglycan contains LL-diaminopimelic acid as the diamino acid. The predominant menaquinone is MK-8(H4). The cellular fatty acid profile of strain OS4T is similar to that of the genus Nocardioides. The 16S rDNA similarity of strain OS4T with previously described Nocardioides species is 94.5% +/- 0.7%, and a phylogenetic tree based on 16S rDNA sequences revealed a distinct lineage for strain OS4T within the evolutionary radiation enclosed by the genus Nocardioides. Therefore, on the basis of our data, we propose that strain OS4T should be placed in the genus Nocardioides as a member of a new species, Nocardioides pyridinolyticus. The type strain of the new species is strain OS4 (= KCTC 0074BP).
