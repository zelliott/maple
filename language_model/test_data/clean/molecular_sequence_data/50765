The sarcoplasmic reticulum of rabbit skeletal muscle contains a small "proteolipid," i.e., a protein which is soluble in acidic CHCl3/CH3OH. We propose the name sarcolipin for this small protein, to signify its lipid-like solubility and association with the sarcoplasmic reticulum. We have determined the following amino acid sequence for sarcolipin, using protein chemistry methods: M E R S T R E L C L N F T V V L I T V I L I W L L V R S Y Q Y. This 31-residue sequence includes a 19-residue hydrophobic segment which probably spans the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. The molecular weight calculated from the sequence, 3733, agrees with that measured by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, showing that sarcolipin contains no attached fatty acyl or other prosthetic groups.
