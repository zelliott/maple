qnrD, unlike other qnr genes, is mainly located on small nonconjugative plasmids. We investigated the presence of qnrD among 1,373 Enterobacteriaceae isolates in China. Twelve qnrD-positive strains were detected, and all were nonsusceptible to fluoroquinolones. The complete sequence of plasmids showed that the qnrD determinants were located on two plasmids with a respective size of ~4.2 and 2.7 k-bp. Interestingly, the identification of qnrD in this study revealed the highest prevalence of Proteeae among Enterobacteriaceae identified.
