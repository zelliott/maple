The cDNA coding for mouse IL-10 (mIL-10) was transduced into the parental cells of a spontaneous adenocarcinoma of BALB/c mice (TSA-pc), and clones secreting small, medium, and large quantities of IL-10 were selected. In vivo, both low and high producer clones do not display an enhanced ability to grow in H-2 and non-H-2 incompatible mice. Instead, the intensity of their rejection increases in function of the amount of mIL-10 released. After an initial growth period in syngeneic mice, high producer clones undergo complete rejection due to the combined action of CD8+ lymphocytes, NK cells, and neutrophils. After this rejection, mice are immune to a subsequent challenge with TSA-pc. This memory rests on a strong lytic activity of CD8+ CTL and granulocytes. Following the rejection, mice also develop anti-TSA Ab that guide the granulocytes in TSA-pc memory reaction. A direct comparison shows that although TSA clones engineered to release IL-2 activate CTL and no anti-TSA Ab, those engineered to release IL-4 activate a strong Ab response but not CTL. The kind of cytokine released by the tumors appears to determine the type of response. However, IL-10 high producer cells do not deviate the immune memory, neither toward a Th1 nor a Th2. Both the CTL activity and the Ab responses induced by IL-10 high producer cells are the strongest so far observed in the TSA system.
