In an attempt to investigate possible binding domains of the tumor necrosis factors (TNF), we have previously synthesized a cyclic hexapeptide corresponding to murine TNF-(127-132) (cTNF-1). In this report, we describe the synthesis and biological activity of another cyclic octapeptide corresponding to human TNF-alpha-(59-66) (cTNF-2). The design of these cyclic peptides is based on their high sequence homology with corresponding fragments of human TNF-alpha or TNF-beta. Similar to cTNF-1, the cyclic octapeptide cTNF-2 displayed low in vitro cytotoxicity against human HeLa and HEP-2 cell lines. The cyclic peptides cTNF-2 and cTNF-1 were then tested for the induction of interleukin-1 (IL-1) production from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocytes in vitro. At low concentrations, the IL-1 levels induced by these cyclic peptides were similar to that of recombinant TNF-alpha. However, the IL-1 production by cTNF-2 stimulation was dose-dependently increased and reached that of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 0.1 micrograms/mL) level. These findings suggest that the fragments corresponding to human TNF-alpha-(59-66) and murine TNF-(127-132) may represent certain binding domains of the tumor necrosis factors that elicit IL-1 production.
