A microbead-based ligase detection reaction (LDR) assay using a molecular beacon probe was developed for the facile and rapid detection of point mutations present in low copy numbers in a mixed population of wild-type DNA. Biotin-tagged ligation products generated in the LDR were captured on the surface of streptavidin-modified magnetic beads for purification and concentration. The resulting product-tethered microbeads were combined with a molecular beacon probe solution, and the suspension was directly flowed into a capillary. The microbeads were accumulated in a confined space within the capillary using a bar magnet. The packed bead sample was then scanned by a fluorescence scanning imager to detect the presence of any mutations. With the developed methodology, we were able to successfully detect one cancer mutation in a mixture of 400 wild-type templates (t test at 95% confidence level). Furthermore, the post-LDR processing, typically the most laborious and time-consuming step in LDR-based mutation detection assays, could be carried out much more rapidly (approximately 20 min). This was enabled by the simple bead and fluid manipulations involved in the present assay.
