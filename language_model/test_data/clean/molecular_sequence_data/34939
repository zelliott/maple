We have developed a simple method for preparing a tagged protein by PCR. With this method any protein sequence can be easily tagged. The techniques include three steps of DNA restriction, ligation and PCR. We could obtain a DNA construct containing SUMO-1 gene with His6 tag sequence with high efficiency by the next day.
