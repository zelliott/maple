We previously described the isolation of an FK506-binding protein, FKBP51, that is predominantly expressed in murine T cells and is capable of mediating drug-dependent calcineurin inhibition in vitro. In addition, the gene for FKBP51 is induced by glucocorticoids. Screening of a human thymus cDNA library resulted in the identification of the human homologue of FKBP51. Expression of the 3.7 kb mRNA corresponding to FKBP51 is induced by glucocorticoids in the human T cell line, C7TK.4. The 51.2 kDa protein encoded by this gene shares 87% identity to murine FKBP51 and demonstrates a similar IC50 value for the FK506-mediated inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase in vitro. The distribution and abundance of FKBP51 and FKBP12 in seventeen human tissues were compared by Western analysis. Unlike its murine counterpart, the human FKBP51 is abundantly expressed in numerous tissues and in many cases, is in molar excess over FKBP12.
