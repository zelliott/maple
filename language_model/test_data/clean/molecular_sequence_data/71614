Upon interleukin 1 (IL-1) stimulation, the IL-1-receptor (IL-1R)-associated kinase (IRAK) is rapidly recruited to the IL-1R complex and undergoes phosphorylation. Here we demonstrate that recombinant wild-type IRAK (IRAK-WT), but not a kinase-defective mutant with Asp340 replaced by an asparagine residue (IRAK-Asp340Asn), is highly phosphorylated and is capable of auto-phosphorylation in vitro. Overexpression of both IRAK-WT and IRAK-Asp340Asn caused activation of nuclear factor kappaB, suggesting that the kinase activity of IRAK is not required outside of the IL-1R complex.
