We have constructed 14 independent point mutations in the conserved AAUAAA element of the SV40 late polyadenylation signal in order to study the recognition and function of alternative polyadenylation signals. A variant RNA containing an AUUAAA was polyadenylated at 20% the level of wild-type substrate RNA, while all other derivatives tested were not functional in vitro. The AUUAAA variant RNA formed specific complexes in native polyacrylamide gels and crosslinked to the AAUAAA-specific 64kd polypeptide, but at a lower efficiency than wild-type substrate RNA.
