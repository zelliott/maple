A major outbreak of febrile syndrome occurred during 2002 among the Greek Army forces in Cyprus. Serological and molecular investigations revealed that the causative agent was a Sicilian-like phlebovirus. A virus strain was isolated from a blood sample taken on the first day of the disease. Phylogenetic analysis of partial L RNA segment sequences revealed that the strain from Cyprus differed from sandfly Sicilian virus by 6.7% at the nucleotide level.
