The effects of carbon and nitrogen source on the regulation of the vanadium chloroperoxidase secreted by the fungus Curnularia inaequalis were investigated. The addition of glucose showed a repressing effect on both the observed messenger RNA level and the measured enzyme activities, whereas the addition of glutamate as nitrogen source and the addition of both glutamate and glycerol had no effect. Addition of vanadate had no effect on the level of mRNA. Eight hundred base pairs of the upstream promoter region of vCPO were sequenced and various features of interest are highlighted. Closer inspection of the mycelium revealed that once secreted, vCPO probably remains tightly associated with the hyphae in two forms, one of which may be a proform of the enzyme. A possible cleavage event at the C-terminus may lower its potential for hyphal association and permit its disassociation into the growth medium. A putative role for the vanadium chloroperoxidase is put forward.
