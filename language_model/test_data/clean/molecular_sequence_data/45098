The amino acid sequence of actinoporin RTX-A (175 aa) from the sea anemone Radianthus macrodactylus was determined by sequencing of clones obtained via amplification of cDNA. It was established that RTX-A possessed high homology with HmgIII from Heteractis magnifica (87%) and StI, StII from Stichodactyla helianthus (84 and 87%, respectively). The analysis of structural and functional relationships within RTX-A was carried out. The some disagreement concerning to significant role of several amino acid residues for actinoporins exhibition of hemolytic activity was found.
