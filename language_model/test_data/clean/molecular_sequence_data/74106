Prohormone convertase 2 (PC2) requires interaction with the neuroendocrine protein 7B2 for the production of an activatable zymogen; the mechanism for this effect is unknown. 7B2 could act proactively to generate an activation-competent form of pro-PC2 during synthesis, or block spontaneous generation of activation-incompetent forms. We here demonstrate that addition of exogenous recombinant 7B2 to CHO cells expressing pro-PC2 prevented the unfolding and aggregation of secreted PC2 forms in a dose-dependent manner, as assessed by aggregation assays, activity assays, cross-linking experiments, and sucrose density gradients. Intracellular pro-PC2 was also found to exist in part as higher-order oligomers that were reduced in the presence of coexpressed 7B2. 7B2 addition did not result in the acquisition of enzymatic competence unless added before or very rapidly after pro-PC2 secretion, indicating that an activation-competent structure cannot be maintained in the absence of 7B2. Velocity sedimentation experiments showed that addition of extracellular 7B2 solubilized three different PC2 species from a precipitable aggregate: two activatable pro-PC2 species, the intact zymogen and a zymogen with a partially cleaved propeptide, and an inactive 66-kDa form. Our results suggest that 7B2 possesses chaperone activity that blocks partially unfolded pro-PC2 forms from losing catalytic competence and then aggregating. The loss of the catalytically competent conformer appears to represent the earliest indicator of pro-PC2 unfolding and is followed on a slower time scale by the appearance of aggregates. Because 7B2 expression is not confined to areas expressing pro-PC2, 7B2 may represent a general intracellular and extracellular secretory chaperone.
