The O-polysaccharide was isolated by mild acid hydrolysis of the lipopolysaccharide of Rahnella aquatilis 1-95 and studied by sugar and methylation analyses along with 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, including NOESY and 1H,13C HSQC experiments for linkage and sequence analysis. The following structure of the branched trisaccharide repeating unit of the O-polysaccharide was established: [carbohydrate structure: see text].
