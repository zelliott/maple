We report the nucleotide sequences of two fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) cDNAs, FGFR1 and FGFR3, from the newt species Notophthalmus viridescens. These two cDNA sequences and a previously published newt FGFR cDNA, FGFR2, were used to derive the amino acid sequences which were then compared with their homologues from other species. This comparison shows that the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain is highly conserved across the species examined with the second half of the domain slightly more conserved than the first half. The 3' portion of the carboxyl terminal tail is not very highly conserved. The comparison of the extracellular portion of FGFR2 shows a high degree of conservation among the Ig-like domains and a low degree of conservation in the region that links the third Ig-like domain with the transmembrane domain.
