This study aimed to investigate the inter-relation between the angiotensin II (ANG II) AT1 receptor and renin gene expression in rat kidneys. To this end, renin mRNA levels and mRNA levels for AT1a and AT1b were assayed by RNase protection in the kidneys of normal rats, in animals treated with the AT1 antagonist losartan and in rats bearing 0.2-mm left renal artery clips for 2 days. In normal rats, we found a negative correlation between renin mRNA levels and AT1a receptor mRNA levels. Losartan led to a fourfold increase in renin mRNA levels without changing AT1 receptor mRNA levels. Unilateral renal artery clipping increased renin mRNA levels fourfold in the clipped kidney and suppressed renin mRNA levels in the contralateral kidneys. AT1 receptor mRNA levels were not changed in the contralateral intact kidneys, but were significantly decreased by 15-25% in the clipped kidneys. Renin mRNA levels were inversely correlated to AT1a mRNA levels in the clipped, but not in the contralateral, kidneys. Our findings suggest that the systemic activity of the renin angiotensin system has no regulatory influence on renal AT1 receptor gene expression. Renin mRNA levels in normal and in clipped kidneys appear to be negatively determined by the level of AT1a receptor gene expression. Thus modulation of AT1a receptor gene expression could be a pathway for indirect modulation of renin gene expression by ANG II. This conclusion is in agreement with the observation that AT1 receptor antagonists are powerful stimulators of the renin system.
