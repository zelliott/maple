The purified casein kinase II (CK II) from Arabidopsis thaliana phosphorylates wheat elongation factor 1 beta (EF-1 beta), but not elongation factor 1 beta' (EF-1 beta'), which lacks a serine residue in the conserved phosphorylation site. Both EF-1 beta and beta' subunits, with similar functions, seem to undergo different regulation despite the partial amino acid sequence of EF-1 beta being similar to that of EF-1 beta'.
