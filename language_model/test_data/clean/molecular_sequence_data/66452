Monoclonal antibody (mAb) Tg786 against Toxoplasma gondii has been found to detect a 42-kDa rhoptry protein (ROP6) which showed protease activity and host cell binding characteristics after secretion. Using the mAb, a colony containing a 3o-UTR was probed in a T. gondii cDNA expression library. A full length cDNA sequence of the rhoptry protein was completed after 5o-RACE, which consisted of 1,908 bp with a 1,443 bp ORF. The deduced amino acid sequence of ROP6 consisted of a polypeptide of 480 amino acids without significant homology to any other known proteins. This sequence contains an amino terminal stop transfer sequence downstream of a short neutral sequence, hydrophilic middle sequence, and hydrophobic carboxy terminus. It is suggested that the ROP6 is inserted into the rhoptry membrane with both N- and C-termini.
