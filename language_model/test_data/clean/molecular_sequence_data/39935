A thermostable DNA polymerase I from a mesophilic Bacillus sphaericus strain C3-41 was characterized in this study. The polI was cloned, sequenced and over-expressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed 110 kDa fusion protein of PolI was stable at 70 degrees C for 1 h. Compared with DNA polymerase I of E. coli (TaKaRa), the relative polymerase activity of this PolI was 3.33 +/- 0.1 RFU microl(-1) at 37 degrees C using fluorescent quantitative analysis. It showed higher polymerase activity than E. coli PolI at higher temperature, with a relative activity of 3.75 +/- 0.1 RFU microl(-1) at 70 degrees C. The polI sequence analysis and the protein structure prediction indicated that this protein had a high similarly to other PolI from thermophilic micro-organisms. This information is of importance for future study for evolution of the house-keeping gene polI in entomopathogenic bacterium B. sphaericus.
