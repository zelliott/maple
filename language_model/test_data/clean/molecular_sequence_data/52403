A method is described for cloning large fragments (1.5 kb to 2 kb) of dengue virus cDNA from replicative-form viral RNA. Aedes albopictus cells (C6/36 clone) infected with dengue virus contain double-stranded, replicative-form RNA molecules which were used as a template for an initial reverse transcription using a primer containing sequence homologous to regions of the genome at or near the 3' end of the gene being studied. The product was then used as a template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using the same 3' primer and a second which hybridized to a region at the 5' end of the sequence to be cloned. Both primers were engineered to contain specific restriction enzyme cutting sites which enabled the PCR product to be cut and cloned directly into plasmids for sequencing and expression studies. We have used this method to construct clones of the envelope glycoprotein gene (E) and the non-structural genes 1 and 2a (NS1/2a) and 3 (NS3) of dengue type 2, Tonga 1974 strain, and E and NS1/2a from dengue type 3, H-87 strain, either as discrete genes or as constructs with long and short leader sequences, with or without anchor sequences. The method could be applied to the cloning of any gene from any flavivirus, directly from infected cell extracts, without the necessity for tedious virus purification steps.
