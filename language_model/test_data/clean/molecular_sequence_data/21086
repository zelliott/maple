Next-generation RNA sequence analysis of platelets from an individual with autosomal recessive gray platelet syndrome (GPS, MIM139090) detected abnormal transcript reads, including intron retention, mapping to NBEAL2 (encoding neurobeachin-like 2). Genomic DNA sequencing confirmed mutations in NBEAL2 as the genetic cause of GPS. NBEAL2 encodes a protein containing a BEACH domain that is predicted to be involved in vesicular trafficking and may be critical for the development of platelet Î±-granules.
