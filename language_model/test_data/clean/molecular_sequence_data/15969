A complementary DNA clone corresponding to the 70 kDa subunit of soluble guanylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.2) of rat lung has been isolated. The primary structure of the cDNA consisted of 3063 nucleotides including a 1857-nucleotide coding region for 619 amino acids, and the calculated molecular weight was 70476. Blot hybridization of total poly(A)+RNAs from rat tissues detected a mRNA of about 3.4 kilobases. The amount of mRNA was abundant in lung, cerebrum and cerebellum, moderate in heart and kidney, and low in liver and muscle. Southern blot analysis of high molecular weight genomic DNA from rat liver indicated the presence of one gene in the rat haploid genome. The amino acid sequence of the 70 kDa subunit has partial homology with particulate guanylate cyclase from sea-urchin sperm, and protein phosphatase inhibitor I.
