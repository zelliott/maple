The nucleotide sequence of the Xestia c-nigrum granulovirus (XcGV) genome was determined and found to comprise 178,733 bases with a G+C content of 40.7%. It contained 181 putative genes of 150 nucleotides or greater that showed minimal overlap. Eighty-four of these putative genes, which collectively accounted for 43% of the genome, are homologs of genes previously identified in the Autographa californica multinucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) genome. These homologs showed on average 33% amino acid sequence identity to those from AcMNPV. Several genes reported to have major roles in AcMNPV biology including ie-2, gp64, and egt were not found in the XcGV genome. However, open reading frames with homology to DNA ligase, two DNA helicases (one similar to a yeast mitochondrial helicase and the other to a putative AcMNPV helicase), and four enhancins (virus enhancing factors) were found. In addition, several ORFs are repeated; there are 7 genes related to AcMNPV orf2, 4 genes related to AcMNPV orf145/150, and a number of repeated genes unique to XcGV. Eight major repeated sequences (XcGV hrs) that are similar to sequences found in the Trichoplusia ni GV genome (TnGV) were found.
