In the cerebral ganglia of the central nervous system of the freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis many neuropeptides are proteolytically processed from larger prohormones at sites marked by both single and multiple basic amino acids. In the present study we identified cloned cDNA and PCR products corresponding to three putative endoproteases that may be involved in prohormone processing. The cDNA encodes a protein of 653 residues with an overall sequence identity of 60%, 41%, 35%, 40%, and 27% with the recently characterized endoproteases PC2, PC1/3, PC4, furin and Kex2, respectively. The Lymnaea preproconvertase has approximately 80% homology with the catalytic domain, and approximately 40% and approximately 50% with the N- and C-terminal part, respectively, of the vertebrate PC2. Two cloned PCR products, Lfur 1 and Lfur 2, show highest sequence identity to furin. Expression of the LPC2 gene is exclusively in the central nervous system, where two LPC2 transcripts of 3.0 and 4.8 kb were detected.
