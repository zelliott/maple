Nucleotide sequences of the isoepoxydon dehydrogenase gene (idh) for eight strains of Byssochlamys nivea were determined by constructing GenomeWalker libraries. A striking finding was that all eight strains of B. nivea examined had identical nucleotide sequences, including those of the two introns present. The length of intron 2 was nearly three times the size of introns in strains of Penicillium expansum and P. griseofulvum, but intron 1 was comparable in size to the number of nucleotides present in introns 1 and 2 of P. expansum and P. griseofulvum. A high degree of amino acid homology (88%) existed for the idh genes of the strains of B. nivea when compared with sequences of P. expansum and P. griseofulvum. There were many nucleotide differences present, but they did not affect the amino acid sequence because they were present in the third position. The identity of the B. nivea isolates was confirmed by sequencing the ITS/partial LSU (28 S) rDNA genes. Four B. nivea strains were analysed for production of patulin, a mycotoxin found primarily in apple juice and other fruit products. The B. nivea strains produced patulin in amounts comparable to P. expansum strains. Interest in the genus Byssochlamys is related to the ability of its ascospores to survive pasteurization and cause spoilage of heat-processed fruit products worldwide.
