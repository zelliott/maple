The subunit composition and primary structure of the proton-translocating F1F0 ATP synthase have been determined in Clostridium thermoaceticum. The isolated enzyme has a subunit composition identical to that of the F1F0 ATP synthase purified from Clostridium thermoautotrophicum (A. Das, D. M. Ivey, and L. G. Ljungdahl, J. Bacteriol. 179:1714-1720, 1997), both having six different polypeptides. The molecular masses of the six subunits were 60, 50, 32, 17, 19, and 8 kDa, and they were identified as alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, and c, respectively, based on their reactivity with antibodies against the F1 ATPase purified from C. thermoautotrophicum and by comparing their N-terminal amino acid sequences with that deduced from the cloned genes of the C. thermoaceticum atp operon. The subunits a and b found in many bacterial ATP synthases could not be detected either in the purified ATP synthase or crude membranes of C. thermoaceticum. The C. thermoaceticum atp operon contained nine genes arranged in the order atpI (i), atpB (a), atpE (c), atpF (b), atpH (delta), atpA (alpha), atpG (gamma), atpD (beta), and atpC (epsilon). The deduced protein sequences of the C. thermoaceticum ATP synthase subunits were comparable with those of the corresponding subunits from Escherichia coli, thermophilic Bacillus strain PS3, Rhodospirillum rubrum, spinach chloroplasts, and the cyanobacterium Synechococcus strain PCC 6716. The analysis of total RNA by Northern hybridization experiments reveals the presence of transcripts (mRNA) of the genes i, a, and b subunits not found in the isolated enzyme. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the atp genes reveals overlap of the structural genes for the i and a subunits and the presence of secondary structures (in the b gene) which could influence the posttranscriptional regulation of the corresponding genes.
