VHL tumor suppressor protein contains two domains, alpha and beta. The alpha-domain is involved in the formation of a large protein complex suggested to be involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. However, the role of the beta-domain, which may recognize the target proteins for protein degradation, remains unknown. Here we report that the beta-domain interacts directly with atypical PKC isotypes, PKCzeta and PKClambda. Further, the regulatory domain of aPKC is sufficient for this direct protein-protein interaction. Since aPKC isotypes have been implicated in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis, these results suggest that aPKC isotypes are potential direct target of the VHL beta-domain.
