Apoptotic signaling is mediated by homophilic interactions between conserved domains present in components of the death pathway. The death domain, death effector domain, and caspase recruitment domain (CARD) are examples of such interaction motifs. We have identified a novel mammalian CARD-containing adaptor molecule termed mE10 (mammalian E10). The N-terminal CARD of mE10 exhibits significant homology (47% identity and 64% similarity) to the CARD of a gene from Equine Herpesvirus type 2. The C-terminal region is unique. Overexpression of mE10 in MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells induces apoptosis. Mutational analysis indicates that CARD-mediated mE10 oligomerization is essential for killing activity. The C terminus of mE10 bound to the zymogen form of caspase-9 and promoted its processing to the active dimeric species. Taken together, these data suggest a model where autoproteolytic activation of pro-caspase-9 is mediated by mE10-induced oligomerization.
