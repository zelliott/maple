The virE operon of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens Ti plasmid pTiA6 encodes at least one trans-acting protein involved in the expression of virulence. Two open reading frames designated virE1 and virE2 code for polypeptides of 7 and 60 kilodaltons (kDa), respectively, that can be visualized after expression in Escherichia coli minicells. To determine which virE sequences are required for virulence, a strain deleted for the entire locus [strain KE1(pTiA6 delta E)] was constructed and tested for the ability to be complemented by subclones with and without site-directed mutations in the virE operon. One subclone containing only virE1 and virE2 as well as upstream promoter sequences was sufficient to restore full virulence on the host plant Kalanchoe daigremontiana. However, some other virulence locus representing a host range determinant appeared to be deleted from strain KE1(pTiA6 delta E), since virE1 and virE2 were not sufficient to fully restore virulence on wounded tomato plants. virE operon constructs with specific lesions in either virE1 or virE2 were impaired for complementation of pTiA6 delta E. Several mutations specific for the promoter-proximal virE1 locus appeared to have a polar effect on expression of the virE2-encoded 60-kDa protein. However, virE2::lacZ fusion constructs suggest that this effect is not at the level of transcription or translation. Collectively, these data indicate that both the 7- and the 60-kDa polypeptides are virulence determinants for the Ti plasmid pTiA6 and suggest that the 60-kDa protein may be less stable in the absence of the 7-kDa protein.
