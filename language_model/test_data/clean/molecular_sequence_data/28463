A detailed insight to the structure of a given major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide complex can strongly support and also improve the analysis of the peptide binding capabilities of the MHC molecule and the characterization of the developing T cell response. The number of MHC class II-peptide crystal structures is limited, therefore constructing and analyzing computer models can serve as efficient complementary tools when someone deals with experimentally determined binding and/or functional data. Commercial programs are available for modeling protein and protein-protein complexes, in general. However, more accurate results can be obtained if the parameters are directly optimized to a given complex, especially in the case of special proteins as MHC class II, an integral membrane protein, whose functional parts behave like regular globular proteins. Here, we present the optimization of an approach used for modeling MHC class II molecules complexed with various peptides fitting into the binding groove and several ways to analyze them with the help of experimental data.
