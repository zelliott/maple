The induction of the viral lytic cycle in latently Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected B cells is initiated by activation of the BZLF1 gene, whose expression is sufficient to disrupt EBV latency, suggesting that BZLF1 acts as the switch to change from a latent to a lytic replicative cycle. In the present studies, a series of deletion plasmids encompassing positions bp -552 to +12 of the BZLF1 promoter were constructed and tested for their response to anti-immunoglobulin (anti-Ig), an inducer of the viral lytic cycle, upon transfection into EBV-negative and -positive lymphoid cells. The promoter consisted of three functionally distinct regions. Region I (bp -552 to -221) had a negative influence on promoter activity; its deletion made the promoter highly responsive to anti-Ig. Region II (bp -203 to -177) was important for conferring responsiveness to anti-Ig. The response to anti-Ig did not require the presence of the EBV genome or EBV gene products. This sequence also enhanced expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene from the simian virus 40 promoter in response to anti-Ig, even when inserted downstream of the cat gene. Region III (-134 to -116) was a positive element that was transactivated by the BZLF1 gene product.
