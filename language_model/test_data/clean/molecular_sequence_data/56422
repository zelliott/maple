Mammalian spermiogenesis is characterized by chromatin condensation and replacement of the histones typical of somatic and earlier spermatogenic cells by protamines in the nucleus. However, a spermatid-specific H2b histone (ssH2b) that has an unusual carboxyl-terminus containing a region rich in hydrophobic amino acids is transcribed and translated in mouse round spermatids. The hydrophobicity of this region suggested that the protein may be localized at the nuclear envelope, the initial site of chromatin condensation during spermiogenesis. To identify ssH2b in the spermatid nucleus, an antiserum (anti-ss-H2b127-138) was generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the unique carboxyl-terminus of the protein. Immunocytochemistry of fixed, frozen testicular sections at both the light and electron microscopic levels indicated that ssH2b is present in nuclei of round spermatids. Moreover, the protein was not found to be preferentially associated with the nuclear envelope, indicating that it is not involved in chromatin-nuclear envelope interaction in the round spermatid. Rather, it appeared to be distributed uniformly throughout the nucleus with the exception of its exclusion from the nucleolus. In addition, the ssH2b protein was not found in mature sperm even when the chromatin was partially decondensed, suggesting that it is present and functions only during a restricted period of spermatogenic development.
