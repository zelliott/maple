Mesenterocin 52, a bacteriocin produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides FR52, was purified from producing cells by the adsorption-desorption method, combined with reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The elution profile revealed the presence of two inhibitory peaks of activity, each displaying different inhibitory spectra. Mesenterocin 52A possessed a broad inhibitory spectrum, including anti-Listeria activity, while Mesenterocin 52B was only active against Leuconostoc spp. The amino acid sequence and M(r) of Mesenterocin 52A appeared identical to the previously described Mesentericin Y105. In contrast, Mesenterocin 52B possessed a M(r) of 3446 Da, corresponding to 32 amino acids and a sequence that shared no homology with known bacteriocins: NH2-KGVLGWLSMASSALTGPQQPNSPWLAKIKNHK.
