The complete amino acid sequence of ovine miniplasminogen (M(r) 37,662, 343 residues) was determined with the aid of fragments obtained by cleavage with 2-(2-nitrophenylsulfenyl)-3-methyl-3'-bromoindolenine and clostripain. The fragments were aligned with overlapping sequences and sequence comparison with miniplasminogens of other species. Sequence comparison with other species (human, bovine, porcine, equine and canine) gave an overall identity of 63% and a similarity of 83%. The dendrogram of the alignment indicates that ovine miniplasminogen has the closest relationship with the bovine (87% identity) and the most distant with the equine (77% identity) species. The close relationship is indicative for the presence of the same structural and functional domains as in the other species. Sequence comparison of different miniplasminogens showed that positions 49 (Arg), 83 (Arg) and 161 (Ser) in the light chain of the plasmin molecule may play a role in the interaction between plasminogen and streptokinase.
