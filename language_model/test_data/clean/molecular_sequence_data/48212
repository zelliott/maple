We have previously demonstrated that phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) up-regulates H-ferritin gene expression in myeloid cells by stabilization of its message. In the present report, we showed that insertion of the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of H-ferritin mRNA at the 3'-end of luciferase coding sequence significantly reduced the stability of luciferase mRNA in human monocytic THP-1 cells. However, the half-life of the chimeric transcript was markedly prolonged after PMA treatment. A cytosolic protein factor from THP-1 cells was found to specifically bind to H-ferritin 3'-UTR. PMA treatment of THP-1 cells resulted in the reduction of the RNA binding activity in a time-dependent manner. Deletion analysis and RNase T1 mapping revealed a pyrimidine-rich sequence within the 3'-UTR which interacts with the protein factor. Competition experiments with homoribopolymers further demonstrated the importance of uridines for the binding activity. Point mutations in uridines of the pyrimidine-rich sequence reduced the protein binding to 3'-UTR, while increasing the stability of the chimeric luciferase transcript. Together, these results demonstrate that the pyrimidine-rich sequence in the 3'-UTR is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of H-ferritin gene expression in myeloid cells.
