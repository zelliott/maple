The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients suffering from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) display two unique polypeptide chains by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE). In the absence of a well-defined ante-mortem diagnostic test for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), spinal fluid samples of eight normal cows and eight cows known to carry BSE by post-mortem histological analysis were investigated to verify if equivalent polypeptides were present. Proteins with similar migration to human CJD polypeptides were not detected. But surprisingly, a cluster of polypeptide spots that was faint or not detected in normal bovine CSF samples was found to be elevated or massively increased in BSE CSF samples (more than 10-fold increase). These elevated polypeptide chains were identified as apolipoprotein E.
