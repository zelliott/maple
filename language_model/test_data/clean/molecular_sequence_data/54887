The fish pathogen Vibrio alginolyticus virulence factors and regulation mechanism are barely known except the quorum sensing regulated extracellular products. In the present study, the cleavable isotope-coded affinity tags (cICATs) were used to analyze the differentially expressed extracellular proteins of V. alginolyticus wild-type and a ΔluxO mutant, and a putative peptidase Pep was identified. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR confirmed that the transcription of pep was down-regulated by LuxO. Furthermore, western blotting demonstrated that the expression of Pep was cell-density dependent and quorum sensing regulated in V. alginolyticus. The pep in-frame mutant abolished the swimming and swarming motility, suggesting that it was involved in motility regulation in V. alginolyticus. In liquid medium, the polar flagellum was observed intact in ∆pep mutant while the chemotaxis related gene cheY, which is a response regulator causing change in direction of flagellar rotation, was down-regulated in ∆pep mutant. When ∆pep mutant was grown on hard agar plate, the lateral flagella disappeared and the transcriptions of flagellar biogenesis genes flaK, fliS, lafK, and lafA were down-regulated in ∆pep mutant. These results suggested that Pep was a luxO-regulated extracellular protein and involved in the motility of V. alginolyticus.
