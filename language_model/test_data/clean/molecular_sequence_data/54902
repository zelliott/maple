Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) is naturally distributed from Asia to Europe. It has been widely planted as an ornamental shrub and is rich in nutritional and medicinal compounds. Fungal pathogens that cause diseases such as dried-shrink disease are threats to the production of this plant. In this study, we isolated the dried-shrink disease pathogen from bark and total chitinase protein from leaves of infected plants. The results of the Oxford Cup experiment suggested that chitinase protein inhibited the growth of this pathogen. To improve pathogen resistance, we cloned chitinase Class I and III genes in H. rhamnoides, designated Hrchi1 and Hrchi3. The full-length cDNA of the open reading frame region of Hrchi1 contained 903 bp encoding 300 amino acids and Hrchi3 contained 894 bp encoding 297 amino acids. Active domain analysis, protein types, and secondary and 3D structures were predicted using online software.
