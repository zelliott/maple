The gene (sod) encoding the superoxide dismutase (SOD) of the obligately anaerobic bacterium Bacteroides gingivalis was cloned. The amino acid (aa) sequence of the SOD, deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the sod gene, basically resembled that of known Fe-SODs. However, the aa sequence of the B. gingivalis SOD was found to be intermediate between those of Fe-SOD and Mn-SOD in a limited region around the putative second ligand, where major differences between the aa sequences of Fe-SOD and Mn-SOD are known to exist.
