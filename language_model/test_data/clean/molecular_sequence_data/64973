We report on the nucleotide sequences of geminiviruses of the genus Bemogovirus infecting Sida micrantha Schr., a common weed in Brazil. For decades, the mosaic frequently associated with Sida plants was considered to be caused by a Brazilian strain of Abutilon mosaic virus (AbMV). By infection studies and sequence comparisons, we demonstrate that it is associated with a complex of at least two begomoviruses as different from AbMV as most South American geminiviruses. Two molecules of DNA A (A1, A2) and three of DNA B (B1, B2, B3) were cloned and sequenced. According to the high homology in their common regions, DNA A1 and DNA B3, as well as DNA A2 and DNA B2, are cognate components of two begomoviruses, which were infectious in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. No trans-replication was found for any other A/B combination. The intergenic region of DNA B2 appears to be the product of the recombination between DNA B1 and DNA A2. These results show that a coinfection of begomoviruses can persist over decades, producing a reservoir of partially recombined but distinct geminiviruses.
