The adult bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) has two major tetrameric hemoglobins, B and C, which share a common beta chain but have different alpha chains. Components B and C associate upon deoxygenation to form a complex of the form BC2, a trimer of tetramers that depends on contacts between the alpha B and alpha C chains. Nucleotide sequences of cDNA transcripts for these chains have been determined. Transcripts were identified by analysis of the amino acid compositions of the tryptic peptides of the components and by partial amino acid sequencing. These results, together with the amino acid sequence of the beta chain (Tam, L.-T., Gray, G. P., and Riggs, A. F. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 8290-8294), permit an analysis of the structures of the alpha 2 beta 2 tetramers of hemoglobins B and C. Molecular modeling suggests possible residues at the alpha B-alpha C interfaces in the BC2 trimer and additional alpha C-alpha C contacts that would form a closed ring of six alpha chain subunits that would further stabilize the BC2 trimer. Phylogenetic analysis of the alpha B sequence suggests that it may be a "tadpole" chain, the temporal expression of which has shifted from larva to adult.
