Stathmin is a M(r) 19,000 cytosolic protein proposed to act as a relay for signal-activating pathways regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. In a study of erythropoietic differentiation, stathmin was detected as a protein that is induced during the early stages of differentiation in several cellular model systems. The unphosphorylated form of stathmin was most prominently induced, which suggests that this form does not only play a role in pathways oriented toward cell proliferation, as is the case for lymphocytic systems, but may also play a role in various differentiation pathways.
