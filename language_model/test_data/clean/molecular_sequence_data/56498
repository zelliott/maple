Mouse genomic clones encoding the epithelin/granulin gene and its 5'- and 3'-flanking regions have been isolated and sequenced. This gene was found to be a single-copy gene, and contained 13 exons interrupted by 12 introns. Eight out of the 12 introns are classified as phase 0, and are located within the central part of each of the tandem repeats in the amino acid sequence of the epithelin/granulin precursor. The first intron is unique because of the interruption of the 5'-untranslated region and its fairly large size (approximately 2.4 kbp). Consensus sequences for several of the potential regulatory elements are present in the 5'-flanking sequence, including a common CCAAT sequence.
