Recent studies have suggested that protein kinase C (PKC) may be involved in the mechanism of signal transduction by which members of the interferon (IFN) family regulate gene expression and cell phenotype. We have investigated the role of PKC in the control of cell growth and gene expression by IFN alpha in Daudi cells. Treatment of these cells with two analogues of staurosporine, which are potent inhibitors of PKC, completely blocked the induction by IFN alpha of the mRNA for 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase and the 6-16 gene. These compounds also inhibited cell proliferation and thymidine incorporation in this system. In contrast, the protein kinase inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulphonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H7) did not significantly inhibit the induction of these genes by IFN alpha and had no effect on Daudi cell growth or thymidine incorporation in the presence or absence of IFN alpha. No effect of IFN alpha on total PKC activity could be observed, and there were no significant changes in the overall levels of individual PKC isoforms or their mRNA following IFN alpha treatment. In contrast, treatment of Daudi cells with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, which also inhibits cell proliferation, strongly down-regulated PKC. These data suggest that the activity of a PKC species, or a closely related enzyme, may be required both for continued cell proliferation and the response to IFN alpha in Daudi cells, but that IFN-induced growth inhibition does not involve overall down-regulation or change in activity of PKC.
