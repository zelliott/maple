The efficacy of synthetic immunoadjuvants and recombinant cytokines for the potentiation of host-resistance against virus infection was investigated using mouse models infected with Sendai virus and herpes simplex type 1 virus (HSV). The synthetic MDP derivative, MDP-Lys(L18), and recombinant cytokines, IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma, G-CSF and GM-CSF were shown to be effective for the stimulation of nonspecific protection against Sendai virus infection in mice. Both MDP-Lys(L18) and GM-CSF were effective for the protection against HSV infection in cyclophosphamide (CY)-treated mice. B30-MDP was suggested to be useful as an immunoadjuvant for the potentiation of antigenicity of recombinant or component vaccines.
