CYCLOIDEA-like genes belong to the TCP family of transcriptional regulators and have been shown to control different aspects of shoot development in various angiosperm lineages, including flower monosymmetry in asterids and axillary meristem growth in monocots. Genes related to the CYC gene from ANTIRRHINUM show independent duplications in both asterids and rosids. However, it remains unclear to what extent this affected the evolution of flower symmetry and shoot branching in these and other eudicot lineages. Here, we show that CYC-like genes have also undergone duplications in two related Ranunculales families, Fumariaceae and Papaveraceae s.str. These families exhibit morphological diversity in flower symmetry and inflorescence architecture that is potentially related to functions of CYC-like genes. We present sequences of 14 CYC-related genes covering 9 genera. Phylogenetic analyses indicate the presence of three clades of CYC-like genes. Shared motifs in the region between the TCP and R domains of CYC-like genes between Fumariaceae, Papaveraceae s.str., and AQUILEGIA (Ranunculaceae) indicate that the observed duplications originated from a single CYC gene present in all Ranunculales. RT-PCR expression data suggest that gene duplication and diversification in Fumariaceae and Papaveraceae s.str. was accompanied by divergence in expression patterns.
