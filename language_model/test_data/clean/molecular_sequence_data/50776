There are no simple, direct methods to reliably distinguish oncogenic serotype 1 Marek's disease viruses (MDVs) from their attenuated variants. The present study was an attempt to apply polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to develop a rapid and sensitive assay for the presence of the MDV genome. PCR oligos were chosen to flank the 132-base-pair tandem direct repeats in the serotype 1 MDV genome. The PCR reaction was specific for serotype 1 MDVs, amplifying fragments corresponding to one to three copies of the tandem repeats present in Md11/8, JM/102W, and GA viruses. A high-molecular-weight DNA smear was observed when the DNA from an attenuated Md11/100 was PCR-amplified. Use of the PCR technique allowed the detection of two copies of the 132-base-pair repeat in the DNA extracted from MDV-induced lymphomas removed from two chickens. No DNA was amplified from the DNA extracted from lymphomas induced by either an avian leukosis virus (RAV-1) or reticuloendotheliosis virus (chick syncytial virus).
