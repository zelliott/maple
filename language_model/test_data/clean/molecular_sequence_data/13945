Shortly after infection of two rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) either with a SIVmac32H challenge stock or with the same virus that had been passaged in another rhesus monkey for 11 months, SIV-envelope genes were cloned from their peripheral blood mononuclear cells and subsequently expressed by recombinant vaccinia viruses. The molecular weights and antigenicities of the thus produced envelope glycoproteins were largely identical to those of the native SIV. The envelope glycoprotein derived from the in vivo passaged virus proved to be poorly recognized by virus neutralizing monoclonal antibodies directed against one of the seven antigenic sites for which monoclonal antibodies were available. Immunization studies in rats showed that this protein was also less efficient in inducing antibodies against this antigenic site, and that it induced significantly lower levels of virus neutralizing antibodies than the other SIV-envelope glycoprotein. The immunogenicity of the SIV-envelope glycoprotein incorporated into immune stimulating complexes (iscoms) was compared to that of the same protein presented with Quil A or MDP-tsl.
