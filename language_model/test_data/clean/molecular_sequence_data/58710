Three laccase genes were isolated from the white-rot basidiomycete Trametes villosa (Tv). The predicted protein products have 63-71% identity to the previously cloned Tv laccase genes lcc1 and lcc2. The genes lcc3, lcc4 and lcc5 contain 12, 10 and 11 introns, respectively. The position of several of the introns is conserved among all 5 genes. The 5 genes appear to be differentially regulated, and message has only been detected for lcc1 and lcc2. The karyotype of Tv was determined by CHEF, and 8 bands ranging in size from approximately 5.7 to 2.2 Mb were resolved of which 2 appear to be doublets. The 5 laccase genes have been mapped to specific bands resolved by CHEF. The lcc1 and lcc2 genes hybridize to a band of approximately 5.7 Mb. The lcc4 and lcc5 genes are on a chromosome of approximately 3.7 Mb, and lcc3 is on a chromosome of approximately 2.8 Mb.
