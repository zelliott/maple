Trinucleotide repeat sequences have become of great interest due to their association with specific genetic disorders. Here we report the identification of a cDNA containing opa trinucleotide repeats from mouse testis, termed t-OPA. The opa repeat is contained within the longest open reading frame within the cDNA. Northern analysis demonstrated that four distinct t-OPA transcripts (1.6, 2.5, 3.6, 4.0 kilobases) are preferentially expressed in mouse and rat testis, with low expression in the pituitary, brain, and adrenal gland. Further, t-OPA RNAs were highly abundant in both pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids and decreased in cytoplasts. Polysome profile analysis indicated that t-OPA mRNAs are translated in mouse testis with efficiencies similar to other transcripts expressed in late meiotic/early post-meiotic spermatogenic cells. These findings thus suggest a role for cell-specific mRNAs containing opa repeats during mouse spermatogenesis.
