Phosphoinositides are key regulators of diverse cellular processes in eukaryotic cells. Genetic studies in yeast have advanced our understanding of how phosphoinositide-signaling pathways regulate membrane trafficking. Enzymes required for the synthesis (kinases) and turnover (phosphatases) of distinct phosphoinositides have been identified and several downstream effector molecules linked to phosphoinositide signaling have recently been characterized.
