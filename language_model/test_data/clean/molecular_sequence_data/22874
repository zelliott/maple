An unusual In0-like class 1 integron containing a common region that includes the putative recombinase gene named orf513 (CR1) and bla(CTX-M-2) was characterized from Escherichia coli. The integron contained an unusual gene cassette array, estX-aadA1, embedded between the 5'-conserved segment (5'-CS) and 3'-CS1 regions and was flanked by mer-Tn21 sequences downstream of the tni truncated module. This element constitutes one of the few examples of CR1-bearing class 1 integrons that has been fully characterized.
