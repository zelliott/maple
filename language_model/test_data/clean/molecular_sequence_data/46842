Human herpesvirus-8 K8.1 gene encodes for two immunogenic class I glycoproteins, K8.1A and B, originating from spliced messages [(1998) Virology 243, 208-217]. The 228-amino-acid-long K8.1A open reading frame (ORF) contains four N-glycosylation sites and the 167-amino-acid-long K8.1B ORF contains three N-glycosylation sites, sharing similar amino- and carboxyl-termini with ORF K8.1A but with an in-frame deletion [(1998) Virology 249, 140-149]. To characterize the K8.1A and B glycoproteins in the infected body cavity-based B cell lymphoma (BCBL-1) cells and in the virion envelopes, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) recognizing only K8.1A protein or both K8.1A and B proteins were generated. These antibodies reacted with the infected cell membranes and virion envelopes. Stable COS-1 transformant cells expressed the K8.1A and B proteins independently on the plasma membranes. MAbs recognized multiple proteins with molecular weights ranging from 23 to 72 kDa from the BCBL-1 cells and COS-1 cells and the 72 to 68 kDa molecular-weight proteins from the virion particles. The K8.1A is the predominant protein affinity purified from the infected BCBL-1 cells. Digestion with glycosidases show that these proteins contain both N- and O-linked sugars, suggesting that the multiple proteins recognized by the MAbs represent the precursor and product forms of K8.1A and B proteins, and the 72 to 68 kDa molecular-weight proteins represent the virion particle-associated mature forms of these glycoproteins.
