Accumulated findings have indicated that hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA integrates into the cellular DNA of HBV-infected chronic hepatitis tissues. The integrated sequence (IS) of HBV DNA at the virus-cell junction is conserved in a 25-bp region which is adjacent to direct repeat 1. A cellular protein which we purified from the nuclear extract of HepG2 cells binds to the IS and was designated IS binding protein 3 (ISBP3). The amino acid sequence of ISBP3 was determined and found to be identical to that of transcription initiation factor Yin and Yang 1 (YY1). An antibody against C-terminal amino acids of YY1 recognized ISBP3 in a Western blot analysis and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Furthermore, ISBP3 also interacted with Y3, which corresponds to the YY1 binding sequence, to enhance intramolecular recombination of polyomavirus DNA. Although YY1 is known as a transcription factor, the IS did not exhibit any effect on the transcription of precore and pregenome RNAs. The possible involvement of YY1 in the intramolecular recombination of linear replicative HBV DNA has been examined (Y. Hayashi et al., unpublished data). Data suggest that YY1 is involved in the joining reaction between HBV DNA and cellular DNA to form the virus-cell junction.
