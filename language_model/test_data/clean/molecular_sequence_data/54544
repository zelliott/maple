Recent studies on the mitochondrial genome have suggested that the duplications of tRNA and tandem repeats in the control region are important changes that are related to species diversity. This paper reports the study of mitogenomes from five Pampus (Perciformes, Stromateidae) species with very similar morphology. A duplicated tRNA(Met) gene in the tRNA-IQM region is present in Pampus sp. and P. punctatissimus. In the conserved sequence blocks of the control region, a duplicated CSB3 and promoter are found in Pampus sp. but are absent in P. minor. Moreover, a duplicated TAS is found in P. punctatissimus and P. chinensis. Based on the complete mitogenome sequence of Pampus sp., the first sequence reported from Stromateidae and the longest (17,694 bp) among the Perciformes mitogenomes, we conducted phylogenetic analysis to show that Stromateoidei and Scombroidei are more closely related to each other than to other Perciformes suborders. However, we reject the reciprocal monophyly of these two suborders.
