During the final step of the malignant progression to glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most frequent and malignant of primary brain tumors, more than 90% of the cases exhibit loss of genetic material on chromosome 10. We previously identified a 4-cM deletion interval in the 10q24-qter region that is common to all the GBM we have examined. A contig of 20 YACs spanning the 5 Mb of chromosomal DNA in the region has been assembled. Overlaps between YACs have been verified by STS content, fingerprinting analysis, and/or Alu-Alu PCR. The contig contains 17 known microsatellite markers, 15 new STSs derived from the insert ends of YACs, 9 ESTs, and 11 others STSs, for a total of 52 STSs (average marker density 1/100 kb). The physical map of this region will facilitate the search for a candidate tumor-suppressor gene(s) that is inactivated during the information of GBM.
