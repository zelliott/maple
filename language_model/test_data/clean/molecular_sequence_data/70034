Effect of synthetic nonapeptide (Thr-Cys-Ser-Val-Ser-Glu-Trp-Gly-Ile) representing the amino acid sequence 86-94 of human seminal plasma was studied on the ovarian follicular growth in the bullfrog R. tigrina during preparatory phase of reproductive cycle. Daily (except on Sundays) injections of 10 micrograms nonapeptide for one month caused a significant increase in ovarian weight and number of second growth phase (SGP) or vitellogenic oocytes. The results suggest that the nonapeptide is biologically active in amphibians also.
