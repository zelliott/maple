We compared allele sequences of two loci near the Arabidopsis lyrata self-incompatibility (S) loci with sequences of A. thaliana orthologs and found high numbers of shared polymorphisms, even excluding singletons and sites likely to be highly mutable. This suggests maintenance of entire S-haplotypes for long evolutionary times and extreme recombination suppression in the region.
