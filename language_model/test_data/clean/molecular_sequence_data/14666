To characterize the clinical features of a Chinese pedigree with Blau syndrome and to identify mutations in the NOD2/CARD15 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2/caspase recruitment domain family, member 15) gene.

Clinical features of this family were evaluated. Genomic DNA was obtained from blood samples, and all exons of NOD2/CARD15 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct DNA sequencing of PCR products was performed for mutations in NOD2/CARD15.

Granulomatous arthritis, uveitis, and skin granulomas were found in all affected members. Sequencing analysis demonstrated a heterozygous C>T mutation in exon 4 of NOD2/CARD15 in all patients of this pedigree, which resulted in an amino acid substitution at position 334 (p.R334W).

The R334W mutation in NOD2/CARD15 caused Blau syndrome in a Chinese pedigree. This is the first report of R334W mutation in NOD2/CARD15 in a Chinese pedigree of this disease.
