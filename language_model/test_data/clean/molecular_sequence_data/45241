A new microsporidium, Liebermannia patagonica n. gen., n. sp., is described from midgut and gastric caecum epithelial cells of Tristira magellanica, an apterous grasshopper species of southern Patagonia, Argentina. L.patagonica is diplokaryotic, apansporoblastic, homosporous, and polysporoblastic. Transitional (from merogony to sporogony) stages and sporonts of L. patagonica were surrounded by host rough endoplasmic reticulum. The ovocylindrical spores measured 2.9 +/- 0.09 x 1.2 +/- 0.04 microm (fresh, n = 50), and they had an isofilar polar filament of only three coils and a cluster of tubules instead of a classical posterior vacuole. Prevalence was high (up to 80.6%) at the type locality for the four years sampled . Maximum likelihood , neighbor joining, maximum parismony analyses of the small submit rDNA all placed L.patagonica(Accession No. DQ 239917) in one with Orthosomella operophterae.
