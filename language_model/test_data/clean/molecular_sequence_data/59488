Basal levels of expression of complement C4 vary in individuals but it is unknown whether this is due to gene copy number, protein clearance rates or differences in expression. To investigate whether differences in the promoter region may influence transcription of the C4 genes, we sequenced the promoter region of the C4B1 gene from the HLA-A1, B8, C4AQ0, C4B1, DR3 haplotype and compared this with an equivalent C4A3 region. The promoter regions of the C4 genes were highly conserved, indicating that transcriptional differences are unlikely. An unusual feature of the alignment was the higher level of polymorphism in the RP genes past the breakpoint of deletion/duplication in a region where the highest conservation would be expected.
