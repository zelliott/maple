So far, the role of fibroblasts in inflammatory processes has been underestimated. We have previously shown that stimulation of fibroblasts with viruses or bacteria results in a simultaneous production of several cytokines, including interferon-beta, interleukin (IL) 6 and colony-stimulating factors. We here report that virally infected fibroblasts produce also a chemotactic factor for granulocytes. The activity is inducible not only by measles virus but also by IL 1 beta and the double-stranded RNA poly(rI).poly(rC). This factor, when purified to homogeneity, occurs as a 6-7-kDa protein doublet upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The pure protein is serologically related to a fully characterized granulocyte chemotactic peptide (GCP) from monocytes, designated IL8. Furthermore, the chemotactic factor from fibroblasts has an NH2-terminal sequence identical to that of GCP/IL8, small differences in NH2-terminal processing being observed. Finally, in addition to diploid fibroblasts, the osteosarcoma MG-63 cell line is also a producer of GCP/IL8. It can thus be concluded that GCP/IL8 can be produced by several cell types in response to infection and that fibroblasts can contribute to chemotaxis in inflammation.
