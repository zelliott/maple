A Triticum durum cDNA library prepared from developing endosperm (22 days after flowering (DAF] was screened using synthetic oligonucleotide probes covering part of the CM3 and CM16 N-terminal protein sequences. A full-length cDNA clone (pTd78) encoding the CM16 protein (chloroform/methanol-soluble protein) was isolated and characterized. To our knowledge this is the first characterization of a clone coding for a wheat CM protein. The CM16 protein is synthesized as a preprotein with a signal peptide of 24 residues, the molecular weight of the mature protein being 13,438 Da. As other members of the cereal trypsin/alpha-amylase inhibitor family, the CM16 protein contains 10 cysteine residues, their position being well conserved. In developing endosperm the highest level of CM16 mRNA was detected at mid-maturation.
