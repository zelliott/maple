Mammalian phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) plays an important role in the regulation of various cellular, receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated processes, such as mitogenesis and transformation. PI 3-kinase is composed of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit of 85 kDa or 55 kDa. We have cloned a gene for a regulatory subunit from Drosophila melanogaster, named droPIK57, from head-specific cDNA libraries. The droPIK57 gene encodes a protein containing two SH2 domains with significant sequence homology to those in p85 and p55. Like the p55 subunits, DroPIK57 is missing the SH3 domain and the bcr homology region of the p85 subunit. The short N-terminus as well as the C-terminus of the DroPIK57 protein show no identity to the known PI 3-kinase subunits, suggesting that it is a new member in the family of regulatory subunits. In-situ hybridization and Northern blot analysis indicate a widespread function of this gene during embryogenesis and in the CNS.
