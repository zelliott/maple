The nucleotide sequences of the VP1-coding regions of several isolates of serotype C3 foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) were determined. The deduced amino acid sequences were compared with those of serotype C1 FMDV. The results provide evidence for two different lineages of FMDV C3 and document the potential for both long-term conservation and rapid evolution of FMDV.
