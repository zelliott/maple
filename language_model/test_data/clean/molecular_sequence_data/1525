Oral tolerance is an immunomodulatory mechanism used by gut tissues to induce systemic tolerance to ingested proteins. In models of disease, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, oral tolerance has been used to protect against paralysis induced by immunization with myelin proteins. Previous work in our laboratory has shown a role for the chemokine, CCL2, and its receptor in the induction of high dose oral tolerance. In the present study, we report that two CCR5 ligands, CCL4 and CCL5, are expressed in gut tissues after Ag feeding. CCR5(-/-) mice were unable to be tolerized by feeding a high dose of Ag and were not protected from developing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Moreover, CCR5(-/-) mice did not display cytokine deviation as normally seen after high dose oral Ag. Using a selective CCR5 antagonist, methionine-RANTES, CCL2 expression was inhibited, resulting in enhanced IL-12 production and the inability for mice treated with methionine-RANTES to become orally tolerized. This current study suggests that CCR5 ligands may function to modulate CCL2 levels in the gut after Ag feeding, promoting a cellular environment that favors tolerance rather than immunity.
