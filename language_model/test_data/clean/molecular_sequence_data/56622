O-4'-nor-2', 3'-dideoxy-2', 3'-didehydronucleoside 5'-triphosphates are shown to be effective termination substrates of DNA biosynthesis catalyzed by human placental DNA polymerases alpha and epsilon, rat liver DNA polymerase beta, reverse transcriptases of human immunodeficiency virus and avian myeloblastosis virus, and calf thymus terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. These compounds do not interact only with the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment). The probable reasons of interaction of acyclo-d4NTP with the DNA synthesizing complexes are discussed.
