In vivo function of the molecular chaperone Hsp90 is ATP-dependent and requires the full-length protein. Our earlier studies predicted a second C-terminal ATP-binding site in Hsp90. By applying direct biochemical approaches, we mapped two ATP-binding sites and unveiled the C-terminal ATP-binding site as the first example of a cryptic chaperone nucleotide-binding site, which is opened by occupancy of the N-terminal site. We identified an N-terminal gamma-phosphate-binding motif in the middle domain of Hsp90 similar to other GHKL family members. This motif is adjacent to the phosphate-binding region of the C-terminal ATP-binding site. Whereas novobiocin disrupts both C- and N-terminal nucleotide binding, we found a selective C-terminal nucleotide competitor, cisplatin, that strengthens the Hsp90-Hsp70 complex leaving the Hsp90-p23 complex intact. Cisplatin may provide a pharmacological tool to dissect C- and N-terminal nucleotide binding of Hsp90. A model is proposed on the interactions of the two nucleotide-binding domains and the charged region of Hsp90.
