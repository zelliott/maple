Encapsidation of the DNA of the virulent Bacillus subtilis phage SPP1 follows a processive unidirectional headful-mechanism and initiates at a unique genomic location (pac). We have cloned a fragment of SPP1 DNA containing the pac site flanked by reporter genes into the chromosome of B. subtilis. Infection of such cells with SPP1 led to highly efficient packaging, initiated at the inserted pac site, of chromosomal DNA. The directionality in the packaging of this DNA was the same as observed with vegetative phage DNA. Mutagenizing the chromosomal pac insert defined an 83 base pair segment containing the pac cleavage site which is sufficient to direct phage specific DNA encapsidation. The packaging recognition signal as defined can also be utilized by the SPP1 related phages 41c, SF6 and rho 15.
