The paper substantiates the point of view that the first step in the evolution of osmoregulation in vertebrates involved development of water-impermeable epithelium which depended on specific distribution of aquaporins in plasma membranes, secretion of autacoids, formation of water-impermeable cell contacts with a high electrical resistance. Migration of vertebrates to the land was associated with appearance of the ability to regulate osmotic permeability of epithelium in a number of organs involving vasotocin and other pituitary hormones, insertion of aquaporins into the luminal plasma membrane. Enhancement of the renal role in the water-salt balance, intensification of the kidney function was due to a rise in renal circulation, glomerular filtration rate, and tubular reabsorption which, despite the increase in the energy expenditure, provided for an obvious enhancement of the renal work efficiency in maintaining the constancy of the internal medium. Colonisation of desert regions became possible in birds and mammals due to development of the system of urine osmotic concentration. Unlike the accepted point of view that this depended on the appearance of Henle's loops, the statement is substantiated that the leading role in this process is played by differentiation of the kidney into the cortex and medulla, as at our Laboratory nephron loops similar to Henle's loop have been revealed in the lamprey. In the vertebrates, the evolution shifted from the polyorgan to mono-organ type of osmotic homeostasis maintenance, with the leading role of the kidney in maintaining physico-chemical constants of the internal medium fluids.
