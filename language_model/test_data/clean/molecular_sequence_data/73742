We report the cloning, sequence, and expression of the bpdS and bpdT genes from Rhodococcus sp. strain M5, which are believed to encode the first two-component signal transduction system in the genus Rhodococcus, which potentially regulates biphenyl/polychlorobiphenyl metabolism in M5. BpdT has a typical responses regulator sequence (209 amino acids; 23 kDa), whereas BpdS, the predicted histidine kinase component, is an unusually large transmembrane protein (1,576 amino acids; 170 kDa) that contains ATP-binding and leucine-rich repeat motifs and some conserved residues of protein kinases. Expression of bpdST, like that of the bpdC1C2BADE degradative operon, is inducible by biphenyl.
