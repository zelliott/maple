gamma-Cyclodextrin, maltosyl-alpha-cyclodextrin and diglucosyl-alpha-cyclodextrin were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. All of these compounds have the same molecular weight (M.W. = 1297.15) and consist of only D-glucopyranose. From a comparison of the intensities in the post-source decay (PSD) fragment spectra of these cyclodextrin derivatives, correlation between the chemical structures and the relative intensities in the PSD fragment ions was found. The correlation is considered to be caused by the difference in the number of cleavage sites at the glycosyl binding. It was found that the intensity of the PSD ion resulting from one cleavage is higher than that resulting from two cleavages at a glycosyl bond. The results show that PSD fragment-ion spectrum method used in MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is a very powerful technique for the structural analyses of the sugar-substituted cyclodextrins.
