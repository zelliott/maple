The self-incompatibility locus of Brassica consists of a coadapted gene complex that contains at least two genes required for the recognition and inhibition of pollen by the stigma when self-pollinated. Here, we report the identification of a third S locus-linked gene from the S2 haplotype of Brassica oleracea. This gene, which we designated SLA (for S Locus Anther), is a novel gene with an unusual structure. SLA is transcribed from two promoters to produce two complementary anther-specific transcripts, one spliced and the other unspliced, that accumulate in an antiparallel manner in developing microspores and anthers. The sequence of the spliced transcript showed the presence of two open reading frames that predict proteins of 10 and 7.5 kD. Neither transcript was produced in a self-compatible B. napus strain carrying an S2-like haplotype, indicating that the SLA gene in this strain is nonfunctional. Interestingly, sequences related to SLA were not detected in DNA or RNA from plants carrying S haplotypes other than S2. The haplotype specificity of SLA, its anther-specific expression, and its physical linkage to the S locus are properties expected for a gene that encodes a determinant of S2 specificity in pollen.
