Sequence analyses and comparison of the genes coding for the nonstructural (NS) and hemagglutinin (HA) proteins of different influenza B viruses isolated between 1940 and 1987 reveal that the number of substitutions is not always proportional to the time between isolates. Examination of 14 influenza B virus NS gene and 10 HA gene sequences by the maximum parsimony method suggested that--as with influenza C viruses--there are multiple evolutionary lineages which can coexist for considerable periods of time. Comparison of the sequence divergence among genes of viruses belonging to type A, B, and C virus suggests that, in man, influenza B viruses evolve slower than A viruses and faster than C viruses. We propose an evolutionary model for influenza B viruses that is intermediate between the pattern for human influenza A viruses and that for influenza C viruses.
