The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE) induces imaginal discs to form adult appendages in Drosophila. We have isolated a set of six ecdysone-responsive genes that apparently encode disc cell-surface or secreted proteins. Transcripts from one of these genes, IMP-E3, accumulate rapidly within 1-2 h in response to hormone. Developmentally, IMP-E3 transcripts reach maximum levels during the first stages of metamorphosis (white prepupae, WPP) and are primarily limited to imaginal tissues. Transcripts are also present during embryogenesis (0-3 h and 12-18 h). Two different-sized transcripts (1.2 and 1.4 kb) result from differential polyadenylation, with the larger transcript predominating in WPP. The conceptual IMP-E3 protein contains a signal peptide, an RGD sequence, and a potential glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. We speculate that the protein provides a transient cue important for imaginal disc morphogenesis.
