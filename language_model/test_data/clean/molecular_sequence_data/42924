According to known SSUrDNA sequences of Plasmodium vivax, correlated protozoa and human being, sequences of oligonucleotide primers were defined with computer programming. Specific SSUrDNA fragment of P. vivax, about 640 bp in length, was directly amplified by two temperature point polymerase chain reaction from extracted genomic DNA of two blood samples of vivax malaria patients from Yunnan Province. Using dideoxynucleotide terminator method, the sequences of amplified DNA fragments were determined separately and showed no difference between the two samples. However, comparison of the sequence reported by Waters AP and McCutchan TF (1989) and that of amplified fragment of Yunnan P. vivax isolates revealed the existence of nucleotide substitution and deletion which occurred respectively in the sites 269 and 630, and resulted in the change of restriction map.
