Glycoprotein II (GpII) is a heterogenous glycoprotein isolated from the membranes of bovine chromaffin granules in the adrenal medulla. When viewed by two-dimensional electrophoresis this glycoprotein consists of two components, upper (GpIIa) and lower (GpIIb), with a molecular mass of 80,000-100,000 daltons and a pI of 4.2-4.7. NH2-terminal sequence analysis of GpIIa and GpIIb revealed sequence similarity with lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (lamp-1 and lamp-2), which was supported by sequence data of peptides from trypsin and cyanogen bromide digestions. An oligonucleotide probe was used to isolate a cDNA clone encoding the nucleotide sequence of GpIIa. The predicted amino acid sequence of GpIIa shares a 72% identity with the human lamp-1 type protein, which belongs to a highly conserved group of lysosomal-associated membrane glycoproteins (lamp proteins), whose function is still unknown. The COOH-terminal region of GpIIa was identical to the COOH-terminal region of lamp proteins. This COOH-terminal determinant has been demonstrated to be essential for the intracellular targeting of lamp proteins to lysosomes. A synthetic peptide antisera to the COOH-terminal region of GpIIa was used to show that this region is present on purified chromaffin granules and not proteolytically processed. The sequence analysis of GpIIa and immunological data confirm GpII as the secretory granule counterpart of lamp proteins and raise some questions regarding intracellular targeting between lysosomes and secretory granules within the chromaffin cell.
