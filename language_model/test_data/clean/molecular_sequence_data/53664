A 15.2-kDa polypeptide, encoded by the nuclear gene PETO, was identified as a novel cytochrome b(6)f subunit in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The PETO gene product is a bona fide subunit, subunit V, of the cytochrome b(6)f complex, because (i) it copurifies with the other cytochrome b(6)f subunits in the early stages of the purification procedure, (ii) it is deficient in cytochrome b(6)f mutants accumulating little of the complex, and (iii) it colocalizes with cytochrome f, which migrates between stacked and unstacked membrane regions upon state transition. Sequence analysis and biochemical characterization of subunit V shows that it has a one transmembrane alpha-helix topology with two large hydrophilic domains extending on the stromal and lumenal side of the thylakoid membranes, with a lumenal location of the N terminus. Subunit V is reversibly phosphorylated upon state transition, a unique feature that, together with its topological organization, points to the possible role of subunit V in signal transduction during redox-controlled short term and long term adaptation of the photosynthetic apparatus in eukaryotes.
