Recombinant human soluble low affinity receptor for the Fc portion of IgE (sFc epsilon RII/sCD23) was produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Chinese hamster ovary cells and subjected to carbohydrate analysis. Applied methods included analytical SDS-PAGE, reversed phase HPLC, methylation analysis and sequential degradation with exoglycosidases. The results revealed that sFc epsilon RII derived from Chinese hamster ovary cells is glycosylated exclusively at Ser-147, containing mainly the trisaccharide Sia(alpha 2-3)Gal(beta 1-3)GalNAc, whereas the yeast derived glycoprotein was glycosylated at Ser-167 and contained only alpha-mannosyl residues. It is shown here for the first time that different amino acids of a given protein can be O-glycosylated when expressed in yeast or Chinese hamster ovary cells.
