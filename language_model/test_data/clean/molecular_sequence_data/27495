Congenital transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi was diagnosed in 2 triplets born to a triamniotic bichorionic delivery. Only the sisters sharing the placenta became infected, as diagnosed by microhematocrit and/or polymerase chain reaction of 3 parasite targets. The neonates' parasitologic response to benznidazole was monitored. Molecular strategies allowed genotyping lineage IId and identical minicircle signatures in both triplets, showing they harbored the same maternal parasite populations.
