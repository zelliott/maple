The major bcr-abl fusion gene is presently seen as the hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and presumably as the cause of its development. Accordingly, long-term disappearance of bcr-abl after intensive therapy is considered to be a probable cure of CML. The nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) provides a powerful tool for minimal residual CML detection. The RT-PCR was optimized by (1) increasing the amount of total RNA involved in the reverse transcription reaction to correspond to total RNA extracted from 10(8) cells, (2) using a specific abl primer in this reverse reaction, and (3) reamplifying 10% of the RT-PCR product in nested amplification. This optimized RT-PCR permitted us to detect up to 1 copy of RNA bcr-abl synthesised in vitro, mixed with yeast RNA in an equivalent quantity to 10(8) white blood cells (WBCs). Using this highly sensitive RT-PCR during the follow-up of CML patients, a signal was unexpectedly found in healthy controls. Therefore, a systematic study of the possible expression of bcr-abl RNA in the WBCs of healthy adults and children and in umbilical cord blood was undertaken. It showed the presence of bcr-abl transcript in the blood of 22 of 73 healthy adults and in the blood of 1 of 22 children but not in 22 samples of umbilical cord blood.
