A pectate lyase gene (pelY) from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis was cloned in Escherichia coli DH-5 alpha. The gene was expressed in either orientation in pUC plasmids, indicating that the insert DNA carried a Y. pseudotuberculosis promoter which functioned in E. coli. However, when cloned in the orientation which placed the coding region downstream of the vector lac promoter, expression of pelY was nine times higher than it was in the opposite orientation and the growth of E. coli cells was inhibited. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the pelY gene disclosed an open reading frame of 1,623 base pairs (PLY). The peptide sequence at the amino-terminal end of the protein contains a typical signal peptide sequence, consistent with the observation that the mature PLY protein accumulated largely in the periplasmic space of E. coli. The pI of PLY produced in E. coli cells was 4.5, and its activity was inhibited 90% or more by EDTA. The enzyme macerated cucumber tissue about 1,000 times less efficiently than did PLe from Erwinia chrysanthemi EC16. The pelY gene has no sequence similarity to the pel genes thus far sequenced from Erwinia spp.
