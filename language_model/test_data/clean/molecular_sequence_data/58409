We determined a 146 kb contiguous sequence at the 25 degrees-36 degrees region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome containing the amyE-srfA segment. Among the 113 ORFs identified, 33 are already known. functions were assigned to 38 ORFs by a search of non-redundant protein sequence data banks and those of 16 ORFs were suggested through significant similarity with reported sequences. The amino acid sequences of 13 of the ORfs were similar to proteins of unknown function of Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and other species. We did not find similarities for 29 ORFs to any known proteins. The 146 kb region is rich in enzymes (35 ORFs) related to the metabolism of low molecular mass compounds and five genes for surfactin production occupy about 26 kb of the region.
