In an effort to better understand functional recognition of structurally dissimilar ligands by a single TCR, a model system for studying cross-recognition of disparate peptide/class I complexes was developed using the murine (H-2b) CTL clone AHIII12.2, which is reactive to a human self-peptide (p1049) bound to an HLA-A2.1 molecule. We identified a second complex comprised of a synthetic peptide, designated p1058, bound to H-2Db that is recognized by clone AHIII12.2. In cytolysis assays, dose-response profiles for peptides p1049 and p1058 pulsed onto the appropriate target cells were comparable, suggesting that p1049/A2.1 and p1058/Db form functionally equivalent epitopes. To probe the interaction between each complex and the TCR of AHIII12.2, singly substituted analogues of each peptide were tested for their activity in lysis assays. Differences were observed between the two epitopes with respect to permissible residue substitutions at each peptide position from P3 to P8; marked differences were evident at P3 and at P8. The results obtained suggest that this TCR forms critical contacts with atoms at peptide positions P3 and P5 of p1049/A2.1 and at P5 and P8 of p1058/Db, and that TCR cross-recognition of these ligands is a function of both shared and complex-specific contacts made with each epitope. These findings further highlight the versatile reactivity that may be shown by a single TCR and suggest a basis for the recognition of peptide ligands sharing only a limited set of structural features.
