Somatic embryogenesis is a unique process in plant cells. For example, embryogenic cells (EC) of carrot (Daucus carota) maintained in a medium containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) regenerate whole plants via somatic embryogenesis after the depletion of 2,4-D. Although some genes such as C-ABI3 and C-LEC1 have been found to be involved in somatic embryogenesis, the critical molecular and cellular mechanisms for somatic embryogenesis are unknown. To characterize the early mechanism in the induction of somatic embryogenesis, we isolated genes expressed during the early stage of somatic embryogenesis after 2,4-D depletion. Subtractive hybridization screening and subsequent RNA gel blot analysis suggested a candidate gene, Carrot Early Somatic Embryogenesis 1 (C-ESE1). C-ESE1 encodes a protein that has agglutinin and S-locus-glycoprotein domains and its expression is highly specific to primordial cells of somatic embryo. Transgenic carrot cells with reduced expression of C-ESE1 had wide intercellular space and decreased polysaccharides on the cell surface and showed delayed development in somatic embryogenesis. The importance of cell-to-cell attachment in somatic embryogenesis is discussed.
