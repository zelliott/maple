The nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the cellulose-binding protein A (CBPA) of Eubacterium cellulosolvens 5 was determined. The gene consists of an open reading frame of 3453 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 1151 amino acids with a molecular mass of 126408 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of CBPA contained one domain highly similar to a catalytic domain of glycosyl hydrolases belonging to family 9, two linker-like domains and four domains of unknown function. Among the four domains of unknown function, the domains 1 and 2 region had significant homology in amino acid sequence with the cellulose-binding domains in the family 9 glycosyl hydrolases. The cloned gene was inserted into an expression vector, pBAD-TOPO, and expressed in Escherichia coli as a fused protein. The fused protein was detected by immunoblotting using antiserum against CBPA.
