When steroid hormone antagonists have inappropriate agonist effects, the clinical consequences are grave. Progesterone antagonists bind to two naturally occurring isoforms of human progesterone receptors (hPR), hPRB and the NH2-terminally truncated hPRA, and usually inhibit agonist-stimulated transcription. It is shown here that elevation of cAMP levels in a human breast cancer cell line leads to the functional reversal of progesterone antagonist action. While hPR occupied by the antagonists RU486 and ZK112993 are transcriptionally inactive, the antagonist-occupied receptors become strong activators of transcription in the presence of 8-Br-cAMP. However, this functional switch does not occur with the progesterone antagonist ZK98299, which, unlike RU486 and ZK112993, is unable to induce hPR binding to DNA. This suggests that the 8-Br-cAMP-induced transcriptional reversal requires that the antagonist-occupied receptors be bound to DNA. Even with agonist-occupied hPR, addition of 8-Br-cAMP results in a synergistic increase in transcriptional activity. When hPRA alone are transiently expressed in COS-1 cells, transcription of a reporter gene is stimulated by the agonist R5020 and by 8-Br-cAMP and is synergistic when both are present; but the 8-Br-cAMP-dependent component of transcription proceeds in the absence of hPRA, in the absence of the progesterone response element, and in the presence of a DNA-binding domain mutant of hPRA that cannot bind to the progesterone response element. Additionally, under the intracellular conditions in which 8-Br-cAMP activates antagonist-hPR complexes, there is no protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of the receptors. We discuss a model in which a gene that is independently transcribed by cAMP-responsive factors and by hPR can be selected for positive or negative regulation on the transcription complex due to additive or cooperative interactions between the two DNA-bound factors.
