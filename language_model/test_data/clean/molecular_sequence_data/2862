Tubulin genes in Trypanosoma rangeli, the only trypanosome besides T. cruzi to infect humans in America, are organized in homogeneous, alternate alpha and beta gene tandem repeats of 3.8 kb. The basic repeat was cloned, mapped and partially sequenced. In contrast to most other eukaryotes, where tubulin genes are scattered throughout the genome, trypanosomatids so far studied are characterized by tandem arrangements of these genes with the genus Trypanosoma displaying an alternating alpha- and beta-tubulin tandem repeat.
