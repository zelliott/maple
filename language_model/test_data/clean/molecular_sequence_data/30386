Escherichia coli expression, processing, and secretion of human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) fused to the signal peptide of E. coli OmpA or PhoA protein were studied. With fusion to either signal sequence, high-level expression was observed and the products accumulated to about 20% of total cell protein. In the fusion to OmpA leader sequence, more than 50% of the product has the OmpA signal peptide removed precisely. The majority of the processed material is not released by osmotic shock. On the other hand, very little of the material from the fusion to PhoA has the PhoA signal peptide removed. Use of the host with a mutation in prlA or prlF, variation of temperature for cell growth, and alteration of the amino acid residues around the cleavage site do not facilitate processing of the PhoA signal peptide. These results suggest that some component in the PhoA signal peptide, interacting with the Il-1 beta sequence, is interfering with the processing of the signal peptide.
