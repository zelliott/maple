Prevaccination genomic diversity of human papillomavirus genotype 11 (HPV 11) was established by sequencing 40% of the genome of 63 clinical isolates obtained from an ethnogeographically closed Caucasian cohort, and full-length genome sequencing of the ten most divergent isolates. In the study, which included the largest number of isolates to date, by analyzing pooled L1, LCR, E6, E5a, and E5b sequences (3,217 bp) of an individual isolate, a total of 23 genomic variants were identified, of which three (5 isolates) and twenty (58 isolates) corresponded to prototypic and non-prototypic variant groups, respectively. Several novel, potentially important mutations are described. Full-length genome sequences of ten isolates revealed more than 99% similarity to the HPV 11 prototype isolate. The minimum genomic distance between the full-length sequences of genomic variants and the prototype was 3 point mutations and 2 inserts and the maximum distance 31 point mutations, one insertion and one deletion. Within the ethnogeographically closed cohort investigated in this study, HPV 11 was shown to be less polymorphic in comparison to the majority of HPV genotypes studied to date.
