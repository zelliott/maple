Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic separation coupled to (structurally informative) spectroscopic methods like NMR and MS and an efficient bioassay have been used to determine the active compounds from a crude fraction of Bacopa monniera. The fraction containing a mixture of saponins with closely related structures was found to show a significant anthelmintic activity against Caenorhabditis elegans (used as a model test organism for determining anthelmintic activity). The activity was correlated to two dammarane type triterpenoidal saponins containing at least three sugar units. The optimization of separation for 1 mg of the crude sample on column and the sensitivity of on-flow one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments to the high-molecular-mass compounds (M(r) 890-930) has been demonstrated.
