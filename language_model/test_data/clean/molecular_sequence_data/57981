The human transferrin gene enhancer is organized in two domains. Domain A contains a single enhanson designated Ia. Domain B contains four enhansons named Ib, II, III and IV. We demonstrate here that the liver-enriched transcription factor HNF-3 alpha interacts with enhanson Ia and that enhansons Ib and IV are binding sites for members of the NF1 family. In addition, enhansons II and III seem to be respectively the targets for the AP4 protein and for EIII, a factor not yet completely identified. Analysis of mutated enhancer regions establishes that each enhanson is required for full enhancer activity and that the proteins binding to enhansons II, III and IV may interact within a multiprotein complex. This enhancer region presents no activity in the Sertoli cells of testis, where transferrin is also synthesized. We demonstrate that in Sertoli cells, the members of the HNF-3 family are not expressed; this fact may account for the inactivity of the enhancer in these cells.
