Sequences from the nuclear (nu) alcohol dehydrogenase gene, the nu 28S ribosomal RNA locus, and the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase II gene were used both individually and in combined analyses to infer the phylogeny of the subgenus Sophophora (Diptera: Drosophilidae). We used several optimality criteria, including maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, and minimum evolution, to analyze these partitions to test the monophyly of the subgenus Sophophora and its four largest species groups, melanogaster, obscura, saltans, and willistoni. Our results suggest that the melanogaster and obscura species groups are each monophyletic and form a closely related clade. The Neotropical clade, containing the saltans and willistoni species groups, is also recovered, as previous studies have suggested. While the saltans species group is strongly supported as monophyletic, the results of several analyses indicate that the willistoni species group may be paraphyletic with respect to the saltans species group.
