The objectives of this study were threefold: (i) assess immunogenicity of donor plasma proteins following hepatic xenotransplantation, (ii) identify potential immunogens, and (iii) consider the implications of antibody formation against these plasma proteins in xenograft survival. We studied liver and heart xenografts in a concordant combination, hamster to rat. All grafts were examined at necropsy for evidence of rat immunoglobulin G (IgG) deposition. Cardiac xenografts were placed in recipients who had, or had not, been sensitized with hamster serum. Hepatic xenografts were placed in naive recipients to see if antibodies to hamster serum proteins could be eluted from the rejecting organ. Sera of immunized rats were examined for the presence of anti-hamster antibodies by immunoelectrophoresis and by Western blotting following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) separation of hamster serum. Antibodies in sera of immunized rats were compared with those eluted from rejecting livers. Candidate antigens were identified by tandem mass spectrometry, sequence analysis, and reference to protein databases. Results showed that sera of immunized rats recognized a minimum of four different antigens in hamster serum by immunoelectrophoresis, and a minimum of seven by the more sensitive SDS-PAGE Western blot. IgG eluted from rejecting livers bound three of seven candidate antigens recognized by sera of the immunized animals. Sequence analysis searches revealed proteinase inhibitors in each of the three SDS-PAGE bands common to the above samples. All of these candidate proteinase inhibitor immunogens share a common catabolic fate, uptake via the lipoprotein-related protein (LRP/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor (CD91). Sensitization to hamster serum proteins hastened cardiac xenograft rejection in 30-50% of recipients (depending on sensitization protocol). Vascular deposition of rat IgG occurred in all rejecting xenografts. Antibody binding to proteinase inhibitors could disturb their functional activity and contribute to the pathogenesis of delayed xenograft rejection.
