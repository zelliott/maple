The separation of mixtures of primary and secondary cardiac glycosides by micellar electrokinetic capillary electrophoresis modified by cyclodextrins, urea and sodium cholate proved to be suitable for the determination of these hydrophobic compounds. It was possible to distinguish the two anomeric cardenolides glucodigifucoside and glucodigiglucomethyloside with all three buffer systems. Electropherograms of crude plant cell extracts from Digitalis lanata were obtained with this method.
