An adult male farmer with chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis despite previous circulating anti-HBs antibodies was studied. No markers of other hepatotropic viral infection were observed. HBV DNA was detected in serum by PCR and was characterized further by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequencing of cloned PCR products derived from the S gene. The HBV DNA was ascribed to genotype F, and single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) demonstrated the co-circulation of multiple quasispecies. Some of the variants exhibited changes located within the neutralizing "a" determinant, located between amino acids 124-147 of the S protein. Within this region, two clones showed either C124R or C124Y mutations. Other mutations were Q129R, C138R, C139R, and S140T (one clone each). Outside the "a" determinant several substitutions were documented. The high degree of the quasispecies variability was probably linked to the severity of the infection. Most members of the patient's family were infected with HBV, all with genotype F.
