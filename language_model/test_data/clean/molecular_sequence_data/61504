Regulation of the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II genes expression is an important field in immunology, because these molecules play a crucial role in the function of the immune system. HLA DQ genes expression is a complex phenomenon regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In this study, we have investigated the post-transcriptional mechanisms accounting for alleles-dependent length polymorphism of DQA1 mRNA. We have first sequenced the genomic DNA encoding the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of DQA1 *0101, *0102, *0103, *0201, *0301, *0401, and *0501 alleles. We have identified two competing splicing sites: a unique splicing donor site AG/GTA located 20 nucleotides downstream from the stop codon associated to two spliced acceptor sequences, approximately 165 and approximately 370 nucleotides downstream. In addition, three polyadenylation signals have been identified, respectively, at approximately 475, approximately 795, and approximately 855 nucleotides downstream from the stop codon. Subsequently, we have analyzed mRNAs derived from DQA1 alleles in homozygous B lymphoblastoid cell lines by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. We show that allele-dependent length polymorphism of DQA1 mRNA-3' UTR results from a combination of differential splicing and alternative polyadenylations. Four mRNA isoforms (two spliced variant cleaved at two distinct polyadenylation sites) were detected in DQA1 *0101, *0102, and *0103 homozygous cell lines, and six mRNA species (three spliced variant cleaved at two polyadenylation-sequence signal) were generated by the other four alleles. Possible advantages for cells to generate multiple transcripts previously undetected are discussed.
