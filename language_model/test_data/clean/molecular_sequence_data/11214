The human gene for the 10-kDa flavoprotein subunit of the mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I) was completely cloned and sequenced. The so-called NDUFV3 gene contains three exons, spanning 20 kb. The open reading frame contains a 34-codon import sequence and a 74-codon mature protein sequence. A database search revealed close homology to bovine and rat protein sequence but not to any other known protein. Northern blot analysis showed that the NDUFV3 gene is ubiquitously expressed. The NDUFV3 gene was assigned by FISH to a single location on chromosome 21q22.3 and might contribute to the Down syndrome phenotype.
