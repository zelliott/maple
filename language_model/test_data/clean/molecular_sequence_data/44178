The Rieske protein II (Schmidt et al., 1996, FEBS Lett. 388, 43-46) from the thermoacidophilic crenarcheon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (DSM 639) was expressed in E. coli cells. The full length protein was strictly bound to the E. coli membranes and could only be removed by detergent treatment indicating the presence of a membrane anchor. The iron sulfur cluster was correctly inserted into a fraction of the full length protein and much more effectively into a soluble form created by the deletion of the 45 N-terminal amino acids. The soluble form of the protein displayed the typical spectroscopic properties of a respiratory Rieske protein. The midpoint potential was +375 mV determined by CD redox potentiometry. The presented data demonstrate that the structure of the recombinant protein is very similar or identical to the authentic protein making this a powerful model system for the studies of Rieske proteins by site directed mutagenesis.
