Calpain-10 is a novel ubiquitous calpain family member that has been implicated as a susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes. One of the major challenges is that the function of calpain-10 is not yet known. To address this problem, we purified human calpain-10 from different sources, including the endogenous and the recombinant calpain-10 from HeLa S3 and 293F cells, respectively. Both endogenous and recombinant calpain-10 were present as two major forms with different origins. Interestingly, radiolabeled calpain-10 was found to be efficiently cleaved at the N-terminal region by calpain-2, but not by other proteases. None of these calpain-10 proteins have putative proteolytic activity under in vitro conditions when examined using different peptide substrates, including more than 70 in vitro translated, radiolabeled oligopeptides. Our results raise the possibility that calpain-10 may require a special intracellular localization or interacting partner(s) to acquire proteolytic activity, or it functions by interacting with other proteins rather than through its proteolytic activity.
