Amoebae and plasmodia constitute the two vegetative growth phases of the Myxomycete Physarum. In vitro and in vivo phosphorylation of actin in plasmodia is tightly controlled by fragmin P, a plasmodium-specific actin-binding protein that enables actin phosphorylation by the actin-fragmin kinase. We investigated whether amoebal actin is phosphorylated by this kinase, in spite of the lack of fragmin P. Strong actin phosphorylation was detected only following addition of recombinant actin-fragmin kinase to cell-free extracts of amoebae, suggesting that amoebae contain a protein with properties similar to plasmodial fragmin. We purified the complex between actin and this protein to homogeneity. Using an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated actin, we demonstrate that Thr203 in actin can be phosphorylated in this complex. A full-length amoebal fragmin cDNA was cloned and the deduced amino acid sequence shows 65% identity with plasmodial fragmin. However, the fragmins are encoded by different genes. Northern blots using RNA from a developing Physarum strain demonstrate that this fragmin isoform (fragmin A) is not expressed in plasmodia. In situ localization showed that fragmin A is present mainly underneath the plasma membrane. Our results indicate that Physarum amoebae express a fragmin P-like isoform which shares the property of binding actin and converting the latter into a substrate for the actin-fragmin kinase.
