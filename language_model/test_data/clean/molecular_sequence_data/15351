Three heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) cDNAs were isolated from the carmine spider mite, Tetranychus cinnabarinus. They were tentatively named as TCHsp70-1, TCHsp70-2 and TCHsp70-3. Structural analyses showed that all of the three TCHsp70 cDNAs held the full open reading frame (ORF). Putative protein sequences and a phylogenetic tree suggested that TCHsp70-1 and TCHsp70-3 were cytoplasm HSP70 and TCHsp70-2 was endoplasmic reticulum HSP70. Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences of TCHsp70-1 and TCHsp70-3 showed 84.78% identity, TCHsp70-1 and TCHsp70-2 showed 57.33% identity, TCHsp70-2 and TCHsp70-3 showed 58.26% identity. Real-time comparative quantitative PCR revealed that the relative expression of TCHsp70-2 was lower than TCHsp70-1 and TCHsp70-3 at each temperature tested. TCHsp70-1 and TCHsp70-3 shared a similar expression pattern after cold and heat shock compared with their expression at normal temperature (26 degrees C), but the mRNA expression of TCHsp70-1 was significantly higher and lower than that of TCHsp70-3 at cold and heat shock temperatures (except for 34 degrees C), respectively. This result possibly indicated the expression patterns of TCHsp70 were affected by their location in different cellular compartments. The results also indicated that three TCHsp70s, especially TCHsp70-1 and TCHsp70-3, may play an important role in mediating tolerance to cold, thermal stress for Tetranychus cinnabarinus.
