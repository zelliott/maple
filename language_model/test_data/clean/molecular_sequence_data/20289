Rhodnius prolixus is an ancient haematophagous hemipteran insect capable of mounting a powerful immune response. This response is transcriptionally regulated in part by transcription factors of the Rel/Nuclear Factor kappa B (Rel/NF-kappaB) family. We have cloned and characterized three members of this transcription factor family in this insect. Dorsal 1A is primarily expressed in early developmental stages. In contrast, dorsal 1B and 1C, both differentially spliced products of dorsal 1A, are expressed primarily in the adult fat body in response to septic injury, suggesting their exclusive role in immunity. Additionally, we identified putative kappaB binding sites in the 5' upstream regions of target genes known to be involved in the innate immune response of insects.
