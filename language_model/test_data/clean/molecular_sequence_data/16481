Currently used antiestrogenic drugs against hormone-dependent breast cancer, and estrogenic drugs used in treatment of osteoporosis, are associated with risk factors. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop selective estrogen receptor modulators with better tissue selectivity. In a recent study (Peptides, 2002, Vol. 3, 573-580), we used a monoclonal antibody to estradiol (mAb-E2) to screen a phage-display peptide library. We identified a 15-mer peptide (peptide H5) that recognizes mAb-E2 (IC(50) 1 microM) and estrogen receptor (ER)alpha (IC(50) 500 microM) but not ERbeta, and displays estrogen-like activity in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we designed and prepared peptides based on peptide H5, which possess improved estrogenic activity, by evaluating their binding to mAb-E2 and to ERs. Initially, we determined the minimal binding sequence of peptide H5 capable of binding mAb-E2 and ER. Subsequently, systematic single-residue replacements of the minimal sequence, followed by multiple-residue replacements, yielded hexa- and heptapeptides with increased affinities to mAb-E2 and to ER. The most promising peptides, VSWFFE (EMP-1) and VSWFFED (EMP-2) (EMP: estrogen-mimetic peptide), bind mAb-E2 with high affinity (IC(50) of 6 and 30 nM, respectively), recognize ERs with increased affinity (IC(50) of 100 microM for ERalpha, and 100-250 microM for ERbeta), and possess estrogenic activity in vivo. The short peptides described in this study may be used as potential lead compounds for developing new ER ligands.
