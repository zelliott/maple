Maturing citrus fruit undergo pigment changes which can be enhanced by exogenous ethylene. In order to identify genes induced by ethylene in citrus fruit peel, we cloned the gene c-thi1. mRNA corresponding to c-thi1 increased gradually in the peel during natural fruit maturation and in response to ethylene. GA3 pretreatment reduced the inductive effect of ethylene. Levels of c-thi1 increased also in juice sacs but the effect of ethylene was much less prominent. c-thi1 is homologous to yeast and plant genes encoding for an enzyme belonging to the pathway of thiamine biosynthesis. The data suggest that thiamine is involved in citrus fruit maturation.
