Routine typing of a potential bone marrow donor by sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOP) and sequence based typing (SBT) produced inconclusive subtyping results, suggesting a new allele. A magnetic bead-based method, haplotype specific extraction (HSE), was used to separate the diploid sample into its haploid components. The sample was then re-typed using standard SBT, revealing a new human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele, since named B*1576. HSE used in conjunction with standard SBT is a convenient and simple tool for resolving ambiguous and novel allele combinations without the need for amplification or subcloning.
