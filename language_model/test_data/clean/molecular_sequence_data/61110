Nisin is a 34-residue lantibiotic widely used as food preservative. Its mode of action on the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane is unclear. It should form ion channels but a molecular description of the interaction between nisin and phospholipids is lacking. The interactions between nisin and a membrane and the influence of phospholipids are here analysed by molecular modelling. The NMR structures of nisin in a micellar environment were previously determined (Van den Hooven et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 235 (1996) 382-393) Those structures were used to start with. They were refined by running a Monte Carlo procedure at a model lipid/water interface. It was shown that nisin is adsorbing onto the interface, with its N-terminal moiety more deeply inserted in lipids than the C-end, indicating distinct hydrophobic properties of the N- and C-domains. Therefore, we suggest that the N-terminal part is implied in the insertion of nisin in lipids, while the C-terminal moiety could be involved in the initial interaction with the membrane surface. Modelling the interaction of nisin with different neutral or anionic phospholipids shows that it disturbs the lipid organisation. The disturbance is maximal with phosphatidylglycerol. In this system, nisin curves the surface of phosphatidylglycerol layer round suggesting it could induce micelle formation. This could be a preliminary step to pore formation. It suggests that phosphatidylglycerol could have a direct action on nisin insertion and on ion channel formation. Appearance of a curvature also agrees with the 'wedge model' proposed in the literature for the nisin pore formation.
