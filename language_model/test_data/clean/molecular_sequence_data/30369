From cell extracts of the pseudomurein possessing methanogen Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum two putative pseudomurein precursors were isolated and characterized: (1) an undecaprenyl pyrophosphate activated disaccharide pentapeptide composed of N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetyltalosaminuronic acid, alanine, glutamic acid and lysine in a molar ratio of 1:1:2:2:1 and (2) the corresponding undecaprenyl pyrophosphate activated tetrapeptide lacking one alanine residue. The isolation of these precursors show that the biosynthesis of the eubacterial murein and the methanobacterial pseudomurein differs not only in the cytoplasmic step, as recently described, but also in the lipid stage.
