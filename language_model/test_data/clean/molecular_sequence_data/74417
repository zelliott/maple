Thioredoxin (Trx) proteins play important biological functions in cells by changing redox via thioldisulfide exchange. This system is especially widespread in plants. Through database search, we identified 30 potential Trx protein-encoding genes (OsTrx) in rice (Oryza sativa L.). An analysis of the complete set of OsTrx proteins is presented here, including chromosomal location, conserved motifs, domain duplication, and phylogenetic relationships. Our findings suggest that the expansion of the Trx gene family in rice, in large part, occurred due to gene duplication. A comprehensive expression profile of Trx genes family was investigated by analyzing the signal data of this family extracted from the whole genome microarray analysis of Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97, two indica parents, and their hybrid Shanyou 63, using 27 different tissues representing the entire life cycle of rice. Results revealed specific expression of some members at germination transition as well as the 3-leaf stage during the vegetative growth phase of rice. OsTrx genes were also found to be differentially up- or down-regulated in rice seedlings subjected to treatments of phytohormones and light/dark conditions. The expression levels of the OsTrx genes in the different tissues and under different treatments were also checked by RT-PCR analysis. The identification of OsTrx genes showing differential expression in specific tissues among different genotypes or in response to different environmental cues could provide a new avenue for functional analyses in rice.
