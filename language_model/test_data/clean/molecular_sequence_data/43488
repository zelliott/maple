Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) has been defined as a major target antigen in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). To identify the molecular ligands triggering a T cell response to GAD, a panel of human GAD65-specific T lymphocyte lines was generated from peripheral blood of three recent onset IDDM patients. All lines derived from a patient expressing the high-risk-conferring HLA-DR*0301/ *0401 haplotypes recognized a single epitope localized between amino acid positions 270 and 283 of GAD65, a stretch that is located in close proximity to the homology region shared with Coxsackie virus P2-C protein. All lines with this specificity were restricted to the DRA, B1*0401 product of the DR4 haplotype. Analysis of the GAD-specific T cell response in a second patient homozygous for DR4 haplotypes demonstrated that the same DRA, B1*0401 allele selected T cells specific for a different determinant. The T cell response profile in a third patient showed that DR*1501/ *1601-encoding haplotypes could present at least three different epitopes to GAD65-specific T lymphocytes. One of these epitopes was presented by a DR allele associated with the resistance-conferring DRB1*1501 haplotype. GAD-specific T cell lines could not be isolated from HLA class II-matched normal individuals. Our data reveal that (a) the T cell response to GAD65 is quite heterogenous in recent onset IDDM patients; (b) HLA-DR, not DQ, seems to be the principal restriction element used by T cells present at the onset of the disease; and (c) T cells responding to epitopes containing identical sequences to Coxsackie virus P2-C protein were not detected.
