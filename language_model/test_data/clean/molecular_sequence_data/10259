We describe a plant protoplast transformation method that provides transformants with a simple pattern of integration of a foreign gene. The approach is to deliver into plant protoplasts by direct gene transfer the Agrobacterium virulence genes virD1 and virD2 with or without virE2, together with a target plasmid containing a gene of interest flanked by Agrobacterium T-DNA border repeat sequences of 25 bp. We present evidence of T-DNA formation in maize protoplasts and its integration into the maize genome. The frequency of VirD1-VirD2-mediated integration events was about 20-35% of the total number of transformants. The addition of virE2 doubled the transformation efficiency. The method described here is of sufficient efficiency and simplicity to be useful for the production of transgenic plants with single-copy well-defined transgenic inserts.
