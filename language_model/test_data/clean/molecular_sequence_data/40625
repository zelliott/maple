Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is a bacterial pathogen that causes highly contagious respiratory infection in pigs and has a serious impact on the production economy and animal welfare. As clear differences in virulence between serotypes have been observed, the genetic basis should be investigated at the genomic level. Here, we present the draft genome sequences of the A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes 2 (strain 4226) and 6 (strain Femo).
