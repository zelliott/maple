The synthetic oligonucleotide probe (CAC)5/(GTG)5 for DNA, fingerprinting was studied in this paper. The incomplete pattern of DNA fingerprints was obtained from bloodstains up to three years old, which were kept at room temperature. The identical results were achieved from various human organ tissues of the same individual. DNA fingerprints from vaginal swabs was the same as that obtained from the male donor's blood. The discernible DNA fingerprints were obtained with as little as 250ng of genomic DNA. Besides, using restriction enzyme Hae III instead of Hinf I to digest human DNA, the highly polymorphic hybridization pattern was also obtained. A practical case was tested by Hinf I and Hae III digestion, respectively. The results demonstrated that the (CAC)5/(GTG)5 was a suitable probe for DNA fingerprinting in forensic practice.
