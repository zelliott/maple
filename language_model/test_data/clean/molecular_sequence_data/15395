Voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) are reported to be porin-type, beta-barrel diffusion pores. They are prominently localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane and are involved in metabolite exchange between the organelle and the cytosol. In this study, we have investigated a family of VDAC isoforms in Arabidopsis thaliana (AtVDAC). We have shown that the heterologous expression of AtVDAC proteins can functionally complement a yeast mutant lacking the endogenous mitochondrial VDAC gene. AtVDACs tagged with GFP were localized to mitochondria in both yeast and plant cells. We also looked at the response of AtVDACs to biotic and abiotic stresses and found that four AtVDAC transcripts were rapidly up-regulated in response to a bacterial pathogen.
