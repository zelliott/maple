Fasciclin I, a neuronal cell adhesion molecule, was first identified in the grasshopper. To date, various fasciclin I-like proteins have been identified but their biological functions have not been well characterized. Here, we have purified a fasciclin I-like protein with a molecular weight of 33kDa from sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus intermedius) ovaries using hydrophobic chromatography and gel filtration. The protein was not N-glycosylated. Partial amino acid sequences of cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-cleaved fragments were highly conserved to other sea urchin fasciclin I-like proteins identified previously. The circular dichroism (CD) spectrum analysis demonstrated that the 33kDa protein contained high content of alpha-helical structure. These results suggest that the 33kDa protein is a fasciclin I-like family. Additionally, the fasciclin I-like protein promoted HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell attachment. Further, a synthetic peptide (P1: GLREAANIAEQVDLRQVLRDVDL) of the protein corresponding to a highly conserved region of the fasciclin I-like family promoted heparin-dependent HT1080 cell attachment. Moreover, the peptide inhibited HT1080 cell attachment to the fasciclin I-like protein. These results suggest that the 33kDa protein from sea urchin ovaries isolated here is a member of the fasciclin I family and that the N-terminal region of the protein is important for cell attachment activity. The protein has a potential to be involved in biological functions in sea urchin as a cell adhesive molecule.
