In Peru, there is a lack of information on molecular analysis in pediatric human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. At present, the mother-to-child transmission rate is estimated at approximately 2-4%. The objective of this study was to assess the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in infected children. Children with suspected or confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis were evaluated at two public hospitals between 2002 and 2007. Whole blood samples were obtained from 90 HIV-positive children, who were confirmed to be positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. The specimens were subjected to envelope heteroduplex mobility assay (env HMA) followed by gag and pol gene region sequence analysis. Subtype B was found in 88 (98%) of 90 children and 2 (2%) children were subtype BF recombinants. This is the first report of recombinant HIV strains in HIV-infected children in Peru. Understanding the origin, diversity, and spread of HIV strains worldwide will be necessary for the development of an effective vaccine that targets pediatric populations throughout the world.
