Phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEAMT) is involved in choline biosynthesis in plants. The 5' untranslated region (UTR) of several PEAMT genes was found to contain an upstream open reading frame (uORF). We generated transgenic Arabidopsis calli that expressed a chimeric gene constructed by fusing the 5' UTR of the Arabidopsis PEAMT gene (AtNMT1) upstream of the beta-glucuronidase gene. The AtNMT1 uORF was found to be involved in declining levels of the chimeric gene mRNA and repression of downstream beta-glucuronidase gene translation in the calli when the cells were treated with choline. Further, we discuss the role of the uORF.
