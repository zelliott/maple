cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase (PDE) has been directly photolabeled with [32P]cGMP using UV light. Sequence analysis of peptide fragments obtained from partial proteolysis or cyanogen bromide cleavage indicate that two different domains are labeled. One site, on a Mr = 36,000 chymotryptic fragment located near the COOH terminus, has characteristics consistent with it being close to or part of the catalytic site of the enzyme. This peptide contains a region of sequence that is highly conserved in all mammalian cyclic nucleotide PDEs and has been postulated to contain the catalytic domain of the enzyme. The other site, on a Mr = 28,000 cyanogen bromide cleavage fragment located near the middle of the molecule, probably makes up part of the allosteric site of the molecule. Labeling of the enzyme is concentration dependent and Scatchard analysis of labeling yields a biphasic plot with apparent half labeling concentrations of about 1 and 30 microM consistent with two types of sites being labeled. Limited proteolysis of the PDE by chymotrypsin yields five prominent fragments that separate by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) at Mr = 60,000, 57,000, 36,000, 21,000, and 17,000. Both the Mr = 60,000 and 57,000 apparently have blocked NH2 termini suggesting that the Mr = 57,000 fragment is a subfragment of the Mr = 60,000 fragment. Primary sequence analysis indicates that both the Mr = 21,000 and 17,000 fragments are subfragments of the Mr = 36,000 fragment. Autoradiographs of photolabeled then partially proteolyzed enzyme show labeled bands at Mr = 60,000, 57,000, and 36,000. Addition of 5 microM cAMP prior to photolabeling eliminates photolabeling of the Mr = 36,000 fragment but not the Mr = 60,000 or 57,000 fragments. The labeled site not blocked by cAMP is also contained in a Mr = 28,000 cyanogen bromide fragment of the enzyme that does not overlap with the Mr = 36,000 proteolytic fragment. Limited chymotryptic proteolysis also increases basal activity and eliminates cGMP stimulation of cAMP hydrolysis. The chymotryptic fragments can be separated by either ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or solid-phase monoclonal antibody treatment. A solid-phase monoclonal antibody against the cGMP-stimulated PDE removes the Mr = 60,000 and 57,000 labeled fragments and any intact, unproteolyzed protein but does not remove the Mr = 36,000 fragment or the majority of activity. Ion exchange HPLC separates the fragments into three peaks (I, II, and III). Peaks I and II contain activity of approximately 40 and 100 units/mg, respectively. Peak II is the undigested or slightly nicked native enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
