Blood samples collected from wild deer in Missouri in November of 2000 and 2001 were positive by PCR assays for Ehrlichia chaffeensis (50 of 217; 23%), Ehrlichia ewingii (44 of 217; 20%), and Anaplasma species (214 of 217; 99%). Nucleotide sequences of selected amplicons from the assay for anaplasma matched sequences of the white-tailed deer agent. Serologic analysis of 112 deer sampled in 2000 showed a very high prevalence of antibodies to E. chaffeensis (97 of 112; 87%) and a low prevalence of antibodies reactive with Anaplasma phagocytophila (2 of 112; 2%).
