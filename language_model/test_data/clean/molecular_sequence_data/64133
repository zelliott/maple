Molecular characterisation of Cryptosporidium oocysts isolated from faeces collected from eastern grey kangaroos Macropus giganteus inhabiting an Australian water catchment revealed that this host was susceptible to three types of Cryptosporidium. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 18S rDNA, Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) and a 70kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) identified an isolate identical to the described Cryptosporidium 'marsupial' genotype. A second isolate had less than 0.5% variation, compared to the described Cryptosporidium 'marsupial' genotype, within the sequences of the 18S rDNA, COWP and HSP70 and 10% variation in the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1). Multilocus analysis of the third Cryptosporidium revealed a novel genotype that had a degree of genetic variation, at the four loci characterised, which was greater than or equivalent to that used to discriminate between currently recognised Cryptosporidium species. These findings have increased our current understanding on the molecular epidemiology of Cryptosporidium in Australian wildlife and have provided information on the types of Cryptosporidium marsupials may shed into the environment.
