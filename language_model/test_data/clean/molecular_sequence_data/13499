As tubeimoside I isolated from Bolbostemma paniculatum (Maxim.) Franquet (Cucurbitaceae) has been shown to suppress tumor promoter effects, tubeimoside III from the same plant was tested in vitro and in vivo against the action of the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Tubeimoside III, the natural analog of tubeimoside I, also had an anti-inflammatory effect on mouse ear edema induced by arachidonic acid and TPA and a potent anti-tumor promoting effect on two-stage carcinogenesis of mouse skin after topical application. However, the important difference in bioactivities between tubeimosides I and III is the non-activity of tubeimoside III as an inhibitor of tumor promotion if administered orally. Differences in metabolism connected with different routes of the compound may be one of a number of explanations of the important difference.
