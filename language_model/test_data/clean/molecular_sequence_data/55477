The evidence for the existence of receptor heteromers opens up a new field for a better understanding of neural transmission. Based on our theory, we have discovered main triplets of amino acid residues in cell-adhesion receptors of marine sponges, which appear also as homologies in several dopamine D2 receptor heteromers of human brain. The obtained results probably mean a general molecular mechanism for receptor-receptor interactions in heteromers originated from the lowest animals (marine sponges).
