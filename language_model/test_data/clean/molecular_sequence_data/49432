Although tyrosine kinases are critically involved in the angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 (AT1) receptor signaling, how AT1 receptors activate tyrosine kinases is not fully understood. We examined the structural requirements of the AT1 receptor for transactivation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR). Studies using carboxyl terminal-truncated AT1 receptors indicated that the amino acid sequence between 312 and 337 is required for activation of EGFR. The role of the conserved YIPP motif in this sequence in transactivation of EGFR was investigated by mutating tyrosine 319. Ang II failed to activate EGFR in cells expressing AT1-Y319F, whereas EGFR was activated even without Ang II in cells expressing AT1-Y319E, which mimics the AT1 receptor phosphorylated at Tyr-319. Immunoblot analyses using anti-phospho Tyr-319-specific antibody showed that Ang II increased phosphorylation of Tyr-319. EGFR interacted with the AT1 receptor but not with AT1-Y319F in response to Ang II stimulation, whereas the EGFR-AT1 receptor interaction was inhibited in the presence of dominant negative SHP-2. The requirement of Tyr-319 seems specific for EGFR because Ang II-induced activation of other tyrosine kinases, including Src and JAK2, was preserved in cells expressing AT1-Y319F. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation was also maintained in AT1-Y319F through activation of Src. Overexpression of wild type AT1 receptor in cardiac fibroblasts enhanced Ang II-induced proliferation. By contrast, overexpression of AT1-Y319F failed to enhance cell proliferation. In summary, Tyr-319 of the AT1 receptor is phosphorylated in response to Ang II and plays a key role in mediating Ang II-induced transactivation of EGFR and cell proliferation, possibly through its interaction with SHP-2 and EGFR.
