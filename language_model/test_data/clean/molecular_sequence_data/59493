In rice suspension culture, a large part (about 90% of total activity in the culture) of the chitinase activity was found in the medium. Two extracellular chitinases (which we named RCH-A and -B) were separated from the cell suspension by DEAE-cellulofine column chromatography. When cells were treated with N-acetylchitooligosaccharides (chitin oligosaccharides) for 3 days, extracellular chitinase activity increased about 3-fold over the control culture. After the treatment, another extracellular chitinase (named RCH-C) appeared in addition to increases in the levels of RCH-A and -B. Partial amino acid sequences of these enzymes indicated that RCH-A (33.5 kDa) and -B (34 kDa) were class Ib chitinases but RCH-C (27 kDa) was a class III chitinase. RCH-A and -B were capable of actively degrading water-insoluble chitin with high affinities, while RCH-C had less affinity for the substrate. However, when a water-soluble chitin derivative, 6-O-hydroxyethylchitin (glycolchitin) was used, RCH-C as well as RCH-A and -B degraded actively with a high affinity. A synergistic effect was observed when these three chitinases acted simultaneously in the hydrolysis of chitin.
