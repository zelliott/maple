A Gram-staining-negative, rod-shaped and non-motile bacterium, designated CL-SS4T, was isolated from crude-oil-contaminated seawater from the west coast of Korea and was investigated by means of a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Strain CL-SS4T grew optimally at 25-30 degrees C, at pH 6.8-7.7 and in the presence of 2-3% sea salts. The major fatty acids were iso-C17:0 3-OH, iso-C15:0 and iso-C15:1 G. The major isoprenoid quinone was MK-6. The DNA G+C content was 50.7 mol%. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain CL-SS4T revealed that it was a member of the genus Muricauda, sharing 95.7-96.9% sequence similarity with the type strains of Muricauda species and being most closely related to Muricauda aquimarina SW-63T. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences confirmed that strain CL-SS4T formed a deep lineage related to the genus Muricauda. Strain CL-SS4T was distinguishable from recognized Muricauda species on the basis of differential phenotypic characteristics and DNA G+C content. Based on these results, it is proposed that strain CL-SS4T represents a novel species of the genus Muricauda, for which the name Muricauda olearia sp. nov. is proposed. An emended description of the genus Muricauda is also proposed. The type strain is CL-SS4T (=KCCM 90075T=JCM 15563T).
