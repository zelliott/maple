The synthesis of the trisaccharide Lewis a was performed using an anomeric fluorous silyl protective group. This methodology allowed us to fully characterize each product (NMR, MS) and monitor each synthetic step (TLC). Although the product purifications could be performed by fluorous-solid-phase extraction (F-SPE) technology, standard chromatography could be used to effect purification if necessary. Trichloroethoxy carbonyl (Troc) protection of the amino group of the glucosamine moiety was found essential to allow protecting group manipulation of the fluorous protected sugar.
