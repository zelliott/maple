A Candida albicans gene homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae elongation factor 1 beta was isolated by screening a genomic DNA library using a C. albicans cDNA as a probe. This cDNA was previously obtained by immunoscreening of an expression library with polyclonal antibodies raised against candidal cell wall components. Sequence analysis of the cDNA and the whole C. albicans gene (EMBL accession number X96517) revealed an intron-interrupted open reading frame of 639 base pairs that encodes a 213 amino acid protein. Exon sequences are highly homologous (74%) to S. cerevisiae EFB1, whereas intron sequence is less conserved (34% identity), and the predicted amino acid sequence shares about 73% identity.
