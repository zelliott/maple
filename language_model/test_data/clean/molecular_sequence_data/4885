The looping-out and deletion model of switch recombination suggests that double strand breaks (DSBs) may occur in switch regions and participate in the recombination transaction. A DSB assay based on the ligation-mediated PCR method has been devised for the Sgamma3 region. Mitogen-inducible DSBs have been detected in Sgamma3 DNA of normal splenic B cells but not in splenic T cells or thymocytes. The breaks are restricted to the Sgamma3 region and are sequence specific. Examination of the sequence surrounding the DSBs has led to the derivation of a consensus sequence for DSB formation. Induction of Sgamma3-specific DSBs is correlated with the onset of switch recombination. The DSBs flank clusters of Sgamma3 recombination breakpoints, suggesting that processing of the broken ends may occur during the recombination reaction.
