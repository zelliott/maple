During the replication cycle of vaccinia virus, four different forms of viral particles are produced. The two extracellular enveloped forms, cell-associated enveloped virus and extracellular enveloped virus, are responsible for cell-to-cell transmission and long-range spread of infection both in vivo and in vitro. Despite the biological importance of the enveloped forms, the mechanism of envelopment and the components involved in this process have been analysed only recently. Therefore the individual steps and the rate-limiting factors of the envelopment process are still unknown. The protein p37K, an unglycosylated but acylated envelope protein of molecular mass 37 kDa, has been shown to be essential for envelopment. However, this study shows that over-expression of p37K by vaccinia virus recombinants reduces rather than increases the yield of infectious enveloped virus which is mainly due to the enveloped virions exhibiting a strongly diminished specific infectivity.
