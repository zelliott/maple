A peptide containing a single disulfide bond was sequenced using high-energy collision-induced dissociation (HE-CID) in conjunction with a high mass resolution time-of-flight  tandem mass spectrometer equipped with a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization source. This mass spectrometer, which has spiral ion  trajectory, allowed both high mass resolution and high precursor ion selectivity. It is difficult to obtain sufficient product ions from peptides containing disulfide bonds using HE-CID due to the single collision in the gas phase. To compensate for insufficient dissociation, the disulfide bond was cleaved via an in-source reduction process using 1,5-diaminonaphthalene, a reducing matrix. After applying the reduction in the ionization, subsequent sequencing using HE-CID provided the detailed structural information of the peptide containing the single disulfide bond.
