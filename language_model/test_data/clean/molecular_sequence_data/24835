Membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs), such as PSD-95, are modular scaffolds that organize signaling complexes at synapses and other cell junctions. MAGUKs contain PDZ domains, which recruit signaling proteins, as well as a Src homology 3 (SH3) and a guanylate kinase-like (GK) domain, implicated in scaffold oligomerization. The crystal structure of the SH3-GK module from PSD-95 reveals that these domains form an integrated unit: the SH3 fold comprises noncontiguous sequence elements divided by a hinge region and the GK domain. These elements compose two subdomains that can assemble in either an intra- or intermolecular fashion to complete the SH3 fold. We propose a model for MAGUK oligomerization in which complementary SH3 subdomains associate by 3D domain swapping. This model provides a possible mechanism for ligand regulation of oligomerization.
