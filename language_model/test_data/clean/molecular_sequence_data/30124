The theory for measuring ligand binding constants from footprinting autoradiographic data associated with a single binding site is derived. If the ligand and DNA cleavage agent compete for a common site, the spot intensities are not proportional to the amount of DNA not blocked by ligand. The analysis of a single site is experimentally illustrated by using results for the anticancer drug actinomycin D interacting with the duplex d(TAGCGCTA)2 as probed with the hydrolytic enzyme DNase I.
