Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) are a family of enzymes that play a crucial role in the regulation of signal transduction mediated by reversible protein tyrosine phosphorylation. To understand the significance of PTPases in physiological and pathophysiological processes in the kidney, we isolated three cDNA segments encoding PTPases (LAR, LRP and a novel PTPase) from rat kidney by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using PCR product as a probe, we isolated a full-length cDNA of rat LRP. LRP cDNA encoded a single membrane spanning protein consisted of 796 amino acids, with two tandemly located intracellular PTPase domains. By Northern analysis, a ubiquitous pattern of LRP gene expression in rat tissues was demonstrated. In cultured rat mesangial cells, LRP mRNA was detected and the mRNA level was suppressed by either interleukin-1 or interleukin-6 treatment.
