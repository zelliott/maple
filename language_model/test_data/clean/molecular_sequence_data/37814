We report an improved method for the detection and identification of mycobacteria using PCR and the heteroduplex mobility shift assay (HMA). The HMA for detection of mycobacteria was based on the microheterogeneity within the DNA coding sequences for 16S rRNA. A remarkable shift between single-stranded, heteroduplex and homoduplex bands in PAGE was observed among the Mycobacterium spp. tested. The Mycobacteria HMA (MHMA) of amplified PCR products from mycobacteria DNA coding for 16S rDNA derived from culture showed a specific heteroduplexes formed among different Mycobacterium species. Other bacterium species were distinguished from Mycobaterium due to slow migrating heteroduplexes mobility bands observed when M. bovis (BCG), M. avium, or M. fortuitum were used as a standard. The specific heteroduplexes were detected when as little as 1 etag of DNA template was used, although better results were obtained with 5 etag and when PCR products of sample test and mycobacterium standard were mixed at a ratio of 1.8. To correctly evaluate the feasibility of using MHMA to detect and identify mycobacteria, 15 clinical sample patients were tested. All MTB-positive clinical samples were identified by MHMA as well as the negative samples. In addition, MHMA will, in principle, be applicable to the detection and classification of any microorganism showing differences within the 16S rRNA as well as to the identification of new and unrecognized bacterial species.
