Two novel strains isolated from soils, JS12-10(T) and JS14-6(T), were characterized using a polyphasic approach to determine their taxonomic positions. These isolates were found to be aerobic, Gram-negative, motile with one polar flagellum, non-spore-forming and rod-shaped. Phenotypic and fatty acid data supported the affiliation of JS12-10(T) and JS14-6(T) to the genus Dyella. However, chemotaxonomic data and DNA-DNA relatedness values allowed differentiation of these strains from other Dyella species with validly published names. Strains JS12-10(T) and JS14-6(T) showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities with Dyella ginsengisoli Gsoil 3046(T) (98.4 %) and Dyella japonica XD53(T) (97.9 %), respectively, and the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between them was 97.1 %. DNA-DNA hybridization values between the novel isolates and strains of other recognized Dyella species were 29-38 %. Therefore, strains JS12-10(T) and JS14-6(T) represent two novel species of the genus Dyella, for which the names Dyella soli sp. nov. (type strain JS12-10(T) =KACC 12747(T) =JCM 15423(T)) and Dyella terrae sp. nov. (type strain JS14-6(T) =KACC 12748(T) =JCM 15424(T)) are proposed.
