Two bovine rhodopsin mutants with substitutions of negatively charged residues within transmembrane domains II and III by uncharged ones (Asp-83----Asn and Glu-134----Gln) were constructed. Both mutants stimulated transducin GTPase with slightly lowered efficiency, but were completely unable to activate cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase.
