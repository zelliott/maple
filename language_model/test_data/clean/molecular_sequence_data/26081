A cDNA clone of silkworm (Bombyx mori) larval hemolymph antitrypsin (sw-AT) has been isolated from a fat body cDNA library. The cDNA has an open reading frame which codes a 392-amino acid residue polypeptide comprising a 16-residue signal peptide and a 376-residue mature sw-AT of Mr 41,805. The reactive site of sw-AT for inhibition of bovine trypsin [Sasaki, T. et al. (1987) J. Biochem. 102, 433-441] was identified as Lys343-Val344. Alignment of the sw-AT amino acid sequence with those of 11 members of the serpin superfamily of proteins clearly confirmed the homology of sw-AT with serpins. The amino acid sequence of sw-AT is 56% identical with that of the proteinase inhibitor from a lepidopteron, Manduca sexta [Kanost, M.R. et al. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 965-972], but the sequence around the reactive site shows no homology and the inhibitory specificity for proteinases is very different.
