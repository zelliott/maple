In order to study some of its enzymatic properties, phosphatidylinositol synthase 1 (AtPIS1) from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana was expressed in Escherichia coli, a host naturally devoid of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns). In the context of the bacterial membrane and in addition to de novo synthesis, the plant enzyme is capable of catalysing the exchange of the inositol polar head for another inositol. Our data clearly show that the CDP-diacylglycerol-independent exchange reaction can occur using endogenous PtdIns molecular species or PtdIns molecular species from soybean added exogenously. Exchange has been observed in the absence of cytidine monophosphate (CMP), but is greatly enhanced in the presence of 4 microm CMP. Our data also show that AtPIS1 catalyses the removal of the polar head in the presence of much higher concentrations of CMP, in a manner that suggests a reverse of synthesis. All of the PtdIns metabolizing activities require free manganese ions. EDTA, in the presence of low Mn2+ concentrations, also has an enhancing effect.
