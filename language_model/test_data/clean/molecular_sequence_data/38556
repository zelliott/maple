The O-specific side-chain polymers from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia serogroups O21 and O25 were isolated from the lipopolysaccharides of the reference strains. The O21 polymer contained D-arabinose, 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose and 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-galactose in equal proportions. Methylation analysis and NMR spectroscopy showed that the polysaccharide is based on a branched trisaccharide repeating unit of the structure shown below. The O25 polymer is linear with a disaccharide repeating unit identical to that forming the backbone of the O21 polymer.
