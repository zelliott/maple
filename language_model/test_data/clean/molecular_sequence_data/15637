Here we report the isolation and characterization of the Chlamydomonas sp. W80-derived CFo ATP synthase subunit II WCFII homologue gene. Intracellular ATP concentration and stress-tolerance of Escherichia coli were increased by transformation with WCFII. We propose that WCFII-mediated stress tolerance is due to enhanced accumulation of intracellular ATP.
