Cancer, an unrestrained proliferation of cells, is one of the lead cause of death. Nearly 12.5 million people are diagnosed with cancer worldwide, 7.5 million people die of which 2.5 million cases are from India. Major cause for cancer is restriction of programmed cell death (apoptosis). Multiple signaling pathways regulate apoptosis. Bcl-2 (B - Cell Lymphomas-2) family proteins play a vital role as central regulators of apoptosis. Bcl-2L10, a novel anti-apoptotic protein, blocks apoptosis by mitochondrial dependent mechanism. The present study evaluates the 3D structure of Bcl-2L10 protein using homology modeling and aims to understand plausible functional and binding interactions between Bcl-2L10 with BH3 domain of BAX using protein - protein docking. The docking studies show binding of BH3 domain at Lys 110, Trp-111, Pro-115, Glu-119 and Asp-127 in the groove of BH 1, 2 and 3 domains of Bcl-2L10. Heterodimerization of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and BH3 domain of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins instigates apoptosis. Profound understanding of Bcl-2 pathway may prove useful in identification of future therapeutic targets for cancer.
