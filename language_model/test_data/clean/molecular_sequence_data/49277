Cultured Thalictrum minus cells produce a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid, berberine, in the presence of benzyladenine, and excrete it into the culture medium. T. minus cells excluded berberine, even if berberine was exogenously added to the medium, without benzyladenine treatment. Similarly, T. minus cells excluded a heterocyclic dye (neutral red) and calcein AM, which is used as a fluorescent probe to detect the drug efflux pump activity by ABC transporters. The addition of several inhibitors of P-glycoprotein, a representative ABC transporter, induced the accumulation in of both berberine and calcein AM ATP-dependent manner. The expression of P-glycoprotein-like ABC transporter genes was also demonstrated. The involvement of ABC transporter in the secretion of berberine in T. minus cells is discussed.
