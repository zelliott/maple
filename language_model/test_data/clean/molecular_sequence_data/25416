This study analyses the influence that the nature of the dielectric constant has on the final structures obtained from in vacuo molecular mechanics calculations on a drug-DNA complex and compares these structures with the energy minimised complex including explicit solvent molecules. Minimisations have been performed on a proflavine-decanucleotide structure, where the drug was intercalated at the d(CpG) site of the d(GpApTpApCpGpApTpApC) decamer duplex, using two expressions for the dielectric constant: a distance-independent, epsilon ij = EPS, and a distance-dependent, epsilon ij = EPS*Rij, form and for values of EPS from 1 to 8. Significantly different structures are obtained for the distance-independent and the distance-dependent expressions of the dielectric constant. The use of a distance-independent dielectric constant leads to distorted structures, which are very sensitive to slight changes in the value of EPS. The use of a distance-dependent dielectric constant leads to less distorted and more stable structures. The effects on helical parameters are analysed in detail. The structures obtained for different values of EPS (within the distance-dependent formalism) seem to converge for values of EPS equal to 4 or greater. Based on these results a distance-dependent form of the dielectric with an EPS value of 4 is recommended in order to produce reliable refined nucleic acid structures by molecular mechanics. These conclusions have been supported by molecular-mechanics minimisation of the same structure with the inclusion of explicit water molecules and counter-ions.
