The isolation of a liver peptide that inhibits the growth, mitosis rate and thymidine incorporation in regenerating liver is described. The peptide has the structure Pyroglu-gln-gly-ser-asn, and the deamidated forms are also active. The peptide probably belongs to a class of growth inhibitors with a high degree of tissue specificity. Two such peptides have previously been isolated from the epidermis (Reichelt et al. 1987) and from colonic tissue (Skraastad et al. 1987).
