The genes corresponding to the L11, L1, L10, and L12 equivalent ribosomal proteins (L11e, L1e, L10e, and L12e) of Escherichia coli have been cloned and sequenced from two widely divergent species of archaebacteria, Halobacterium cutirubrum and Sulfolobus solfataricus, and the L10 and four different L12 genes have been cloned and sequenced from the eucaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Alignments between the deduced amino acid sequences of these proteins and to other available homologous proteins of eubacteria and eucaryotes have been made. The data suggest that the archaebacteria are a distinct coherent phylogenetic group. Alignment of the proline-rich L11e proteins reveals that the N-terminal region, believed to be responsible for interaction with release factor 1, is the most highly conserved region and that there is specific conservation of most of the proline residues, which may be important in maintaining the highly elongated structure of the molecule. Although L11 is the most highly methylated protein in the E. coli ribosome, the sites of methylation are not conserved in the archaebacterial L11e proteins. The L1e proteins of eubacteria and archaebacteria show two regions of very high similarity near the center and the carboxy termini of the proteins. The L10e proteins of all kingdoms are colinear and contain approximately three fourths of an L12e protein fused to their carboxy terminus, although much of this fusion has been lost in the truncated eubacterial protein. The archaebacterial and eucaryotic L12e proteins are colinear, whereas the eubacterial protein has suffered a rearrangement through what appear to be gene fusion events. Within the L12e derived region of the L10e proteins there exists a repeated module of 26 amino acids, present in two copies in eucaryotes, three in archaebacteria, and one in eubacteria. This modular sequence is apparently also present in the L12e proteins of all kingdoms and may play a role in L12e dimerization, L10e-L12e complex formation, and the function of the L10e-L12e complex in translation.
