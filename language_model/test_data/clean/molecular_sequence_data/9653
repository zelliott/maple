The chemical structure of the cell wall galactomannan of Candida lipolytica was analyzed using two-dimensional NMR techniques without chemical fragmentation. The H-1-H-2-correlated cross-peaks of the galactomannan indicated that it consists of an alpha-1,6-linked mannan backbone moiety with side chains. A sequential NMR assignment of the side chains through nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) cross-peaks indicated that the triose side chain contains an alpha-1,2-linked galactopyranose unit at the non-reducing terminal. The structure was significantly different from the galactomannan of Trichophyton. The molar ratio of the side chains calculated from the H-1 signal dimensions indicated that ca. 45% of the backbone alpha-1,6-linked mannose units are not substituted with side chains and are responsible for the reactivity of the galactomannan with factor 9 serum.
