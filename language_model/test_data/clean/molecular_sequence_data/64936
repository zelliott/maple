Ribozymes are RNA molecules with cleavage activity that can be engineered to specifically target a given RNA molecule. The hammerhead, hairpin and hepatitis delta virus ribozymes have been widely studied for their use as therapeutical agents. This review discusses the structure and properties of these ribozymes, along with the advances made in the development of these molecules for their application in the treatment of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus infections.
