Our previous studies have characterized an endogenous lectin from human brain identified as galectin-1. A soluble ligand of galectin-1 was purified from human brain by affinity chromatography and preparative electrophoresis. The purified ligand (termed HBGp82, for human brain galectin-1-binding polypeptide of 82,000 daltons) has an apparent molecular mass of 82 kDa and is glycosylated by N-linked biantennary complex structures. HBGp82 was partially characterized by microsequencing of peptide fragments. Similar peptides were found in a heat shock of protein of 90,000 daltons, hsp90. However, comparison of apparent molecular weights and matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry clearly showed that HBGp82 differs to some degree from hsp90.
