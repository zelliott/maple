Newly defined antigens of the B5, B35 cross-reacting group have been found in Japanese and North American Indians. Nucleotide sequencing of the alleles encoding the Japanese B5.35 antigen and the variant B5 antigen from the Piman Indians show them to be identical. This new allele, B*5102, differs from B*5101 by a single nucleotide substitution that changes residue 171 from histidine to tyrosine. Residue 171, which is part of the alpha 2 helix, is believed to contribute directly to peptide interaction in the A pocket of the binding groove and is either histidine or tyrosine in all HLA-A, B, C heavy chains. Tyrosine 171 is shared by B*5102, B*3501, B*3502, and B*5301 and must be responsible for the serological cross-reactivities of these molecules not shared with B*5101. Stimulation of lymphocytes from a B*5101 positive donor with B*5102 positive cells failed to generate cytotoxic T cells with specificity for the difference between these molecules. However, one out of five clones of cytotoxic T cells raised against B*5101 failed to lyse targets expressing B*5102. Substitution of histidine for tyrosine at residue 171 affected recognition of HLA-B35-restricted human minor histocompatibility antigen-specific T cell clones.
