The complete VP1 encoding (1D) gene of 54 foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus serotype Asia1 field isolates, most of which were isolated during 2000 and 2001, was sequenced. The phylogenetic analysis identified a novel subgroup (>10% nucleotide divergence) within the widely circulating lineage of this serotype. The newly emerged viruses were responsible for disease outbreaks in both cattle and buffaloes and were present in six different states in the country. Amino acid sequence comparison of these isolates revealed significant sequence divergence at many of the amino acid positions in comparison to those of lineage VI-A and C. Emergence of such viruses may affect the efficacy of vaccine strain currently used for protection against FMD in India.
