UDP-glucose:solanidine glucosyltransferase and UDP-galactose:solanidine galactosyltransferase from cytosol of potato sprouts were partially separated by Sephadex G-100 and Q-Sepharose chromatographies, proving the existence of different glycosylation systems in biosynthesis of alpha-chaconine and alpha-solanine.
