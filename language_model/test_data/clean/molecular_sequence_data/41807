The multidrug resistance gene product, P-glycoprotein or the multidrug transporter, confers multidrug resistance to cancer cells by maintaining intracellular levels of cytotoxic agents below a killing threshold. P-glycoprotein is located within the plasma membrane and is thought to act as an energy-dependent drug efflux pump. The multidrug transporter represents a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of transporters (or traffic ATPases) and is composed of two highly homologous halves, each of which harbors a hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic ATP-binding fold. This review focuses on various biochemical and molecular genetic approaches used to analyze the structure, function, and mechanism of action of the multidrug transporter, whose most intriguing feature is its ability to interact with a large number of structurally and functionally different amphiphilic compounds. These studies have underscored the complexity of this membrane protein which has recently been suggested to assume alternative topological and quaternary structures, and to serve multiple functions both as a transporter and as a channel. With respect to the multidrug transporter activity of P-glycoprotein, progress has been made towards the elucidation of essential amino acid residues and/or polypeptide regions. Furthermore, the drug-stimulatable ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein has been established. The mechanism of drug transport by P-glycoprotein, however, is still unknown and its physiological role remains a matter of speculation.
