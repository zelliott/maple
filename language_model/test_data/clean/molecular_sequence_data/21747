Mutalysin-II (mut-II) from Lachesis muta snake venom is an endopeptidase with hemorrhagic activity. A mAb against mutalysin-II that neutralized the hemorrhagic effect was produced previously. To identify the mAb epitopes, sets of 15-mer overlapping peptides covering the mut-II amino acid sequence were synthesized using the SPOT method and tested but failed to react with the mAb. Using a phage-display approach seventeen clones reactive with mAb were identified. Additional immunoassays with the peptides and mAb identified the QCTMDQGRLRCR, TCATDQGRLRCT, HCFHDQGRVRCA, HCTMDQGRLRCR and SCMLDQGRSRCR sequences as possible epitopes. Immunization of rabbits with these peptides induced antibodies that recognize mut-II and protected against the hemorrhagic effects of Lachesis venom.
