During routine histopathology of 180 juvenile hard clams, Mercenaria mercenaria, from a site in Virginia, USA, in 2007, we discovered a single individual heavily infected with a parasite resembling a haplosporidian, some members of which cause lethal bivalve diseases. Scanning electron microscopy of spores and sequencing of small subunit ribosomal DNA confirmed a new species: Minchinia mercenariae n. sp. Further sampling of clams at the site found prevalences up to 38% using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). No parasites were found in routine histological screening of the same individuals, but re-examination of clams judged positive by in situ hybridization (ISH) revealed very faintly staining plasmodia. No unusual mortalities have occurred among the sampled groups. Analysis of clams from Massachusetts to Florida by PCR failed to detect the parasite, but a haplosporidian found in a clam from New Jersey in 2001 was subsequently identified by ISH as M. mercenariae. No other haplosporidians have been reported in thousands of hard clams from the US east coast examined histologically since the mid-1980s. The discovery underscores critical questions about how to assess the risks associated with parasites in groups known to be lethal, but that themselves are not considered a problem.
