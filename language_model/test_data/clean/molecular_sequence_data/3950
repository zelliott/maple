Nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs) are widely distributed among prokaryotes and eukaryotes and have diverse functions in physiology. Recent genome sequencing revealed NOS-like protein in bacteria, but whether these proteins generate nitric oxide is unknown. We therefore cloned, expressed, and purified a NOS-like protein from Bacillus subtilis (bsNOS) and characterized its catalytic parameters in both multiple and single turnover reactions. bsNOS was dimeric, bound l-Arg and 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin with similar affinity as mammalian NOS, and generated nitrite from l-Arg when incubated with NADPH and a mammalian NOS reductase domain. Stopped-flow analysis showed that ferrous bsNOS reacted with O(2) to form a transient heme Fe(II)O(2) species in the presence of either Arg or the reaction intermediate N-hydroxy-l-arginine. In the latter case, disappearance of the Fe(II)O(2) species was kinetically and quantitatively coupled to formation of a transient heme Fe(III)NO product, which then dissociated to form ferric bsNOS. This behavior mirrors mammalian NOS enzymes and unambiguously shows that bsNOS can generate NO. NO formation required a bound tetrahydropteridine, and the kinetic effects of this cofactor were consistent with it donating an electron to the Fe(II)O(2) intermediate during the reaction. Dissociation of the heme Fe(III)NO product was much slower in bsNOS than in mammalian NOS. This constrains allowable rates of ferric heme reduction by a protein redox partner and underscores the utility of using a tetrahydropteridine electron donor in bsNOS.
