We have previously constructed Escherichia coli strains in which an R1 plasmid is integrated into the origin of chromosome replication, oriC. In such intR1 strains, oriC is inactive and initiation of chromosome replication instead takes place at the integrated R1 origin. Due to the large size of the chromosome, replication intermediates generated at the R1 origin in these strains are considerably more long-lived than those in unintegrated R1 plasmids. We have taken advantage of this and performed primer extensions on total DNA isolated from intR1 strains, and mapped the free 5' DNA ends that were generated as replication intermediates during R1 replication in vivo. The sensitivity of the mapping was considerably improved by the use of a repeated primer extension method (RPE). The free DNA ends were assumed to represent normal in vivo start sites for leading strand DNA synthesis in plasmid R1. The ends were mapped to a short region approximately 380 bp away from the R1 minimal origin, and the positions agreed well with previous in vitro mappings. The same start positions were also utilized in the absence of the DnaA protein, indicating that DnaA is not required for determination of the position at which DNA synthesis starts during initiation of replication at the R1 origin.
