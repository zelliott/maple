Based on the previous finding that certain 30-mer single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides (oligonucleotides) having particular 6-mer palindromic sequences could induce interferon-alpha and -gamma, and enhance natural killer activity, the present study was carried out to clarify the entire relationship between the activity and the sequence of 30-mer oligonucleotides. The results indicated that the activity depended critically on the presence of particular palindromic sequences including the 5'-CG-3' motif(s). The size and the number of palindromes as well as the extra-palindromic sequences also influenced the activity. An oligonucleotide with a 10-mer palindrome and extra-palindromic oligoguanylate sequences showed the strongest activity among the oligonucleotides tested.
