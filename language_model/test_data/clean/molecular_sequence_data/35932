Two Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV)-based neoR retroviral vectors--LNL6 and G1Na--were used to transduce various human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) populations. These groups included bulk CD(8+)- and CD(4+)-enriched TIL from human renal cell carcinomas and melanomas. Transduction efficiencies averaged 5% for single 4-hr supernatant infections. Integrated provirus could be detected for up to 4 weeks of in vitro culture. LNL6 provirus could be distinguished from G1Na provirus using specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers. A single neomycin phosphotransferase (neoR) gene copy could be detected in 10(5) TIL. Using quantitative PCR, the relative ratio of LNL6 to G1Na copies in the same sample could be determined even at low copy numbers. These preclinical studies demonstrate the feasibility of using two retroviral marking vectors in human gene therapy efforts.
