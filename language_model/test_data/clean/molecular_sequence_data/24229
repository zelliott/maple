IgA is the predominant immunoglobulin class synthesized in humans and can be subdivided into two subclasses, IgA1 and IgA2, each encoded by a separate gene and differentially expressed depending on age and anatomical localization of the producing cells. Duplication of the alpha1 gene is frequently observed in selected populations. As this duplication may serve to enhance IgA-mediated immunity, we determined its effect on switching and production of IgA in human B cells. We developed a nested PCR strategy, involving sequencing the switch (S) alpha2 region, the only human S region not sequenced to date, to assess the proportion of cells switching to IgA1 and IgA2 in vivo. Our results show that there is no difference in the serum and salivary levels of IgA1 and IgA or rate of switching to IgA1 and IgA between normal donors and individuals carrying alpha1 gene duplications, suggesting involvement of a regulatory step in the production of IgA.
