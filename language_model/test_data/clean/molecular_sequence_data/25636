The cofactor required in the methylcoenzyme M methylreductase reaction was shown to be a large molecule with an Mr of 1149.21 in the free acid form. The cofactor, named MRF for methyl reducing factor, was identified from analyses by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectroscopy as uridine 5'-[N-(7-mercaptoheptanoyl)-O-3-phosphothreonine-P-yl(2-acetamido- 2-deoxy- beta-mannopyranuronosyl)(acid anhydride)]-(1----4)-O-2-acetamido-2-deoxy- alpha-glucopyranosyl diphosphate. MRF contains N-(7-mercaptoheptanoyl)threonine O-3-phosphate (HS-HTP) [No11, K. M., Rinehart, K. L., Tanner, R. S., & Wolfe, R. S. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 4238-4242] and is linked to C-6 of 2-acetamido-2-deoxymannopyranuronic acid of the UDP-disaccharide through a carboxylic-phosphoric anhydride linkage. It is postulated that this bond is responsible for the instability of the molecule and its hydrolysis during isolation. Analyses of Eadie and Hofstee plots of the methylcoenzyme M methylreductase reaction indicate that MRF has a 6-fold lower Km(app) than HS-HTP and a 50% greater Vmax. This suggests that the UDP-disaccharide moiety may be of importance in the binding of MRF to the enzyme active site.
