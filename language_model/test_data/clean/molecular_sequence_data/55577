The inducible macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance determinant, ermJ, from Bacillus anthracis 590 was cloned in Escherichia coli CSH26. The DNA sequence of ermJ was similar to that of ermK or ermD from B. licheniformis, suggesting that ermK-like genes have been distributed in Bacillus strains by transposition. Expression of ermJ was achieved in a B. subtilis minicell system, and the rRNA methyltransferase product of ermJ was purified. The molecular mass of the enzyme was 58 kDa, and it was concluded to be a homodimer. Its biochemical characteristics were different from those of ermC methyltransferase.
