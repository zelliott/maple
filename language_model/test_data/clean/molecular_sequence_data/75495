The sequence organization of four different families of Y chromosomal repetitive DNA is characterized at three levels of spatial extension along the Y chromosome of Drosophila hydei. At the lowest level of resolution, DNA blot analysis of Y chromosomal fragments of different lengths and in situ hybridization experiments on metaphase chromosomes demonstrate the clustering of each particular sequence family within one defined region of the chromosome. At a higher level of resolution, family specific repeats can be detected within these clusters by crosshybridization within 10-20 kb long continuous stretches of cloned DNA in EMBL3 phages. At the highest level of resolution, detailed sequence analysis of representative subclones about 1 kb in length reveals a satellite-like head to tail arrangement of family specific degenerated subrepeats as the building scheme common to all four families. Our results provide the first comparative sequence analysis of three novel families of repetitive DNA on the long arm of the Y chromosome of D. hydei. Additional data are presented which support the existence of two related subfamilies of repetitive DNA on the short arm of the Y chromosome.
