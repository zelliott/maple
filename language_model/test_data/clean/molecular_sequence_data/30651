We have cloned, sequenced, and disrupted the gene encoding U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This RNA is close in size and exhibits a high degree of secondary structure homology to human U1 RNA. There exist two regions of extended primary sequence identity between S. pombe and human U1 RNAs; the first comprises nucleotides involved in hydrogen bonding to 5' splice junctions, and the second is a single-stranded region which, in the human snRNA, forms part of the A protein binding site. S. pombe U1 lacks two nucleotides just following the 5' cap structure which are present in all other U1 homologs examined to date, and the region which corresponds to the binding site for the human 70K protein (molecular weight of 55,000) is more divergent than in other organisms. A putative upstream transcription signal is conserved in sequence and location among all loci encoding spliceosomal snRNAs in S. pombe with the exception of U6. Disruption of the single-copy U1 gene, designated snu1, reveals that this RNA is indispensable for viability.
