Approximately 660 nt including the carboxy-terminal portion of the bean yellow mosaic potyvirus (BYMV) coat protein gene, complete 3' noncoding sequence and a short poly(A) tract were introduced to produce antisense RNA in transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana. Original (R0) transformants were selfed, and homozygous second generation (R2) populations challenged with infected sap, purified virus, or viral RNA. One transgenic line of 10 examined was extremely resistant to infection by mechanical inoculation of 100 micrograms/ml BYMV or 50 micrograms/ml BYMV RNA (the highest concentrations tested); no virus could be detected in inoculated leaves of this line. Nine other lines were systemically infected when inoculated with BYMV or BYMV RNA, with initial symptoms indistinguishable from those in nontransgenic plants. One of these lines subsequently developed reduced symptoms and then symptomless, virus-free leaves (complete recovery from BYMV infection), while other lines produced leaves with reduced symptoms and reduced virus titer compared to the controls (partial recovery). No transgenic lines had resistance to infection, nor recovery from symptom expression, following inoculation with pepper mottle or turnip mosaic potyviruses. Antisense RNA from 3' regulatory regions can confer multiple degrees of resistance to potyviruses, including extreme resistanc to infection, presumably by interference in virus replication.
