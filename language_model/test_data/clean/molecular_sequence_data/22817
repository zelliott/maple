CD94/NKG2A is an inhibitory receptor expressed by natural killer (NK) cells and a subset of CD8+ T cells. Ligation of CD94/NKG2A by its ligand HLA-E results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the NKG2A immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, and recruitment and activation of the SH2 domain-bearing tyrosine phosphatase-1, which in turn suppresses activation signals. The nkg2a gene encodes two isoforms, NKG2A and NKG2B, with the latter lacking the stem region. We identified three new alternative transcripts of the cd94 gene in addition to the originally described canonical CD94Full. One of the transcripts, termed CD94-T4, lacks the portion that encodes the stem region. CD94-T4 associates with both NKG2A and NKG2B, but preferentially associates with the latter. This is probably due to the absence of a stem region in both CD94-T4 and NKG2B. CD94-T4/NKG2B is capable of binding HLA-E and, when expressed in E6-1 Jurkat T cells, inhibits TCR mediated signals, demonstrating that this heterodimer is functional. Coevolution of stemless isoforms of CD94 and NKG2A that preferentially pair with each other to produce a functional heterodimer indicates that this may be more than a serendipitous event. CD94-T4/NKG2B may contribute to the plasticity of the NK immunological synapse by insuring an adequate inhibitory signal.
