Members of the SPAN-X (sperm protein associated with the nucleus mapped to the X chromosome) family of cancer-testis antigens are promising targets for tumor immunotherapy because they are normally expressed exclusively during spermiogenesis on the adluminal side of the blood-testis barrier, an immune privileged compartment.

This study analyzed the human SPANX genomic organization, as well as SPAN-X mRNA and protein expression in somatic and cancer cells. The SPANX family consists of five genes, one of which is duplicated, all located in a gene cluster at Xq27.1. From the centromere, the arrangement of the five SPANX genes mapped on one contiguous sequence is SPANXB, -C, -A1, -A2, and -D. Reverse transcription-PCR analyses demonstrated expression of SPAN-X mRNA in melanoma and ovarian cell lines, and virtual Northern analysis established SPANX gene expression in numerous cancer cell lines. Immunoblot analysis using polyclonal antisera raised against recombinant SPAN-X confirmed the translation of SPAN-X proteins in melanoma and ovarian tumor cell lines. The immunoreactive proteins migrated between M(r) 15,000 and M(r) 20,000 similar to those observed in spermatozoa. Immunoperoxidase labeling of melanoma cells and tissue sections demonstrated SPAN-X protein localization in the nucleus, cytoplasm, or both. Ultrastructurally, in melanoma cells with nuclear SPAN-X, the protein was associated with the nuclear envelope, a localization similar to that observed in human spermatids and spermatozoa. Significantly, the incidence of SPAN-X-positive immunostaining was greatest in the more aggressive skin tumors, particularly in distant, nonlymphatic metastatic melanomas.

The data herein suggest that the SPAN-X protein may be a useful target in cancer immunotherapy.
