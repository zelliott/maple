The Escherichia coli chaperonin system, GroEL-GroES, facilitates folding of substrate proteins (SPs) that are otherwise destined to aggregate. The iterative annealing mechanism suggests that the allostery-driven GroEL transitions leading to changes in the microenvironment of the SP constitutes the annealing action of chaperonins. To describe the molecular basis for the changes in the nature of SP-GroEL interactions we use the crystal structures of GroEL (T state), GroEL-ATP (R state) and the GroEL-GroES-(ADP)(7) (R" state) complex to determine the residue-specific changes in the accessible surface area and the number of tertiary contacts as a result of the T-->R-->R" transitions. We find large changes in the accessible area in many residues in the apical domain, but relatively smaller changes are associated with residues in the equatorial domain. In the course of the T-->R transition the microenvironment of the SP changes which suggests that GroEL is an annealing machine even without GroES. This is reflected in the exposure of Glu386 which loses six contacts in the T-->R transition. We also evaluate the conservation of residues that participate in the various chaperonin functions. Multiple sequence alignments and chemical sequence entropy calculations reveal that, to a large extent, only the chemical identities and not the residues themselves important for the nominal functions (peptide binding, nucleotide binding, GroES and substrate protein release) are strongly conserved. Using chemical sequence entropy, which is computed by classifying aminoacids into four types (hydrophobic, polar, positively charged and negatively charged) we make several new predictions that are relevant for peptide binding and annealing function of GroEL. We identify a number of conserved peptide binding sites in the apical domain which coincide with those found in the 1.7 A crystal structure of 'mini-chaperone' complexed with the N-terminal tag. Correlated mutations in the HSP60 family, that might control allostery in GroEL, are also strongly conserved. Most importantly, we find that charged solvent-exposed residues in the T state (Lys 226, Glu 252 and Asp 253) are strongly conserved. This leads to the prediction that mutating these residues, that control the annealing function of the SP, can decrease the efficacy of the chaperonin function.
