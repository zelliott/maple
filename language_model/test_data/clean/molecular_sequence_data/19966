The diversity of Archaea was studied in vertisolic and loam soils of a semi-arid region in Australia. Sampling was undertaken at an agricultural site, two grassland environments, and a brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) woodland. Archaeal community structure was profiled using amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) combined with rDNA sequencing of an example of each restriction fragment length polymorphism type. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that both crenarchaeotal and euryarchaeotal Archaea were present at oxic depths in the soil at all field sites. Along with previously described soil archaeal lineages, novel soil lineages and the deeply divergent Pendant-33 group of Euryarchaeota were also detected. A novel statistical method for comparing ARDRA derived data was demonstrated and implemented using the archaeal communities from the four field sites. Archaeal diversity, as measured by this method, was significantly higher in the agricultural site than at either of the grassland sites or the brigalow woodland.
