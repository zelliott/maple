The psbB operon contained in the plastomes of higher plants consists of the genes psbB, psbH, petB and petD. The primary transcript of this operon is subject to a series of processing steps which include cleavages resulting in four monocistronic mRNAs and splicing of the petB and petD transcripts. A search for editing sites within the two latter transcripts from maize led us to the detection of one editing site within the petB coding region which is conserved at the DNA level in other graminean species and in tobacco. This shows that editing must be considered as an additional processing step of the psbB operon encoded primary transcript. As is evident from cDNA sequences derived from the dicistronic and/or unspliced petB/D transcripts which are completely edited, editing is an early step of mRNA processing which precedes both splicing and cleavage to the monocistronic mRNAs and which must, therefore, be independent of the latter two steps. This conclusion is confirmed by a similar observation with the editing site of the rpl2 transcript which is contained in the polycistronic transcript of the rpoA operon, although here only partial editing is observed for the unspliced dicistronic rpl23/rpl2 transcript.
