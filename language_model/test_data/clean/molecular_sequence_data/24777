We previously reported that the dog dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) gene is polymorphic as observed in humans, and four alleles were identified based on the number and/or order of the 12 and 39 bp sequences located in the homologous region of human DRD4. To assess the diversity of the DRD4 gene in dogs we examined the allelic variations in four breeds (beagle, golden retriever, Shetland sheepdog, and shiba) employing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). As a result, we found three novel alleles and determined the DNA sequences of these alleles. The beagle shared four alleles, including 396, 435, 447a, and 447b, with the 435 (52.6%) and 447a (39.5%) alleles being common. The golden retriever had the 435 and 447a alleles, and the 435 allele was frequent (73.3%). In the Shetland sheepdog, the 435, 447a, and 498 alleles were observed, of which the 447a allele was most frequent (82.5%). The shiba had five alleles-447a, 447b, 486, 498, and 549-and the 447b allele was most common (55.4%). These findings suggest that the allele frequency varied among the four dog breeds, and analysis of the DRD4 polymorphism may therefore be useful for elucidating the relationships among dog breeds.
