A chromosomally encoded oxacillinase, OXA-22, had been characterized from Ralstonia pickettii PIC-1 that did not explain by itself the resistance profile of this strain to beta-lactams. Thus, further analysis of the genetic background of this species led to the identification of another oxacillinase, OXA-60, that was expressed only after beta-lactam induction. This chromosomally encoded oxacillinase shared 19% amino acid identity with OXA-22. It has a narrow-spectrum hydrolysis profile that includes imipenem. OXA-60-like enzymes were identified in several R. pickettii strains. Gene inactivation and induction studies of the bla(OXA-60) and bla(OXA-22) genes in R. pickettii identified the relative contribution of each oxacillinase to the resistance profile of R. pickettii to beta-lactams.
