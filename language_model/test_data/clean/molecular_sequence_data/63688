Insertional mutagenesis can be achieved by a variety of approaches, including both random and targeted methods. In contrast to chemical mutagenesis, insertional mutagens provide a molecular tag, thereby allowing rapid identification of the mutated genomic region. Integration into defined genomic locations has great utility for both gene insertion and mutagenesis. Our laboratories have explored targeted integration through the use of transposases coupled to defined DNA-binding domains. This technology holds great promise for targeted insertional mutagenesis by biasing integration events to regions recognized by the chosen DNA-binding domain. Herein, we provide a brief background on targeted transposon integration and detailed protocols for testing chimeric transposases in both mammalian cell culture and insect embryos.
