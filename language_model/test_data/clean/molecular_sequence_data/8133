The mouse protein mSos1 has a central Ras guanine nucleotide exchange domain, and a long proline-rich C-terminal tail which contains several potential binding sites for the SH3 domains of the adaptor protein, Grb2. In fibroblasts, growth factor stimulation results in the recruitment of Grb2-mSos1 into complexes with activated receptors and cytoplasmic phosphoproteins such as Shc, which are apparently involved in Ras activation, and subsequently to an increase in mSos1 phosphorylation on serine and threonine. The catalytic and C-terminal domains of mSos1 contain several potential sites for phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinases. In vitro, purified p42/p44 MAP-kinase selectively phosphorylated the C-terminal tail of mSos1. Comparative tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of mSos1 phosphorylated in vitro by MAP kinase and of mSos1 immunoprecipitated from EGF-stimulated cells, revealed several phosphopeptides in common. These common phosphorylation sites have been mapped to a region encompassing the first three proline (pro)-rich motifs in the tail of mSos1. Furthermore, a region of mSos1 containing the first two pro-rich motifs could associate with MBP kinase activity in vitro. Phosphorylation of mSos1 did not affect binding of Grb2 to mSos1, but appeared to decrease binding of the mSos1-Grb2 complex to Shc and the EGF-receptor. These findings suggest a potential inhibitory role for MAP-kinase in attenuating nucleotide exchange on Ras, by uncoupling mSos1 from membrane-bound receptor complexes that lead to Ras activation.
