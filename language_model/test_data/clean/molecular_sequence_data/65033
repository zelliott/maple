In common with several other respiratory and photosynthetic enzymes, a sub-population of cytosolic phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) occurs in the nucleus in pea leaves and shoots. The full-length cDNA encoding pea cytosolic PGK has been cloned and sequenced, revealing not only the PGK 'signature' but also a nuclear localization signal (NLS). A translational fusion of PGK and GFP was used to transform tobacco BY-2 cells resulting in GFP locating to the cell nuclei.
