The stimulatory effect of VIP on intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) has been investigated in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the reporter gene aequorin, and expressing human VPAC(1), VPAC(2), chimeric VPAC(1)/VPAC(2), or mutated receptors. The VIP-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase was linearly correlated with receptor density and was higher in cells expressing VPAC(1) receptors than in cells expressing a similar VPAC(2) receptor density. The study was performed to establish the receptor sequence responsible for that difference. VPAC(1)/VPAC(2) chimeric receptors were first used for a broad positioning: those having the third intracellular loop (IC(3)) of the VPAC(1) or of the VPAC(2) receptor behaved, in that respect, phenotypically like VPAC(1) and VPAC(2) receptor, respectively. Replacement in the VPAC(2) receptor of the sequence 315-318 (VGGN) within the IC(3) by its VPAC(1) receptor counterpart 328-331 (IRKS) and the introduction of VGGN in state of IRKS in VPAC(1) was sufficient to mimic the VPAC(1) and VPAC(2) receptor characteristics, respectively. Thus, a small sequence in the IC(3) of the VPAC(1) receptor, probably through interaction with G(alphai) and G(alphaq) proteins, is responsible for the efficient agonist-stimulated [Ca(2+)](i) increase.
