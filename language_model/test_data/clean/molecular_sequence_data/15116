A Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain deficient in phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase that exhibits choline auxotrophy grew in the presence of dioctanoyl phosphatidylcholine (diC8PC). We isolated and characterized mutants defective in growth in the diC8PC-containing medium. Mutations in LEM3/ROS3 impaired growth in that medium, indicating that Lem3p is involved in the utilization of extracellular phosphatidylcholine (PC) with short acyl chains.
