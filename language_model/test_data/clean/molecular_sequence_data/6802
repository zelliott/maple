The nucleotide sequence of a 2384 bp portion within the unique short (Us) region of the herpesvirus simiae (simian herpes B virus; SHBV) genome is presented. A partial and a complete open reading frame (ORF) were found within this nucleotide sequence. The partial ORF encodes the C terminus (147 amino acids) of a protein kinase which is highly conserved in the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) and simian agent 8 (SA8) Us regions. The complete ORF is located 3' to the partial ORF within the 2384 bp sequence and encodes a 593 amino acid glycoprotein which appears to be closely related to the SA8 glycoprotein G (gG), but shares little amino acid similarity with gG of HSV-1 and -2. However, the complete ORF shares certain features conserved among most alphaherpesvirus gGs, notably three highly conserved cysteine residues and an adjacent N-glycosylation site. Therefore, it was concluded that this complete ORF encodes the SHBV gG. The 358 amino acid C-terminal portion of SHBV gG was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein and this was detected by immunoblotting with sera from cynomolgus monkeys which were either experimentally or naturally infected with SHBV. The purified fusion protein was inoculated into rabbits to raise an antiserum which recognized a number of apparently SHBV gG-specific protein bands in extracts from SHBV-infected simian cells.
