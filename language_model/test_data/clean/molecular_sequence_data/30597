Adherence of monocytes to endothelial cells or extracellular matrices is likely to play a critical role in triggering monocyte activation in extravascular sites of infection, chronic inflammatory disorders, tissue damage and neoplastic growth. We have constructed a cDNA library from monocytes adhered for 30 min on plastic and have screened it by differential hybridization for mRNA rapidly induced by adherence. Two of the cDNA isolated have been identified as IL-1 beta and superoxide dismutase. Sequence data from three other adherence specific clones demonstrates the presence of ATTTA mRNA instability sequences in their 3' untranslated regions signifying inflammation-associated genes. The deduced amino acid sequences indicate the presence of open reading frames with sequence homologies to a family of host defense cytokines, one of them being identified as IL-8. Of the 14 clones initially identified, 4 have been analyzed for induction of mRNA expression. Although 3 of the 4 clones were equally induced by PMA and LPS under nonadherent conditions, all 4 cDNA showed distinct patterns of induction with adherence to extracellular matrix components or endothelial cells. The deduced amino acid sequence homologies indicate that we have isolated cDNA that code for three unique gene products. These cDNA belong to a gene family of early host defense cytokines involved in inflammation and cell growth, but which are differentially regulated by adherence to different surfaces.
