We attempted to detect cytomegalovirus DNA (CMV-DNA) and Pneumocystis carinii DNA (P. carinii-DNA) in sputum samples of 18 hematological neoplasm patients with pneumonia, using rapid cycle DNA amplification. A thermal cycler based on recirculating hot air was used for rapid temperature control of 10-microliters samples in this glass capillary tubes. After a total amplification time of 15 min, the amplified products were electrophoresed on agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. In three cases, CMV-DNA was detected at about the time the pneumonia occurred. These patients were successfully treated with ganciclovir in the early stages of infection and CMV was not detected by the virus culture method. In four other cases, P. carinii-DNA was detected in their sputum samples but not detected by Grocott staining. These four cases of P. carinii were successfully treated with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. For detection of CMV-DNA and P. carinii-DNA using the capillary polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a different temperature setting base on the primer difference was not necessary. Therefore, capillary PCR was performed at the same time for detection of CMV and P. carinii. We conclude that capillary PCR amplification is a valuable tool for rapid diagnosis and early treatment of pneumonia due to CMV and P. carinii.
