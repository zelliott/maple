The function of interferon (IFN) response elements (IREs) may be classified into two classes according to the location of the IRE in the polymerase II transcription promoter: located upstream of the core promoter, or located within the core promoter. Thus, the IRE-binding factors (IREBFs) can serve as sequence-specific transcription factors that activate IFN-inducible gene transcription and they can participate in preinitiation complex formation. In the murine and human (2'-5')oligoadenylate synthetase genes the IRE is located within the core promoter region. For this reason, it is important to isolate cDNAs encoding protein factors that can bind to this IRE and determine their functional roles in the regulation of expression of the IFN-inducible (2'-5')oligoadenylate synthetase gene. We have isolated three groups of cDNAs that encode IREBFs. Here we report on clone 38 cDNA, which contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 277 amino acids that is designated IREBF-2. The C terminus of IREBF-2 is extremely proline-rich and contains a high percentage of short-armed amino acids. IREBF-2 shares marked similarity with some gene products of the herpes group of viruses. These gene products are potent transcription activators. IREBF-2 is constitutively expressed in BALB/c 3T3 cells.
