The gene encoding growth hormone (GH) has been cloned from a rabbit genomic library, and its sequence has been determined. The rabbit GH gene is similar to other mammalian GH, being comprised of five exons and four introns. As in rodents and artiodactyls, the rabbit GH occurs as a single gene, with no evidence for a cluster of GH-like genes, as is found in primates. The amino acid sequence of rabbit GH is similar to that of pig GH and other conserved mammalian GH, and, like these, differs markedly from the available sequences of ruminant and primate GH. This provides further support for the idea that, in mammals, GH show a slow underlying rate of evolution which has increased markedly on at least two occasions.
