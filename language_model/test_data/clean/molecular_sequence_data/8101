Short sequences that were over represented in a database of Streptomyces promoter region sequences were identified. These sequences and others that were selected on the basis of the characteristics of known promoters, were tested to determine if they were found predominantly at particular distances from the transcription start site. In several cases obvious clusters were recorded. This has allowed the objective identification of potential promoter core sequences. In some cases these may define novel promoter classes. 150 Streptomyces promoters have been listed and grouped on this basis. A new and extended consensus sequence for the Streptomyces E.coli sigma 70-like promoters was determined. It showed differences from that of E.coli, both in sequence and in the spacing between the -35 and -10 regions.
