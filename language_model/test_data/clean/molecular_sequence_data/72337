Cadherins are a family of transmembrane proteins that play a crucial role in cell adhesion and in morphogenesis. Several of the cadherins are expressed in the nervous system, but none is neuron-specific. We characterize a new member of the cadherin family, Br-cadherin, which is present exclusively in the central nervous system. Although the Br-cadherin protein is confined to the central nervous system, its mRNA is present in several additional tissues, suggesting that there is posttranscriptional control of this gene's expression. Within the central nervous system, Br-cadherin appears to be expressed specifically by neurons. In the mouse, its expression becomes detectable during the first postnatal week, which corresponds temporally to the onset of synaptogenesis and dendrite outgrowth in the brain. This pattern of expression is consistent with a role for Br-cadherin in neuronal development, perhaps specifically with synaptogenesis.
