The gene encoding human preproTRH was isolated from a human lung fibroblast genomic DNA library with a rat prepro TRH cDNA fragment. The transcriptional unit is 3.3 kilobases in size and contains three exons interrupted by two introns of approximately 1050 and 650 base pairs, respectively. Exon 1 encodes the 5'-untranslated region of the mRNA, exon 2 the putative signal sequence and the initial portion of propeptide, and exon 3 encodes the remainder of the propeptide, which contains six copies of the TRH sequence in contrast to five copies in the rat preproTRH gene. The predicted human preproTRH peptide structure has 242 amino acids compared to 255 amino acids in the rat. Homology with rat preproTRH is 73.3% and 59.5% at the nucleic acid and amino acid levels, respectively. Intron-exon splicing sites and 5' and 3' mRNA borders were confirmed rigorously by sequencing a human preproTRH cDNA using the polymerase chain reaction and human hypothalamic cDNA.
