The possibility of direct pituitary effects of sex steroids on gonadotropin gene expression and synthesis was studied in male rats. The animals were treated with a potent GnRH antagonist, Ac-D-pClPhe-D-pClPhe-D-Trp-Ser-Tyr-D-Arg-Leu-Arg-Pro-D-Ala-+ ++NH2CH3COOH (Org 30276; 0.5 mg/kg BW, sc, twice daily) for 10 days. Groups of the antagonist-treated rats were implanted at the beginning of the injections with Silastic capsules containing testosterone (T), 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), or diethylstilbestrol (DES). Groups treated with the antagonist alone or vehicle served as controls. The antagonist treatment decreased unoccupied pituitary receptors of GnRH by 93% (P less than 0.001), serum LH by 34% (P less than 0.01), and serum FSH by 30% (P less than 0.05), and serum T became undetectable (less than 0.10 nmol/liter). Compared to antagonist treatment alone, no further effects on serum or pituitary LH levels found after steroid replacements. In contrast, the antagonist-induced decreases in serum and pituitary FSH (30% and 70%, respectively; P less than 0.05-0.01) were totally reversed by the T and DHT implants, but not by DES. Pituitary levels of the LH beta-subunit mRNA were decreased by 60% (P less than 0.01) after antagonist treatment. Combination treatment with androgens had no further effect on this mRNA, whereas DES partially reversed this suppression (P less than 0.05). In contrast, the pituitary mRNA level of the FSH beta-subunit, which decreased with antagonist treatment by 90% (P less than 0.01), returned to the control level with T and DHT replacements, but only partially with DES. The pituitary mRNA level of the common alpha-subunit was significantly suppressed only by combined antagonist plus DHT treatment (P less than 0.01). However, combination of DES with the antagonist increased alpha-subunit mRNA levels 2.4-fold (P less than 0.05) compared to antagonist treatment alone. It is concluded that the suppression of gonadotropin secretion by GnRH antagonist treatment is accompanied in male rats by a parallel reduction in mRNA levels of the gonadotropin beta-subunits. Sex steroid replacement of the antagonist-treated animals selectively reverses some of the mRNA changes. Androgens (T and DHT) increase the mRNA of FSH beta-subunit, but have no effect on the LH beta-subunit. Estrogen increases the mRNA levels of common alpha- and LH beta-subunits and slightly increases that of FSH beta.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
