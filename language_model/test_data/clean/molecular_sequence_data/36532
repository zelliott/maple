We have constructed recombinant baculoviruses and vaccinia viruses containing cloned DNA, encoding either the envelope protein alone or all of the structural proteins (core, membrane and envelope) of louping ill virus. Glycosylated viral envelope protein, presented both inside and on the surface of insect and mammalian cells, was expressed by all four recombinant viruses. Differences in antigenic presentation of the envelope protein were observed between the envelope protein and structural protein constructs as well as between the insect and mammalian cell expression systems. Despite the expression of epitopes known to elicit neutralizing and protective antibodies when present in authentic antigen, the recombinant envelope protein expressed by either vector failed to induce, in mice or rabbits, either neutralizing or protective antibodies against louping ill virus.
