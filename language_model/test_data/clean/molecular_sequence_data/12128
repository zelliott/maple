The CC chemokines RANTES and MIP-1 alpha are known to activate certain leucocytes and leucocytic cell lines. We have produced and fully characterised the recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli. They induce chemotaxis of the pro-monocytic cell line, THP-1 and T cells. THP-1 cells express three of the known CC chemokine receptors. In order to study the activation of a single receptor, we have expressed the shared receptor (CC CKR-1) for RANTES and MIP-1 alpha stably in the HEK 293 cell line. We have examined the effects of RANTES and MIP-1 alpha on the CC CKR-1 transfectants by equilibrium binding studies and in a chemotaxis assay. RANTES competes for [125I]RANTES with an IC50 of 0.6 +/- 0.23 nM, whereas MIP-1 alpha competes for its radiolabelled counterpart with an IC50 of 10 +/- 1.6 nM in the transfectants. These affinities are the same as those measured on the THP-1 cell line. The stably transfected HEK 293 cells respond to both these chemokines in the chemotaxis assay with the same EC50 values as those measured for THP-1 cells. This indicates that this cellular response can be mediated through the CC CKR-1 receptor.
