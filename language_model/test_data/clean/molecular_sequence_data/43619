A continuous 20.9 kb sequence from human herpesvirus 6 variant B (HHV-6B) strain Z29 (GenBank accession number L16947) is genetically colinear with a discrete segment of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL region and with HHV-6 variant A (HHV-6A). Short nucleotide sequence determinations at multiple sites within an 8.5 kb region immediately 3' to the 20.9 kb contig revealed additional colinearity between HHV-6B, HCMV and HHV-6A. Homology studies with the predicted peptide sequences from 11 complete and 12 partial HHV-6B open reading frames (ORFs) revealed that most encode proteins conserved to varying degrees in all previously sequenced primate herpesviruses. HHV-6B homologs were identified for the HSV-1 ICP18.5, ICP8, UL52, UL24, UL25 and major capsid protein. Several HHV-6B proteins had limited amino acid similarity to their positional homologs in other herpesviruses. Each gene identified is highly homologous to its HHV-6A counterpart, including two unique HHV-6 genes predicted to encode membrane-associated glycoproteins. However, two regions of substantial divergence were noted, one spanning the origin of replication and the other encoding one of the putative HHV-6-specific glycoprotein genes. Substitutions in the latter region lead to predicted differences in reading frames and protein lengths among HHV-6 isolates.
