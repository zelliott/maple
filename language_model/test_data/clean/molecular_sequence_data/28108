The oriT locus of the Escherichia coli K12 F plasmid contains a site at which one of the DNA strands is cleaved as a prelude to conjugal transmission to recipient bacteria. We have remapped this site biochemically by using oriT-containing plasmids that were purified from bacteria expressing the F transfer (tra) functions. The strand interruption was found on the transferred strand 137 base-pairs clockwise of the center of the BglII site at 66.7 on the F map. This location is consistent with the locations anticipated from studies of delta traF' plasmids, but it differs from previous results by other investigators. The strand interruption produced a 3'-OH, but the nature of the 5' terminus of the strand on the other side of the nick was not determined. Some DNA sequence motifs in the vicinity of the oriT nick site of F resemble the chromosomal site involved in formation of delta traF'purE plasmids.
