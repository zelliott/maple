The rat alpha 2u globulin gene family is composed of about 25 members with closely related structure. Several of these genes are transcriptionally active in the liver of adult males. We isolated about 50 independent genomic clones from the library and determined complete nucleotide sequences of two. Although they were alike and revealed structural features prerequisite for active genes, one cloned gene was interrupted in the 6th intron with about 900 bp 5' truncated and 3'-terminal triplicated form of LINE 1 sequence flanked by 16 bp complete direct repeat originating from the 6th intron. Within the inserted LINE 1 an excellent splicing acceptor homologue with a precedent lariat junction motif and multiple polyadenylation signals was identified. Thus, the possible production of a chimeric RNA, the last exon of which would be replaced by a part of LINE 1, has to be considered.
