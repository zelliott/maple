A murine immunoglobulin G monoclonal antibody (MAb) raised against outer membrane vesicles of Moraxella catarrhalis 035E was shown to bind to a surface-exposed epitope of a major outer membrane protein of this organism. This outer membrane protein, which had an apparent molecular weight of approximately 80,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, was designated CopB. MAb 10F3, reactive with CopB, bound to a majority (70%) of M. catarrhalis strains tested. More importantly, mice passively immunized with MAb 10F3 exhibited an enhanced ability to clear a bolus challenge of M. catarrhalis from their lungs, a result which suggested that CopB might have potential as a vaccine candidate. The M. catarrhalis gene encoding CopB was cloned in Escherichia coli, and nucleotide sequence analysis of the copB gene indicated that the CopB protein was synthesized with a leader peptide, a finding confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the mature CopB protein purified from M. catarrhalis 035E. Southern blot analysis showed that chromosomal DNA from seven different M. catarrhalis strains hybridized with a probe comprising the majority of the copB structural gene from strain 035E. Additional data emphasizing the extent of conservation of the CopB protein among M. catarrhalis strains were obtained from Western immunoblot analyses with polyclonal antisera raised against CopB proteins from different M. catarrhalis strains used to probe the recombinant form of the CopB protein from strain 035E. The ability of the CopB protein to function as a target for biologically active antibodies and its apparent conservation among M. catarrhalis strains warrant further investigation of this outer membrane protein as a potential vaccine candidate.
