Mammalian Ubc9 (mUbc9) is required for rapid degradation of the E2A proteins E12 and E47 by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We have shown elsewhere that mUbc9 interacts with amino acids 477-530 of E12/E47. Here we test the hypothesis that this region, rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine (PEST) residues, serves as the E2A protein degradation domain (DD). An E2A protein lacking this region, E47Delta(478-531), was significantly more stable than wild-type E47(half-life of more than 6 h versus 55 min). Deletion of the E2A DD had no effect on the E-box-binding and transcriptional activity of E47. We mapped two discreet mUbc9-interacting regions within the E2A DD: amino acids 476-494 and 505-513. E2A(505-513) interacted with mUbc9 but not with human Ubc5, MyoD, Id3, or the polymyositis-scleroderma autoantigen. Substitution of the E2A(505-513) central hydrophobic residues with basic residues abolished interaction with mUbc9. Also, full-length E47 lacking the second mUbc9-interacting region was significantly more stable than wild-type E47. Reintroduction of the E2A DD into the long-lived, naturally occurring chimeric oncoprotein E2A-HLF (hepatic leukemic factor) destabilized it, suggesting that this domain can transfer a degradation signal to a heterologous protein. E2A-HLF-DD chimeric protein was stabilized by the proteasome inhibitor LLNL, indicating the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system mediating degradation through the E2A degradation domain. Our experiments indicate that the E2A DD mediates E2A protein interactions with the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that the E2A DD is required for metabolism of these widely expressed proteins.
