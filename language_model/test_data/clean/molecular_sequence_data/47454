The gene for human growth hormone receptor (hGHR) consists of at least 10 exons, and the corresponding protein is encoded in exons 2-10 which span at least 87 kbp of chromosome 5. Failure to amplify exons 3 and 8 of the hGHR gene from Japanese subjects with the previously reported primers prompted us to determine intron sequences flanking exon 3 and those flanking exon 8 of the hGHR gene, and novel intron sequences flanking exons 3 and 8 of the hGHR gene were identified. We designed new oligonucleotide primers based on these sequences, and successfully amplified DNA fragments encompassing exon 3 and those encompassing exon 8 of the hGHR gene. Since all of the 50 Japanese and the two Caucasians had the very same intron sequences which were different from the previously reported ones, it is more likely that the previously reported sequences were simply wrong than that there exist polymorphic differences in the intron sequences among different ethnic populations.
