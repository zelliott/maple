The cDNA coding for human skeletal muscle beta-tropomyosin was expressed in Escherichia coli to produce an unacetylated beta-tropomyosin. This cDNA was deleted from the sequence corresponding to the exon 9 and expressed in E. coli to produce an unacetylated beta-tropomyosin mutant lacking the C-terminal residues 254-284. The main structural and functional properties of the two isolated proteins, designated tropomyosin-1 and des-(254-284)-tropomyosin, respectively, were characterized in comparison with those of the genuine rabbit skeletal muscle alpha beta-tropomyosin. The folding and thermal stability of the three tropomyosins were indistinguishable. Tropomyosin-1, but not des-(254-284)-tropomyosin, was polymerized in the presence of troponin and did bind to actin in the presence of the troponin complex. Despite its weak binding to actin, des-(254-284)-tropomyosin displayed a regulatory function in the presence of troponin with a marked activation of the actomyosin subfragment-1 ATPase in the presence of Ca2+ and low concentrations of subfragment-1. The data were interpreted in the light of the allosteric models of regulation and suggest the involvement of the sequence coded by exon 9 in the stabilization by tropomyosin of the off state of the thin filament.
