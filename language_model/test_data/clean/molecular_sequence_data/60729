We present the mapping of two anti-human interleukin-10 (hIL-10) antibodies (CB/RS/2 and CB/RS/11) which have been described as binding their antigen cooperatively. The epitopes were identified using hIL-10-derived overlapping peptide scans prepared by spot synthesis. To identify residues essential for binding within the two epitopes, each position was replaced by all other L-amino acids. The epitope-derived peptides were further characterized with respect to antibody affinity and their inhibition of the antibody-hIL-10 interaction. One antibody (CB/RS/11) binds to residues which are completely buried in the X-ray structure of IL-10. Accessibility of this hidden epitope is enhanced upon binding of the antibody CB/RS/2, which recognizes a discontinuous epitope located nearby. The recognition of the hidden CB/RS/11 epitope, as well as the cooperative binding behaviour of the two antibodies, provides evidence that IL-10 can adopt a conformational state other than that observed in the crystal structure.
