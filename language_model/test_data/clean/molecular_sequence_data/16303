A detailed investigation of the Drosophila melanogaster mobile dispersed repetitive element jockey was performed. This is similar in its structural organization and coding potential to the long interspersed elements (LINEs) of various organisms. A complete copy of jockey (approx. 5 kb) is terminated with an oligodeoxynucleotide (dA) sequence preceded by two long open reading frames (ORFs) overlapping with a frameshift-1. Judging by the sequence homologies, ORF1 codes for a nucleic-acid-binding protein, and ORF2 for a reverse transcriptase which is most similar in its sequence to putative reverse transcriptase of other LINEs. As demonstrated by sequencing two deleted jockey copies, they contain only a small part of ORF2; however, other regions, including the terminal sequences, are highly conservative. The existence of a large number of jockey copies with a deletion in the second frame may indicate that they can use reverse transcriptase in trans.
