To investigate the effect of the yeast-conform variant of the Artemisia annua gene encoding for amorpha-4,11-diene synthase (ADS) on the production of amorpha-4,11-diene in a transformed yeast.

The ADS gene was mutated to the yeast-conform variant ADSm. The ADSm synthesis was performed based on step-by-step extension of a short region of the gene through a series of polymerase chain reactions (PCR). The artificial ADSm gene contained codons preferred by the yeast translation machinery. The sequence was then integrated into a yeast expression vector pYeDP60. The fusion construct was active and the transformed yeast cells produced higher level of amorpha-4,11-diene compared with the plant gene-transformed yeast cells.

Strains transformed with the yeast-conform allele (ADSm) were more efficient in terms of production of amorpha-4,11-diene than those transformed with the plant gene.

We demonstrated that yeast-conform allele of foreign genes by serial PCR reactions can be a solution to low efficiency of heterologous gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells.
