The polymerase chain reaction was used to identify novel IAI subgroup introns in cpDNA-enriched preparations from the interfertile green algae Chlamydomonas eugametos and Chlamydomonas moewusii. These experiments along with sequence analysis disclosed the presence, in both green algae, of a single IA1 intron in the psaB gene and of two group I introns (IA2 and IA1) in the psbC gene. In addition, two group I introns (IA1 and IB4) were found in the peptidyltransferase region of the mitochondrial large subunit rRNA gene at the same positions as previously reported Chlamydomonas chloroplast introns. The 188 bp segment preceding the first mitochondrial intron revealed extensive sequence similarity to the distantly spaced rRNA-coding modules L7 and L8 in the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mitochondrial DNA, indicating that these two modules have undergone rearrangements in Chlamydomonas. The IA1 introns in psaB and psbC were found to be related in sequence to the first intron in the C. moewusii chloroplast psbA gene. The similarity between the former introns extends to the immediate 5' flanking exon sequence, suggesting that group I intron transposition occurred from one of the two genes to the other through reverse splicing.
