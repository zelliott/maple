We have engineered the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei to assemble and secrete immunologically authentic engineered Fab antibody fragments into the culture medium. A major improvement in yield was achieved by fusing the heavy Fd chain to the T. reesei cellulase, CBHI. The yields of secreted, immunologically active Fab and CBHI-Fab fusion were 1 mg/l and 150 mg/l, respectively. The Fab fragment can be released from the fusion protein CBHI-Fab by an extracellular T. reesei protease. There was no detectable difference in affinity for the antigen between the engineered Fab and the idiotypic antibody.
