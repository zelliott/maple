We have performed analyses of single-strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCP) of the promoter region and the translated parts of the 18 exons of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. DNA from 20 unrelated familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients was studied. Four different running conditions were used for the nondenaturing gel electrophoresis to systematically evaluate how differences in the running conditions affect the sensitivity of the assay. These conditions were 15 W, 40 W, and 50 W in the absence of glycerol, and 50 W in the presence of 10% glycerol. SSCP analyses of the 18 PCR fragments for the 20 subjects revealed a total of 46 genotypes at 15 W, 45 at 50 W, 42 at 40 W, and 41 at 50 W with 10% glycerol. A total of 53 different genotypes were observed when the results of the four conditions were considered together. Assuming that the four conditions together detected 100% of the different genotypes, the sensitivity of the four individual conditions ranged between 87% (15 W) and 77% (50 W with 10% glycerol). There were marked differences among the different running conditions to detect abnormal SSCP patterns of individual exons. Therefore, different conditions should be used for the different exons of the LDLR gene.
