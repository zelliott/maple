Over the past year or so, methylation of histones has come to be recognised as a major player in the regulation of gene activity. This notion follows the discovery of lysine and arginine methyltransferases and proteins that recognise the methyl-lysine 'mark' on histones. Methylated histones have been implicated in heterochromatic repression, promoter regulation and the propagation of a repressed state via DNA methylation.
