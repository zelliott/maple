Eosinophil infiltration of the lung is a feature of both allergic and nonallergic asthma, and IL-5 is the key cytokine regulating the production and activation of these cells. Despite many studies focusing on the IL-5 promoter in both humans and mice there is as yet no clear picture of how the IL-5 gene is regulated. The aim of this study was to determine if distal regulatory elements contribute to appropriate regulation of the human IL-5 (hIL-5) gene. Activity of the -507/+44 hIL-5 promoter was compared to expression of the endogenous IL-5 gene in PER-117 T cells. The IL-5 promoter was not sufficient to reproduce a physiological pattern of IL-5 expression. Further, functional analysis of the 5' and 3' intergenic regions revealed a number of novel regulatory elements. We have identified a conserved enhancer located approximately 6.2 kb upstream of the hIL-5 gene. This region contains two potential GATA-3-binding sites and increases expression from the hIL-5 promoter by up to ninefold.
