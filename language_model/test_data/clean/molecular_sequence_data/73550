The pituitary hormone prolactin (prl) is implicated in a number of biological functions, especially lactation, which is mediated through specific lactogenic receptors (PrlR). Human growth hormone (hGH) is also a pituitary hormone responsible for linear growth. While the growth hormone receptor (hGHR) binds only hGH, hPrlR can interact with both hGH and hPrl. Using structural information from the human growth hormone (hGH)/receptor (hGHR) complex, we modeled by homology a complex between rabbit prolactin hormone (rbPrl) and its receptor (rbPrlR). While the somatogenic hormone/somatogenic receptor (hGH/hGHR) and somatogenic hormone/lactogenic receptor (hGH/hPrlR) interactions are now known and well studied, here we propose a model for the interaction of the lactogenic hormone with its receptor (rbPrl/rbPrlR), and compare these three kinds of ligand/receptor interaction. We identified residues contributing to the active site and tested the potential dimerization of the receptor. Biochemical studies and information deduced from the modeled complex do not exclude a homodimeric form but point to a functional heterodimeric complex.
