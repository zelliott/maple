Three distinct lineages of gymnopoid and marasmioid fungi are recognized in parsimony and Bayesian analyses of nLSU rDNA sequences. One lineage contains the genera Lentinula, Rhodocollybia, Tetrapyrgos, a resurrected and redefined Mycetinis, and two unresolved clades designated /marasmiellus and /gymnopus. /marasmiellus includes the type species of Marasmiellus and is dominated by members of Gymnopus sect. Vestipedes. /gymnopus includes the type species of Gymnopus, Micromphale and Setulipes, and members of Gymnopus sect. Levipedes. A second lineage includes the genera Marasmius s.s. and Crinipellis and represents a redefined /marasmiaceae. A third lineage includes the genera Cylindrobasidium, Flammulina, Gloiocephala, Physalacria, Strobilurus, Xerula and Marasmius sect. Epiphylli and represents /physalacriaceae. One new combination in Rhodocollybia and four new combinations in Mycetinis are proposed. A discussion of the taxonomic implications resulting from the phylogenetic reconstruction is presented.
