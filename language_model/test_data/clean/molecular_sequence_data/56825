We studied two patients with a leukaemic T cell lymphoma who presented with a marked increase in blood eosinophilia. To investigate the mechanism of the eosinophilia, supernatants of peripheral blood cells containing more than 80% lymphoma cells were tested by biological assays for the presence of colony stimulating factors (CSF). In one case supernatants stimulated the growth of granulocyte-macrophage (GM), erythroid and eosinophil colonies. These effects were neutralized by anti-GM-CSF antibodies; anti-IL5 antibodies slightly decreased eosinophil colony formation. Supernatants derived from the second patient cells stimulated the same lineages. Neutralizing experiments demonstrated that in addition to GM-CSF it contained interleukin 3 (IL-3) and interleukin 5 (IL-5). In agreement with the biological data, RNA studies using the polymerase chain reaction showed that cells from the first patient expressed GM-CSF transcripts; IL-5 transcripts were also detected in very low amounts. GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 transcripts were detected in cells from the second patient. Thus eosinophilia associated with some T cell lymphoma is likely due to secretion of different combinations of cytokines by malignant cells.
