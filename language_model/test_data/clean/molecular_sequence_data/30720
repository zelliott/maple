A major peptide related to the NH2-terminal fragment (position 1 to 76) of mammalian chromogranin A was isolated from ostrich adenohypophyses following acid-acetone extraction. The complete amino acid sequence of the homogenous peptide was deduced following automatic Edman degradation of the native peptide as well as of CNBr-, tryptic- and Lysobacter-derived peptides. The 76 amino acid sequence is strikingly homologous to bovine (80.3% sequence identity), porcine (79.0%), human (79.0%) and rat (72.4%) corresponding sequences, but much less so to human chromogranin B (22.4%). As this peptide is followed in bovine, porcine and human structure by a pair of basic residues (Lys-Lys), it could conceivably be produced during maturation in secretory granules. Finally, its structure appears to contain two potential amphipathic helices joined by the single disulfide bridge present in all chromogranin A and B molecules.
