Ceratocystis resinifera hyphae produce a black melanin pigment causing a deep stain in softwood logs. We exploited the homology of polyketide synthases to clone PKS1, a gene responsible for dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin biosynthesis in C. resinifera. Sequence analysis indicated that PKS1 has two introns near its 5(') end and encodes a 2188-amino acid polypeptide with five functional domains: beta-ketoacyl synthase, acyl transferase, two acyl carrier proteins and a thioesterase/Claisen cyclase. A gene disruption construct designed to replace a portion of PKS1 with a hygromycin resistance cassette was transformed into C. resinifera through Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. PKS1 null mutants had an albino phenotype, and pigmentation was restored by the addition of scytalone, a melanin pathway intermediate. The disruption of PKS1 and restoration of pigmentation with scytalone confirmed the presence of a dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin pathway in C. resinifera. The transformation method described in this paper is the first reported for a Ceratocystis species.
