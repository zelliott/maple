The complete nucleotide sequence of cherry leaf roll virus (CLRV, genus Nepovirus) from a naturally infected cherry tree (Prunus avium cv. Bing) in North America was determined. RNA1 and RNA2 consist of 7,893 and 6,492 nucleotides, respectively, plus a poly-(A) tail. Each RNA encodes a single potential open reading frame. The first 657 nucleotides of RNA1 and RNA2 are 99% identical and include the 5'-UTR and the first 214 deduced amino acids of the polyproteins following the first of two in-frame start codons. Phylogenetic analysis reveals close relationships between CLRV and members of subgroup C of the genus Nepovirus.
