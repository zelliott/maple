A taxonomic study was carried out on strain DLFJ1-1(T), which was isolated from an oil-degrading bacterial consortium, enriched by the surface seawater from around the Dalian Peninsula. The isolate was Gram-reaction-negative, oxidase- and catalase-positive, short-rod-shaped and non-motile. Growth was observed at salinities from 0.5 to 15 % and at temperatures from 4 to 37 °C; the strain was unable to degrade gelatin or to reduce nitrate. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain DLFJ1-1(T) belonged to the genus Thioclava, with the highest sequence similarity (96.4 %) to Thioclava pacifica TL 2(T), while the similarities to other species examined were all below 95.0 %. The principal fatty acids were C19 : 0ω8c cyclo and summed feature 8 (C18 : 1ω7c/ω6c). The major quinone of strain DLFJ1-1(T) was Q10. The major polar lipids of strain DLFJ1-1(T) were phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol. The G+C content of the chromosomal DNA was 62.5 mol%. The combined genotypic and phenotypic data show that strain DLFJ1-1(T) represents a novel species of the genus Thioclava, for which the name Thioclava dalianensis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain DLFJ1-1(T) ( = CGMCC 1.12325(T) = LMG 27290(T) = MCCC 1A03957(T)). An emended description of the genus Thioclava is also proposed.
