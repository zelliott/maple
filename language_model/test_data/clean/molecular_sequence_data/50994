A great challenge in understanding how different extracellular matrices assemble is to sort through the vast number of possible interactions between and among matrix molecules. The most profound insights are likely to come from patients with defined defects of matrix molecules and the use of transgenic mice or other experimental technologies that mimic the complexity of the human system.
