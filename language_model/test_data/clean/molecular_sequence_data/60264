Matrix metalloproteinase activity is instrumental in processes of cellular invasion. The interstitial invasion of endothelial cells during angiogenesis is accompanied by up-regulation of several matrix metalloproteinases, including membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). In this study, we show that endothelial cells stimulated to undergo angiogenesis by a three-dimensional extracellular matrix environment increase production of the transcription factor Egr-1. Increased binding of Egr-1 to the MT1-MMP promoter correlates with enhanced transcriptional activity, whereas mutations in the Egr-1 binding site abrogate the increased transcription of MT1-MMP in the stimulated cells. These data identify Egr-1-mediated transcription of MT1-MMP as a mechanism by which endothelial cells can initiate an invasive phenotype in response to an alteration in extracellular matrix environment, thus functionally associating MT1-MMP with a growing number of proteins known to be up-regulated by Egr-1 in response to tissue injury or mechanical stress.
