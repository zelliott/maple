We have explored the potential of irradiation-fusion gene transfer (IFGT) hybrids as a source of well-defined human chromosome fragments from which probes can be derived. Extensive characterization of the IFGT hybrid 4J4 with a full panel of markers from Chromosome (Chr) 6 showed that the human DNA content derives largely from 6p21.3 and 6q27. A cosmid library has been constructed from 4J4 DNA, and 370 recombinants containing human DNA have been isolated and overlapping clones ordered into 20 contigs. Regional localization of representative clones from each contig, determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), places 13 contigs in 6q27 and 6 in 6p21.3. Preliminary screening of cDNA libraries with selected cosmids has identified two expressed sequences. Since there are a number of medically important genes in both these regions of human Chr 6 with several disease loci linked to the HLA-A region in 6p21.3 and various tumor suppressor genes to 6q27, this library will provide a valuable resource to aid the isolation of candidate genes for these diseases. In addition, unique markers for detailed physical and genetic mapping of these regions of human Chr 6 can be easily obtained.
