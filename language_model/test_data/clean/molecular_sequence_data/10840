Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a family of angiogenic and mitogenic proteins that promote cell division. The binding of FGFs to the heparan sulfate of cell-surface-bound proteoglycans appears to be critical for their activity. The interaction of fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1 or aFGF) using heparin lyase-derived oligosaccharides from heparan sulfate was investigated. FGF-1 was also shown to protect sequences in heparan sulfate from heparin lyase digestion and protected oligosaccharide products of octasaccharide and decasaccharide size were recovered by FGF-1 affinity chromatography, suggesting that the high-affinity binding of heparan sulfate to FGF-1 resides within an octasaccharide sequence. The FGF-1 binding affinity of heparan sulfate is reduced compared to heparin presumably due to the absence of 6-sulfate groups in heparan sulfate. Inspection of the FGF-1 heparan sulfate binding domain shows that the majority of interacting amino acids are contained within a 20-amino-acid sequence that folds back upon itself (because of three turns) forming a triangular shaped cup of positive charge. The importance of FGF-1 binding site topology was investigated using three synthetic peptide mimics of the FGF-1 glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding site. Heparan sulfate affinity chromatography and isothermal titration calorimetry, used to measure binding thermodynamics, demonstrated that a synthetic peptide analogous to the GAG binding site in FGF-1 bound tightly to heparan sulfate. A peptide containing a D-proline in place of L-proline bound with considerably reduced affinity, presumably due to the altered structure of the second turn in the binding site. A cyclic peptide, expected to be topologically most similar to the triangular GAG binding site in FGF-1, bound with the highest affinity to heparan sulfate. These data suggest the triangular topology of the GAG binding site in FGF is critical for its interaction with heparan sulfate. Analysis of known GAG binding sites in 25 proteins using the Chou-Fasman algorithm show that these sites commonly contain turns.
