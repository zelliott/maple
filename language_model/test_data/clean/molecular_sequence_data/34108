Primers were developed for leafhoppers of the genus Aphrodes amplifying 84-244 bp fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene. DNA was extracted from legs of over 100-year-old archived museum specimens, amplified and sequenced. The fragments contain sufficient variation to unequivocally identify the different species. The majority of the analysed museum specimens, including three specimens of the syntype series for the UK endemic species A. aestuarina (Edwards 1908), were found to have been assigned to the wrong species. This work clearly underlines the need to validate museum specimens using molecular methods where identity is in doubt, based on reliable standards for species discrimination.
