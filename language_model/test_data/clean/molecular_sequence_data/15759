The genetic organization of the M RNA segment of snowshoe hare (SSH) virus, a member of the Bunyavirus genus of the family Bunyaviridae, has been determined. The middle (M) RNA segment has a single open reading frame (ORF) of 1441 amino acids. We have used amino- and carboxy-terminus sequencing and synthetic peptides to map proteins within the ORF. The order of the proteins translated from the single large open reading frame is G2, NSm, G1. The G2 protein extends from amino acids 14 to 299. The molecule is 286 residues long, with a computed nonglycosylated molecular weight of 31,973 Da. It is preceded by a cleaved 13 amino acid signal sequence. G2 includes a long highly hydrophobic sequence and contains three potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The G1 protein occupies the C-terminal end of the open reading frame from amino acids 474 to 1441 (968 amino acid residues) and has a computed nonglycosylated, molecular weight of 108,981 kDa. It has two potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and a potential transmembrane region followed by a potential cytoplasmic domain at the C-terminal end. If membrane associated it has an orientation of N-terminus outer, C-terminus inner. Limited trypsin digestion removes a 33-kDa fragment from the N-terminal end, leaving a virion-associated truncated G1 molecule (amino acids 762 to 1441) with a single N-linked glycosylation site. Between the G2 and G1 molecules there are 174 amino acids, sufficient to code for 19 kDa of protein. Some antibodies raised against peptides within this region react with proteins of 11 kDa (NSm) and 10 kDa present in infected cell lysates, but the exact relationship of these proteins to the open reading frame remains to be determined.
