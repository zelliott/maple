A genomic locus was discovered within Brucella abortus that contains a novel transposon-like element designated Tn2020. Tn2020 is bounded by a copy of an insertion sequence designated IS2020 and a truncated imperfect copy of IS2020 (tIS2020A). The truncated copy is immediately adjacent to a second copy of IS2020. These data are consistent with the locus having evolved by a complex rearrangement following the transposition of a second copy of Tn2020. Analysis of the organization, orientation, and open reading frames (ORFs) of IS2020 places it within the IS6 family. Four ORFs from Tn2020 were translated in vitro producing a potential transposase with an apparent molecular mass of 27.5 kDa, and three polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 71 kDa, 22 kDa, and 14 kDa. The central region of Tn2020 encodes the 71 kDa and 14 kDa proteins, while the 22 kDa protein is likely an internal translation initiation product of the IS2020 transposase. The 71 kDa protein shares sequence similarity with several bacterial transcriptional regulatory proteins and may form a helix-turn-helix structure capable of binding DNA. No homologous protein sequences to the 14 kDa peptide were detected in available databases. The 27.5 kDa transposase and its 22 kDa internal translation product shared significant similarity to several transposases from diverse bacterial hosts. Immediately 5' of Tn2020 are genes encoding ribosomal proteins RplU and RpmA. This region also contains a 90 bp sequence that shares significant homology to a repetitive element with inverted repeats from the Sinorhizobium genome. Downstream from Tn2020 is an ORF encoding a protein having significant similarity to a hypothetical protein from Caulobacter. The locus is lower in G+C content from that of the genome. These data suggest that lateral transfer of genetic material has occurred.
