Using a site-directed mutagenesis technique we constructed a new feline herpesvirus-1 recombinant strain containing a deletion in two genes encoding glycoproteins gI and gE. These proteins may have a role in virulence, the establishment of latency, and viral recurrence as shown in other herpesviruses of the varicella and simplex types. This recombinant was characterized and used to immunize juvenile cats against virulent virus challenge. Significant protection resulted from vaccination of cats by the subcutaneous route.
