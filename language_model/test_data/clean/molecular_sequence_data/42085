The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used to detect mycoplasma contamination in a panel of 42 continuous cell lines. According to the microbiological cultivation assay on agar, 29 cell lines were chronically infected and 13 cell lines were negative. Sets of outer and inner primers (nested double-step PCR) were applied which anneal to DNA sequences coding for conserved regions of the 16S rRNA. These oligonucleotides allow for the amplification of DNA regions found in at least 25 mycoplasma species (including the ones most commonly found in cell cultures), but do not cross-hybridize with DNA from eukaryotic cells. Mycoplasma-positive cell lines showed distinctive bands in ethidium bromide-stained gels, both after the first round of amplification as well as after the second PCR; all agar-negative cell lines were also unambiguously negative in the PCR assay. Thus, neither false-positive nor false-negative results occurred. Provided that the proper PCR working conditions are scrupulously observed, the PCR amplification has several outstanding advantages: high sensitivity, specificity, reliability, objectivity, speed, and simplicity.
