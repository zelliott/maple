Since its discovery, 5-hydroxytryptamine, more usually called serotonin, has been an elusive candidate as a major mood regulator. This capacity gives it a great importance in the treatment of depression. It is within this framework that our work takes place, as it is related more particularly to a new therapeutic class whose leader is agomelatine. This compound binds to the melatoninergic receptors and to the serotoninergic 5-HT2c receptor, giving rise to the MASSA concept (Melatonin Agonist and Selective Serotonin Antagonist). Like the majority of the serotoninergic receptors, the sub-type 5-HT2c is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). The three-dimensional structure of 5-HT2c is not experimentally known, and we thus resorted to comparative homology modelling to build a model allowing us to study its interactions with agomelatine.
