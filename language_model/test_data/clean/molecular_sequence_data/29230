The 26S proteasome is known to play central roles in the growth of many eukaryotes. However, little is known regarding its distribution in higher plants. Here, we report the spatial distribution pattern of Rpn3 (a regulatory PA700 subunit) and C2 (a subunit of the 20S proteasome) in rice ( Oryza sativa L.) seedlings as determined by in situ hybridization. The transcripts were abundantly co-expressed in the apical and marginal meristems of shoots and roots. Interestingly, these transcripts also accumulated in the leaf and ligule primordia of the shoot apex. Our results suggest that the 26S proteasome is spatially distributed among various tissues and may be involved not only in cell division but also in organ formation in higher plants.
