Receptor CD4, expressed on the surface of immunocompetent cells, plays the key role in the pathogenesis of HIV infection, facilitating the penetration of the virus into the susceptible tissues of the host body. In this work the nucleotide sequence of the site on the gene of receptor CD4, responsible for the regulation of its transcription, has been determined.
