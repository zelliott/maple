The gene encoding lipoamide dehydrogenase from Azotobacter vinelandii has been cloned in Escherichia coli. Fragments of 9-23 kb from Azotobacter vinelandii chromosomal DNA obtained by partial digestion with Sau3A were ligated into the BamHI site of plasmid pUC9. E. coli TG2 cells were transformed with the resulting recombinant plasmids. Screening for clones which produced A. vinelandii lipoamide dehydrogenase was performed with antibodies raised against the purified enzyme. A positive colony was found which produced complete chains of lipoamide dehydrogenase as concluded form SDS gel electrophoresis of the cell-free extract, stained for protein or used for Western blotting. After subcloning of the 14.7-kb insert of this plasmid the structural gene could be located on a 3.2-kb DNA fragment. The nucleotide sequence of this subcloned fragment (3134 bp) has been determined. The protein-coding sequence of the gene consists of 1434 bp (478 codons, including the AUG start codon and the UAA stop codon). It is preceded by an intracistronic region of 85 bp and the structural gene for succinyltransferase. A putative ribosome-binding site and promoter sequence are given. The derived amino acid composition is in excellent agreement with that previously published for the isolated enzyme. The predicted relative molecular mass is 50223, including the FAD. The overall homology with the E. coli enzyme is high with 40% conserved amino acid residues. From a comparison with the three-dimensional structure of the related enzyme glutathione reductase [Rice, D. W., Schultz, G. E. & Guest, J. R. (1984) J. Mol. Biol. 174, 483-496], it appears that essential residues in all four domains have been conserved. The enzyme is strongly expressed, although expression does not depend on the vector-encoded lacZ promoter. The cloned enzyme is, in all the respects tested, identical with the native enzyme.
