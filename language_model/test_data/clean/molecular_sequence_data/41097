Vps74p, a member of the GOLPH3 protein family, binds directly to coatomer and the cytoplasmic tails of a subset of Golgi-resident glycosyltransferases to mediate their Golgi retention. We identify a cluster of arginine residues at the N-terminal end of GOLPH3 proteins that are necessary and sufficient to mediate coatomer binding. While loss of coatomer binding renders Vps74p non-functional for glycosyltransferase retention, the Golgi membrane-binding capabilities of the mutant protein are not significantly reduced. We establish that the oligomerization status and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate-binding properties of Vps74p largely account for the membrane-binding capacity of the protein and identify an Arf1p-Vps74p interaction as a potential contributing factor in Vps74p Golgi membrane association.
