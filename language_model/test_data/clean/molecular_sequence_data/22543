The feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) vaccines that are currently in wide use are generally poor inducers of virus-neutralizing antibodies, although such antibodies appear after recovering from challenge. However, the presence of neutralizing antibodies in cats recovering from natural FeLV infection clearly correlates with resistance to subsequent infection and passive transfer of antibodies can protect other animals. After demonstrating the induction of neutralizing antibodies in rats and goats immunized with the transmembrane envelope protein p15E of FeLV, cats were immunized with the same antigen. High titres of neutralizing antibodies specific for FeLV were induced and epitope mapping revealed a pattern of recognition similar to that seen following immunization of rats and goats. These epitopes are highly related to epitopes recognized after immunization with porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) p15E and to epitopes recognized by neutralizing antibodies in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. The ability of p15E to induce neutralizing antibodies in cats suggests that it should be included in the next generation of vaccines. In contrast, sera from FeLV-infected animals usually fail to recognize the neutralization-relevant epitopes in p15E. Since homologous epitope sequences are present in feline endogenous retroviruses, it appears that tolerance against these sequences is not induced.
