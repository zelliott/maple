Entomopathogenic bacteria of the genus Photorhabdus harbor a type III secretion system. This system was probably acquired prior to the separation of the species within this genus. Furthermore, the core components of the secretion machinery are highly conserved but the predicted effectors differ between Photorhabdus luminescens and P. asymbiotica, two highly related species with different hosts.
