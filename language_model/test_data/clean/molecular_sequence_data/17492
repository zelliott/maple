Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), a pathogen of major economic importance to the world's poultry industries, causes a severe immunodepressive disease in young chickens. Maternal antibodies are able to protect the progeny passively from IBDV infection. The gene encoding the IBDV host-protective antigen (VP2) has been cloned and expressed in yeast resulting in the production of an antigen that very closely resembles native VP2. When injected into specific pathogen free chickens a single dose of microgram quantities of the yeast derived antigen induces high titres of virus neutralizing antibodies that are capable of passively protecting young chickens from infection with IBDV.
