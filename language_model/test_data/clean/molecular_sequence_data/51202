Systematic theoretical modeling of symmetric DNA oligomers, carried out earlier for the B conformation, is now extended to A-DNA. In contrast to the previous results, it is found that A-DNA shows no multiplicity of low-energy substate conformations. The possibilities of the Jumna algorithm are subsequently applied to studying deformations of the oligomers. Controlled winding and stretching deformations are used to study how the two allomorphs and different base sequences absorb such external stress. The results help explain the internal mechanics of the DNA double helix and the extent to which fine structure influences this behavior. The results point to some differences between the A and B double helices, but also to many similarities. Sequence effects on flexibility are relatively limited compared to their impact on optimal energy conformations. It is also shown that the conformational substates detected for B-DNA oligomers are preserved under deformation, but have little influence on its energetics.
