Fifty cosmids from the ICRF, London, and Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, California, human chromosome 22 cosmid libraries were isolated, regionally assigned and tested for their ability to detect repeats or single copy sequences. The search resulted in nine cosmids containing repetitive motifs from the pericentric region of chromosome 22. An additional 19 cosmids, that detected single copy sequences in the long arm of chromosome 22q: 7 in the region 22q11.2-q13.1 and 12 in 22q13.1-qter, were mapped more precisely by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Three out of these 19 recombinants displayed restriction fragments containing (CA)n repeats, were subcloned and sequenced. One cosmid, representing a region coding for an ubiquitous 300-bp transcript, is localized 600 kb from PDGFB, and four cosmids contained sequences surrounding the ARSA gene at 22q13.3. Presently, long range physical maps, that may be useful for analysing structural alterations of chromosome 22q13, are being constructed from these additional, regionally assigned markers from chromosome 22q13 employing both existing cosmid and new bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries.
