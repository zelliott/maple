The four vertebrate glypican-related integral membrane proteoglycans identified so far constitute a discrete family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans that are linked to the cell surface via glycosyl phosphatidylinositol. In addition to the GPI anchor and substitution with heparan sulfate, the members of this family show significant sequence homology and share a unique and characteristic cysteine motif. Starting from an EST entry that showed significant sequence similarity to MXR7 and OCI-5 (coding, respectively, for human and rat glypican-3), we have isolated a human cDNA coding for glypican-5, a novel member of this proteoglycan family. The gene for this novel glypican (GPC5) maps to 13q32. In the adult, it is primarily expressed in brain tissue.
