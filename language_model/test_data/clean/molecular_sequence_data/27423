Breu Branco virus (BE AR 492347) was isolated from Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) triannulatus mosquitoes captured in Tucuruí, Pará State, northern Brazil, in 1988. No cross-reactivity by complement-fixation tests was observed between Breu Branco virus and other known arboviruses. Results of electron microscopy and physicochemical tests suggested that Breu Branco virus may be a member of the family Reoviridae. In order to elucidate its taxonomic status, a comprehensive genetic characterization was conducted for Breu Branco virus and related strains (BE AR 494475 and BE AR 486204) that were also isolated from Anopheles mosquitoes in the same area. This included full-length genome sequencing, determination of genetic traits and phylogenetic analysis. Breu Branco virus showed a similar genome organization to members of the genus Orbivirus, family Reoviridae. Genetically, Breu Branco virus was indistinguishable from strains BE AR 494475 and BE AR 486204. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that Breu Branco virus BE AR 492347 and its related strains constitute a novel species of the genus Orbivirus. Breu Branco virus is the first Brazilian orbivirus and the fifth orbivirus in the world to be sequenced fully.
