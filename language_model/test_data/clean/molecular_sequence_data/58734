NFAT1 (NFATp), a cytosolic component of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), is encoded by a single gene which was mapped to mouse chromosome 2 in the vicinity of the wasted (wst) locus. Although wasted mice display a severe immune disorder, they express normal levels of NFAT1 protein. The NFAT1 protein in wasted mice is properly regulated and possesses comparable DNA binding activity as that in their littermate controls. Therefore, the wasted phenotype is not due to a defect in the expression or early regulation of the NFAT1 protein.
