cDNAs encoding the isoform I alpha of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase were isolated from a bovine trachea smooth muscle cDNA library constructed in lambda gt10. The deduced protein sequence is identical with the protein sequence obtained by Edman degradation of the bovine lung enzyme [(1984) Biochemistry 23, 4207-4218]. Alternate cDNA clones were isolated which code for a protein slightly different within the aminoterminal part from the known amino acid sequence. These alternate cDNAs contain the sequence of a peptide identified in the isoform I beta of cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from bovine trachea smooth muscle indicated the presence of two different mRNA species of about 6.2 kb.
