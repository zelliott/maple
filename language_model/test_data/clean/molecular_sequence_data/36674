We report the cDNA sequence and predicted amino acid sequence of a novel type I keratin, designated as GK50, and show that keratin expression in the goldfish optic nerve is highly complex. The GK50 protein is one of at least three type I keratins expressed in goldfish optic nerve based on both antibody reactivity and blot-binding to the type II keratin ON3. After optic nerve crush in situ hybridization shows a localized increase in GK50 mRNA expression in the crush zone. This is in contrast to ON3 mRNA which shows a localized increase that is limited to the proximal and distal margins of the crush zone, suggesting a diversity of keratin expression in different cell types of the goldfish optic nerve.
