The complete amino acid sequence of mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase from rabbit liver was determined. The sequence was obtained from analysis of peptides isolated from chymotryptic, cyanogen bromide, and limited acid cleavages of the protein. The enzyme consists of four identical subunits, each of 475 residues, i.e. 8 residues shorter than the subunit of the corresponding cytosolic isoenzyme. The sequences of the two rabbit proteins are easily aligned, provided a gap of 5 residues near the amino terminus and a gap of 3 residues near the carboxyl terminus are included in the mitochondrial sequence. The overall degree of identity between the two isoenzymes is 61.9%, whereas the structural identity of each eukaryotic isoenzyme with the corresponding Escherichia coli enzyme is about 40%. The rabbit isoenzymes are about 70 residues longer than the E. coli enzyme, with one-half of these residues accounted for by insertions in both isoenzymes near their carboxyl terminus. Predictions of secondary structure and calculations of hydropathy profiles are also presented, suggesting an even more extensive degree of identity in the three-dimensional folding of the three proteins, in accord with the known similarity of their catalytic properties. Evidence was obtained for the existence of additional molecular forms of the mitochondrial protein, differing in the absence of some amino acid residues at the amino terminus of the polypeptide chain.
