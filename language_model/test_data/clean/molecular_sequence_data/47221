Basic nuclear proteins were isolated from the sperm of the Syrian hamster Mesocricetus auratus and characterized by gel electrophoresis, amino acid analysis, and sequencing. Analyses of the proteins by gel electrophoresis show that sperm of this species contain both protamines 1 and 2. The two proteins were purified by HPLC and the complete primary sequence of hamster protamine 1 was determined by automated amino acid sequence analysis. The protein sequence was subsequently confirmed by sequencing the PCR-amplified protamine 1 gene. The first forty-two residues of the hamster protamine 2 sequence were obtained by amino acid sequence analysis of the isolated protein, and this sequence was also confirmed and extended by sequencing the gene. Total basic nuclear protein was also isolated from sperm of six other species of hamsters, the protamines were identified by HPLC and amino acid analysis, and the proportion of protamines 1 and 2 in each species was determined. Marked differences in the protamine 2 content of sperm were observed among the different species of hamster. This variation and the high level of sequence similarity between mouse and hamster protamines provide insight into how the two protamines may be organized in sperm chromatin. Mol. Reprod.
