We describe the generation of Dictyostelium discoideum cell lines that carry different suppressor tRNA genes. These genes were constructed by primer-directed mutagenesis changing a tRNA(Trp)(CCA) gene from D. discoideum to a tRNA(Trp)(amber) gene and changing a tRNA(Glu)(UUC) gene from D. discoideum to a tRNA(Glu)(ochre) as well as a tRNA(Glu)(amber) gene. These genes were stably integrated into the D. discoideum genome together with a reporter gene. An actin 6::lacZ gene fusion carrying corresponding translational stop signals served as a reported. Active beta-galactosidase is expressed only in D. discoideum strains that contain, in addition to the reporter, a functional suppressor tRNA. Both amber suppressors are active in D. discoideum without interfering significantly with cell growth and development. We failed, however, to establish cell lines containing a functional tRNA(Glu)(ochre) suppressor. This may be due to the fact that nearly every message from D. discoideum known so far terminates with UAA. Therefore a tRNA capable of reading this termination codon may not be compatible with cell growth.
