A strategy for detection of mutations in CLN3, the gene for Batten disease or juvenile onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, has been devised using a technique which detects conformation polymorphisms and direct sequencing of genomic DNA fragments. We define two mutations found uniquely in Finnish patients, one a large deletion (2.8 kb), the other a point mutation affecting the 5'splice donor site of an intron.
