Boc-L-Asn-L-Pro-OBzl: C21H29O6N3.CH3OH, Mr = 419.48 + CH3 OH, monoclinic, P2(1), a = 10.049(1), b = 10.399(2), c = 11.702(1) A, beta = 92.50(1)degrees, V = 1221.7(3) A3, dx = 1.14 g.cm-3, Z = 2, CuK alpha (lambda = 1.54178 A), F(000) = 484 (with solvent), 23 degrees, unique reflections (I greater than 3 sigma(I)) = 1745, R = 0.043, Rw = 0.062, S = 1.66. Boc-beta-cyano-L-alanine-L-Pro-OBzl: C21H27O5N3, Mr = 401.46, orthorhombic, P2(1)2(1)2(1), a = 15.741(3), b = 21.060(3), c = 6.496(3) A, V = 2153(1) A3, dx = 1.24 g.cm-3, Z = 4, CuK alpha (lambda = 1.54178 A), F(000) = 856, 23 degrees, unique reflections (I greater than 3 sigma(I)) = 1573, R = 0.055, Rw = 0.078, S = 1.86. The tert.-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) protected dipeptide benzyl ester (OBzl), Boc-L-Asn-L-Pro-OBzl, prepared from a mixed anhydride reaction using isobutylchloroformate, Boc-L-asparagine, and HCl.L-proline-OBzl, crystallized with one methanol per asymmetric unit in an extended conformation with the Asn-Pro peptide bond trans. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding occurs between the methanol and the Asn side chain and between the peptide backbone and the Asn side chain. A minor impurity due to the dehydration of the Asn side chain to a beta-CNala crystallized with a similar extended conformation and a single intermolecular hydrogen bond.
