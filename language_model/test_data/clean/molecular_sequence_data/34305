SOCS-1 is a critical regulator of multiple signaling pathways, including those activated by cytokines that regulate Ig H chain class switching to IgE. Analysis of mice with mutations in the SOCS-1 gene demonstrated that IgE levels increase with loss of SOCS-1 alleles. This suggested that overall SOCS-1 acts as an inhibitor of IgE expression in vivo. A genetic association study was performed in 474 children enrolled in the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study to determine if genetic variation in the SOCS-1 locus correlates with altered levels of IgE. Carriers of the C-allele for a novel, 3' genomic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the SOCS-1 gene (SOCS1+1125G > C; rs33932899) were found to have significantly lower levels of serum IgE compared with those of homozygotes for the G-allele. Analysis demonstrated that the SOCS1+1125G > C SNP was in complete linkage disequilibrium with an SNP at position SOCS1-820G > T (rs33977706) of the SOCS-1 promoter. Carriers of the T-allele at the SOCS1-820G > T were also found to be associated with the decreased IgE. The promoter SNP increased transcriptional activity of the SOCS-1 promoter in reporter assays and human B cells. Consistent with this observation, the presence of this polymorphism within the promoter abolished binding of yin yang-1, which is identified as a negative regulator of SOCS-1 transcriptional activity. These data suggest that genetic variation in the SOCS-1 promoter may affect IgE production.
