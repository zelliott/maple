The mitochondrial selenoprotein is a major structural protein of the keratinous mitochondrial capsule in mammalian sperm, a structure that functions in shaping mitochondria into the helical sheath surrounding the flagellum. A cDNA clone (Kleene et al., 1990) was isolated previously encoding a protein whose predicted size and amino acid content of > 20% cysteine and proline closely resembled a selenoprotein in the bull mitochondrial capsule. The sequences of additional cDNAs and genomic DNA reported here reveal that the mouse mitochondrial capsule selenoprotein reading frame begins 54 codons further upstream than previously reported. Significantly, these 54 codons contain three in-phase UGA codons, which normally signify stop but encode selenocysteine in bacterial and mammalian selenoproteins. The coding region of the mitochondrial capsule selenoprotein gene is interrupted by a single intron. S1 mapping and primer extension demonstrate that the vast majority of MCS mRNAs are spliced using consensus 5' and 3' slice junctions in mammalian cells. However, two cDNAs have been identified that apparently represent rare mRNA variants produced by use of cryptic splice sites.
