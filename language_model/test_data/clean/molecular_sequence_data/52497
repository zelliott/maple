In the chestnut-blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica, a plasmid, pCRY1, occurs in the mitochondria of several strains isolated at various locations in the northeastern United States and Canada. The monomer of this plasmid is a 4.2-kb circular double-stranded DNA that has no detectable sequence homology with the 160-kb mitochondrial DNA of Ep155, a standard virulent laboratory strain of C. parasitica. The circular nature and oligomeric characteristics of the plasmid were deduced from the heterogeneous size of plasmid DNA molecules as detected by one- and two-dimensional gel-electrophoresis, the nature and alignment of restriction fragments, and the lack of detectable termini in the nucleotide sequence. The cytoplasmic location of the plasmid was deduced from its co-purification with mitochondria, uniparental (maternal) transmission in sexual crosses, dissociation from the nuclei of the donor strain during its horizontal transfer between vegetatively compatible strains through hyphal anastomoses, and mitochondrial codon usage (UGA = Try). The pCRY1 plasmid contains a long open reading frame that is transcribed and potentially encodes a unique 1214 amino-acid, B-family DNA polymerase similar to those encoded by the LaBelle and Fiji circular mitochondrial plasmids of Neurospora. In this subgroup of proteins, the DTD motif characteristic of B-family DNA polymerases is replaced by TTD. Amino-acid motifs related to those that are characteristic of the 3'-->5' exonuclease domains of B-family DNA polymerases have been located in the amino-terminal portion of the proteins. A comparison of isogenic plasmid-free and plasmid-containing cultures indicates that pCRY1 is an infectious agent that effects a reduction in the pathogenicity of some, but not all, strains of C. parasitica.
