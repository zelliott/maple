PYRIN- and CARD-containing proteins belong to a recently identified protein family involved in the regulation of apoptosis and inflammatory processes. Variations in the gene products of the family members PYPAF1 and NOD2/CARD15 have been associated with several autoinflammatory diseases. We could identify the mouse orthologs of PYPAF1, PYPAF5, NOD1, NOD2 and the rat ortholog of PYPAF5. Intriguingly, we found that PYPAF5 has been reported previously not only as regulator of NF-kappaB and caspase-1, but also as angiotensin II and vasopressin receptor. In particular, based on a comprehensive sequence analysis, we propose a structural model for this hormone receptor that is different from the model suggested previously.
