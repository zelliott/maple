Three dominant cell surface proteins of Corynebacterium ammoniagenes ATCC 6872 were identified in the cell wall fraction. The cspA gene, which encodes one of the major cell surface proteins, was cloned using the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein. Then the cloned chromosomal fragment containing the cspA gene was sequenced and was shown to encode a mature polypeptide of 333 amino acids with a molecular mass of 36654 Da. The amino acid sequence of the cspA gene showed similarity to the amino acid sequence of C. glutamicum CspA, one of the two major secreted proteins of C. glutamicum, although C. ammoniagenes CspA and C. glutamicum CspA differed in size. Northern blot analysis and primer extension analysis respectively revealed a 1.1 kb transcript and a promoter sequence resembling that of the C. ammoniagenes fatty acid synthase B (fasB) gene.
