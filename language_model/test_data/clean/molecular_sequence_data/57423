Based on selective labeling by ATP analogues, Lys68 of the Calvin Cycle enzyme phosphoribulokinase (PRK) from spinach has been assigned to the active-site region [Miziorko et al. (1990), J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3642-3647]. The equivalent position is occupied by lysyl or arginyl residues in the PRK from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources, suggesting a requirement for a basic residue at this location. To examine this possibility, we have replaced Lys68 of the spinach enzyme with arginyl, glutaminyl, alanyl, or glutamyl residues by site-directed mutagenesis. All of the mutant enzymes retain substantial kinase activity; and even in the case of the radical substitution by glutamate, the Km values for ATP and ribulose 5-phosphate are not perturbed significantly. Glutamate at position-68 may destabilize tertiary structure, because the yield of this mutant protein from transformed E. coli is quite low compared to that of the other proteins in this series. Despite the active-site proximity of Lys68, our results show that this residue does not play a key role in catalysis or substrate binding.
