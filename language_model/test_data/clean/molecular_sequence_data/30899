MK is a gene that is expressed temporarily during the early stages of retinoic acid-induced differentiation of embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells and during the mid-gestation period of mouse embryogenesis. The 5'-regions of MK cDNAs and their mRNAs are heterogeneous; so far three kinds of MK cDNAs (MK1, MK2, and MK3) have been isolated. The MK gene was cloned from a genomic DNA library of a BALB/c mouse, and its structure was elucidated. 5'-Region sequences specific for MK1, MK2, and MK3 were arranged in the order of MK3, MK2, and MK1. Then, there was a sequence common to all MK cDNAs consisting of four exons. The results indicate that different species of MK mRNA are generated by the use of alternative promoters and different modes of splicing.
