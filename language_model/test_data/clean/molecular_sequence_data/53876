Small aquarium fishes become increasingly important in the study of normal vertebrate development and disease. Differential DNA methylation might play a role in these processes. In the teleost Xiphophorus, a well-established animal model for melanoma formation, tumour-specific hypomethylation of the melanoma-inducing gene ONC-Xmrk has been observed. We have isolated a cDNA for the DNA-(cytosine-5)-methyltransferase XDNMT-1 from this organism, which encodes the first full-length protein from a fish species. Linkage analysis showed that Xdnmt-1 is different from the Xiphophorus tumour suppressor R, which is involved in the transcriptional repression of the ONC-Xmrk melanoma oncogene in healthy fish. As methylation has been implicated in the regulation of ONC-Xmrk expression, XDNMT-1 might play a role by acting up- or downstream of R. Expression analysis demonstrated that the Xdnmt-1 transcript is present in all adult tissues and cell lines tested. However, developing embryos show a spatially and temporally regulated expression pattern suggesting that the enzyme might play a role during development in fish.
