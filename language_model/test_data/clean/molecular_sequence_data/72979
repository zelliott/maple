Spectrin isotypes segregate in neurons and are differentially distributed between axons and somatodendritic compartments. Their functions in those compartments are likely to be mediated by proteins that interact selectively with one or other isotype. Fodaxin (an axon-specific protein previously termed A60) colocalizes in CNS neurons with axonal spectrin and in vitro binds brain spectrin (a mixture of alpha I, beta I, and beta II polypeptides) but not erythrocyte spectrin (alpha I and beta I). Because alpha II and beta II spectrin polypeptides are enriched in axons, we investigated a possible binding of fodaxin to the types of spectrin found in axons. Fodaxin did not bind to isolated brain alpha chains. Bacterially expressed C-terminal segments 18-19 of beta II spectrin bound to fodaxin and inhibited the binding of fodaxin to whole brain spectrin. By contrast, recombinant segments 18-19 of the somatodendritic beta I sigma 2 spectrin showed no interaction with fodaxin. Within beta II, fodaxin binding activity was localized to residues 2,087-2,198, which are unique to beta II and link between the end of segment 18 and the pleckstrin homology domain in segment 19. The divergent regions of sequence in segments 19 of beta II and beta I sigma 2 are candidates to mediate the isotype-specific functions of spectrin. Fodaxin is the first protein to be described that discriminates between the unique regions of beta spectrin isoforms.
