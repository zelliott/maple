We have previously shown using gene targeting that PU.1 is essential for the development of lymphoid and myeloid lineages during fetal liver hematopoiesis. We now show that PU.1 is required for the maturation of yolk sac-derived myeloid progenitors and for the differentiation of ES cells into macrophages. The role of PU.1 in regulating target genes, thought to be critical in the development of monocytes and granulocytes, has been analyzed. Early genes such as GM-CSFR, G-CSFR, and myeloperoxidase are expressed in PU.1-/- embryos and differentiated PU.1-/- ES cells. However, the expression of genes associated with terminal myeloid differentiation (CD11b, CD64, and M-CSFR) is eliminated in differentiated PU.1-/- ES cells. Development of macrophages is restored with the introduction of a PU.1 cDNA regulated by its own promoter. The PU.1-/- ES cells represent an important model for analyzing myeloid cell development.
