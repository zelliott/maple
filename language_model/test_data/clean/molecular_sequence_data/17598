The gene for the secreted neutral metalloprotease, immune inhibitor A (InA), from Bacillus thuringiensis var. alesti has been cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence has been confirmed by partial amino acid sequencing. The central part of the amino acid sequence showed similarity to the active site in thermolysin. Southern and Western blots show that InA-related sequences are common among other B. thuringiensis subspecies. In Western blots, 17 out of 25 tested species gave a positive signal. Culture filtrates from subspecies expressing InA were toxic when injected in Trichoplusia ni larvae, whereas filtrate from a strain negative in Western blot had no effect when injected. The LD50 dose of purified InA protein injected in T. ni larvae was 12.5 +/- 2.5 ng per mg of larval body weight.
