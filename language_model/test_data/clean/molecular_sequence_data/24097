Because of their relative simplicity, synthetic receptors often lack the selectivity observed for biopolymer receptors, such as aptamers. However, aptamer recognition of ligands is limited by the chemistries inherent in the four canonical nucleotides. Here, we report the design and selection of a ternary complex in which the specificity of a bis-boronic acid synthetic host (1) that binds to various carboxylic acids is tuned by a surrounding aptamer. Although, the synthetic receptor alone has higher selectivity for citrate over DL-tartrate, the formation of the aptamer:receptor complex reversed the organic host selectivity to preferentially bind tartrate. The RNA conformation changed upon the introduction of the synthetic host, consistent with an induced-fit mechanism for binding.
