A total of 59 bacteria samples from Antarctic sea water were collected and screened for their ability to produce alpha-amylase. The highest activity was recorded from an isolate identified as an Alteromonas species. The purified alpha-amylase shows a molecular mass of about 50,000 Da and a pI of 5.2. The enzyme is stable from pH 7.5 to 9 and has a maximal activity at pH 7.5. Compared with other alpha-amylases from mesophiles and thermophiles, the "cold enzyme" displays a higher activity at low temperature and a lower stability at high temperature. The psychrophilic alpha-amylase requires both Cl- and Ca2+ for its amylolytic activity. Br- is also quite efficient as an allosteric effector. The comparison of the amino acid composition with those of other alpha-amylases from various organisms shows that the cold alpha-amylase has the lowest content in Arg and Pro residues. This could be involved in the principle used by the psychrophilic enzyme to adapt its molecular structure to the low temperature of the environment.
