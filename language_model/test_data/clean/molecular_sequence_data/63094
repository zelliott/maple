Parasite glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) is an important toxin in malaria disease, and people living in malaria-endemic regions often produce high levels of anti-GPI antibodies. The natural anti-GPI antibody response needs to be understood to aid the design of an efficient carbohydrate-based antitoxin vaccine. We present a versatile approach based on a synthetic GPI glycan array to correlate anti-GPI antibody levels and protection from severe malaria.
