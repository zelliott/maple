Cephamycin C is produced in a nine steps pathway by the actinomycetes S. clavuligerus and N. lactamdurans. The genes encoding the biosynthesis enzymes are clustered in both microorganisms as well as in the cephabacin producer Lysobacter lactamgenus, a Gram negative bacterium. The clusters of genes include genes encoding enzymes common to the biosynthesis of penicillin and cephalosporin C by the eukaryotic producers Penicillium chrysogenum and Cephalosporium acremonium and genes for steps specific for the formation of the precursor alpha-aminoadipic acid as well as for the enzymes involved in the late modification of the cephalosporin intermediates of the pathway. Present are also genes for proteins involved in the export and/or resistance to cephamycin C. In S. clavuligerus a gene encoding a regulatory protein controlling the formation of cephamycin C and clavulanic acid is also present in the cluster.
