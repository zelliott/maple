Using a radish cDNA probe, we have isolated and characterized two genomic clones from Arabidopsis thaliana (GEA1 and GEA6) encoding two different proteins that are homologous to the "Early methionine-labelled" (Em) protein of wheat. GEA1 differs from GEA6 and Em clones of wheat in that a sequence coding for 20 amino acid residues is tandemly repeated 4 times. These two genomic clones correspond to two genes named AtEm1 and AtEm6. Sequencing of several cDNA clones showed that both genes are expressed. The transcription start site was determined for both genes by RNase mapping. The site of polyadenylation is variable and there is no obvious consensus sequence for polyadenylation at the 3' ends of the genes. mRNA corresponding to GEA6 is present only in nearly dry and dry seeds, whereas the corresponding to GEA1 appears in immature seeds and is maximum in dry seeds. No expression of either gene could be detected in leaf, stem, or floral buds. Expression of both genes could be detected in immature seeds when the siliques were incubated with abscisic acid (ABA), demonstrating that both genes are ABA responsive. However, examination of the 5' upstream region does not reveal any extensive homology, suggesting that regulation of the two genes differs. In situ hybridization with a GEA1 probe demonstrated that the expression of this gene is essentially located in the provascular tissues of the cotyledons and axis of the dry seed as well as in the epiderm and outer layers of the cortex in the embryo axis.
