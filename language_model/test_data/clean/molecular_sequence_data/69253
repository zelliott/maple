FK506-binding protein (FKBP)12 and FKBP13 are members of a family of proteins which bind the immunosuppressant drugs, FK506 and rapamycin. FKBP12 and FKBP13 are encoded by distinct genes, designated FKBP1 and FKBP2, respectively. The structure of human FKBP1 was previously characterized. We now report the genomic structure of the human and murine FKBP2 genes. Comparison of FKBP1 and FKBP2 reveals significant homology and correlation of intron positions in the C-terminal region, suggesting that these genes may have evolved from a common ancestral gene.
