We have identified a member of the insulin receptor (InsR)/insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) family. The Xenopus insulin receptor (Xe-InsR) is present as a maternal 6.6 kb transcript. Northern blot analysis reveals the presence of this transcript until the mid-blastula transition (MBT), when levels decrease. At neurulation, two distinct transcripts of 6.6 and 7.7 kb are detected, both of which persist throughout embryogenesis. In situ hybridization analysis shows that InsR expression is restricted to regions of ectodermal and mesodermal origin, notably the encephalon, otic vesicles, optic vesicles, gills, somites and the pronephros.
