The neotropical tick Amblyomma cajennense is a significant pest to domestic animals, the most frequently human-biting tick in South America and the main vector of Brazilian spotted fever (caused by Rickettsia rickettsii), a deadly human disease. The purpose of this study is to characterize the adult A. cajennense salivary gland transcriptome by expressed sequence tags (ESTs). We report the analysis of 1754 clones obtained from a cDNA library, which reveal mainly transcripts related to proteins involved in the hemostatic processes, especially proteases and their inhibitors. Remarkably, five types of possible serine protease inhibitors were found, including a molecule with a distinguished structure that contains repeats of the active motif of hirudin inhibitors. Besides, other components that may be active over the host immune system or acting as defensins against infecting microorganisms were also described, including a molecule similar to insect venom allergens. The conjunction of components from this transcriptome suggests a diverse strategy of A. cajennense tick during feeding, but emphasized in the coagulation system.
