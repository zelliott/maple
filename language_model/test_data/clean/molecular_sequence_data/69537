The Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes RHO1 and MRP2 are convergently transcribed, with 281 base pairs separating their termination codons. Transcript mapping revealed at least 111 base pairs within the RHO1-MRP2 intercoding region are transcribed in both directions. Transplacement experiments showed distinct sequences of 70 nt for MRP2 and 179 nt for RHO1 were sufficient for normal mRNA 3' end formation. The MRP2 signal functioned in either orientation, although relatively inefficiently in the non-native orientation. This element contains a polyAT sequence essential for 3' end formation in both orientations. RHO1 or MRP2 3' end formation was not affected by overproduction or elimination of the complementary, natural antisense transcript. In contrast, insertion of a strong promoter that extended antisense transcripts beyond their normal 3' ends inactivated either MRP2 or RHO1. These data suggest that transcript termination in the compact yeast genome can be important to prevent inactivation of downstream genes as a result of antisense transcription.
