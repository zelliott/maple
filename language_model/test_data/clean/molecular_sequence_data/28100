In order to obtain specific antibodies against thymosin beta 9 showing minimal cross-reactivity with the highly homologous peptide thymosin beta 4, the N-terminal fragment 1-14 of thymosin beta 9 was used for immunization. These antibodies have been tested in a competitive ELISA and show less than 1% cross-reactivity with thymosin beta 4. On the other hand, antibodies raised against the native thymosin beta 9 (1-14) cross-react 35% with thymosin beta 4. Specific antibodies against thymosin beta 9 are important for studying the concentration and localization of thymosin beta 9 in thymus and other bovine tissues because thymosin beta 9 is always accompanied by thymosin beta 4. Using N-terminal fragments of thymosin beta 4-like peptides may be a general approach for obtaining specific antibodies since this part of sequence is less conserved in thymosin beta 4-like peptides.
