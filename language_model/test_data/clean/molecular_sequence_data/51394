A cDNA clone, lambda GTHA1, encoding human glutathione transferase A1-1 has been isolated from a hepatoma HepG2 cDNA library. At the nucleotide level, the new clone showed minor differences from cDNA deriving from normal liver, but the deduced amino acid sequence was identical to the structure previously described. The protein was expressed from a plasmid, pKHA1, and isolated by a single-step affinity purification on an S-hexylglutathione Sepharose matrix. The yield of the recombinant protein was 165 mg from a 3-liter culture of bacteria.
