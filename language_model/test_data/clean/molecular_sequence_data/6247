To attain light-dependent functionalization of biocompatible materials, a photolabel-derivatized, bioactive laminin fragment has been synthesized, chemically characterized, and photoimmobilized. Covalent high-resolution patterning of the laminin fragment CDPGYIGSR to hydroxylated fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP-OH), poly(vinyl alcohol), and glycophase glass has been achieved. The synthetic peptide CDPGYIGSR was thermochemically coupled to either N-[m-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-diazirin-3-yl]phenyl]-4-maleimidobuty ramide or 4-maleimidobenzophenone. Photolabel-derivatized peptides were radiolabeled, and 20 and 300 microns-sized patterns were visualized by autoradiography. The biospecific interaction of photoimmobilized laminin fragments with cells was investigated by analyzing the selective attachment of NG 108-15 neuroblastoma x glioma cells which bear CDPGYIGSR-specific cell surface receptors. On photopatterned FEP-OH membranes NG 108-15 cells differentiated in serum-supplemented media within 1 day. Specific attachment to the immobilized oligopeptide CDPGYIGSR was assessed in serum-free media with competitive binding studies, showing an 82% decrease in cell adherence after the cell receptors were blocked with soluble CDPGYIGSR.
