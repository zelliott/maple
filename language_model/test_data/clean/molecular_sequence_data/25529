We report the nucleotide sequence of a 4470-bp fragment derived from a sea urchin genomic clone containing part of a heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70)-encoding gene. This fragment, named hsp70 gene II, contains 1271 bp of the flanking region and 3299 bp of structural gene sequence interrupted by five introns and encoding the N-terminal 371 amino acids (aa) of the protein. The 5' flanking region contains a putative TATA element, two CCAAT boxes, four heat-shock consensus sequence elements (hse) and one consensus sequence for binding of Sp1. Remarkable homologies were observed for deduced aa sequence and intron-exon organization between hsp70 gene II and rat hsc73 gene.
