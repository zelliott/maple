Cryptomonads have acquired photosynthesis through secondary endosymbiosis: they have engulfed and retained a photosynthetic eukaryote. The remnants of this autotrophic symbiont are severely reduced, but a small volume of cytoplasm surrounding the plastid persists, along with a residual nucleus (the nucleomorph) that encodes only a few hundred genes. We characterized tubulin genes from the cryptomonad Guillardia theta. Despite the apparent absence of microtubules in the endosymbiont, we recovered genes encoding alpha-, beta-, and gamma-tubulins from the nucleomorph genome of G. theta. The presence of tubulin genes in the nucleomorph indicates that some component of the cytoskeleton is still present in the cryptomonad symbiont despite the fact that very little cytoplasm remains, no mitosis is known in the nucleomorph, and microtubules have never been observed anywhere in the symbiont. Phylogenetic analyses with nucleomorph alpha- and beta-tubulins support the origin of the cryptomonad nucleomorph from a red alga. We also characterized alpha and beta-tubulins from the host nucleus of G. theta and compared these with tubulins we isolated from two flagellates, Goniomonas truncata and Cyanophora paradoxa, previously proposed to be related to the cryptomonad host. Phylogenetic analyses support a relationship between the cryptomonad host and Goniomonas but do not support any relationship between cryptomonads and Cyanophora.
