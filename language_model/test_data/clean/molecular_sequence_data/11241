A synthetic antifreeze protein gene was expressed in plants and reduced electrolyte leakage from the leaves at freezing temperatures. The synthetic AFP was expressed as a fusion to a signal peptide, directing it to the extracytoplasmic space where ice crystallization first occurs. The gene was introduced to Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Russet Burbank by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transformants were identified by PCR screening and expression of the introduced protein was verified by immunoblot. Electrolyte-release analysis of transgenic plant leaves established a correlation between the level of transgenic protein expression and degree of tolerance to freezing. This is the first identification of a phenotype associated with antifreeze protein expression in plant tissue.
