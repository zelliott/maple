We report the isolation and characterization of a novel class of leukocyte peptides with possible cytokine-like activities which we call granulins. They are cystine-rich with molecular weights of approximately 6 Kda, except for granulin D, which appears to be a dimer. We present the sequence of one member of this family, a 56 residue peptide, granulin A, and amino-terminal sequences for three other granulins from human peripheral leukocytes. A fifth related peptide was isolated and partially sequenced from rat bone marrow, suggesting that at least some of the granulin in peripheral leukocytes is preformed in the marrow. Rat granulin, and human granulin A, are closely related, showing that the granulin structures are highly conserved between species.
