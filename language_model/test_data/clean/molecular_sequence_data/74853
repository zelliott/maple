Cord formation is a characteristic property of the cultured Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex species. We describe a case of Mycobacterium marinum demonstrating robust cord formation. Nontuberculous mycobacteria can form true cords in broth culture but do so rarely, despite the fact that many species contain the cell wall glycolipid that mediates cord formation.
