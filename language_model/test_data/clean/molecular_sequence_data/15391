Although a large number of microbial metabolites have been discovered as inhibitors of bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis, only a few inhibitors were reported for the pathway of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide formation, partly because of the lack of assays appropriate for natural product screening. Among the pathway enzymes, D-Ala racemase (Alr), D-Ala:D-Ala ligase (Ddl) and UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide:D-Ala-D-Ala transferase (MurF) are particularly attractive as antibacterial targets, because these enzymes are essential for growth and utilize low-molecular-weight substrates. Using dansylated UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide and L-Ala as the substrates, we established a cell-free assay to measure the sequential reactions of Alr, Ddl and MurF coupled with translocase I. This assay is sensitive and robust enough to screen mixtures of microbial metabolites, and enables us to distinguish the inhibitors for D-Ala-D-Ala formation, MurF and translocase I. D-cycloserine, the D-Ala-D-Ala pathway inhibitor, was successfully detected by this assay (IC(50)=1.7 microg ml(-1)). In a large-scale screening of natural products, we have identified inhibitors for D-Ala-D-Ala synthesis pathway, MurF and translocase I.
