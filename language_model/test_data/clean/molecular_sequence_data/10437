We have examined differences in the spatial and temporal regulation of stress-induced hsp47 and hsp70 gene expression following exposure of zebrafish embryos to heat shock or ethanol. Using Northern blot analysis, we found that levels of hsp47 and hsp70 mRNA were dramatically elevated during heat shock in 2-day-old embryos. In contrast, ethanol exposure resulted in strong upregulation of the hsp47 gene whereas hsp70 mRNA levels increased only slightly following the same treatment. Whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed that hsp47 mRNA was expressed predominantly in precartilagenous cells, as well as several other connective tissue cell populations within the embryo following exposure to either stress. hsp70 mRNA displayed a very different cell-specific distribution. For example, neither stress induced hsp70 mRNA accumulation in precartilagenous cells. However, high levels of hsp70 mRNA were detectable in epithelial cells of the developing epidermis following exposure to heat shock, but not to ethanol. These cells did not express the hsp47 gene following exposure to either of these stresses. The results suggest the presence of different inducible regulatory mechanisms for these genes which operate in a cell- and stress-specific manner in zebrafish embryos.
