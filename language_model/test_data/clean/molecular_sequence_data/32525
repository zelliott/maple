In order to investigate the utilization of glucose in equine skeletal muscle, we determined the coding and proximal promoter sequences of the hexokinase type II (HKII) gene in thoroughbred horse, Grevy's zebra and Hartmann's mountain zebra. The deduced amino acid sequence of thoroughbred horse HKII showed 100, 100, 94.4, 92.7 and 92.6% identities with Grevy's zebra, Hartmann's mountain zebra, human, mouse and rat HKIIs, respectively. In equine HKIIs, specific amino acid substitutions, Ile 159 and Arg 610, were found in the potential binding site for glucose. In addition, the nucleotide sequence of the equine proximal promoter has a number of conserved putative binding sites for transcription factor.
