E-selectin, an adhesion molecule expressed on the surface of activated endothelial cells, is essential for leukocyte rolling on endothelium which leads to extravasation in the process of inflammation. Induction of E-selectin expression by proinflammatory stimuli such as TNF-alpha or LPS is reduced markedly in the presence of dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid and potent anti-inflammatory agent. We have investigated the molecular mechanism underlying dexamethasone-mediated E-selectin repression in porcine aortic endothelial cells. Reduced E-selectin protein expression is paralleled by a decrease in E-selectin mRNA and is based on changes in transcription rate. Analysis of the E-selectin promoter revealed that induction by proinflammatory stimuli as well as repression by dexamethasone are mediated by the same promoter region containing three closely spaced binding sites for nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and an element, NF-ELAM-1 (endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1), constitutively occupied by ATF and c-Jun. NF-ELAM-1 contributes to maximal promoter activity, but does not confer glucocorticoid inhibition, as demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis. In contrast, transcription directed by the E-selectin NF-kappaB elements is reduced strongly in the presence of dexamethasone, thus identifying NF-kappaB as the primary target for glucocorticoid-mediated E-selectin repression.
