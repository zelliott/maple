Nociceptin, also known as orphanin FQ, was recently identified as the naturally occurring agonist of orphan opioid receptor-like ORL1 receptor (Meunier et al., 1995, Nature 377, 532; Reinscheid et al., 1995, Science 270, 792). Nociceptin is a heptadecapeptide which, although it resembles dynorphin A, the endogenous agonist of the kappa-opioid receptor, displays very low potency in competing with binding of [3H]diprenorphine to or inhibiting adenylate cyclase via mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptors. Tritium-labeled nociceptin ([3H]nociceptin) was used here to establish a pharmacological profile in vitro of the ORL 1 receptor. In membranes from recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the ORL 1 receptor, equilibrium binding of [3H]nociceptin is highly specific, saturable (Bmax in the range 1.3-1.8 pmol/mg protein) and of high affinity (Kd approximately equal to 0.1 nM). It is selectively decreased in the presence of Na+ ions and/or of the GTP analog 5'-guanylylimido-diphosphate, an allosteric regulation that is analogous to that of opiate binding to opioid receptors. A few opiates, namely lofentanil, a 4-anilinopiperidine derivative and etorphine, a 6,14-endo-ethenotetrahydrothebaine derivative, were found to be quite potent not only in competing with binding of [3H]nociceptin at the ORL 1 receptor but also in inhibiting forskolin-induced accumulation of cyclic AMP in intact recombinant CHO cells. In a preliminary attempt to delineate active parts of the neuropeptide, nociceptin analogs were also tested, including N- and C-terminal truncation products. Our results suggest that the highly basic, internal core of nociceptin might be essential in conferring on the peptide both affinity for and activity at the ORL 1 receptor. In this respect, the message and address division of dynorphin A, nociceptin's closest structural analog, do not seem to apply to nociceptin.
