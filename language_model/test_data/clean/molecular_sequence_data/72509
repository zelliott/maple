Currently, 16 loci that contribute to the development of IDDM in the NOD mouse have been mapped by linkage analysis. To fine map these loci, we used congenic mapping. Using this approach, we localized the Idd3 locus to a 0.35-cM interval on chromosome 3 containing the Il2 gene. Segregation analysis of the known variations within this interval indicated that only one variant, a serine-to-proline substitution at position 6 of the mature interleukin-2 (IL-2) protein, consistently segregates with IDDM in crosses between NOD and a series of nondiabetic mouse strains. These data, taken together with the immunomodulatory role of IL-2, provide circumstantial evidence in support of the hypothesis that Idd3 is an allelic variation of the Il2 gene, or a variant in strong linkage disequilibrium.
