A Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated F3(T), was isolated from a saline soil sample in China and studied by using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain F3(T) was affiliated with the genus Brevundimonas, with Brevundimonas kwangchunensis KSL-102(T) (98.4 % similarity) and Brevundimonas alba DSM 4736(T) (98.2 %) as its closest relatives. Strain F3(T) contained ubiquinone-10 (Q-10) as the predominant ubiquinone and C(18 : 1)ω7c, C(17 : 1)ω8c and C(16 : 0) as the major fatty acids. The DNA G+C content of strain F3(T) was 66.7 mol%. Levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain F3(T) and the type strains of closely related Brevundimonas species were below 22 %. On the basis of phenotypic characteristics and genotypic distinctiveness, strain F3(T) should be classified as representing a novel species of the genus Brevundimonas, for which the name Brevundimonas viscosa sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is F3(T) ( = CGMCC 1.10683(T) = JCM 17426(T)).
