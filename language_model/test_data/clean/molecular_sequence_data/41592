Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) represent a highly polymorphic and diverse gene family in rhesus macaques. Analyses of the respective gene products have been hampered until now due to non-availability of specific monoclonal antibodies and failure of cross-reactivity of anti-human KIR antibodies. We utilised one activating (KIR3DSW08) and two inhibitory (KIR3DLW03 and KIR3DL05) rhesus macaque KIR-Fc fusion proteins for generation of monoclonal antibodies in mice. Besides broadly reacting ones, we obtained anti-rhesus macaque KIR antibodies with intermediate and with single specificity. These monoclonal antibodies were tested for binding to a panel of rhesus macaque KIR proteins after heterologous expression on transiently transfected cells. Epitope mapping identified two polymorphic regions that are located next to each other in the mature KIR proteins. The availability of monoclonal antibodies against rhesus macaque KIR proteins will enable future studies on KIR at the protein level in rhesus macaques as important animal models of human infectious diseases.
