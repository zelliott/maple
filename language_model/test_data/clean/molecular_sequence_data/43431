Although endothelin (ET) was discovered as a potent vascular endothelium-derived constricting peptide, its presumed physiological and pathophysiological roles are now considered much more diverse than originally though. Endothelin in the brain is thought to be deeply involved in the central autonomic control and consequent cardiorespiratory homeostasis, possibly as a neuromodulator or a hormone that functions locally in an autocrine/paracrine manner or widely through delivery by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This notion is based on the following lines of evidence. (1) Mature ET, its precursors, converting enzymes, and receptors all are detected at strategic sites in the central nervous system (CNS), especially those controlling the autonomic functions. (2) The ET is present in the CSF at concentrations higher than in the plasma. (3) There is a topographical correspondence of ET and its receptors in the CNS. (4) The ET is released by primary cultures of hypothalamic neurons. (5) When ET binds to its receptors, intracellular calcium channels. (6) An intracerebroventricular or topical application of ET to CNS sites elicits a pattern of cardiorespiratory changes accompanied by responses of vasomotor and respiratory neurons. (7) Recently generated knockout mice with disrupted genes encoding ET-1 exhibited, along with malformations in a subset of the tissues of neural crest cell lineage, cardiorespiratory abnormalities including elevation of arterial pressure, sympathetic overactivity, and impairment of the respiratory reflex. Definitive evidence is expected from thorough analyses of knockout mice by applying conventional experimental methods.
