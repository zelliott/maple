A Gram-positive, alkaliphilic bacterium, designated strain DLS13T, was isolated from Dali Lake in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. The isolate was able to grow at pH 7.5-11.0 (optimum at pH 9), in 0-8 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum at 2 %, w/v) and at 10-45 °C (optimum at 30 °C). Cells of the isolate were facultatively anaerobic, spore-forming rods with peritrichous flagella. The predominant isoprenoid quinone was MK-7 and its cell wall peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. The major polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0, anteiso-C17:0 and iso-C15:0. The genomic DNA G+C content of the isolate was 43.9 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain DLS13T was a member of the genus Bacillus and most closely related to Bacillus saliphilus DSM 15402T (96.9 % similarity). The DNA-DNA relatedness value between strain DLS13T and B. saliphilus DSM 15402T was 38.7±1.9 %. Comparative analysis of genotypic and phenotypic features indicated that strain DLS13T represents a novel species of the genus Bacillus, for which the name Bacillus daliensis sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is DLS13T (=CGMCC 1.10369T=JCM 17097T=NBRC 107572T).
