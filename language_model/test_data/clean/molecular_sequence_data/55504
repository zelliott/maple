The dynamics of gene expression of two proteins, TLR9 (one of the key receptors recognizing CpG repeats of herpes virus DNA) and Î²-defensin 2 (antibacterial peptide), was studied on the model of herpetic keratitis in C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice. New data on differences in TLR9 gene expression in mice of the two strains infected with the virus were obtained. Reduced TLR9 gene expression in the cornea of C57Bl/6 mice was associated with their high sensitivity to infection caused by herpes simplex 1 virus.
