The aim of this work was to shed some more light on factors influencing the effectiveness of delta ribozyme cleavage of structured RNA molecules. An oligoribonucleotide that corresponds to the 3'-terminal region X of HCV RNA and yeast tRNAPhe were used as representative RNA targets. Only a few sites susceptible to ribozyme cleavage were identified in these targets using a combinatorial library of ribozyme variants, in which the region responsible for ribozyme-target interaction was randomized. On the other hand, the targets were fairly accessible for binding of complementary oligonucleotides, as was shown by 6-mer DNA libraries and RNase H approach. Moreover, the specifically acting ribozymes cleaved the targets precisely but with unexpectedly modest efficacy. To explain these observations, six model RNA molecules were designed, in which the same seven nucleotide long sequence recognized by the delta ribozyme was always single stranded but was embedded into different RNA structural context. These molecules were cleaved with differentiated rates, and the corresponding k2 values were in the range of 0.91-0.021 min-1; thus they differed almost 50-fold. This clearly shows that cleavage of structured RNAs might be much slower than cleavage of a short unstructured oligoribonucleotide, despite full accessibility of the targeted regions for hybridization. Restricted possibilities of conformational transitions, which are necessary to occur on the cleavage reaction trajectory, seem to be responsible for these differences. Their magnitude, which was evaluated in this work, should be taken into account while considering the use of delta ribozymes for practical applications.
