In the heart, individual cardiac muscle cells are linked by gap junctions. These junctions form low resistance pathways along which the electrical impulse flows rapidly and repeatedly between all the cells of the myocardium, ensuring their synchronous contraction. To obtain probes for mapping the distribution of gap junctions in cardiac tissue, polyclonal antisera were raised to three synthetic peptides, each matching different cytoplasmically exposed portions of the sequence of connexin43, the major gap-junctional protein reported in the heart. The specificity of each antiserum for the peptide to which it was raised was established by dot blotting. New methods were developed for isolating enriched fractions of gap junctions from whole heart and from dissociated adult myocytes, in which detergent-treatment and raising the temperature (potentially damaging steps in previously described techniques) are avoided. Analysis of these fractions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed major bands at 43 kDa (matching the molecular mass of connexin43) and at 70 kDa. Western blot experiments using our antisera indicated that both the 43-kDa and the 70-kDa bands represent cardiac gap-junctional proteins. Pre-embedding immunogold labelling of isolated gap junctions and post-embedding immunogold labelling of Lowicryl-embedded whole tissue demonstrated the specific binding of the antibodies to ultrastructurally defined gap junctions. One antiserum (raised to residues 131-142) was found to be particularly effective for cytochemical labelling. Using this antiserum for immunofluorescence labelling in combination with confocal scanning laser microscopy enabled highly sensitive detection and three-dimensional mapping of gap junctions through thick slices of cardiac tissue. By means of the serial optical sectioning ability of the confocal microscope, images of the entire gap junction population of complete en face-viewed disks were reconstructed. These reconstructions reveal the presence of large junctions arranged as a peripheral ring around the disk, with smaller junctions in an interior zone: an arrangement that may facilitate efficient intercellular transfer of current. By applying our immunolabelling techniques to tissue from hearts removed from transplant patients with advanced ischaemic heart disease, we have demonstrated that gap junction distribution between myocytes at the border zone of healed infarcts is markedly disordered. This abnormality may contribute to the genesis of reentrant arrhythmias in ischaemic heart disease.
