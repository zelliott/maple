The two chromosomally encoded beta-lactamases, OXA-22 and OXA-60, from Ralstonia pickettii are inducible by beta-lactam molecules. Disruption of RP3 abolished induction of both beta-lactamases and the resistance to pH, osmolarity and survival in the stationary phase, suggesting that RP3 might be a global regulator. Interactions between RP3, OXA-22 and OXA-60 were investigated at a transcript and protein level using 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiments, real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and footprinting assays. The rp3 gene was actively transcribed and the promoter sequences corresponded to a nontypical sigma(70)-type promoter. RT-PCR analysis showed that rp3 expression as well as that of the bla(OXA) genes was positively regulated: the level of transcripts of rp3, bla(OXA-22) and bla(OXA-60) genes were, respectively, increased 20-, 100- and 2000-fold upon imipenem induction. DNAse I footprinting showed that RP3 specifically bound to tandem repeats centered at positions -55.5 and -73.5 upstream from the bla(OXA-22) and bla(OXA-60) transcriptional start sites. Interestingly, the binding site at bla(OXA-60) overlapped the -35 region of the rp3 promoter, although the region essential for induction lies at the beginning of the orf-rp3. This result indicates that RP3 is most probably only one component of a novel regulatory system involved in the expression of beta-lactamases in R. pickettii.
