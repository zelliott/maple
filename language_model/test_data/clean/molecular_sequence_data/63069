We investigated the presence of glycoproteins in Borrelia burgdorferi. We did not find any evidence for glycosylation of the major outer membrane proteins OspA and OspB or the structural flagellar proteins FlaB and FlaA. We suggest that glycoproteins present on the surface of B. burgdorferi may be tightly bound culture medium glycoproteins.
