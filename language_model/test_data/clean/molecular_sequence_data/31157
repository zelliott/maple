E. coli strains producing a hybrid protein, containing adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and protein A of S. aureus was obtained. The sequence coding for ACTH was obtained from the bovine proopiomelanocortin cDNA and, after the modification of the 5'- and 3'-terminal parts, was linked with the protein A gene and its derivatives due to synthetic adaptors. Three forms of ACTH gene, coding this hormone with differing N-terminal amino acid were used to construct the fusion gene. The hybrid proteins contain Asp-Pro or (Asp)4-Lys sequences for obtaining ACTH by acid or enterokinase treatment, respectively. It is shown that each of the constructed plasmids direct the synthesis of hybrid protein in E. coli. This protein was purified by the use of IgG-sepharose. The level of the expression of the hybrid protein is 4 mg/l of the bacterial culture. Most of the synthesized protein is secreted into the periplasmic space.
