Eight hundred and nineteen strains of Escherichia coli isolated in Spain between 1986 and 1991 from extraintestinal infections and feces of healthy controls were investigated for expression of P-fimbriae using a particle agglutination test. Among strains causing urinary tract infections, sepsis and other extraintestinal infections, P-fimbriae were found in 31% (130/420) (P < 0.001), 25% (30/118) (P < 0.001) and 12% (11/92) (P < 0.5) respectively. In contrast, only 7% (14/189) of faecal isolates from healthy individuals carried P-fimbriae. According to two more common toxic markers detected in this study (alpha-haemolysin and cytotoxic necrotizing factor type 1), P-fimbriated E. coli strains were grouped into three categories: haemolysin+cytotoxic necrosing factor+ (Hly+CNF1+) (68/185; 37%), haemolysin+cytotoxic necrosing factor- (Hly+CNF1-) (61/185; 33%) and Hly-CNF1- (56/185; 30%). The 185 P-fimbriated strains belonged to 17 different O serogroups. However, 148 (80%) were of one of six serogroups (O1, O2, O4, O6, O7 and O18). The most frequent serogroups determined in the Hly+CNF1+ strains were the O4 and O6 (53/68; 78%), in the Hly+CNF1- strains it was the O18 (27/61; 44%) and in the Hly-CNF1- strains the O1, O2 and O7 (41/56; 73%). The majority (160/185; 86%) of P-fimbriated E. coli expressed the mannose-resistant haemagglutinin type IVa.
