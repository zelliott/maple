Because of previous indications that estradiol (E2) plays a role in the regulation of testicular testosterone (T) production in some species, the production of E2 and aromatase gene expression in human fetal testes were investigated. Testicular minces from 14 fetuses (fetal age 15-23 weeks) were incubated with and without 200 ng/ml highly purified hCG, and the production of E2 and T was measured by RIA. Basal T production was high at 15-18 weeks of gestation and decreased thereafter. Estradiol production was low in all testes. Aromatase mRNA (P-450 arom messenger ribonucleic acid) was not detectable in fetal testicular tissues when studied by Northern and dot blot techniques. Placenta and fetal liver expressed aromatase mRNA, but fetal ovary contained only miniscule amounts. HCG significantly stimulated the production of both T and E2 in the testes of older fetuses (19-23 weeks), but the testicular E2 production of the youngest fetuses (15-18 weeks) did not increase significantly after hCG stimulation. These results indicate that aromatase activity and gene expression are very low in human fetal testes. These findings suggest that E2 may not play a major role in testicular T production in the human fetus.
