We investigated the role of beta 3 Gal-T5, a member of the beta 1,3galactosyltransferase (beta 1,3Gal-T) family, in cancer-associated glycosylation, focusing on the expression of sialyl-Lewis a (sLea, the epitope of CA19.9 antigen), poly N-acetyllactosamines, and sialyl-Lewis x (sLex) antigen. A clone permanently expressing an antisense fragment of beta 3Gal-T5 was obtained from the human pancreas adenocarcinoma cell line BxPC3 and characterized. Both beta 1,3Gal-T activity and sLea expression are dramatically impaired in the clone. Analysis of the oligosaccharides synthesized in cells metabolically labelled with tritiated galactose shows that a relevant amount of radioactivity is associated to large O-glycans. Endo-beta-galactosidase mostly releases NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-3[Fuc alpha 1-4]GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal and NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-3GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal from such O-glycans of BxPC3 membranes, but GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal and type 2 chain oligosaccharides, including NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4[Fuc alpha 1-3]GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal, from those of the antisense clone. Furthermore, BxPC3 cells secrete sLea in the culture media but not sLex, while antisense clone secretes mostly sLex, and accumulation of both antigens is prevented by benzyl-alpha-GalNAc. These data indicate that beta 3Gal-T5 suppression turns synthesis of type 1 chain O-glycans to poly N-acetyllactosamine elongation and termination by sLex. In other cell lines and clones, beta 3Gal-T5 transcript, beta 1,3Gal-T activity, and sLea antigen are also correlated, but quantitatively the relative expression ratios are very different from cell type to cell type. We suggest that beta 3Gal-T5 plays a relevant role in gastrointestinal and pancreatic tissues counteracting the glycosylation pattern associated to malignancy, and is necessary for the synthesis and secretion of CA19.9 antigen, whose expression still depends on multiple interacting factors.
