The influence of polymer concentration and temperature on the rheological behavior of chitosan solution was studied. The threshold concentrations for the different viscometric regimes were determined and the different power laws exponents were calculated and compared with those predicted from models. Different observations and the high values of these exponents within the high concentration region lead to consideration of the presence of intermolecular interactions as soon as the polymer concentration is larger than the overlap concentration. The activation energy was determined as a function of the polymer concentration, and its evolution was compared with theoretical predictions. A gel-sol transition was demonstrated at high concentrations.
