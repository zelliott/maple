Molecular modeling studies based on the potent NK-1 antagonist CP-96,345 led us to the identification of some 2-benzylidene- and 2-benzyl-3-benzylaminoquinuclidine derivatives as potential antagonists at the NK receptor subtypes. The synthesized compounds, whose Z/E isomerism has been defined by X-ray analysis, show only moderate potency on the three neurokinin receptors. The possible reasons of the low potency exhibited by the tested compounds are discussed.
