We have previously demonstrated that vaccination of mice with plasmid DNA vectors expressing immunodominant mycobacterial genes induced cellular immune responses and significant protection against challenge with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We demonstrate here, using in vitro-synthesized RNA, that vaccination with DNA or RNA constructs expressing the M. tuberculosis MPT83 antigen are capable of inducing specific humoral and T-cell immune responses and confer modest but significant protection against M. tuberculosis challenge in mice. This is the first report of protective immunity conferred against intracellular bacteria by an RNA vaccine. This novel approach avoids some of the drawbacks of DNA vaccines and illustrates the potential for developing new antimycobacterial immunization strategies.
