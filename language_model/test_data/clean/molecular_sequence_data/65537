The SMC protein complexes play important roles in chromosome dynamics. The function of the SMC5-6 complex remains unclear, though it is involved in resolution of different DNA structures by recombination. We have now identified and characterized the four non-SMC components of the human complex and in particular demonstrated that the MAGEG1 protein is part of this complex. MAGE proteins play important but as yet undefined roles in carcinogenesis, apoptosis, and brain development. We show that, with the exception of the SUMO ligase hMMS21/hNSE2, depletion of any of the components results in degradation of all the other components. Depletion also confers sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate. Several of the components are modified by sumoylation and ubiquitination.
