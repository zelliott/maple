We isolated a human glutamate receptor subunit 7 (GluR-7) cosmid after high stringency screening of a human genomic placental library using a rat GluR-7 cDNA as a probe. A 614-bp fragment of the GluR-7 cosmid was sequenced, and an exon that encodes 53 amino acids was found between two introns. The exon exhibited 89% and 96% identity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively, with the corresponding region of rat GluR-7. The human GluR-7 was classified as a kainate subtype glutamate receptor based on its homology to rat GluR-7. Using somatic cell hybrid analysis, human GluR-7 was localized to chromosome 1. Fine mapping analysis using FISH localized the gene to 1p33-34. Since glutamate receptors of the kainate subtype have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, establishing the precise map position of human GluR-7 subunit is an important step towards evaluating this locus as a candidate for mutations in neurodegenerative disorders.
