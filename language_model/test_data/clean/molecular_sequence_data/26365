Chemically defined synthetic polymers, known as multiple antigen peptide systems (MAPs) represent an effective and novel approach for engineering peptide-based vaccines. Ten different mono and diepitope MAP models, containing different arrangements and stoichiometry of functional B and/or T helper epitopes from the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium berghei were used to immunize mice. High titers of antibody and protective immunity against sporozoite challenge were elicited by MAPs containing T and B epitopes arranged in tandem and in equimolar amounts. These results indicate that MAPs may serve as a basis for developing subunit vaccines to induce high levels of antibodies against sporozoites.
