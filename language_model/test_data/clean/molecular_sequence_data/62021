The O-polysaccharide of Providencia stuartii O4 was obtained by mild acid degradation of the lipopolysaccharide, and the following structure of the pentasaccharide repeating unit was established: [structure: see text] where D-Qui4N(L-AspAc) is 4-(N-acetyl-L-aspart-4-yl)amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-glucose, which has not been hitherto found in bacterial polysaccharides. Structural studies were performed using sugar and methylation analyses, Smith degradation and NMR spectroscopy, including conventional 2D 1H,1H COSY, TOCSY, NOESY and 1H,13C HSQC experiments as well as COSY and NOESY experiments run in an H(2)O-D(2)O mixture to reveal correlations for NH protons.
