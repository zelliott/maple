The downstream DNA region of the fimbrilin gene (fimA), which encodes the major subunit protein of Porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae, was fully sequenced. Gene products, expressed from this region in Escherichia coli, were purified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and their partial amino acid sequences were determined to verify open reading frames (ORFs) found in the region by DNA sequencing. Four ORFs, designated ORF1, ORF2, ORF3 and ORF4, were found in the 5.8-kb PstI fragment downstream from fimA, which was previously cloned and partially characterized by Yoshimura, Takahashi, Hibi, Takasawa, Kato, and Dickinson (Infect. Immun. 61: 5181-5189, 1993). The direction of transcription of all the ORFs was the same as that of fimA. The 50 and 80 kDa encoded proteins, ORF2 and ORF3, respectively, have been reported to be minor components associated with fimbriae. The 15 and 19 kDa proteins, ORF1 and ORF4, respectively, have been expressed in E. coli but not identified in P. gingivalis. However, all the gene products of the ORFs, expressed in E. coli, appeared to contain intact signal peptides based on their N-terminal amino acid sequences.
