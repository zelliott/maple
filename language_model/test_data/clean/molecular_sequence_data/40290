Fatty acid binding proteins are considered to be promising vaccine candidates against trematodiasis. In order to provide additional information about their function in Fasciola gigantica we performed a comparative analysis of FgFABP1 and FgFABP3, two isoforms with quite different isoelectric points of 4.9 and 9.9 and 67% sequence identity. Both are expressed in the juvenile and adult parasite but differ in their tissue-specific distribution. In addition, the sequence of FABP3 is identical in F. hepatica and F. gigantica indicating the protein's functional importance in this genus. Immune sera produced against soluble recombinant FgFABPs reacted with 14 kDa antigens in crude worm, soluble egg, cirrus sac extracts, and excretion/secretion product. Both FgFABPs were located in the parenchyma of the parasite but in addition, FgFABP1 was abundant in testes and spermatozoa while FgFABP3 was abundant in vitelline cells, eggs, and caecal epithelium. Mass spectrometry identified FgFABP1 and FgFABP3 in the ES product whereas only FgFABP3 was identified in egg extract. Serum samples of an experimentally infected rabbit reacted from week 6 post-infection with FgFABP3 and from week 12 with FgFABP1 while sera of infected sheep were not reactive. The results suggest differences in the biological functions of these 2 isoforms and differences in the host/parasite interaction that should be considered for their potential as vaccines against fascioliasis.
