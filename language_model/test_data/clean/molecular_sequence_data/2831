The complete nucleotide sequence of the phytoreovirus rice dwarf virus (RDV) genome segment 9 is presented. It consisted of 1305 nucleotides and had an open reading frame that codes for a putative polypeptide of 351 amino acids. Mr of the protein was calculated to be 38,598. The terminal nucleotides 5' GGUAAA--GAU 3' were the same as those of RDV genome segment 10. The fourth nucleotide from the 3' end of an expected conserved sequence was a C rather than the U found in the previously sequenced genome segment 10. A structure similar to the segment-specific inverted repeat of wound tumour virus was also found in the terminal region of segment 9.
