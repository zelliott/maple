One rRNA operon of all mycobacteria studied so far is located downstream from a gene thought to code for the enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine carboxyvinyl transferase (UNAcGCT), which is important to cell wall synthesis. This operon has been designated rrnAf for fast-growing mycobacteria and rrnAs for slow growers. We have investigated the upstream sequences and promoter activities of rrnA operons of typical fast growers which also possess a second rrn (rrnBf) operon and of the rrnA operons of the fast growers Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium chelonae, which each have a single rrn operon per genome. These fast growers have a common strategy for increasing the efficiency of transcription of their rrnA operons, thereby increasing the cells' potential for ribosome synthesis. This strategy involves the use of multiple (three to five) promoters which may have arisen through successive duplication events. Thus we have identified a hypervariable multiple promoter region (HMPR) located between the UNAcGCT gene and the 16S rRNA coding region. Two promoters, P1 and PCL1, appear to play pivotal roles in mycobacterial rRNA synthesis; they are present in all of the species examined and are the only promoters used for rRNA synthesis by the pathogenic slow growers. P1 is located within the coding region of the UNAcGCT gene, and PCL1 has a characteristic sequence that is related to but distinct from that of the additional promoters. In fast-growing species, P1 and PCL1 produce less than 10% of rRNA transcripts, so the additional promoters found in the HMPR are important in increasing the potential for rRNA synthesis during rapid growth. In contrast, rrnB operons appear to be regulated by a single promoter; because less divergence has taken place, rrnB appears to be younger than rrnA.
