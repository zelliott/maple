The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) consists of several proteins whose primary functions are to transport and phosphorylate their substrates. The complexity of the PTS undoubtedly reflects its additional roles in chemotaxis to PTS substrates and in regulation of other metabolic processes in the cell. The PTS permeases (Enzymes II) are the membrane-associated proteins of the PTS that sequentially recognize, transport, and phosphorylate their specific substrates in separate steps, and the Escherichia coli mannitol permease is one of the best studied of these proteins. It consists of two cytoplasmic domains (EIIA and EIIB) involved in mannitol phosphorylation and an integral membrane domain (EIIC) which is sufficient to bind mannitol, but which transports mannitol at a rate that is dependent on phosphorylation of the EIIA and EIIB domains. Recent results show that several residues in a hydrophilic, 85-residue segment of the EIIC domain are important for the binding, transport, and phosphorylation of mannitol. This segment may be at least partially exposed to the cytoplasm of the cell. A model is proposed in which this region of the EIIC domain is crucial in coupling phosphorylation of the EIIB domain to transport through the EIIC domain of the mannitol permease.
