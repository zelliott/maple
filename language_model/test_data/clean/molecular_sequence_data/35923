We determined the cDNA sequence of the mRNA for antithrombin III (AT III) from sheep liver. It encodes a protein of 465 amino acids, including a signal peptide of 32 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of the mature protein shows a sequence identity of 89.1%, 95.6% and 85.0% to the human, bovine and rabbit equivalents, respectively. Cysteine residues involved in disulfide bonds as well as potential glycosylation sites are conserved between the four species. In contrast, the amino acid sequence of the signal peptide shows a smaller identity, i.e., 68.7% and 56.3% compared to the human and rabbit preprotein, respectively.
