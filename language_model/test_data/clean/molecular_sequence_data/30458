The mitochondrial 18S and 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes of rye, plus a total of about 90 kilobase pairs of flanking DNA, have been cloned and maps of restriction enzyme cleavage sites have been constructed. Like their homologs from hexaploid wheat, the rye genes are closely linked and are part of a three-copy family of recombining repeats (the "18S/5S repeat"). The rye repeat probably also contains a mitochondrial tRNA(fMet) gene, which the wheat repeat is known to carry. However, despite the overall organizational similarity between the wheat and rye 18S/5S repeats in the immediate vicinity of their coding regions, extensive rearrangement of flanking sequences has taken place during evolutionary divergence of the two species. Our data provide additional support for an emerging picture of plant mitochondrial genomes as evolving much more rapidly in structure than in sequence.
