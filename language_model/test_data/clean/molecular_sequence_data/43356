We examined the full-length hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope (surface antigen or HBV small surface antigen [HBsAg]) sequences of 12 different liver samples from 10 different hepatoma-containing chronic carriers. Surprisingly, novel and frequent mutations occurred predominantly at amino acids 40 and 47 of HBsAg, in addition to within a known protective B-cell epitope (so-called group a determinant of HBsAg 124-148). Approximately 58% of chronic carriers contain mutations at the group a determinant. The mutation frequency at the hotspot codons 40 and 47 is approximately 83%, 1 order of magnitude higher than at the known polymorphic sites of subtype-specific determinants at codons 122 and 160, which is approximately 4%. This new mutational domain is found to coincide with a major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted T-cell epitope. The potential biological significance of this novel mutation in the immunopathogenesis of HBV chronic carriers is discussed.
