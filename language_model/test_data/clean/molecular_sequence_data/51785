1. The "code-sequence" of N-glycosylation site(s), the amino acids located around O-glycosylation site(s), the sequence motifs of several kinases, the sequence motifs of--sulfation, amidation, isoprenylation, myristoylation, palmitoylation and N-acetylation, Aspartic and Asparagine hydroxylation-site, gamma-carboxyglutamate domain, phosphopantetheine attachment site etc. are extensively listed, compared to those reported by "PROSITE" Computer Screen Center and discussed. 2. The structural aspects of protein-DNA recognition are quoted as discussion and conclusion.
