A full-length cDNA clone from mango (Mangifera indica L.) fruit has homology to the rab11/YPT3 class of small GTPases. The corresponding mRNA is expressed in fruit, only during ripening. The likely involvement of this RabX protein in trafficking cell-wall modifying enzymes through the trans-Golgi network is discussed.
