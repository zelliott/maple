A new polymorphism of the human prothrombin (F2) gene was detected by a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of specific alleles (PASA) and mutated primer-mediated PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The method is simple and useful for detecting polymorphisms and mutations. The new polymorphism of C1 and C2 examined by this method is highly heterozygous and serves as a good human DNA marker.
