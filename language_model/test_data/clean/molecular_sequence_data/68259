Parts of the Bcr/Abl hybrid transcript supposed to be important for its transforming ability were sequenced in a series of CML blast crises, in order to evaluate the possible presence of alterations responsible for the disease transition from the chronic to the acute phase. In addition, the N- and Ki-ras as well as the p53 involvement was investigated by exploring their structure and expression in the same patients. We used traditional types of molecular analysis including Southern and Northern blot, together with methods that allow a rapid detection of point mutations and microdeletions, such as SSCP, single strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing. The results obtained may be summarized as follows: no alterations were found in the parts of the Bcr/Abl transcripts investigated in the present study (SH2, SH3 and the region surrounding codon 832); p53 alterations were observed in 5% and N- and Ki-RAS mutations in 5% of the cases examined. These molecular defects are therefore responsible for the clinical progression of the Ph1-positive CML only in a minority of cases.
