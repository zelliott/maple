Two nifA-like genes, designated anfA and vnfA, have been identified in Azotobacter vinelandii. The anfA gene is located upstream from the nitrogenase-3 structural gene cluster (anfHDGK) and is preceded by a sequence that is potentially part of a ntrA-dependent promoter. The product of anfA appears to be required for expression of nitrogenase-3, since cells of the anfA deletion strain CA66 were unable to synthesize this nitrogenase when derepressed in N-free, Mo- and V-deficient medium. The vnfA gene was identified after determination of the nucleotide sequence of DNA flanking the Tn5 insertion in mutant strain CA46. Two open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2) were found located upstream from the vnfA gene, and a nifE-like ORF, preceded by a possible ntrA-dependent promoter, was found downstream from this gene. It is not known whether vnfA is expressed only under N2-fixing conditions. However, potential ntrA-dependent promoters were found immediately upstream from vnfA (within the 3' end of ORF2) and immediately downstream from ORF1. The region spanning ORF1 and ORF2 contained an A + T-rich sequence that was also found immediately upstream from the potential ntrA-dependent promoter of anfA. The product of vnfA appears to be required for the synthesis of nitrogenase-2, since cells of strain CA46 synthesized only nitrogenase-1 and -3 but not nitrogenase-2 when grown in the presence of vanadium. The product of nifA, which is required for synthesis of nitrogenase-1, is not required for synthesis of either nitrogenase-2 or nitrogenase-3. However, growth data indicate that nifA is required for a factor (or factors) necessary for maximal diazotrophic growth under Mo- and V-deficient conditions.
