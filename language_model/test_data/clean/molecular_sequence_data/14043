An 837 nt long group IA intron was discovered in the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis virulent phage LL-H genome. The LL-H intron conforms well to the secondary structure that is common to all group I introns. The only exception is that the extreme 3' nucleotide of the intron is an A residue instead of the usual G; despite this the intron is efficiently spliced in vivo. This LL-H intron contains an ORF, ORF168, which shows homology with endonucleases encoded by ORFs contained in Bacillus subtilis phage introns. At present, the LL-H intron is the only one found in the phages of lactic acid bacteria and the first one to be found in a phage belonging to the most abundant taxonomic group, group B or Siphoviridae. The LL-H intron interrupts gene terL, the product of which (50.5 kDa, TerL) is significantly homologous to the large subunit of B. subtilis phage SPP1 terminase. The product of the upstream gene, terS of LL-H (15.9 kDa, TerS), shows homology to small subunits of B. subtilis phage terminases.
