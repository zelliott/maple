A Gram-stain negative, strictly aerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming, and rod-shaped bacterial strain designated FW-3(T) was isolated from fresh water and its taxonomic position was investigated by using a polyphasic approach. Strain FW-3(T) was found to grow at 10-37 °C and at pH 7.0 in the absence of NaCl on nutrient agar. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain FW-3(T) was shown to belong to the family Acetobacteraceae and to be related to Roseomonas lacus TH-G33(T) (97.2 % sequence similarity) and Roseomonas terrae DS-48(T) (96.4 %). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was determined to be 68.0 %. The major menaquinone was determined to be Q-10 and the major fatty acids were identified as summed feature 7 (comprising C18:1 ω9c/ω12t/ω7c as defined by the MIDI system; 55.4 %), and C18:1 2OH (29.8 %). DNA and chemotaxonomic data supported the affiliation of strain FW-3(T) to the genus Roseomonas. Strain FW-3(T) could be differentiated genotypically and phenotypically from the recognized species of the genus Roseomonas. The novel isolate therefore represents a novel species, for which the name Roseomonas sediminicola sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain FW-3(T) (=KACC 16616(T) = JCM 18210(T)).
