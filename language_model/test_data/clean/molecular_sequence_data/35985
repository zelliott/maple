The blood of the teleost Notothenia angustata contains a major hemoglobin (Hb 1, over 95% of the total), accompanied by a minor component (Hb 2). The two hemoglobins have identical beta chains and differ in their alpha chains. The primary structure of both hemoglobins has been established through the elucidation of the complete amino acid sequence of the three chains. The study of the oxygen-binding properties shows that Hb 1 displays the Bohr and Root effects and has high affinity for organic phosphates. N. angustata belongs to the family Nototheniidae, suborder Notothenioidei. Unlike the vast majority of nototheniid species, which live in isolation in the Antarctic Ocean and have developed cold adaptation, N. angustata inhabits the waters of southern New Zealand and is not cold adapted. Although some hematological parameters typically favour oxygen transport in a temperate environment, the hemoglobin multiplicity and structural and functional features closely resemble those of the Antarctic species of the same family and suborder. Thus, N. angustata may be considered as a link between temperate and Antarctic habitats. The hypothetical separation history of N. angustata from the Antarctic species of the same family is discussed in the light of the present findings.
