The mouse Clara Cell 10 kiloDalton (kDa) protein (mCC10) cDNA was used to isolate a recombinant phage containing the mCC10 gene sequence in a 14 kilobase (kb) insert from a mouse genomic library. A total of 7.7 kb of this clone was sequenced. The sequenced region included: 3.3 kb of 5'-flanking region, 4.2 kb intragenic sequence and 0.2 kb of DNA flanking the 3' end of the gene. Computer assisted sequence analysis identified potential cis acting response elements for the glucocorticoid receptor, hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF3) and octamer (Oct1) binding protein. The presence of B1 murine repetitive sequence also has been identified in a similar position reported in rat CC10 5'-flanking sequence. As with the rat CC10, the mCC10 5'-flanking region also contains deletions of a 2.1 kb and a 0.3 kb sequence present in the rabbit uteroglobin gene, these regions are reported to contain a cluster of glucocorticoid/progesterone receptor binding sites and estrogen receptor binding sites, respectively.
