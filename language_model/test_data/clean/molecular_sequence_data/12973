Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Although the molecular lesions present in the PAH genes of PKU patients have previously been determined in several Slavic populations, little is known regarding the molecular basis of PKU in the non-Slavic populations of the former Soviet Union. Guthrie card samples from twenty-one classical PKU patients residing in the Tatarian Republic were examined by a combination of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequence analysis. Twelve patients were of Tatarian ancestry, five were of Russian ancestry, and four were of mixed Tatarian and Russian ancestry. Two of the Tatarian patients were related, sharing one mutant allele. The single major allele identified in this study was R408W/RFLP haplotype 2/VNTR 3, which was present on 11/14 or 78.6% of all mutant chromosomes of Slavic origin, but on only 10/27 or 37.0% of mutant chromosomes of Tatarian origin. This result suggests that this allele was introduced into central Asian populations during the eastward expansion of Slavs across the Eurasian landmass. A significant influence of Turkic peoples on Tatars can be inferred from the presence of R261Q. IVS10nt546g --> a, L48S, IVS2nt5g --> c and P281L, all of which are relatively common among Turks or have been observed in Mediterranean populations. Together, these alleles are present on 11/27 or 40.7% of all mutant chromosomes in ethnic Tatars. Surprisingly, the common Scandinavian mutation IVS12ntlg --> a was also present in Tataria, as was the delta agE221D222fs mutation found previously only in Denmark. Thus, some direct or indirect gene flow from Scandinavian into Tataria seems evident. Finally, the complete absence of PAH mutations previously observed in Oriental populations suggests that there was little gene flow into Tataria from Eastern Asia.
