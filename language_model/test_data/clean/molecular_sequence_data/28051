A gene of the chloroplast genome has been designated the psbG gene on the basis that in maize the gene product is a 24-kDa polypeptide of photosystem two (PS2) (Steinmetz, A. A., Castroviejo, M., Sayre, R. T., and Bogorad, L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 2485-2488). We have located and sequenced the equivalent gene in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and have raised specific antibodies to the gene product following its expression in Escherichia coli as a beta-galactosidase fusion protein. Using these antibodies, we have investigated the location of the gene product in various thylakoid membrane fractions of pea (Pisum sativum). The gene product of apparent molecular mass 27-28 kDa is severely depleted in PS2-enriched membrane preparations and its distribution between stromal and granal regions of the membrane is distinct to that of the psbC gene product which is known to be a core polypeptide of PS2. We therefore conclude that psbG does not code for a component of PS2 but instead suggest that it is present in a novel protein complex of the thylakoid membrane. On the basis of 1) the conserved overlap between psbG and ndhC, a chloroplast gene which shows significant homology to a mitochondrial gene that codes for a subunit of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase of mitochondria, and 2) sequence similarity between the psbG gene product and the ndh gene product of E. coli, which codes for a respiratory NADH dehydrogenase, we propose that this ill-defined complex functions as a NADH or NADPH-plastoquinone oxidoreductase.
