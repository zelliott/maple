An intracellular oligopeptidase from Lactobacillus paracasei Lc-01 has been purified to homogeneity by Fast Flow Q Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, and Mono Q chromatography. The molecular mass of the enzyme was determined to be 140 kDa by gel filtration and approximately 30 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and SDS-capillary electrophoresis. The pI of the enzyme was at pH 4.5. The enzyme expressed maximum activity at pH 8.0 and 40 degrees C. Oligopeptidase activity on bradykinin was inhibited strongly by 1,10-phenantroline and EDTA and partly by p-chloromercuribenzoic acid but not by phosphoramidon or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Marked inhibition by beta-casein fragment 58 to 72 was demonstrated. The enzyme showed neither general aminopeptidase nor caseinolytic activity, and it degraded only oligopeptides between 8 and 13 amino acids. The enzyme readily hydrolyzed the Phe-Ser and Pro-Phe bonds of bradykinin; the Phe-His bond of angiotensin I; the Pro-Gln, Gln-Phe, and Phe-Gly bonds of substance P; and the Pro-Tyr bond of neurotensin. Weak activity toward the Ala-Tyr and Pro-Ser bonds of alpha(s1)-casein fragment 157 to 164, was observed. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the oligopeptidase showed a high degree of homology to the lactacin B inducer from Lactobacillus acidophilus.
