To understand the mechanisms involved in the regulation of the mitotic cyclin B Nicta; CycB1;1 expression, we have cloned the Nicotiana sylvestris cyclin gene, Nicsy; CycB1;1, whose coding sequence is homologous to that of Nicta;CycB1;1 cDNA. The structure and the function of its 5'-flanking region, 1149 bp upstream of the first start codon, was analysed. By producing stably transformed cells of a synchronized culture with the Nicsy;CycB1;1 promoter/beta-glucuronidase (gus) reporter gene fusion, we demonstrate that the 1149 bp promoter fragment mediates a gus transcriptional oscillation, indistinguishable from that of endogenous Nicsy;CycB1;1 cyclin B transcripts. Transient GUS activity in BY-2 protoplasts reveals that promoter activity is considerably reduced by shortening the 5'-flanking region to 538 or 320 bp. Furthermore, the 320 bp fragment no longer mediates the observed transcriptional regulation of the 1149 bp Nicsy;CycB1;1 promoter in BY-2 protoplasts isolated from synchronized cells.
