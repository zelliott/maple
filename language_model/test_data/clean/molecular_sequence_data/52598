Adhesion receptors expressed on the surfaces of tumor-activated endothelial cells provide an advantageous locus for targeting gene therapy vectors to angiogenic tissues and/or tumor vasculature. In this study, we engineered a series of Asn-Gly-Arg (NGR)-containing congeners of the presumptive cell binding motif contained within the ninth type III repeat of fibronectin and displayed these tumor vasculature targeting motifs (TVTMs) within the context of Moloney murine leukemia envelope "escort" proteins. Comparative studies of envelope incorporation into viral particles and evaluation of the cell binding properties of the targeted vectors revealed critical structural features, thus identifying a subset of optimal TVTMs. Utilizing a modified ELISA to evaluate viral binding to target cells, we observed a significant down-regulation of TVTM-virion binding to human endothelial cells following sustained (48-h) exposure to VEGF. Normalized for equivalent titers (10(6) CFU/ml), as assayed on NIH 3T3 cells, vectors displaying TVTM escort proteins significantly enhanced the transduction efficiency from 12.2 to 37.4% in human KSY-1 endothelial cell cultures (P < 0.001) and from 0.4 to 4.1% in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cultures (P < 0.001). In summary, these studies utilized an engineering approach to identify a subset of TVTMs that are stably incorporated as envelope "escort" proteins into retroviral vectors and that, by functioning to improve the binding efficiency and transduction of both HUVEC and KSY1 endothelial cells, may have therapeutic potential for targeting gene delivery to the tumor-associated vasculature.
