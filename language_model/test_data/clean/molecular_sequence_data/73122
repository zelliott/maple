We have isolated suppressors of the temperature-sensitive rRNA processing mutation rrp2-2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A class of extragenic suppressors was mapped to the YBR257w reading frame in the right arm of Chromosome II. Characterization of this gene, renamed POP4, shows that the gene product is necessary both for normal 5.8S rRNA processing and for processing of tRNA. Immunoprecipitation studies indicate that Pop4p is associated with both RNase MRP and RNase P. The protein is also required for accumulation of RNA from each of the two ribonucleoprotein particles.
