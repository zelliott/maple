The members of the Ipl1-aurora like kinase (IARK) subfamily are conserved serine/threonine kinases that play a key role in the control of chromosome segregation, centrosome separation, and cytokinesis from yeast to mammals. We report on the isolation of a new Drosophila member of the family, designated Ipl1-aurora-like kinase (ial) Phylogenetic analysis of kinase domains established that ial is more divergent from known mammalian IARKs than is aurora. Mapping based on examination of chromosomal aberrations, together with mapping within contigs identified by the Drosophila Genome Project, placed the gene at 32B on the left arm of the second chromosome. Discrete single-gene mutations in this region, including all known relevant P-element disruptions, were examined and proven not to be mutations in ial. Characterization of spatial and temporal expression of ial and its gene product showed that it manifests itself in patterns which can be consistent with a role in cell cycle control.
