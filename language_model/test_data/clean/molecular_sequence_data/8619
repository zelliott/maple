The hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein encoded by measles virus (MV) is a type II integral membrane protein that is expressed at the infected cell surface. Genes encoding wild-type MV HA as well as two mutant HA proteins shortened at their carboxy-termini by either 18 (HA delta 18O) or 223 (HA delta 223) amino acids were constructed and studied in a transient expression system in COS cells. Under nonreducing conditions, assembly of HA delta 18 into homodimers was diminished while HA delta 223 remained in a monomeric form. Hemadsorption assays revealed that neither mutant was functional at the cell surface. These studies show that the carboxy-terminal ectodomain of the HA protein is essential to its proper folding and assembly into homodimers while its carboxy-terminal 18 amino acids are essential for the hemadsorption (receptor-binding) function of the protein.
