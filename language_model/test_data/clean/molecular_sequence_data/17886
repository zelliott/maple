The mammalian genome contains multiple copies of ribosomal protein (rp) L19-related sequences. Screening of mouse and rat genomic libraries with cloned rpL19 cDNA yielded seventeen independent lambda Charon 4A recombinant phages containing twelve and five genes for mouse and rat rpL19, respectively. Structural analysis indicated that all of these rpL19 genes contain the entire coding sequence (approx. 700 bp) but lack introns. The nucleotide sequence of a mouse gene (rpL19-17), exhibiting the highest homology with the mouse rpL19 cDNA, revealed genetic lesions which would preclude the translation of an intact protein, from a putative transcript. Based on these features we propose that these clones represent processed genes of which most, if not all, are pseudogenes.
