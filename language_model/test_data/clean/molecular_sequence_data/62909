The apoptosis protection by plasminogen activator inhibitor -2(PAI-2) is dependent on a 33 amino acids fragment between helix C and D of PAI-2 which is probably may be due to the interaction of PAI-2 with unknown intracellular proteins. In this study we used the fragment between helix C and D of PAI-2 as bait to screen a HeLa cells cDNA library constructed during apoptosis in a yeast two-hybrid system and retrieved a clone that encodes 241 amino acids of proteasome (prosome, macropain) subunit, beta type 1(PSMbeta1) which plays important roles in NF-kappaB activation. GST-pulldown experiments confirmed the interaction between PAI-2 and PSMB1 in vitro. These data suggest that the antiapoptosis activity of PAI-2 is probably related to its interaction with PSMbeta1.
