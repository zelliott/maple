The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase 4 (MKK4), a member of the MAP kinase kinase family, directly phosphorylates and activates the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK), in response to cellular stresses and proinflammatory cytokines. JNK is a member of the MAP kinase family and a key component of a stress activated protein kinase signalling pathway. MKK4 mRNA is widely expressed in adult mouse tissues, but is especially abundant in skeletal muscle and brain. Mice lacking the MKK4 gene had abnormal hepatogenesis and died before embryonic day 14. However cell lines lacking MKK4 have been obtained and these exhibited defective activation of JNK and AP-1 dependent transcription activity in response to some, but not all cellular stresses. Furthermore, T lymphocytes deficient in MKK4 showed impaired IL-2 production following activation of the T cell receptor, suggesting a key role of the MKK4/JNK pathway in inflammation. The mutation of the MKK4 gene in some carcinomas indicates that it may also have a role as a tumor suppressor. Control of the MKK4 activity and expression may provide novel approaches to cancer or anti-inflammatory therapy.
