Function and biochemical properties of the V2 vasopressin receptor (V2R) mutant R337ter, identified in patients suffering from X-linked recessive nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, were investigated by expression in COS.M6 or HEK293 cells. Binding assays and measurements of adenylyl cyclase activity failed to detect function for the truncated receptor, although metabolic labeling demonstrated normal levels of protein synthesis. ELISA assays performed on cells expressing the receptors tagged at the amino terminus with the HA epitope failed to detect V2R R337ter on the plasma membrane. Treatment with endoglycosidase H revealed that the receptor was present only as a precursor form because the mature R337ter V2R, resistant to endoglycosidase H treatment, was not detected. The precursor of V2R-R337ter had a longer half-life than that of the wild type V2R, suggesting that arrested maturation may slow the degradation of the precursor. Unrelated experiments had demonstrated that V2R-G345ter, containing eight additional amino acids, was expressed on the plasma membrane and functioned normally. Receptor truncations longer than 337ter revealed that four of the eight amino acids identified initially provided the minimum length required for the protein to acquire cell surface expression. This was shown by the production of mature receptor (V2R-341ter) detectable in SDS-PAGE, which mediated arginine vasopressin stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity and bound ligand. In addition, the identity of amino acid 340 was found to play a role in this phenomenon. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that the V2R R337ter is nonfunctional because it does not reach the plasma membrane and that the minimal protein length required for translocation of the V2R to the cell surface is sufficient to confer function to the receptor protein. They also suggest the existence of a protein quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum independent of glycosylation.
