Genes that encode mitochondrial homologues to the bacterial enzymes of fatty acid synthesis were found in various eukaryotic species. Inactivation of these genes leads to a disturbed mitochondrial respiration and an increase in mitochondrial lysophospholipids. We postulate that there is a mitochondrial biosynthetic system providing fatty acids for phospholipid repair. The mitochondrial acyl carrier protein may also play another role, supporting the formation of the respiratory NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase.
