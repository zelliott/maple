The presence of haemoparasites belonging to the taxa Anaplasma, Bartonella and Trypanosoma was determined among 76 common shrews (Sorex araneus) from Northwest England. Anaplasma phagocytophilum DNA was recovered from the blood of 1 shrew (1.3%), with the amplified 16S rRNA sequence identical to one previously reported from a bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus). Trypanosoma spp. DNA was detected in 9 shrews (11.8%), the amplified 18S rDNA fragments being indistinguishable from one another, and distinct from previously published data. This represents the first report of trypanosome infection in S. araneus and suggests they are susceptible to an uncharacterized Trypanosoma species. Blood from 11 shrews (14.5%) yielded Bartonella spp., with characterization of isolates using comparative sequence analysis of partial gltA and 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer regions revealing 2 different genotypes. Phylogenetic inference from alignment of partial gltA sequences found that both UK S. araneus types formed a well-supported cluster with Bartonella sp. isolated from S. araneus in Sweden. No significant effect of host age, sex, or year of collection was found on prevalence of Bartonella or trypanosome infections. The results of this survey demonstrate that common shrews in the UK are susceptible to haemoparasitic infections, at prevalences similar to those reported from sympatric rodents.
