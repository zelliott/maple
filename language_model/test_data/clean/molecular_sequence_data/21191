Peptaibols are a family of antimicrobial peptides, which are synthesized by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and contain high proportions of alpha-aminoisobytyric acid (Aib). Up to now, 317 peptaibols have been identified, and the majority of them are produced by Trichoderma strains. In this review, we described the diversity, fermation, purification, identification and biosynthesis of peptaibols from Trichoderma.
