The past 5 years have seen tremendous progress in our knowledge of old yellow enzyme (OYE) as a number of OYEs have been cloned and expressed, a high-resolution crystal structure has been determined for one of these, and new substrates have been found that can be turned over by the enzyme. Together these studies do not yet define the physiological role of OYE, but they lead to significant new insights into the enzymatic properties and structure-function relations of OYE.
