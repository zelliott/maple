We have characterized a transcriptional enhancer of the human urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene and found a regulatory element required for co-operation between a PEA3--AP-1 element and an AP-1 site in the enhancer. We designated this regulatory element co-operation mediator (COM). Both the PEA3--AP-1 element, the AP-1 site and the COM are required for efficient phorbol ester induction of transcription from the uPA promoter in the HepG2 hepatoma cell line. We show that the COM is also required for co-operation between the PEA3--AP-1 element and a glucocorticoid response element, both in the presence or absence of TPA, indicating that the COM is generally capable of mediating synergism between inducible enhancer elements. The COM contains multiple overlapping binding sites for nuclear proteins, designated uPA enhancer factors 1-4 (UEF-1-4). We have identified putative binding sites for UEF-1, -2 and -3. The UEF-1 and -3 sites in the uPA enhancer are highly conserved between species. We demonstrate the binding of UEF-3 to the NIP element, a previously characterized regulatory element in the human interleukin-3 and stromelysin promoters, suggesting that this factor plays a role in regulation of a variety of genes.
