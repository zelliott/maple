A novel lectin (CBA) was isolated from the green alga, Codium barbatum, by conventional chromatographic methods. The hemagglutination-inhibition profile with sugars and glycoproteins indicated that CBA had preferential affinity for complex type N-glycans but not for monosaccharides, unlike the other known Codium lectins specific for N-acetylgalactosamine. CBA consisted of an SS-linked homodimer of a 9257-Da polypeptide containing seven cysteine residues, all of which were involved in disulfide linkages. The cDNA of the CBA subunit coded a polypeptide (105 amino acids) including the signal peptide of 17 residues. The calculated molecular mass from the deduced sequence was 9705 Da, implying that the four C-terminal amino acids of the CBA proprotein subunit were post-translationally truncated to afford the mature subunit (84 amino acids). No significantly similar sequences were found during an in silico search, indicating CBA to be a novel protein. CBA is the first Codium lectin whose primary structure has been elucidated.
