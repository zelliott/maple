The oncogenic BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase facilitates the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). We find that after gamma-irradiation BCR/ABL-positive leukemia cells accumulate more DSBs in comparison to normal cells. These lesions are efficiently repaired in a time-dependent fashion by BCR/ABL-stimulated non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) followed by homologous recombination repair (HRR) mechanisms. However, mutations and large deletions were detected in HRR and NHEJ products, respectively, in BCR/ABL-positive leukemia cells. We propose that unfaithful repair of DSBs may contribute to genomic instability in the Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias.
