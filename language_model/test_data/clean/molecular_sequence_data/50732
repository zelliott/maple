A variable number of tandem repeat from a porcine glucosephosphate isomerase intron has been isolated and sequenced. The repeat has a unit size of 39 bp, is highly conserved and is present in at least 14 copies. Flanking sequences show a sequence periodicity of 53-54 bp and some sequence homology to the 39 bp repeat. A considerable part of the genomic DNA has been lost during subcloning and is considered to be deletion prone or refractory to propagation in E. coli. The tandem repeat is locus specific and detects at least six alleles in BamHI digested porcine DNA. No homology to other tandem repeat sequences has been found.
