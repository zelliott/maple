Herpes simplex virus infection is initiated by VP16, a viral transcription factor that activates the viral immediate-early (IE) genes. VP16 does not recognize the IE gene promoters directly but instead forms a multiprotein complex with Oct-1 and HCF-1, a ubiquitous nuclear protein required for progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The functional significance of recruiting HCF-1 to the VP16-induced complex is not understood. Here we describe the identification of a second HCF-like protein, designated HCF-2. HCF-2 is smaller than HCF-1 but shares three regions of strong amino acid sequence homology, including the beta-propeller domain required for association with VP16. HCF-2 is expressed in many tissues, especially the testis, and shows a more dynamic pattern of subcellular localization than HCF-1. Although HCF-2 associates with VP16 and can support complex assembly with Oct-1 and DNA, it is significantly less efficient than HCF-1. A similar preference is shown by LZIP, a cellular counterpart of VP16. Analysis of chimeric proteins showed that differences between the fifth and sixth kelch repeats of the beta-propeller domains from HCF-1 and HCF-2 dictate this selectivity. These results reveal an unexpected level of specificity in the recruitment of HCF-1 to the VP16-induced complex, paralleling the preferential selection of Oct-1 rather than the closely related POU domain protein Oct-2. Implications for regulation of the viral life cycle are discussed.
