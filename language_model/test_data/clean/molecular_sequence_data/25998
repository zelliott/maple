The structure of the capsular antigen of E. coli K49 and the oligosaccharides derived from it by partial acid hydrolysis were studied by 1D- and 2D-n.m.r. spectroscopy, g.l.c.-c.i.-mass spectrometry, and methylation analysis. The K49 polysaccharide consists of the repeating unit----4)-beta-D-GlcpA-(1----6)-beta-D-Galp-(1----6)-beta-D-Glcp- (1----3)-beta - D-GalpNAc-(1----. The glucuronic acid residues are substituted, in the apparent molar ratio of 4:1, with L-threonine and L-serine linked amidically to the carboxyl group.
