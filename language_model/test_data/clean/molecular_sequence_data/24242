The C-type carbohydrate-recognition domains of E-selectin and rat serum mannose-binding protein have similar structures. Selectin/mannose-binding protein chimeras created by transfer of key sequences from E-selectin into mannose-binding protein have previously been shown to bind the selectin ligand sialyl-Lewis(X) through a Ca(2+)-dependent subsite, common to many C-type lectins, and an accessory site containing positively charged amino acid residues. Further characterization of these chimeras as well as analysis of novel constructs containing additional regions of E-selectin demonstrate that selectin-like interaction with sialyl-Lewis(X) can be faithfully reproduced even though structural evidence indicates that the mechanisms of binding to E-selectin and the chimeras are different. Selectin-like binding to the nonfucosylated sulfatide and sulfoglucuronyl glycolipids can also be reproduced with selectin/mannose-binding protein chimeras that contain the two subsites involved in sialyl-Lewis(X) binding. These results indicate that binding of structurally distinct anionic glycans to C-type carbohydrate-recognition domains can be mediated by the Ca(2+)-dependent subsite in combination with a positively charged region that forms an ionic strength-sensitive subsite.
