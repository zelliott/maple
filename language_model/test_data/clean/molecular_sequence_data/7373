A previously recognized open reading frame (T. Yura, H. Mori, H. Nagai, T. Nagata, A. Ishihama, N. Fujita, K. Isono, K. Mizobuchi, and A. Nakata, Nucleic Acids Res. 20:3305-3308) from the 0.2-min region of the Escherichia coli K-12 chromosome is shown to encode a functional transaldolase activity. After cloning of the gene onto high-copy-number vectors, transaldolase B (D-sedoheptulose-7-phosphate:D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dihydroxyacetone transferase; EC 2.2.1.2) was overexpressed up to 12.7 U mg of protein-1 compared with less than 0.1 U mg of protein-1 in wild-type homogenates. The enzyme was purified from recombinant E. coli K-12 cells by successive ammonium sulfate precipitations (45 to 80% and subsequently 55 to 70%) and two anion-exchange chromatography steps (Q-Sepharose FF, Fractogel EMD-DEAE tentacle column; yield, 130 mg of protein from 12 g of cell wet weight) and afforded an apparently homogeneous protein band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a subunit size of 35,000 +/- 1,000 Da. As the enzyme had a molecular mass of 70,000 Da by gel filtration, transaldolase B is likely to form a homodimer. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the protein verified its identity with the product of the cloned gene talB. The specific activity of the purified enzyme determined at 30 degrees C with the substrates fructose-6-phosphate (donor of C3 compound) and erythrose-4-phosphate (acceptor) at an optimal pH (50 mM glycylglycine [pH 8.5]) was 60 U mg-1.Km values for the substrates fructose-6-phosphate and erythrose-4-phosphate were determined at 1,200 and 90 microM, respectively. Kinetic constants for the other two physiological reactants, D,L-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (Km, 38 microM; relative activity [V(rel)], 8%) and sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (K(m), 285 microM; V(rel), 5%) were also determined. Fructose acted as a C(3) donor at a high apparent K(m) (>/=M) and with a V(rel) of 12%. The enzyme was inhibited by Tris-HCl, phosphate, or sugars with the L configuration at C(2) (L-glyceraldehyde, D-arabinose-5-phosphate).
