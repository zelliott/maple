We report the characterization of a novel serine protease of the chymotrypsin family, recently isolated by cDNA-representational difference analysis, as a gene overexpressed in pancreatic cancer. The 2.3-kb mRNA of the gene, named TMPRSS3, is strongly expressed in a subset of pancreatic cancer and various other cancer tissues, and its expression correlates with the metastatic potential of the clonal SUIT-2 pancreatic cancer cell lines. The deduced polypeptide sequence consists of 437 amino acids and exhibits all of the structural features characteristic of serine proteases with trypsin-like activity. TMPRSS3 is membrane bound with a NH2-terminal signal-anchor sequence and a glycosylated extracellular region containing the serine protease domain. Thus, TMPRSS3 is a novel membrane-bound serine protease overexpressed in cancer, which may be of importance for processes involved in metastasis formation and tumor invasion.
