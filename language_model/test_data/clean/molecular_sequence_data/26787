The microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton orchestrates the cellular plasticity and dynamics that underlie morphogenesis and cell division. Growing MT plus ends have emerged as dynamic regulatory machineries in which specialized proteins-called plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs)-bind to and control the plus-end dynamics that are essential for cell division and migration. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the plus-end regulation by +TIPs at spindle and astral MTs have remained elusive. Here, we show that TIP150 is a new +TIP that binds to end-binding protein 1 (EB1) in vitro and co-localizes with EB1 at the MT plus ends in vivo. Suppression of EB1 eliminates the plus-end localization of TIP150. Interestingly, TIP150 also binds to mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK), an MT depolymerase that localizes to the plus end of MTs. Suppression of TIP150 diminishes the plus-end localization of MCAK. Importantly, aurora B-mediated phosphorylation disrupts the TIP150-MCAK association in vitro. We reason that TIP150 facilitates the EB1-dependent loading of MCAK onto MT plus ends and orchestrates the dynamics at the plus end of MTs.
