Laccase-encoding sequences sharing 65-71% identity were shuffledin vivo by homeologous recombination. Yeast efficiently repaired linearized plasmids containing clac1, clac2 or clac5 Trametes sp. C30 cDNAs using a clac3 PCR fragment. From transformants secreting active variants, three chimeric laccases (LAC131, LAC232 and LAC535), each resulting from double crossovers, were purified, and their apparent kinetic parameters were determined using 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) and syringaldazine (SGZ) as substrates. At acidic pH, the apparent kinetic parameters of the chimera were not distinguishable from each other or from those obtained for the LAC3 enzyme used as reference. On the other hand, the pH tolerance of the variants was visibly extended towards alkaline pH values. Compared to the parental LAC3, a 31-fold increase in apparent k(cat) was observed for LAC131 at pH 8. This factor is one of the highest ever observed for laccase in a single mutagenesis step.
