Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes representing sheep satellite I and satellite II DNAs shows a different distribution of the two repetitive DNA families in the centromeric region of most chromosomes. The single signal per chromosome produced by the satellite I probe suggests close proximity of this DNA family to the primary constriction. Satellite II produces two separate signals on the sister chromatids, and large blocks of satellite II DNA constitute most of the short arm of all acrocentric chromosomes. We have isolated and sequenced a phage clone containing a junction between discrete blocks of satellite I and satellite II sequences. The junction is characterized by an abrupt juxtaposition of arrays of the two satellites. The possibility that the peculiar structural features of this junction could have a functional significance is discussed.
