Two forms of murine recombinant interleukin-1 beta (mrIL-1 beta) from Escherichia coli were purified by ion exchange column chromatography; each exhibited equivalent biological activity in the murine thymocyte proliferation assay. It was determined by mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides that both retained the initiating methionine but one form was N alpha-acetylated at the N-terminus.
