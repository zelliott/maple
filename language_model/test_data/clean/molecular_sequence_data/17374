The full-length cDNA of dog preproendothelin-3 (PPET3) was cloned from lung tissue using RT-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Aside from the poly (A) tail, the full-length cDNA was 1976 bp. A polyadenylation signal sequence and one copy of a consensus sequence, ATTTA, which is related to mRNA turnover, was found in the 3' noncoding region. The cDNA had a 594-bp open reading frame encoding a 198-amino acid polypeptide. Regions corresponding to a bioactive mature ET3 peptide, an intermediate form known as big-ET3, and an ET3-like peptide were observed in dog PPET3. Expression of PPET3 mRNA was detected throughout the organs examined, which included heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, stomach, pancreas, duodenum, colon, uterus, ovary and testis.
