Six DNA fragments of interphase chromosomes isolated from nuclear envelopes of murine hepatocytes were cloned and sequenced. Analysis of their structural-functional organization suggests that these fragments are highly specified protein-nonencoding fractions of a eukaryotic genome. In the evolutionary process, they appear already in archaebacteria and may be "ancestral" for DNA sequences involved in structuring chromosomal domains (rosette-like structures) of tissue-specific genes. In their composition, these fragments have nucleotide sequences homologous to the repeats of the SINE and LINE families and to the satellite DNA of murine centromeres.
