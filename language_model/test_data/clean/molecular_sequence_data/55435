The diversity of gene cassette promoters in class 1 integrons was investigated in 47 strains isolated from wastewaters. The weak PcW and PcH1 variants predominated, suggesting that, similar to clinical environments, high rates of gene cassette recombination, rather than high expression of gene cassettes, have been preferentially selected in wastewaters.
