Abalone sperm lysin is a nonenzymatic, 16-kDa protein that creates a hole in the egg vitelline envelope (VE) through which the sperm swims to fuse with the egg. The dissolution of isolated VE by lysin is species specific. Interspecies comparisons show that the most divergent region of lysin is the N-terminal segment of residues 1-12 which is always species-unique. The C-terminus and three internal segments are moderately variable between species, but not species unique. Analysis of nucleotide substitutions shows that lysin evolves rapidly by positive Darwinian selection, suggesting that there is adaptive value in altering its amino acid sequence. The results reported here, in which segments of lysin were exchanged between two species, prove by direct experimentation that the interspecies variable termini play major roles in the species-specific recognition between sperm lysin and the egg VE.
