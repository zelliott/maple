Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria are common microorganisms in a variety of sulfide-rich environments. They play important roles in the global sulfur cycle on earth. Here, we present a high-quality draft genome sequence of a sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, "Candidatus Sulfurovum sediminum" strain AR, which belongs to the class Epsilonproteobacteria and dominated an enrichment culture from a marine sediment collected off Svalbard, within the Arctic Circle. Its genome contains genes for sulfur oxidation and carbon fixation. The size of the draft genome is 2.12 Mb, and the G+C content is 39.4%.
