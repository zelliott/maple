The cDNA for rat monoamine oxidase B mRNA was isolated from liver cDNA library in lambda gt11 using specific antibody and oligonucleotide probes derived from FAD-containing peptide of the enzyme. The primary structure of the protein, deduced from the nucleotide sequence, consisted of 520 amino acid residues and its molecular weight was calculated to be 58.4 kD which is in good agreement with that of the in vitro-synthesized peptide. FAD-binding site is located in the carboxy-terminal region. There is no typical structural feature common to the targeting signals for mitochondria, the periodic distribution of basic amino acids spaced by several uncharged residues, at its amino-terminal region. This region has an uninterrupted stretch of 14 hydrophobic residues.
