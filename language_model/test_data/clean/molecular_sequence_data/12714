Using a panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids, we have previously mapped the gene (HPD, previously called PPD) encoding 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase to the distal half of the long arm of human chromosome 12, region q14-->qter. To obtain a genomic probe useful for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis we screened a human leukocyte genomic library and isolated a 13.4-kb phage clone, which by restriction fragment and sequence analyses was shown to contain exons 1-10 of HPD and approximately 2-kb upstream sequences. We now report the subregional localization of HPD to 12q24-->qter based on two color FISH analysis employing this clone.
