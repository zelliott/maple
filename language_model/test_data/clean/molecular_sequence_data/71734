The expression of the murine Prl-1 protein tyrosine phosphatase gene was examined in normal embryos from E10.5 through E18.5. Prl-1 mRNA was detected in the brain, neural tube, and dorsal root ganglia, and in several non-neuronal tissues, including the skeletal system. Heart and skeletal muscle were consistently negative. At E13.5, Prl-1 was expressed in the condensing prechondrogenic cells of the vertebrae, whereas at E18.5, Prl-1 mRNA was localized to the hypertrophic chondrocytes. The dynamic expression of Prl-1 during cartilage differentiation may suggest a functional role in skeletal development.
