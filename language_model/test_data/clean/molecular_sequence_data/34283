Calcineurin is a phosphatase that is activated at the last known stage of mitosis, abscission. Among its many substrates, it dephosphorylates dynamin II during cytokinesis at the midbody of dividing cells. However, dynamin II has several cellular roles including clathrin-mediated endocytosis, centrosome cohesion and cytokinesis. It is not known whether dynamin II phosphorylation plays a role in any of these functions nor have the phosphosites involved in cytokinesis been directly identified. We now report that dynamin II from rat lung is phosphorylated to a low stoichiometry on a single major site, Ser-764, in the proline-rich domain. Phosphorylation on Ser-764 also occurred in asynchronously growing HeLa cells and was greatly increased upon mitotic entry. Tryptic phospho-peptides isolated by TiO(2) chromatography revealed only a single phosphosite in mitotic cells. Mitotic phosphorylation was abolished by roscovitine, suggesting the mitotic kinase is cyclin-dependent kinase 1. Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 phosphorylated full length dynamin II and Glutathione-S-Transferase-tagged-dynamin II-proline-rich domain in vitro, and mutation of Ser-764 to alanine reduced proline-rich domain phosphorylation by 80%, supporting that there is only a single major phosphosite. Ser-764 phosphorylation did not affect clathrin-mediated endocytosis or bulk endocytosis using penetratin-based phospho-deficient or phospho-mimetic peptides or following siRNA depletion/rescue experiments. Phospho-dynamin II was enriched at the mitotic centrosome, but this targeting was unaffected by the phospho-deficient or phospho-mimetic peptides. In contrast, the phospho-mimetic peptide displaced endogenous dynamin II, but not calcineurin, from the midbody and induced cytokinesis failure. Therefore, phosphorylation of dynamin II primarily occurs on a single site that regulates cytokinesis downstream of calcineurin, rather than regulating endocytosis or centrosome function.
