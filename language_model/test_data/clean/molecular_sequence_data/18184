We have cloned and sequenced the gene encoding the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB1) from Arabidopsis thaliana and partially sequenced genes from soybean (Glycine max). We have also determined the nucleotide sequence for a number of cDNA clones which encode the carboxyl terminal domains (CTDs) of RNA polymerase II from both soybean and Arabidopsis. The Arabidopsis RPB1 gene encodes a polypeptide of approximately 205 kDa, consists of 12 exons, and encompasses more than 8 kb. Predicted amino acid sequence shows eight regions of similarity with the largest subunit of other prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA polymerases, as well as a highly conserved CTD unique to RNA polymerase II. The CTDs in plants, like those in most other eukaryotes, consist of tandem heptapeptide repeats with the consensus amino acid sequence PTSPSYS. The portion of RPB1 which encodes the CTD in plants differs from that of RPB1 of animals and lower eukaryotes. All the plant genes examined contain 2-3 introns within the CTD encoding regions, and at least two plant genes contain an alternatively spliced intron in the 3' untranslated region. Several clustered amino acid substitutions in the CTD are conserved in the two plant species examined, but are not found in other eukaryotes. RPB1 is encoded by a multigene family in soybean, but a single gene encodes this subunit in Arabidopsis and most other eukaryotes.
