Growth-blocking peptide (GBP) is an insect biogenic peptide that prevents the onset of metamorphosis from larva to pupa. A cDNA coding for GBP is described. Mixed oligonucleotides derived from a GBP peptide sequence were used to generate amplified DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Based on the sequence of the amplified DNA, a 41 bases oligonucleotide was designed for screening a cDNA library which was constructed from the armyworm Pseudaletia separata larvae parasitized with the parasitic wasp Cotesia kariyai. The cloned cDNA for GBP was 809 base pairs in length. An open reading frame of 429 base pairs encodes a pre-pro-peptide of 143 amino acid residues in which GBP is localized at the C-terminal region, and other three peptides including a putative signal peptide and appropriate processing sites for endoproteolytic cleavage precede the GBP sequence. Northern blot analyses demonstrate the presence of a 800-base mRNA transcript in fat body and 2.5-kilobase transcript in brain and nerve cord, suggesting the possibility that the transcription of GBP gene is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner. This interpretation was supported by isolating a GBP cDNA fragment from cDNA pool of brain-nerve cords. GBP mRNA is constantly expressed in both parasitized and non-parasitized last instar larvae and there is no difference in the levels of the mRNA between both larvae, thus indicating that parasitism may effect on translational or posttranslational level to elevate plasma GBP concentration.
