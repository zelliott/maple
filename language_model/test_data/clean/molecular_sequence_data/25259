In humans, apolipoprotein (apo) B48 is synthesized in the intestine as an obligatory constituent of chylomicrons. Apolipoprotein B48 is identical to the amino-terminal 2152 amino acids (240 kDa) of apoB100 and is translated from an edited apoB mRNA in which codon 2153 has been converted from glutamine (CAA) to what is recognized as a premature stop codon (UAA). To determine whether the apoB mRNA editing in fact converts cytosine 6666 in codon 2153 to uracil, we incubated a synthetic apoB RNA containing 32P-labeled cytosines in an in vitro editing system prepared from rabbit enterocytes. The in vitro edited RNA was purified and digested to nucleoside 5'-monophosphates, which were analyzed on two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. We found that the edited base co-migrated with authentic uridine 5'-monophosphate. Thus, cytosine 6666 is converted to uracil, most likely by a nucleotide-specific cytosine deaminase. To determine whether apoB mRNA editing occurs in cell lines that do not synthesize apoB, we stably transfected a high expression vector containing 354 base pairs of apoB sequence into 18 different cell lines. We found apoB mRNA editing activity in five osteosarcoma cell lines and one epidermoid cell line, none of which synthesizes any detectable apoB. Thus, apoB mRNA editing occurs in cell lines that do not synthesize apoB, which suggests that mRNA editing may be a common biological phenomenon in eukaryotic cells.
