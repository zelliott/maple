A full-length cDNA clone for human 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) was isolated from a human adult heart cDNA library. The clone encoded an open reading frame of 483 amino acids. When the amino acid sequences of human PGD and sheep PGD were aligned, 94.2% identity between these two proteins was found. Its calculated molecular weight is 53,149 daltons. The predicted isoelectric point is 6.85. When the secondary structure of human PGD was examined by the PROSIS software, 36% alpha-helix and 9% beta-sheet were found.
