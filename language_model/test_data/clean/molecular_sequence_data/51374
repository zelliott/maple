Oligosaccharides from hyaluronic acid and chondroitin 6-sulfate were prepared by digestion with testicular hyaluronidase and separated according to their degree of polymerization by gel-permeation chromatography. These materials were successively analyzed by negative-mode ion-spray mass spectrometry with an atmospheric-pressure ion source. An ion-spray interface was used to produce ions via the ion evaporation process, producing mass spectra containing a series of molecular species carrying multiple charges. Using two adjacent multiply charged molecular ions, the exact molecular weights up to the tetradecasaccharide were calculated with a precision of +/- 1 dalton. This type of mass spectrometry was also demonstrated to be feasible for the analysis of mixtures of oligosaccharides, including tetra-, hexa-, octa- and decasaccharides, from hyaluronic acid or chondroitin 6-sulfate without separation. Ion-spray mass spectrometry was thus shown to be applicable to the structural analysis of oligosaccharides from glycosaminoglycans.
