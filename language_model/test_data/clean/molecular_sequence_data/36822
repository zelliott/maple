Two types of oligonucleotide derivatives which are substituted by P(V) porphyrin at the phosphorus atom of an internucleotidic linkage and at the 5'-terminal internucleotidic linkage via a spacer were synthesized (Fig. 1), and hybridization capabilities of them with complementary oligonucleotides were evaluated. A novel method for a sensing of oligonucleotide by the fluorescence quenching via photo-induced electron transfer between the P(V) porphyrin labeled oligonucleotide and pyrene-labeled one on the oligonucleotide template is reported.
