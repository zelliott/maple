A total of 15590 unique zebrafish EST clusters from two cDNA libraries have been identified. Most significantly, only 22% (3437) of the 15590 unique clusters matched 2805 (of 15200) clusters in the Danio rerio UniGene database, indicating that our EST set is complementary to the existing ESTs in the public database and will be invaluable in assisting the annotation of genes based on the upcoming zebrafish genome sequence. Blast search showed that 7824 of our unique clusters matched 6710 known or predicted proteins in the nonredundant database. A cDNA microarray representing approximately 3100 unique zebrafish cDNA clusters has been generated and used to profile the gene expression patterns across six different embryonic stages (cleavage, blastula, gastrula, segmentation, pharyngula, and hatching). Analysis of expression data using K-means clustering revealed that genes coding for muscle-specific proteins displayed similar expression patterns, confirming that the coordinate gene expression is important for myogenesis. Our results demonstrate that the combination of microarray technology with the zebrafish model system can provide useful information on how genes are coordinated in a genetic network to control zebrafish embryogenesis and can help to identify novel genes that are important for organogenesis.
