Helper T lymphocytes play a critical role in immune system activation following recognition of MHC class II-bound peptide ligands (pMHCII). These CD4 T cells stimulate B cell antibody production and cytolytic T cell generation. Until recently, the structural basis of coordinate T cell receptor (TCR) and CD4 co-receptor interaction with a given pMHCII was unknown. Here we review current structural data on specific pMHCII recognition by T cells and compare TCR and co-receptor docking to pMHCI versus pMHCII ligands. The implications of these findings for thymic selection, helper versus cytolytic T cell recognition and alloreactivity are discussed.
