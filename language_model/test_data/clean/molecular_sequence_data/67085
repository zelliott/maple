The human monoclonal antibody 8F9 binds to a linear 10 amino acid epitope that is present within the N-terminal region of the gB envelope glycoprotein of HCMV. Here we show that this short sequence (ETIYNTTLKY) can function as a tag for the detection of recombinant proteins using antibody 8F9. The AD-2S1 tag was recognized by 8F9 whether present at the N- or C-terminus of recombinant proteins and tagged recombinant proteins could be quantified with multiple analytical techniques such as ELISA, western blotting, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Production of 8F9 using different constant regions or constant regions from different species enhances the convenience and range of use of this system which we term the Recombinant Immunoglobulin and Viral Epitope Tag System or RIVETS.
