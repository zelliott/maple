Six HLA class I and class II-homozygous Chinese cell lines with unique HLA-Dw types were studied. Since the majority of HLA class II nucleotide sequence polymorphism is localized within the second exons of the genes, we used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify these regions in HLA-DQA and DQB genes and subsequently determined the nucleotide sequences. No unique DQA1 or DQB1 alleles were found. However, a new haplotype of DQA1*0601-DQB1*0301-DRB1*1202 was found in two cells; and DQA1*03011 was found in association with DR9 in another two cells. This indicates that new DR-DQ associations may explain the observed new HLA-Dw types. The DQB2 sequences were identical in all six cells and were identical to a sequence previously reported in a DR6 haplotype. The DQA2 sequences from two clones obtained from two cells differed from each other and from previously reported sequences. The results show that the DQA1 and DQB1 alleles in the Chinese individuals studied are as previously reported in Caucasian populations and as such may be typed by restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) or PCR-sequence-specific oligonucleotide typing (PCR-SSO) or PCR-RFLP using conventional probe or restriction enzyme sets.
