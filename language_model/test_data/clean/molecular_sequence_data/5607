We have cloned a cDNA encoding a novel protein of 302 amino acids (designated Noc2, no C2 domain) that has 40.7% amino acid identity with and 77.9% similarity to the N-terminal region of rabphilin-3A, a target molecule of Rab3A. However, unlike rabphilin-3A, Noc2 lacks two C2 domains that are thought to interact with Ca2+ and phospholipids. Noc2 is expressed predominantly in endocrine tissues and hormone-secreting cell lines and at very low levels in brain. Immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractions of the insulin-secreting cell line MIN6 and immunocytochemistry reveal that Noc2 is a 38-kDa protein present in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of Noc2 in PC12 cells cotransfected with growth hormone enhances high K+-induced growth hormone secretion. Screening a mouse embryonic cDNA library with the yeast two-hybrid system shows that Noc2 interacts with the LIM domain-containing protein zyxin, a component of the cytoskeleton, and this interaction is further confirmed by the coimmunoprecipitation experiment. Accordingly, Noc2 is probably involved in regulated exocytosis in endocrine cells by interacting with the cytoskeleton.
