Rpi-blb2, which is originally derived from Solanum bulbocastanum, is a broad-spectrum potato late blight resistance gene and belongs to the NBS-LRR family. Here, the LRR homologues of Rpi-blb2 were cloned with PCR method from 40 potato cultivars (including 20 resistant potato cultivars and 20 susceptible ones) and 7 wild potato populations. Then, the similarities of the sequences, polymorphic (segregating) sites, and nucleotide diversities were estimated by bioinformatic methods. The results showed that high nucleotide polymorphism and some hot-spot mutations existed in the LRR region of Rpi-blb2. The test of Ka/Ks ratio showed that the function of LRR was conserved because of the purifying selection, although different positions of the Rpi-blb2 LRR region were under different selection pressures. Moreover, the LRR region of Rpi-blb2 had no clear differentiation between the cultivated and wild potatoes.
