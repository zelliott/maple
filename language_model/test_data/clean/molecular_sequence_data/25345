The hemagglutinin gene primary structure of influenza virus A/Riga/9977/86 (H3N2) belonging to the "Coen/84" antigenic subgroup was determined by primer sequencing. A comparative analysis confirmed that the reversions of amino acids in the late stages of the H3 influenza virus subtype antigenic drift became more frequent and the antigenic variants remained in epidemic circulation longer. The possible role of some mutations is discussed.
