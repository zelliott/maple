During last years the significant progress was achieved in studying of chemosignaling systems of plants. Using these systems, phytohormones realize regulation of wide spectrum of biochemical and physiological processes in plant cells. The review considers some types of plant chemosignaling systems that differ in structural-functional organization and molecular mechanisms of signal transduction to the effector proteins responsible for gene expression. Among them there activated by cytokinins, ethylene and brassinosteroids two-component signaling systems involving receptor protein kinases as a sensor, and activated by auxin, gibberellins and jasmonates multicomponent SCF-complexes possessing ubiquitin ligase activity. Recently, signaling systems involving receptors of the serpentine type and coupled with them heterotrimeric G-proteins which are widely presented in the animals and fungi were found in plants. Conclusion were drawn similarity of two-component and G-protein-coupled signaling systems in plants and fungi, and about unique nature of plant signaling systems involving SCF-complexes.
