Intelectin is a newly characterized gene family involved in early embryogenesis, host-pathogen interactions and iron metabolism. In this study, we searched the genomes of metazoans by extensive BLAST survey and found no intelectin homologs in invertebrate metazoans but 12 in amphioxus Branchiostoma floridae and 21 in ascidians Ciona intestinalis. Some ascidians oocyte cortical granule lectins (CGLs) have unknown insertion sequences between fibrinogen-related domain (FReD) and Intelectin Domain, the boundaries of which are equivalent to exon structures. In addition to ascidians intelectins/CGLs located in the base, phylogenetic tree comprises four main clades representing mammal, frog, fish, and amphioxus, indicating that intelectin genes undergo extensive lineage-specific duplication or gene conversion. However, genomic neighborhood surrounding analysis shows that clear proto-orthologies are difficult to be established among these counterparts. In addition, sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis of FReDs from intelectins and other fibrinogen-like proteins from choanoflagellate, anemone, frog and human indicate FReDs of intelectins are unique. Likewise, these choanoflagellate and anemone genes may be close to intelectin gene.
