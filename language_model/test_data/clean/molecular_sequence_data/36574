Mutations in the ESP1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae disrupt normal cell-cycle control and cause many cells in a mutant population to accumulate extra spindle pole bodies. To determine the stage at which the esp1 gene product becomes essential for normal cell-cycle progression, synchronous cultures of ESP1 mutant cells were exposed to the nonpermissive temperature for various periods of time. The mutant cells retained viability until the onset of mitosis, when their viability dropped markedly. Examination of these cells by fluorescence and electron microscopy showed the first detectable defect to be a structural failure in the spindle. Additionally, flow cytometric analysis of DNA content demonstrated that massive chromosome missegregation accompanied this failure of spindle function. Cytokinesis occurred despite the aberrant nuclear division, which often resulted in segregation of both spindle poles to the same cell. At later times, the missegregated spindle pole bodies entered a new cycle of duplication, thereby leading to the accumulation of extra spindle pole bodies within a single nucleus. The DNA sequence predicts a protein product similar to those of two other genes that are also required for nuclear division: the cut1 gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and the bimB gene of Aspergillus nidulans.
