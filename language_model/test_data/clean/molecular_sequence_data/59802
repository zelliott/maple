We have previously reported the isolation of a cDNA encoding a mitotic cyclin, NTCYC1, from a tobacco cell suspension library. Here we describe the expression patterns of NTCYC1 and of Ntsuc1, a suc 1 plant homologue, in synchronized tobacco cell suspensions. Furthermore, the expression pattern of this cyclin is compared to that of Ntcdc2-1, a Nicotiana tabacum homologue of cdc2. While no NTCYC1 transcript was detected in cells synchronized in the G1 and S phases, NTCYC1 expression was observed in late G2 and early M phases, disappearing in the G1' of a new cell cycle. On the other hand, Ntsuc1 and Ntcdc2-1 exhibited a constitutive expression during the cell cycle. A functional analysis performed by microinjecting NTCYC1 mRNA into immature Xenopus oocytes, indicates that NTCYC1 could participate in the control of the G2/M transition in plant cells. Subsequently NTCYC1 expression was used to assess the status of mesophyll cells in expanded leaves of N. tabacum. Depending on leaf position along the shoot axis, a large population of mesophyll cells appeared with a 4C DNA content, suggesting a G2 arrest. It was found that leaves with such a population also contained high levels of NTCYC1 transcripts. With respect to these results concerning a naturally occurring G2-arrested cell population, the regulation of NTCYC1 expression in planta is discussed.
