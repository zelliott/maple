In mammals, bombesin-like peptides mediate a broad range of physiological functions through binding to three highly conserved G-protein-coupled receptors: the neuromedin B-preferring, the gastrin-releasing peptide-preferring, and the bombesin-receptor subtype 3. Selective modulation of these receptors presents opportunities for the development of novel therapeutics. To ascertain if rhesus monkey could serve as a surrogate animal model for the development of modulators of bombesin-like receptor function, we undertook a search for additional receptor family members and studied the expression profiles of the three known bombesin-related receptors. We found no evidence for additional receptor family members in mammals, suggesting that the expression of the previously described bombesin-receptor subtype 4 is limited to amphibians. We studied the distribution of the three receptors in a broad array of human and rhesus monkey tissues. Based on the similarity between the human and the rhesus expression profiles, we conclude that the rhesus monkey may be a suitable animal model to evaluate the clinical efficacy and potential side effects of bombesin-like peptide ligands.
