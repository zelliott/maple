In a community follow-up conducted in the Central Highlands of Madagascar, the cellular responses to synthetic peptides from the immunodominant regions of Pf155/RESA and the repeat region of the circumsporozoite protein were studied. Seasonal variations of the T cell response were measured at the individual level; the relationship between this response and the presence of parasites in blood was assessed; the question of the possible protective value of the lymphocyte proliferation in presence of a specific antigen was addressed.
