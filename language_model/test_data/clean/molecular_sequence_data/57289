We examined the DNA in two families with ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC) deficiency. Two point mutations of the OTC gene, a C-to-T (codon 141) and a G-to-A (codon 141), were identified. This allowed prenatal monitoring to be made for two fetuses in each family, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization or TaqI digestion of amplified sequence. The diagnoses showed heterozygotes of a wild type gene and the corresponding mutant gene in these fetuses; each was confirmed postnatally.
