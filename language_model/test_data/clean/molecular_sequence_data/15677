A novel strain, SHET, of aerobic bacteriochlorophyll a-containing bacteria was isolated from the surface layer of bottom sediments from the soda lake Shuluutai-Ekhe-Torom (Chita oblast, Eastern Siberia, Russia). The lake water has a total mineralization of 3.0 g/l and a pH of 9.2. The cells of strain SHET are cocci or short rods, which reproduce by uniform division. The cells are motile by means of flagella. The cell wall structure is of the gram-negative type. Sparse intracytoplasmic membrane vesicles are located close to the cell wall. The new isolate is an obligate aerobe and facultative alkaliphile which grows in a pH range of 7.5-9.5 (with an optimum at pH 8.5-9.0). The best growth of strain SHET occurred at 2.0 g/l NaCl and 23-28 degrees C. Photosynthetic pigments are represented by bacteriochlorophyll a, with the maximum absorption at 865 nm in the in vivo spectrum, and carotenoids (spirilloxanthin derivatives). Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences demonstrated that strain SHET is closely related to Roseococcus thiosulfatophilus of the alpha-1 subclass of Proteobacteria (98.6 % similarity). The DNA G + C base content is 69.1 mol %. Unlike Rsc. thiosulfatophilus, strain SHET grows well on sugars and glycerol and is not capable of utilizing thiosulfate as an energy source. The new isolate is a facultative alkaliphile and reduces nitrates to nitrites. On the basis of its phenotypic and genetic characteristics, strain SHET was described as a new species of the genus Roseococcus, Rsc. suduntuyensis sp. nov.
