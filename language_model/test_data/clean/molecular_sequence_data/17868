Homogenates of rat submandibular glands were electrophoresed on isoelectric focussing gels and bands of proteinase activity demonstrated by means of overlay membranes impregnated with fluorogenic oligopeptide substrates. Inhibition characteristics of individual proteinase bands were tested within the gels and after excision and subsequent elution from the gels. Some bands of activity were resistant to inhibition by pre-incubation of the gel with certain inhibitors, but were subsequently found to be inhibited when tested with the same substrate after elution. These inconsistencies were influenced by the use of different substrates. The results indicate that, though some useful screening information may be obtained by applying inhibitors to the gels, this system does not permit a reliable assessment of inhibition characteristics which require subsequent elution and assay.
