A large scale microarray (20k MMC1) from the African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae was used to monitor gene expression in insecticide resistant and susceptible strains of the Asian mosquito Anopheles stephensi. Heterologous hybridization at slightly reduced stringency yielded approximately 7000 significant signals. Thirty-six putative genes were differentially transcribed between the pyrethroid-resistant (DUB-R) and the susceptible (BEECH) strains. The expression profiles of selected transcripts were verified by real-time PCR. A gene putatively involved in the thickening of the adult cuticle showed the most striking up-regulation in DUB-R. A more specialized microarray containing 231 An. gambiae genes putatively involved in insecticide detoxification was used to further analyse classical insecticide resistance genes. Three glutathione S-transferase (GST) transcripts, one esterase and a cytochrome P450 were up-regulated in the resistant strain, while two peroxidases were down-regulated.
