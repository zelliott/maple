Using a combination of polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism techniques (PCR-SSCP) we have analyzed 78 brain tumor samples (70 primary and 8 metastatic) for the presence of mutations in the conserved regions of the Tp53 (tumor p53) gene. We have found that only two groups, gliomas (exclusively in astrocytomas) and metastases, displayed Tp53 mutations. Three of eight (37.5%) metastases showed a mutant Tp53 allele accompanied by loss of the normal one. In contrast, the frequency of Tp53 mutations in the primary brain tumors examined was lower (5.7%). Although we have examined different types of primary brain tumors, Tp53 mutations were exclusively observed in both, low and high-grade astrocytomas (four of 24). The Tp53 mutations detected in astrocytic tumors appear to be correlated with the malignancy grade. The low-grade astrocytomas were heterozygous for the mutation, whereas the high-grade astrocytomas had affected the two Tp53 alleles, suggesting a two-steps model for inactivation of the p53 gene in astrocytomas. Thus, single p53 mutation seems to occur in initial stages of astrocytoma tumorigenesis; the later lost of the remaining wild-type allele appears associated with the progression towards a more malignant stage.
