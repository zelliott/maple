The gene coding for myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) has been cloned from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The gene appears to be single copy and mRNA is expressed in asexual blood-stage forms. Comparison of cDNA and genomic sequences identified three small introns. The open reading frame codes for a 410-amino-acid protein and no evidence of forms with an extended N-terminal coding sequence was obtained. Residues important in substrate binding and in the catalytic mechanism in other species are conserved. The protein was expressed from a plasmid in Escherichia coli, partially purified and shown to have enzymic activity using a synthetic peptide substrate. Comparison of the malaria parasite protein with that derived from the human gene showed a different pattern of inhibition by chemical modification. Human NMT activity was inhibited by diethylpyrocarbonate and partially inhibited by iodacetamide, whereas P. falciparum NMT activity was not inhibited by either pre-treatment. Since the enzyme in infectious fungi is a target for potential chemotherapeutic drugs, it should also be investigated in the context of parasitic infections such as that responsible for malaria.
