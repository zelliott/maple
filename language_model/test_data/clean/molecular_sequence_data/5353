The 16S rRNA genes from spirochaetes associated with digital dermatitis of British cattle were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from digital dermatitis lesion biopsies using one universal and one treponeme-specific primer. Two treponemal sequences were identified both of which shared a high degree of homology with the oral pathogen Treponema denticola (98%). Two further 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained and shared similarity to Bacteroides levii (99%) and Mycoplasma hyopharyngis (98%). Polymerase chain reaction with T. denticola-specific primers amplified a potential virulence gene from digital dermatitis lesions which shared a high degree of homology to the 46-kDa haemolysin gene of T. denticola. The significance of the presence of organisms in digital dermatitis lesions of the bovine foot which are closely related to oral pathogens is discussed.
