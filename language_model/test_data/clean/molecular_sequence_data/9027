Multivalent protein-carbohydrate interactions are involved in the initial stages of many fundamental biological and pathological processes through lectin-carbohydrate binding. The design of high affinity ligands is therefore necessary to study, inhibit and control the processes governed through carbohydrate recognition by their lectin receptors. Carbohydrate-functionalised gold nanoclusters (glyconanoparticles, GNPs) show promising potential as multivalent tools for studies in fundamental glycobiology research as well as biomedical applications. Here we present the synthesis and characterisation of galactose functionalised GNPs and their effectiveness as binding partners for PA-IL lectin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Interactions were evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition (HIA), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assays. Results show that the gold nanoparticle platform displays a significant cluster glycoside effect for presenting carbohydrate ligands with almost a 3000-fold increase in binding compared with a monovalent reference probe in free solution. The most effective GNP exhibited a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 50 nM per monosaccharide, the most effective ligand of PA-IL measured to date; another demonstration of the potential of glyco-nanotechnology towards multivalent tools and potent anti-adhesives for the prevention of pathogen invasion. The influence of ligand presentation density on their recognition by protein receptors is also demonstrated.
