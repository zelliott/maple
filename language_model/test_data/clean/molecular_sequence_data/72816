We present the cDNA sequence of the guinea pig amyloid precursor protein comprising the complete coding sequence of 770 amino-acid residues. By alternative splicing of three exons transcripts encoding for 695, 714 and 751 amino acids and all forms previously denoted as L-APP are also generated. Guinea pig amyloid precursor protein was shown to exhibit extensive sequence similarity to its human and murine homologues of approx. 97% at the protein level which implies an evolutionary conserved but yet not fully understood physiological function.
