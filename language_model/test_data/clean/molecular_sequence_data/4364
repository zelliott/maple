We have sequenced the genes encoding the inner capsid protein VP6 and the nonstructural proteins NSP1 and NSP4 of the Indian neonatal serotype P8[11]G9 human/bovine reassortant candidate vaccine rotavirus strain 116E. These three genes share a high degree of sequence and deduced amino acid homology with human prototype strain Wa. Our results confirm and extend those of previous RNA-RNA hybridization studies which suggested that these genes are of human origin, and will facilitate examination of the host immune response to 116E induced by natural infection and vaccination.
