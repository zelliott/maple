The disulfide bridge pairing of Ac-AMP2, a 30-residue peptide isolated from the seeds of Amaranthus caudatus, is determined using a fast method involving enzymatic fragmentation followed by identification of the fragments with FAB mass spectrometry. The results confirm the location of the three disulfide bridges as previously established by NMR spectroscopy and molecular modelling.
