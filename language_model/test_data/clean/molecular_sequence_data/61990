Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) is well established as a growth-inhibitory, apoptosis-inducing secreted molecule that acts via insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-independent as well as IGF-dependent pathways. Nuclear localization of IGFBP-3 has been observed and nuclear binding partners for IGFBP-3 demonstrated. However, little is known about the mechanism of IGFBP-3 internalization. We hypothesized that IGFBP-3 is first secreted then taken up again into cells and that its internalization could occur via binding to transferrin or caveolin. Incubation of cells with an IGFBP-3-neutralizing antibody demonstrated that nuclear translocation of endogenous IGFBP-3 requires IGFBP-3 secretion and re-uptake. Nuclear localization of exogenously added IGFBP-3 was rapid, occurring within 15 min, inhibited by co-incubation and extracellular sequestration with IGF-I, and dependent on the transferrin-binding C-terminal peptide region of IGFBP-3. Co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that IGFBP-3 binds transferrin but not directly to the transferrin receptor (TfR1); however, transferrin binds TfR1 and a ternary complex is formed. Specific binding to caveolin scaffolding docking sequence was confirmed utilizing radiolabeled IGFBP-3. Blocking TfR1-mediated endocytosis prevents both endogenous and exogenous IGFBP-3 re-uptake and inhibitors of caveolae formation also retard IGFBP-3 nuclear entry. Co-treatment with anti-transferrin receptor antibody and cholesterol depletion agents completely abolished endogenous and exogenous IGFBP-3 uptake. Suppression of IGFBP-3 internalization by TfR1 blockade inhibited IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis. Together, these data indicate that the actions of IGFBP-3 are mediated by internalization via distinct endocytic pathways.
