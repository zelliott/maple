The conformation of the cytoplasmic part of the zeta-chain of the T-cell receptor (TCR) in its free form and bound to detergent micelles has been investigated by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. The zeta-chain is considered to be a mediator between the extracellular antigen and the intracellular signal-transduction cascade leading to T-cell activation. Earlier studies suggested a T-cell activation mechanism that involved a TCR-state-dependent lipid incorporation propensity of the zeta-chain accompanied by a helical folding transition. In order to support this proposed mechanism, standard protein NMR assignment and secondary-structure-elucidation techniques have been applied to the free TCR zeta-chain and to the zeta-chain bound to the detergent LMPG, which forms a micelle, in order to obtain the structural characteristics of this folding transition in a residue-resolved manner. We could assign the resonances of the free zeta-chain at 278 K, and this formed the basis for chemical-shift-perturbation studies to identify lipid binding sites. Our NMR results show that the free TCR zeta-chain is indeed intrinsically unstructured. Regions around the ITAM2 and ITAM3 sequences are involved in a highly dynamic binding of the free zeta-chain to a detergent micelle formed by the acidic lipid LMPG.
