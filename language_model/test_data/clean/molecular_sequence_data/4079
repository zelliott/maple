The plasmids pN42 and pJBL2 were isolated from the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis strains NCC88 and JCL414. DNA sequence determination and bioinformatic analysis revealed a strikingly conserved genetic organization containing five major, highly conserved open reading frames (ORFs). Transformation studies indicated that ORF2 (consisting of a primase fused to a replicative DNA helicase), ori, and ORF3 constitute the minimal requirements for replication of pN42 in the heterologous host Lactococcus lactis. The ORF1's are predicted to encode type I restriction-modification (R-M) system HsdS subunits with different specificities on either plasmid, suggesting that these plasmids may be involved in host defense by expanding their host R-M system repertoire. These plasmids constitute the basis for the construction of novel L. delbrueckii vectors.
