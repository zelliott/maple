The complete nucleotide (nt) sequence of the rat nuc gene encoding nucleolin, the major nucleolar-specific protein in eukaryotic exponentially growing cells, is compared with the corresponding locus recently characterized in mouse. [Bourbon et al., J. Mol. Biol. 200 (1988) 627-638]. In both murine species the genomic organization has been strikingly conserved during evolution, i.e., the coding region extends over 9 kb and is split into 14 exons, encoding a 712-amino acid protein. Moreover, all the exon-intron junction positions were strictly maintained during evolution. More unexpectedly, this analysis revealed that several introns contain highly conserved sequence elements of about 120 nt. The nt sequence of the homologous locus isolated from a Chinese hamster genomic clone established that these regions were under unusually high selective constraints (84-96% identity between the hamster and murine nuc genes) and, although they do not contain open reading frames, they surprisingly appear to be more conserved than most of the exons, suggesting that they play an important role. Such an element of 130 nt presents features of known genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III. Furthermore, in the rat nuc pre-mRNA the 5'- and 3'-end regions of the last intron are fully complementary over 16 nt, and so are predicted to be included in a prominent stem structure. Moreover, an homologous RNA stem structure can be derived from the mouse sequence, including two compensatory nt changes. As the secondary structure would occlude the canonical sequences required for the proper excision of this intron in both murine species, this remarkable finding could be relevant to the regulation of the nuc gene expression at the RNA processing level.
