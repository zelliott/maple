Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a simple lipid with many important biological functions such as the regulation of cellular proliferation, cellular migration, differentiation, and suppression of apoptosis. Although a direct angiogenic effect of LPA has not been reported to date, there are indications that LPA promotes angiogenesis. In addition, LPA is a chemoattractant for cultured endothelial cells and promotes barrier function in such cultures. To test the hypothesis that LPA is angiogenic, we used the chicken chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Sequence analysis of the cloned, full-length chicken LPA receptor cDNAs revealed three receptor types that are orthologous to the mammalian LPA(1), LPA(2), and LPA(3) receptors. We document herein that LPA is angiogenic in the CAM system and further that synthetic LPA receptor agonists and antagonists mimic or block this response, respectively. Our results predict that LPA receptor antagonists are a possible therapeutic route to interdicting angiogenesis.
