Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains 15 class III adenylyl cyclase genes. The gene Rv1264 is predicted to be composed of two distinct protein modules. The C terminus seems to code for a catalytic domain belonging to a subfamily of adenylyl cyclase isozymes mostly found in Gram-positive bacteria. The expressed protein was shown to function as a homodimeric adenylyl cyclase (1 micromol of cAMP x mg(-1) x min(-1)). In analogy to the structure of the mammalian adenylyl cyclase catalyst, six amino acids were targeted by point mutations and found to be essential for catalysis. The N-terminal region represents a novel protein domain, the occurrence of which is restricted to several adenylyl cyclases present in Gram-positive bacteria. The purified full-length enzyme was 300-fold less active than the catalytic domain alone. Thus, the N-terminal domain appeared to be autoinhibitory. The N-terminal domain contains three prominent polar amino acid residues (Asp(107), Arg(132), and Arg(191)) that are invariant in all seven sequences of this domain currently available. Mutation of Asp(107) to Ala relaxed the inhibition and resulted in a 6-fold increase in activity of the Rv1264 holoenzyme, thus supporting the role of this domain as a potential novel regulator of adenylyl cyclase activity.
