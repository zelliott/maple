Two cDNAs encoding rice (Oryza sativa L.) S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase (SAMS) have been cloned, sequenced and identified. The deduced protein sequences share a high homology (90-94%) with those of other plant SAMS and are 60-62% identical to yeast, rat and human SAMS. The rice SAMS genes are differentially regulated in a tissue-specific manner and by a salt stress, while they are coordinately expressed during growth of the rice cell culture.
