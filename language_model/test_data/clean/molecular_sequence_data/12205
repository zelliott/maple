Genetics and breeding studies require effective methods for polymorphism analysis that allow one to classify varieties and to determine phylogenetic interactions between plant species. A variant of the polymerase chain reaction for DNA amplification with arbitrary primers (RAPD) was used to determine genetic distances between Hordeum vulgare varieties and to integrate of the varieties into groups. The dendrogram of relations between species from the genus Hordeum and species of some cultivated cereals was constructed on the basis of RAPD analysis.
