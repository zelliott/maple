Gram-negative bacteria, plant chloroplasts, green algae and some Gram-positive bacteria utilize the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids. IspD, ispE, and ispF encode the enzymes required to convert MEP to 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate (cMEDP) during the biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate in the MEP pathway. Upon analysis of the Mesorhizobium loti genome, ORF mll0395 showed homology to both ispD and ispF and appeared to encode a fusion protein. M. loti ispE was located elsewhere on the chromosome. Purified recombinant IspDF protein was mostly a homodimer, MW approximately 46 kDa/subunit. Incubation of IspDF with MEP, CTP, and ATP gave 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol (CDP-ME) as the only product. When Escherichia coli IspE protein was added to the incubation mixture, cMEDP was formed. In addition, M. loti ORF mll0395 complements lethal disruptions in both ispD and ispF in Salmonella typhimurium. These results indicate that IspDF is a bifunctional protein, which catalyzes the first and third steps in the conversion of MEP to cMEDP.
