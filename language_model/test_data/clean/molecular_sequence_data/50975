Tandemly polymerized regulatory elements, antisense RNA segments or ribozymes are potentially useful in selective gene silencing. However, existing methods of tandemly polymerizing short DNA segments are laborious. We present a procedure that can create cloned arrays of 40-70 monomer units in two steps. We have created long arrays of regulatory elements and potential ribozyme sequences. Silencing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) activation by tandem arrays of a regulatory element in human immune system cells and in other human and monkey cells is discussed.
