Specific interactions between the 72-amino acid nucleocapsid protein NCp7 of the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 and the genomic RNA are essential for virus replication. Studies on the mechanism of action of NCp7 require a direct visualization of its complexes with nucleic acids and the determination of binding affinities. To facilitate these investigations, fluorescent NCp7 derivatives were developed by introduction in the NCp7 sequence of a non-natural amino acid, (S)-beta-(9-acridinyl)alanine (Aca) obtained by a chiral synthetic method. Three fluorescent NCp7 derivatives were obtained by introducing this amino acid at different positions. As shown by NMR, the three-dimensional structure of NCp7 is not altered by introduction of Aca. The fluorescent peptides were found to be as potent as their precursors in interacting with nucleic acids and in promoting HIV-1 genomic RNA dimerization. Moreover, because of their fluorescent properties, these NCp7s can be used at submicromolar concentrations to directly visualize and quantify protein-nucleic acid interactions in solution or after gel electrophoresis. This could facilitate the development of new antiviral agents aimed at inhibiting the functions of NCp7 and studies on the intracellular traffic of NCp7 within the preintegration complex.
