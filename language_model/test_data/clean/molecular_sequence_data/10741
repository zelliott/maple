Microtubule-dependent motors of the kinesin superfamily have undergone structural and functional diversification during evolution and play crucial roles in cell division and intracellular transport. Degenerate oligonucleotides homologous to highly conserved regions of sequence within the motor domain were used in a polymerase chain reaction to isolate five new members (KIF3C, KIFC2, KIFC3, KIFC4, and KIF22) of the kinesin superfamily from a mouse brain cDNA library. Northern analysis showed that KIF3C and KIFC2 are expressed mainly in neural tissues, that KIFC4 and KIF22 are expressed primarily in proliferative tissues and cell lines, and that KIFC3 is apparently ubiquitous. To elucidate the organization of genes encoding kinesin-like motors in the mouse genome and to explore the potential associations of these genes with classical mouse mutations or human genetic diseases, these new genes as well as genes encoding the previously reported KIF3A and KIF3B motors were mapped to mouse chromosomes by using an interspecific backcross panel of DNAs from The Jackson Laboratory. The data indicate that the gene KIFC4 is present in three copies in the mouse genome on chromosomes 13 (KIFC4A), 10 (KIFC4B), and 17 (KIFC4C). The gene KIF22 is present in two copies on chromosomes 7 (KIF22A) and 1 (KIF22B). The genes KIF3A, KIF3B, KIF3C, KIFC2, and KIFC3 are each single loci and map to chromosomes 11, 2, 12, 15, and 8, respectively.
