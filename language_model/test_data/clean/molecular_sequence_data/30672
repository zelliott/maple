Three randomly derived sequences that can substitute for the signal peptide of Saccharomyces cerevisiae invertase were tested for the efficiency with which they can translocate invertase or beta-galactosidase into the endoplasmic reticulum. The rate of translocation, as measured by glycosylation, was estimated in pulse-chase experiments to be less than 6 min. When fused to beta-galactosidase, these peptides, like the normal invertase signal sequence, direct the hybrid protein to a perinuclear region, consistent with localization to the endoplasmic reticulum. The diversity of function of random peptides was studied further by immunofluorescence localization of proteins fused to 28 random sequences: 4 directed the hybrid to the endoplasmic reticulum, 3 directed it to the mitochondria, and 1 directed it to the nucleus.
