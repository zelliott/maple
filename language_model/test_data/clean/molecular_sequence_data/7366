An extradiol dioxygenase was cloned from the naphthalenesulfonate-degrading bacterial strain BN6 by screening a gene bank for colonies with 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase activity. DNA sequence analysis of a 1,358-bp fragment revealed an open reading frame of only 486 bp. This is the smallest gene encoding an extradiol dioxygenase found until now. Expression of the gene in a T7 expression vector enabled purification of the enzyme. Gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the protein was a dimer with a subunit size of 21.7 kDa. The enzyme oxidized 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl, 3-isopropylcatechol, 3- and 4-chlorocatechol, and 3- and 4-methylcatechol. Since the ability to convert 3-chlorocatechol is an unusual characteristic for an extradiol-cleaving dioxygenase, this reaction was analyzed in more detail. The deduced amino-terminal amino acid sequence differed from the corresponding sequence of the 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase, which had been determined earlier from the enzyme purified from this strain. This indicates that strain BN6 carries at least two different extradiol dioxygenases.
