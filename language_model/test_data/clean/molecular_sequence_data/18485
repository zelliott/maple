A Gram-stain negative, rod-shaped, non-motile and pink-pigmented bacterial strain, designated strain HYL7-26(T), was isolated from a soil in the Desert Park of Huyang forest located in Xinjiang, China. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain HYL7-26(T) belongs to the genus Pontibacter in the family Cytophagaceae. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strain HYL7-26(T) and type strains of Pontibacter species ranged from 93.2 to 96.0 %. Strain HYL7-26(T) was found to contain iso-C15:0 (15.9 %), iso-C17:0 3-OH (9.5 %) and summed feature 4 (comprising anteiso-C17:1 B and/or iso-C17:1 I, 21.0 %, as defined by the MIDI system) as the major cellular fatty acids. The major respiratory quinone was identified as MK-7 and the DNA G+C content was determined to be 43.8 mol%. sym-Homospermidine was the major polyamine observed in the cells. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data, strain HYL7-26(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Pontibacter, for which the name Pontibacter soli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is HYL7-26(T) (=CCTCC AB 206240(T) = NRRL B-59490(T)).
