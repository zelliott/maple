Yeast cells harboring mft1 mutations are compromised in mitochondrial protein targeting, and Mft1p has previously been identified as a ribosomal protein. However, two genes, PLC2 and YML062C, are present in the MFT1 locus, and we show that mft1 mutant cells are compromised in the function of the cytosolic protein encoded by YML062C. The ribosomal protein (YS3a) is actually encoded by the tightly linked PLC2 gene, and does not play a role in targeting proteins to the mitochondria.
