Sphingomonas sp. JB13, isolated from slag of a >20-year-old phosphate rock-stacking site, showed the highest 16S rDNA (1343bp) identity of 97.2% with Sphingomonas sp. ERB1-3 (FJ948169) and <97% identities with other identified Sphingomonas strains. A mannanase-coding gene (1191bp) was cloned and encodes a 396-residue polypeptide (ManAJB13) showing the highest amino acid sequence identities of 56.2% with the putative glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family 26 endo-1,4-β-mannanase from Rhodothermus marinus (YP_004824245), and 44.2% with the identified GH 26 endo-1,4-β-mannanase from Cellvibrio japonicus (2VX5_A). The recombinant ManAJB13 (rManAJB13) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Purified rManAJB13 displayed the typical characteristics of low-temperature-active enzymes: showing apparent optimal at 40°C, ~55% of the maximum activity at 20°C and ~20% at 10°C, and thermolability at 45°C (~15min half-life). The potential mechanism for low-temperature-activity of GH 26 endo-1,4-β-mannanases might be ascribed to the more hydrophobic residues (AILFWV) and less polar residues (NCQSTY) compared with typical thermophilic and mesophilic counterparts. The purified rManAJB13 exhibited >85% mannanase activity at the concentration of 0-4.0M NaCl. No loss of enzyme activity was observed after incubating the enzyme with 1M or 2M NaCl, or trypsin or proteinase K at 37°C and pH 6.5 for 1h. The K(m), V(max) and k(cat) values were 5.0mgml(-1), 277.8μmol min(-1)mg(-1), and 211.9s(-1), respectively, using locust bean gum as the substrate.
