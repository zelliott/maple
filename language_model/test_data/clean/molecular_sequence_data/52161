The Zymomonas mobilis genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenase I (adhA), alcohol dehydrogenase II (adhB), and pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and Z. mobilis by using a broad-host-range vector containing the tac promoter and the lacIq repressor gene. Maximal IPTG (isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside) induction of these plasmid-borne genes in Z. mobilis resulted in a 35-fold increase in alcohol dehydrogenase I activity, a 16.7-fold increase in alcohol dehydrogenase II activity, and a 6.3-fold increase in pyruvate decarboxylase activity. Small changes in the activities of these enzymes did not affect glycolytic flux in cells which are at maximal metabolic activity, indicating that flux under these conditions is controlled at some other point in metabolism. Expression of adhA, adhB, or pdc at high specific activities (above 8 IU/mg of cell protein) resulted in a decrease in glycolytic flux (negative flux control coefficients), which was most pronounced for pyruvate decarboxylase. Growth rate and flux are imperfectly coupled in this organism. Neither a twofold increase in flux nor a 50% decline from maximal flux caused any immediate change in growth rate. Thus, the rates of biosynthesis and growth in this organism are not limited by energy generation in rich medium.
