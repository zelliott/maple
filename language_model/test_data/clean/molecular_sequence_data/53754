A polar multitrichous gram-negative motile rod, EY 3383, originally identified as Burkholderia thailandensis, revealed a DNA-DNA reassociation rate of 36.7%, under stringent conditions, with the type strain of B. thailandensis, despite the 16S rDNA homology value between two type strains being as high as 97.9%. The strain was clearly differentiated from the type strain of B. thailandensis by physiological, bio-chemical, and nutritional characteristics, without significant difference in cellular fatty acid and lipid composition. Based on the results of 16S rDNA sequence analysis, DNA-DNA hybridization and phenotypic characterization, Burkholderia uboniae sp. nov. is herein proposed. The type strain is NCTC 13147=EY 3383, isolated on 8 December 1989 from surface soil along the roadside in Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand. Major respiratory quinone is ubiquinone-8(Q8). G+C content of DNA is 69.71%.
