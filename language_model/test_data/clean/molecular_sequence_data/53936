alpha(2u)-Globulin is well known to be a rat protein encoded by a highly homologous multigene family with more than twenty members. We report here the cloning and identification of major alpha(2u)-globulin mRNA species expressed in various tissues. Initially, eight individual clones (PGCL1-8) were obtained from a male preputial gland cDNA library. Data base analysis with BLAST demonstrated six mRNAs to be novel, all clones being characterized by highly conserved sequence motifs as lipocalins. All cDNAs contained an open reading frame of 543 nucleotides and encode 181 amino acid proteins showing 92.5-98.7% and 87.3-98.3% nucleic and amino acid identity, respectively. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) with sequence analysis showed that PGCL4 is a major member in the female mammary gland, and in the submaxillary and lachrymal glands of both sexes, while the counterpart in male liver and the coagulate glands was found to be PGCL1. Numbers of cDNA species including PGCL1 and PGCL4 were found in preputial glands, no sex-related difference being observed. These results directly demonstrate complex tissue- and sex-specific expression of alpha(2u)-globulins in terms of mRNA species, providing useful information for understanding regulation of the alpha(2u)-globulin multigene family.
