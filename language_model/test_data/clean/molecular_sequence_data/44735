We describe the structural organization of a gene, termed XFDL 141/156, that is transiently activated during early Xenopus development. XFDL 141/156 is first transcribed at the midblastula transition (MBT) and during early gastrulation events. A roughly 200 nucleotide fragment immediately 5' to the transcription start site is sufficient for transient, early zygotic activation of gene expression. The primary transcript is subject to alternative splicing. Corresponding cDNAs encode two structurally related but completely distinct C2H2-type zinc finger proteins of unknown biological function.
