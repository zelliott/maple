Hospital and agriculture wastewater is mostly responsible for causing environmental pollution by spreading un-metabolized antibiotics and resistant bacteria, especially in Bangladesh. Here, we studied the influence of the most frequently prescribed antibiotic, fluoroquinolone (~72%), on the development of antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli. Out of 300, 24 ciprofloxacin resistant E. coli isolates were selected for the study that showed the MBC(100) higher than expected (600 Î¼g/mL). Here, we profiled plasmid, sequenced gyr genes, screened mutations and analyzed the effect of mutation on drug-protein interaction through molecular docking approach. We found that (1) out of 10, most of them (n = 7) had large plasmid(s); (2) all ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates had gyrA double mutations (S83L and D87Y); (3) no isolate had qnr gene; and (4) docking of ciprofloxacin with DNA gyrase A subunit suggests that acquisition of double mutation leads to alteration of the ciprofloxacin binding pocket.
