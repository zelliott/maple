A functional cDNA clone coding for the human prostaglandin E receptor EP1 subtype has been isolated from a human erythroleukemia cell cDNA library probed by low-stringency hybridization using a polymerase chain reaction fragment of the human thromboxane receptor. The human EP1 receptor is comprised of 402 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 41,858 and has the topography common to all G-protein-coupled receptors with seven predicted transmembrane spanning domains. Prostaglandin (PG) E2 challenge of Xenopus oocytes injected with EP1 cDNA resulted in an increase in intracellular Ca2+. In addition, the rank order of potency for prostaglandins in competition for [3H]PGE2 specific binding to membranes prepared from EP1 cDNA transfected COS cells was PGE2 > PGE1 > PGF2 alpha > PGD2. Furthermore, the EP1 receptor-selective antagonists AH 6809 and SC19220 were more potent than the EP2 receptor-selective agonist butaprost in these competition binding assays. In summary, therefore, we have cloned the human EP1 receptor subtype which is functionally coupled to an increase in intracellular Ca2+.
