A serine proteinase from Penicillium citrinum was purified. The M(r) and isoelectric point were determined as about 26,000 and 9.5, respectively. Activity was retained up to above 40 degrees at pH 7 for 30 min, but the enzyme was completely inactivated at 50 degrees. The first amino acids in the N-terminal region were ANVVQSNVPSWGLARISSKRPGTTSYTYDSTAGEGVVFYGVDTG. The specificity differs from that of other serine proteinases. Kinetic studies on fluorogenic substrates were determined.
