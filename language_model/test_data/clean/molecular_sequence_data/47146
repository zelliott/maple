We have isolated cDNAs to two transcripts, granzyme M and alternative granzyme M mRNA from the mouse eye. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed these transcripts were derived from alternative transcription initiations. Northern blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions revealed that both transcripts were expressed in the eye, though the alternative form was the major type. In situ hybridization studies demonstrated that alternative granzyme M mRNA localized exclusively in the photoreceptor cells in the retina and expressed only after the opening of the eye, suggesting that these transcripts are related to the maintenance of the retinal structure or functions of matured photoreceptor cells rather than the development or differentiation of retinal cells.
