Tn5-gusA promoter/probe transposons have been constructed that fuse the Escherichia coli gusA reporter gene transcriptionally or translationally with a target promoter. These have been used to monitor expression of Rhizobium meliloti symbiotic genes within alfalfa nodules. Fusions in all 11 nod genes studied show the same pattern of expression: first on the root surface, then throughout the developing nodule, then mainly in the nodule meristem, falling off progressively through the central region, and then disappearing. In contrast, fusions in all five nif genes studied, all four fix genes, and syrM show a second, different pattern: expression beginning later, first throughout the nodule except for the meristem, strongest just behind the meristem, and falling off progressively through the central region. Novel features revealed by these studies include nod expression in the meristem, regulated in planta expression of control genes nodD1 and nodD3, disappearance of nod expression late in organogenesis, and properties of syrM.
