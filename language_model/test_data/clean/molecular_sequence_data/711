Tnk1/Kos1 is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase found to be a tumor suppressor. It negatively regulates cell growth by indirectly suppressing Ras activity. We identified and characterized the critical cis-elements required for Tnk1/Kos1's promoter activity. Results indicate that the murine Tnk1 promoter lacks a conventional TATA, CAAT or initiator element (Inr) but contains multiple transcription start sites. Transcription is initiated by a TATA-like element composed of an AT rich sequence at -30 (30 bp upstream) from the major transcription start site and an Inr-like element that overlaps the multiple start sites. Deletion analysis of the m-Tnk1 promoter reveals the presence of both positive (-25 to -151) and negative (-151 to -1201) regulatory regions. The three GC boxes which bind Sp1 and Sp3 with high affinity, an AP2 site (that overlaps with an AML1 site) and a MED1 site comprise the necessary cis-elements of the proximal promoter required for both constitutive and inducible Tnk1/Kos1 expression. Importantly, results reveal that cellular stress reverses the repression of Tnk1/Kos1 and induces its expression through increased high affinity interactions between nuclear proteins Sp1, Sp3, AP2 and MED1 for the m-Tnk1 promoter. These findings provide a mechanism by which the m-Tnk1 promoter can be dynamically regulated during normal growth.
