X-linked juvenile retinoschisis(RS) is a recessively inherited vitreo-retinal degeneration characterized by macular pathology and intraretinal splitting of the retina. The RS gene has been localized to Xp22.2 to an approximately 1 Mb interval between DXS418 and DXS999/DXS7161. Mapping and expression analysis of expressed sequence tags have identified a novel transcript, designated XLRS1, within the centromeric RS locus that is exclusively expressed in retina. The predicted XLRS1 protein contains a highly conserved motif implicated in cell-cell interaction and thus may be active in cell adhesion processes during retinal development. Mutational analyses of XLRS1 in affected individuals from nine unrelated RS families revealed one nonsense, one frameshift, one splice acceptor and six missense mutations segregating with the disease phenotype in the respective families. These data provide strong evidence that the XLRS1 gene, when mutated, causes RS.
