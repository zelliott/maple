Activation or inhibition of the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway can ultimately regulate the transcription of a variety of genes. In vertebrates, the best characterized nuclear targets of PKA are the 'cAMP response element' (CRE) binding proteins (CREB). Differences in the transcriptional response to this pathway between cells and tissues can be based on the presence of distinct CREB isoforms. In this context, we have now investigated the presence of different dCREB transcripts in a stable, embryonic insect cell line, i.e., Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells. In addition, we have studied the possible effect of cellular cAMP- and Ca2+ increases on the expression of a luciferase reporter in cells transfected with a CRE-containing reporter gene construct. In combination with recent data from the literature, our results indicate that the regulation of CRE-dependent gene expression shows some important differences between insects and vertebrates.
