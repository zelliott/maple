To construct human Egr-1 promoter luciferase reporter system and study its activity induced by ionizing radiation.

Egr-1 promoter was obtained by human genomic PCR and cloned into pGL3-basic vector. After transfection of recombinant plasmid into human tumor cells, the Egr-1 promoter activity induced by ionizing radiation was detected by luciferase reporter assay.

The luciferase reporter system of Egr-1 promoter was successfully constructed. The activity of Egr-1 promoter was substantially increased after different doses of IR and reached to the peak at the time point of 48 h after IR.

The Egr-1 promoter was constructed in this study showed IR inducible activity in tumor cells, laying foundation for the research of radiation. mediated gene therapy.
