The molecular defect in an opaque-2 (o2) mutant, previously characterized as a null allele, has been identified as containing an insertion of the transposable element of the Bergamo (Bg) family. Restriction mapping and partial sequence analysis of the Bg in the o2 null allele indicates that this element is distinct from the previously described Bg as well as the defective Bg (rbg) of the o2m(r) allele. It is, however, inserted at the same site in O2 as the rbg of o2m(r) and can transpose when Bg is present. This study shows that, depending on genetic background, this allele may not behave as a stable null which could dramatically influence the conclusions drawn from experiments based on this particular mutant.
