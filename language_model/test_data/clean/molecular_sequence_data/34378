Two thermophilic spore-forming strains, with optimum growth temperature at 70Â°C, were isolated from compost of the "Experimental System of Composting" (Teora, Avellino, Italy). A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that these organisms represented a new species of the genus Geobacillus. Based on polyphasic taxonomic data the strains represented a novel species for which the name Geobacillus galactosidasius sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CF1B(T) (=ATCC BAA-1450(T)=DSM 18751(T)).
