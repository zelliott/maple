The CobU protein of Salmonella typhimurium was overexpressed and purified to approximately 94% homogeneity. N-terminal sequencing of purified CobU confirmed the first 22 amino acids. In vitro assays showed that CobU has kinase and guanylyltransferase activities which catalyze the synthesis of adenosyl-cobinamide-GDP from adenosyl-cobinamide, via an adenosyl-cobinamide-phosphate intermediate. We present evidence that the transfer of the guanylyl moiety of GTP to adenosyl-cobinamide-phosphate proceeds via an phosphoramidate-linked, enzyme-guanylyl intermediate. In the presence of oxygen, kinase and guanylyltransferase activities of CobU were lost. Treatment of inactive CobU with dithiothreitol restored approximately 20% of the kinase and guanylyltransferase activities, indicating the involvement of sulfhydryl groups in enzyme activity. The sulfhydryl modifying agents 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and N-ethylmaleimide abolished both CobU activities. Native CobU protein was a dimer (approximately 40 kDa) that functioned optimally at pH 8.8-9.0 and 37 degrees C. Substrates and kinetic parameters for both activities were determined. The preferred corrinoid substrate for this enzyme was adenosyl-cobinamide. In vitro experiments are consistent with previous genetic studies which had suggested that adenosyl-cobinamide was the preferred substrate of CobU, and that CobU functioned more efficiently in the absence of oxygen.
