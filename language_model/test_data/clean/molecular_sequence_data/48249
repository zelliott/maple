Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a lymphotropic virus strongly linked to the development of KS, an endothelial cell neoplasm frequent in persons with AIDS. Reactivation from latency in B cells is thought to be an important antecedent to viral spread to endothelial cells during KS pathogenesis. Earlier experiments have posited a role for the transcriptional activator encoded by KSHV open reading frame 50 (ORF50) in such reactivation, since ectopic overexpression of this protein induces reactivation in latently infected B cells. Here we have explored several aspects of the expression, structure, and function of this protein bearing on this role. The ORF50 gene is expressed very early in lytic reactivation, before several other genes implicated as candidate regulatory genes in related viruses, and its expression can upregulate their promoters in transient assays. The protein is extensively phosphorylated in vivo and bears numerous sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase C, activators of which are potent stimulators of lytic induction. The C terminus of the ORF50 protein contains a domain that can strongly activate transcription when targeted to DNA; deletion of this domain generates an allele that expresses a truncated protein which retains the ability to form multimers with full-length ORF50 and functions as a dominant-negative protein. Expression of this allele in latently infected cells ablates spontaneous reactivation from latency and strikingly suppresses viral replication induced by multiple stimuli, including phorbol ester, ionomycin, and sodium butyrate. These results indicate that the ORF50 gene product plays an essential role in KSHV lytic replication and are consistent with its action as a putative molecular switch controlling the induction of virus from latency.
