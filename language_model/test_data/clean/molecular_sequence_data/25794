Glycopeptides with TN antigen (GalNAc)Ser/Thr and T-antigen structures (beta Gall-3GalNAc)Ser/Thr, described as tumor-associated antigens, were synthesized and coupled to bovine serum albumin. Alternatively, synthetic methods for the construction of beta-anomeric analogues of the TN and T-antigen glycopeptides were developed, aiming at antigenic structures having a varied stereochemistry of the linkage between the carbohydrate and the peptide moiety. As a further type of potential tumor-associated antigen, fucosyl-chitobiose asparagine glycopeptides were synthesized, deprotected, and coupled to bovine serum albumin. The chemical methods developed now make the complex sensitive glycoprotein partial structures accessible in analytically pure form and in preparative amounts.
