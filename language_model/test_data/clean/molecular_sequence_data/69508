Monospecific antibodies against an oligopeptide, conserved among the Mcm class of yeast replication proteins, were used to screen a human cDNA library. Eight of the isolated cDNA clones have the potential to code for sections of proteins with high sequence similarities to the yeast proteins Mcm3 and Cdc46 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Cdc21 from S. pombe. Our results establish a novel and highly conserved family of nuclear proteins in mammalian cells.
