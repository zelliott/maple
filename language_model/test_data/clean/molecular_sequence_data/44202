Neogenin was first identified in the chick embryo, and like a number of cell surface proteins of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, including N-CAM and L1 (generally called cell adhesion molecules or CAMs), it is expressed on growing nerve cells in the developing nervous system of vertebrate embryos. Neogenin is also expressed in other embryonic tissues, suggesting a more general role in developmental processes such as tissue growth regulation, cell-cell recognition, and cell migration. Neogenin, unlike the CAMs, is closely related to a unique tumor suppressor candidate molecule, deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC). Like DCC, the neogenin protein consists of four immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains followed by six fibronectin type III domains, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain. We now report the cloning and sequencing of cDNA clones coding for the human neogenin protein. Human neogenin shares 87% identity with its chicken homolog, and like its chicken counterpart it is expressed in at least two different isoforms derived from alternative splicing in the intracellular domain. Northern blot analysis revealed two mRNA species of about 5 and 7 kb. The chromosomal location of the human neogenin gene (HGMW-approved symbol NEO1) was determined as 15q22.3-q23, using fluorescence in situ hybridization. The gene therefore maps in the vicinity of a locus associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome. The identification of human neogenin and its chromosomal location provides a basis for studying its involvement in genetic disorders or diseases.
