Cloning of a novel Homo sapiens gene from cDNA libraries of human testes using immunoscreening procedure with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against E. coli RecA protein was carried out. The nucleotide sequence and chromosomal localization of this gene were determined. Computer modeling of its primary transcript was conducted. The gene investigated is localized on the P arm of chromosome 19 within the 19p13.1 cluster and consists of seven exons and six introns. It has a leader, 3' untranslated, and translated regions. The translated sequence encodes a 33-kD protein that displays 30-40% homology to the Saccharomyces cerevisae Rad proteins. TATA- and CAAT-like sequences are situated at positions -30 and -40 bp as well as -102 and -148, respectively. The absence of CCGCCC- or GGGCGG-like sequences may indicate that this gene is tissue-specific.
