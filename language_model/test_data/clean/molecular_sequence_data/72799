Many amplified-chromosome regions in human cancers have been identified, while there are only a limited number of reports for amplified genes in a single amplicon. We recently isolated four cDNA clones, A39, B47, C51, and CAB1, from 500 kilobases of yeast artificial chromosome DNA containing the c-ERBB-2 gene. B47 consisted of 615 base pairs and had about 85% homology with the corresponding sequence of mouse Grb-7. We report here the structure of human GRB-7 cDNA, and we report that the amounts of mRNA for c-ERBB-2, CAB1, and GRB-7 were elevated in concordance with the amplification.
