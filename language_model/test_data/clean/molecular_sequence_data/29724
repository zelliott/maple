The predicted second extracellular loop domain of the motilin receptor is of particular interest because it is a region that is quite distinct from the analogous regions in other family members that are most closely related and because the initial report of the photoaffinity labeling of a domain of this receptor included this region (Coulie, B. J., Matsuura, B., Dong, M., Hadac, E. M., Pinon, D. I., Feighner, S. D., Howard, A. D., and Miller, L. J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 35518-35522). In the current work, motilin receptor constructs were prepared that included sequential deletions ranging from single residues to twelve amino acid segments throughout this 67 amino acid domain. Each construct was expressed in COS cells and characterized for motilin radioligand binding and motilin-stimulated intracellular calcium responses. The only segments that had negative impact on motilin binding and biological activity included deletion constructs DeltaCys(235), Delta179-182, and Delta241-246. Cys(235) is likely involved in the highly conserved and functionally important disulfide bond linking the first and second loops of G protein-coupled receptors. Alanine replacements for each of the amino acid residues in the other two segments revealed that the perimembranous residues at both ends of this loop, Val(179) and Leu(245) and Arg(246), were responsible for the negative impact on motilin binding and biological activity. Of note, these mutants responded normally to the non-peptidyl agonist, erythromycin. These data support important functional roles for both amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal perimembranous regions of the second loop for responses to the natural agonist peptide, while supporting independent determinants for action of a non-peptidyl agonist ligand.
