A fraction of the ribosomal 28S genes in some insects are interrupted at specific sites by insertion elements R1 and R2 (also called Type I and II). These elements contain long open-reading frames with homology to reverse transcriptase. We have identified in the silkmoth, Bombyx mori, copies of these elements which have inserted into sites outside the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) units. The 3' ends of all "non-rDNA" elements are identical to the elements within the 28S genes; however their 5' ends are often truncated. Each non-rDNA copy has inserted into sequences that exhibit similarity to their target sites in the 28S gene. We also demonstrate by genomic blot analysis of different strains of B. mori that insertions of R1 and R2 outside the rDNA units have been infrequent, while considerable turnover of elements has occurred within the rDNA locus. One race of B. mori has lost all copies of R1 from its rDNA units, while retaining normal levels of R2. The level of both R1 and R2 have significantly increased in a tissue culture line. These findings add considerable support to the model that R1 and R2 are retrotransposable elements that utilize sequence specific endonucleases in their integration into the genome.
