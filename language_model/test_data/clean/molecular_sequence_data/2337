We have identified and characterized a DNA-protein complex that forms with the adeno-associated virus (AAV) terminal repeats. The complex formed only if the terminal palindrome was in the covalently closed or hairpin configuration; little if any binding was detected with the open duplex form of the terminal repeat. This fact suggested that both secondary structure and primary sequence are essential elements of recognition. DNase I protection studies indicated that virtually all of the A-A' palindrome and significant portions of the B-B' and C-C' palindromes are protected. The postulated terminal resolution site of AAV also is protected. Restriction mapping of the sequences necessary for binding indicated that almost all of the terminal palindrome must be present for binding to occur. Hairpins which are similar in size and shape to the AAV termini did not exhibit competition for binding, and the complex formed only if AAV-infected extracts were used. Thus, the binding reaction is specific for AAV sequences. The viral-coded nonstructural proteins Rep78 and Rep68 comigrated with the DNA-protein complex on neutral acrylamide gels, suggesting that one or both of these proteins are components of the complex. The characteristics of the complex suggested that it has a role in AAV DNA replication.
