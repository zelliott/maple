Bat genomes are characterised by an A-T richness and by a small C-value compared with other mammalian groups. It has been suggested that the small C-value is mainly due to the lack of repetitive DNA sequences. However, little information about repetitive DNA sequences in this mammalian group is available at the molecular level. Here we describe a PstI family of repetitive DNA sequences present in three species of the genus Pteropus. These repetitive sequences are 54.97% G-C rich, organised in tandem and with a unit length of 744 bp. Methylation analysis indicates that some of the CCGG target sites present in these repetitive DNA sequences have methylated cytosines and that there are small differences in the methylation pattern between species. Several features of this family of repetitive sequences suggest that they evolved by concerted evolution.
