We have previously characterized a novel mouse thymocyte marker, defined as thymic shared Ag-1 (TSA-1), present on both immature thymocytes and a subset of thymic medullary epithelial cells. MTS 35, a mAb specific for TSA-1, alters T cell differentiation when added to fetal thymic organ cultures, suggesting TSA-1 may be important for T cell development in the thymus. In this study, we describe the isolation of a cDNA encoding TSA-1 using transient expression of COS-7 cells and selection with MTS 35. The predicted amino acid sequence of this cDNA encodes a 15 to 17-kDa protein and the expressed protein is linked to the membrane via a phosphatidylinositol moiety. TSA-1 is transcriptionally active at various levels in all organs examined, suggesting that its role is not solely intrathymic. TSA-1 shares amino acid sequence homology to the mouse Ly6 multigene family, epidermal growth factor-like receptors, and to cobra venom neurotoxin. The Tsa-1 locus is located on chromosome 15 linked to Ly6 on the mouse genome. We also examined the effects of MTS 35 in fetal thymic organ cultures repopulated with two subsets of thymocytes representing defined stages of T cell development. Our results suggest that TSA-1 may play a role during positive selection and the transition from CD4+CD8+ thymocytes to the mature CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ subsets.
