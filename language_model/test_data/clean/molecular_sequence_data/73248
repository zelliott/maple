The mammalian high mobility group proteins HMGI/Y and HMG1/2 are thought to play an architectural role in assembly of nucleoprotein structures. Counterparts to these proteins have recently been found in the cells of the Dipteran insect Chironomus. In this report we investigate the distribution of three abundant HMG proteins in interphase giant chromosomes of the midge, Chironomus. By means of the indirect immunofluorescence technique the cHMG1b and cHMGI proteins were localized in chromosomal puffs, suggesting their involvement in the organization of transcriptionally active chromatin. In contrast, the highly abundant protein cHMG1a was rather uniformly distributed in the chromosomes. The cHMGI protein, but not cHMG1a or cHMG1b, was detected in nucleoli, which may indicate a role in the transcription of ribosomal genes. The regions of the interphase chromosomes containing AT-rich DNA did not contain higher levels of the cHMGI and cHMG1b proteins. A correlation between the specific location of these proteins in chromatin and their synthesis and turnover rates was observed.
