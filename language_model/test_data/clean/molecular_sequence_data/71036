The heat-stable protease from Chryseobacterium indologenes Ix9a was purified to homogeneity using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The enzyme was characterized as a metalloprotease with an approximate relative molecular mass of 24,000, a pH optimum of 6.5, and a high temperature optimum (50 degrees C). The metal chelator EDTA and the Zn2+-specific chelator 1,10-phenanthroline were identified as inhibitors and atomic absorption analysis showed that the enzyme contained Ca2+ and Zn2+. The activity of the apoenzyme could be restored with Ca2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, and Co2+. Phosphoramidon and Gly-d-Phe did not inhibit Chryseobacterium indologenes Ix9a protease. Heat inactivation did not follow first order kinetics, but showed biphasic inactivation curves. The protease has a Km of 0.813 microg. ml-1 for casein as substrate. Amino acid analysis showed that the protease contains a high amount of small amino acids like glycine, alanine, and serine, but a low concentration of methionine and no cysteine at all. Electrospray mass spectrometry of proteolysis fragments formed when insulin B chain was hydrolyzed showed cleavage at the amino terminal of leucine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. A hydrophobic amino acid at the carboxyl donating side seems to increase the rate of reaction.
