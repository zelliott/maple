The nucleotide sequence of a 19,000 base pair region from the left arm of chromosome XI of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been determined and analysed. It covers the HAP4-GFA1-LAP4 loci already described. As expected HAP4, GFA1 and LAP4 genes have been found and six new open reading frames (ORFs) with a coding capacity of more than 100 amino acid residues have been identified. One of them (YKL461) shows a high degree of identity with an aspartate aminotransferase gene. This raises the question of a second aspartate aminotransferase gene in yeast. A second ORF (YKL462) shows features compatible with a membranous localization. The other ORFs do not show a similarity with any known gene. A member of the highly repetitive 'CAT' DNA sequence is present.
