In 1991 we reported the identification of two deletional alpha-thalassaemia-2 determinants (-3.7 kb and -4.2 kb) and one nondeletional alpha-thalassaemia-2 determinant (Hb Koya Dora alpha 2 codon 142, TAA-->TCA) in a tribal population in Central India (Gupta et al, 1991). Evidence was obtained at that time for the possible presence of an additional nondeletional alpha-thalassaemia-2 because of low levels of Hb S (< 28%) in some Hb S heterozygotes with a simple alpha-thalassaemia-2 heterozygosity (-alpha/alpha alpha). This abnormality has now been identified as a G-->A mutation at IVS-I-117 of the alpha 1-globin gene (acceptor splice site) which makes this gene nonfunctional. Its frequency was established at approximately 6% which raises the total frequency of alpha-thalassaemia determinants in this population to approximately 60%. Subjects with a deletional alpha-thalassaemia-2 and the newly discovered alpha 1 acceptor splice junction mutation in trans appear to have an alpha chain deficiency similar to that of an alpha-thalassaemia-2 homozygote (-alpha/-alpha). An additional change (C-->G) at the Cap -4 site was observed in six alpha 1- and one alpha 2-globin genes; this polymorphism is not associated with a decrease in alpha chain synthesis and is not linked to the IVS-I-117 (G-->A) mutation.
