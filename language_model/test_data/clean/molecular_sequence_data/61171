Mammalian beta-defensins are endogenous cysteine-rich peptide antibiotics that are produced either by epithelial cells lining the respiratory, digestive, and urogenital tracts or by granulocytes and macrophages. A growing body of evidence has implicated these peptides in host defense, particularly mucosal innate immunity. We previously reported the cloning of the full-length cDNA for a porcine beta-defensin (pBD-1), which was found to be expressed throughout the airway and oral mucosa. Here, we provide the structural organization of the pBD-1 gene, showing that the entire gene spans approximately 1.9 kilobases with two short exons separated by a 1.5-kilobase intron. Fluorescence in situ hybridization mapped the pBD-1 gene to porcine chromosome 15q14-q15. 1 within a region of conserved synteny to the chromosomal locations of human and mouse alpha- and beta-defensins. We also provide several independent lines of evidence showing that the pBD-1 gene is expressed constitutively during inflammation and infection, despite its resemblance to many inducible epithelial beta-defensins in amino acid sequence, genomic structure, and sites of expression. First, stimulation of primary porcine tongue epithelial cells with lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-1beta failed to up-regulate the expression of pBD-1 mRNA. Second, pBD-1 gene expression was not enhanced in either digestive or respiratory mucosa of pigs following a 2-day infection with Salmonella typhimurium or Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. Last, direct transfection of the pBD-1 gene promoter into NIH/3T3 cells showed no difference in reporter gene activity in response to stimulation by lipopolysaccharide and IL-1beta. The constitutive expression of pBD-1 in airway and oral mucosa, which is consistent with a lack of consensus binding sites for nuclear factor-kappaB or NF-IL-6 in its promoter region, suggests that it may play a surveillance role in maintaining the steady state of microflora on mucosal surfaces.
