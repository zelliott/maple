The stability of two mutants G88V (Gly-88-->Val) and A69T (Ala-69-->Thr) of staphylococcal nuclease was analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations. The calculated free energy differences of denaturation for G88V and A69T were -1.1 and -2.8 kcal/mol, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the experimental values. The free energy differences divided into electrostatic and van der Waals components were analyzed. These two mutants are mainly destabilized due to van der Waals interactions. There is little difference between the electrostatic contribution to the free energy change in the native state and that in the denatured state. In each mutant structure, a small cavity appears in the vicinity of the perturbed residue. It is suggested that intramolecular van der Waals interactions of the mutants are weaker than those of the wild-type. Furthermore, analyses of the contributions of each residue near the perturbed residue and of water to the free energy difference of denaturation suggest that the interaction between water and the perturbed residue plays a very important role in the stability of staphylococcal nuclease, and that a small hydrophobic core consisting of the three aromatic rings (Tyr-27, Phe-34, Phe-76) and the side chain of Met-32 is also important for the stability.
