Senescence-accelerated mice (SAM) are commonly used as animal models for studying aging. To date, aging-related proteomes in the livers and brains of SAMP8 mice have been reported; however, spleen of SAM has not yet been used as material for studying the aging-related proteome despite its extremely important role in the progress of aging or aging-related diseases.

To identify proteins associated with aging or aging-related diseases in SAM.

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) was used to compare the proteomes of splenic lymphocytes from two strains of SAM (SAMP8 and SAMR1). Differentially expressed spots whose expression altered over twofold (p < 0.01) were identified by LC-MS/MS and database search.

Identification results showed that 18 differentially expressed protein spots represented 14 different proteins known to be involved in aging- or aging disease-related pathways, i.e., annexin I, calgranulin B, transaldolase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and an unnamed protein product were involved in oxidative stress and cell defense, phosphoglycerate mutase I, aldose reductase, carbonic anhydrase I and carbonic anhydrase II were involved in glycolytic energy metabolism and homeostasis, and macrophage capping protein and high mobility group box-1 protein were involved in infection and DNA damage.

2DE combined with MS is effective for comparative proteome analysis of splenic lymphocytes of SAM to identify proteins closely involved in aging or aging-related diseases, especially immune diseases, and further functional studies of these proteins in SAM may throw some light on the study of biomarkers for aging or aging-related diseases.
