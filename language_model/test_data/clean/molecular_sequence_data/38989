An esterase gene (estA) was isolated from a previously constructed genomic library of Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32. The estA gene consisted of a 558 bp open reading frame encoding a putative peptide of 21.3 kDa. Protein sequence homology searches using BLAST revealed that EstA had low amino acid sequence identity with the serine-dependent arylesterases TesI (24%) and EtpA (26%) from Escherichia coli and Vibrio mimicus, respectively. A recombinant EstA fusion protein containing a C-terminal six-histidine tag was constructed and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. Characterization of EstA revealed that it was a serine-dependent enzyme having a monomeric Mr of 22.6-25.1 kDa. Optimum temperature, NaCl concentration and pH for EstA activity were determined to be 35-40 degrees C, 3.5% NaCl and 7.5-8.0, respectively. EstA had significant activity under conditions simulating those of ripening cheese (10 degrees C, 4% NaCl, pH 5.1). EstA hydrolysed a variety of ester compounds and preferred those with substituted phenyl alcohol and short-chain fatty acid groups. Site-directed mutagenesis suggested that the S10 and H164 residues were essential for EstA activity.
