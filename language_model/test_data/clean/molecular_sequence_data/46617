The discrimination of recent mutational derivatives from ancestral variation is a critical antecedent to any effort which aims to identify the factors modulating the rates of origin and persistence of new mutants. We propose that newly arisen mtDNA variants, which we designate as terminal branch haplotypes (TBHs), can be recognized by joint sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. This study examined mtDNA diversity in natural populations of the brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) from four heavily contaminated sites and three relatively pristine locations. While sequence analysis of the mtDNA D-loop region revealed that TBHs were prevalent in these populations, contaminant exposure appeared to play a minor role in their generation. Instead, most TBHs likely arose due to spontaneous mutations with variation in their incidence among sites reflecting the impact of demographic factors.
