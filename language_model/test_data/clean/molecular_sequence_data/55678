When the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was transformed with DNA that shares no homology to the genome, three classes of transformants were obtained. In the most common class, the DNA was inserted as the result of a reaction that appears to require base pairing between the target sequence and the terminal few base pairs of the transforming DNA fragment. In the second class, no such homology was detected, and the transforming DNA was integrated next to a CTT or GTT in the target; it is likely that these integration events were mediated by topoisomerase I. The final class involved the in vivo ligation of transforming DNA with nucleus-localized linear fragments of mitochondrial DNA.
