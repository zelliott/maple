Fragmentation reactions of sodium-cationized enkephalin peptides generated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization were studied using post-source decay (PSD) with a reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Several matrices and analyte-matrix sample preparation methods were evaluated for high-intensity ion currents that could last for the entire PSD analysis. A triple dried-droplet sample preparation procedure with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as the matrix was found to yield abundant longer-lasting ion signals of the peptide-Na(+) ion adducts. The principal decay product of these adduct ions is the [b(n-1) + Na + OH](+) ion, which provides an unambiguous identification of the C-terminal residue of a peptide. In some peptides, the loss of a second residue from the C-terminus is also observed. No other sequence-specific ions were observed.
