Two new saponins have been isolated from the aerial parts of Herniaria fontanesii. Their structures were established as 28-O-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2-[(alpha-L- rhamnopyranosyl)-(1-->3)-]-(beta-D-4-acetoxyfucopyranosyl] ester of 3-O-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl uronic]-2 beta-3 beta-16-alpha-trihydroxy-olean-12-ene-23, 28-dioic acid and 28-omicron-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1-->3)]-(beta-D-fucopyranosyl] ester of 3-omicron-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl uronic]-2 beta-3 beta-16-alpha-trihydroxy-olean-12-ene-23, 28 dioic acid.
