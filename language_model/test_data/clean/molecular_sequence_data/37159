Previous findings that the vaccinia virus uracil DNA glycosylase is required for virus DNA replication, coupled with an inability to isolate a mutant with an active site substitution in the glycosylase gene, were surprising, as such enzymes function in DNA repair and bacterial, yeast, and mammalian null mutants are viable. To further study the role of the viral protein, we constructed recombinant vaccinia viruses with single or double mutations (D68N and H181L) in the uracil DNA glycosylase conserved catalytic site by using a complementing cell line that constitutively expresses the viral enzyme. Although these mutations abolished uracil DNA glycosylase activity, they did not prevent viral DNA replication or propagation on a variety of noncomplementing cell lines or human primary skin fibroblasts. In contrast, replication of a uracil DNA glycosylase deletion mutant occurred only in the complementing cell line. Therefore, the uracil DNA glycosylase has an essential role in DNA replication that is independent of its glycosylase activity. Nevertheless, the conservation of the catalytic site in all poxvirus orthologs suggested an important role in vivo. This idea was confirmed by the decreased virulence of catalytic-site mutants when administered by the intranasal route to mice.
