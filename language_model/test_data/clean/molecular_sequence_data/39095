To screen the BIGH3 gene in three unrelated families with lattice corneal dystrophy (LCD), two of which disclosed a particular phenotype.

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes of the affected patients and their family members. The entire coding sequence of the BIGH3 gene was screened for mutations by means of transcript analysis on total RNA isolated from peripheral leukocytes by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction performed with primers designed for this study. Each mutation was confirmed at the genomic level, by using published primers.

One family that had a typical form of LCD, had the described R124C mutation in the BIGH3 gene. Two families with atypical forms of LCD were negative for the previously known mutations of the gene. Direct sequencing of the BIGH3 mRNA in the latter two families allowed us to identify two mutations located in exon 14. They consist of a 9-bp insertion at position 18851886 and one missense mutation at position 1877 of the BIGH3 gene. Three new polymorphisms were also observed.

Two mutations different from those linked to LCD have been found in clinically distinguishable forms of this disease, intermediate between LCDs types I and IIIA. The DNA segment comprising both alterations normally encodes for a highly conserved region of the fourth internal domain of the Betaig-h3 protein, suggesting that this region may be of functional and/or structural importance. The identification of new mutations by screening of the complete BIGH3 gene and the comparative analysis of the induced modifications in betaig-h3 protein should shed light in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying LCDs resulting from mutations in the BIGH3 gene, and may help to explain their phenotypic heterogeneity.
