The structures of the O-polysaccharides of the lipopolysaccharides of Proteus mirabilis O7 and O49 were determined by chemical methods, mass spectrometry, including MS/MS, and NMR spectroscopy, including experiments run in an H2O/D2O mixture to reveal correlations for NH protons. The O-polysaccharides were found to contain N-carboxyacetyl (malonyl) and N-(3-carboxypropanoyl) (succinyl) derivatives of 4-amino-4,6-dideoxyglucose (4-amino-4-deoxyquinovose, Qui4N), respectively. The behavior of Qui4N derivatives with the dicarboxylic acids under conditions of acid hydrolysis and methanolysis was studied using GLC-MS.
