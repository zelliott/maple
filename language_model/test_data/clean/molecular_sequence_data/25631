We report the chemical characterization and the relationship between the physicochemical properties and conformational change of a succinoglycan polysaccharide produced by Pseudomonas sp, NCIB 11592. The expected chemical structure is confirmed, with a ratio of D-glucose: D-galactose: pyruvate: succinate of 7:1:1:1. The molecular weight of the native form is 4.2 x 10(6) but after a single heating cycle through the disordered state the molecular weight is reduced to 3.0 x 10(6). The polymer has a polymolecularity index of 1.3 in both cases. The conformational change was studied by different methods which enabled us to define the exact nature of the ordered and disordered states. The conformational transition depends on the temperature, the ionic strength and the nature of the counterion. The polyelectrolyte behaviour is in favour of a single chain conformation with an intramolecular helix-coil transition. The enthalpy change during this transition is greater than that expected solely on the basis of the polyelectrolyte contribution. It may be associated with changes in solvation or a rearrangement of water molecules in close association with the polymer.
