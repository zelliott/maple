We here analyse the repertoire of VH7183 rearrangements isolated from different stages of B cell differentiation in adult mice. The nucleotide sequence analyses of VH7183-D-JH rearrangements derived from large pre-B cells (B220+, mu-), small pre-B cells (B220+, mu-) and mature B cells (B220+, mu+) isolated from adult bone marrow revealed a sequential accumulation, among functional rearrangements, of D segments of the FL16 family and a depletion of D segments using the second and the third reading frame (RF). One member (VH7183.1) of the VH7183 gene family was utilized in 60-80% of the rearrangements of all populations analysed. In neonates the majority of the rearrangements utilizing this gene was found to be functional. In contrast, > 96% of the VH7183 rearrangements isolated from adult spleen were non-functional. These data provide evidence for cellular selection of VH regions acting at different points of the B cell differentiation pathway and at the transition of B cells from the bone marrow to the periphery.
