Treatment of Schizosaccharomyces pombe with the C5 DNA methyltransferase (C5Mtase) inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-azaC) has previously been shown to induce G2 checkpoint-dependent cell cycle arrest. S. pombe strains defective in both the checkpoint control pathways and in DNA repair processes are sensitive to 5-azaC. Here we describe the isolation of azr1+, as a multi-copy suppressor of the 5-azaC sensitivity of G2 checkpoint and DNA repair-deficient strains. azr1+ encodes a putative 25 kDa protein with limited homology to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae open reading frame of unknown function. The azr1+ gene is not essential and the null mutant shows no alteration in either DNA repair or checkpoint properties. We also report the sequence of the putative fission yeast cytidine deaminase gene, designated pcd1+, which lies immediately adjacent to azr1+ but which plays only a moderate role in suppression of 5-azaC sensitivity.
