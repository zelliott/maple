A comparison of three techniques for quantitative analysis of galactosylation present on immunoglobulins is described. ESIMS, MALDI-TOF MS, and anion-exchange chromatography with fluorescence detection were evaluated in terms of repeatability, limit of quantitation, selectivity, and linearity. A recombinant monoclonal IgG was enzymatically modified in vitro to produce essentially completely galactosylated and degalactosylated forms of the immunoglobulin. Samples of known galactosylation levels were prepared by mixing the modified forms with the native form of the immunoglobulin. Good repeatability and linearity were demonstrated for all three assays (RSDs<1.0%, correlation coefficients>0.99). Differences in selectivity, sensitivity, and other performance aspects of the three techniques are also discussed in this paper.
