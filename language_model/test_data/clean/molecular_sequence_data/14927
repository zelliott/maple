The taxonomic position of strain DFH11(T), which was isolated from coastal seawater off Qingdao, People's Republic of China in 2007, was determined. Strain DFH11(T) comprised Gram-negative, motile, strictly aerobic spirilli that did not produce catalase. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain DFH11(T) shared ~97.2, 93.3, 91.8, 91.7 and 91.5% sequence similarities with Oleispira antarctica, Spongiispira norvegica, Bermanella marisrubri, Oceaniserpentilla haliotis and Reinekea aestuarii, respectively. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments indicated that the strain was distinct from its closest phylogenetic neighbour, O. antarctica. The strain grew optimally in 2-3% (w/v) NaCl, at pH 5.0-10.0 (optimally at pH 7.0) and between 0 and 30°C (optimum growth temperature 28°C). The strain exhibited a restricted substrate profile, with a preference for aliphatic hydrocarbons, that is consistent with its closest phylogenetic neighbour O. antarctica. Growth of the isolate at different temperatures affected the cellular fatty acid profile. 28°C cultured cells contained C(16:1)ω7c and/or iso-C(15:0) 2-OH (50.4%) and C(16:0) (19.2%) as the major fatty acids. However, the major fatty acids of the cells cultured at 4°C were C(16:1)ω7c and/or C(16:1)ω6c (40.2%), C(16:0) (17.2%) and C(17:1)ω8c (10.1%). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 42.7 mol%. Phylogeny based on 16S rRNA gene sequences together with data from DNA-DNA hybridization, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characterization revealed that DFH11(T) should be classified as a novel species of the genus Oleispira, for which the name Oleispira                         lenta sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain DFH11(T) (=NCIMB 14529(T) = LMG 24829(T)).
