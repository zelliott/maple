Six genes encoding high-molecular-mass subtilisins (HMSs) of alkaliphilic Bacillus spp. were cloned and sequenced. Their open reading frames of 2,394-2,424 bp encoded prosubtilisins of 798-808 amino acids (aa) consisting of the prepropeptides of 151-158 aa and the mature enzymes of 640-656 aa. The deduced aa sequences of the mature enzymes exhibited 60-95% identity to those of FT protease of Bacillus sp. strain KSM-KP43, a subtilisin-like serine protease, and a minor serine protease, Vpr, of Bacillus strains. Three of the six recombinant enzymes were susceptible to proteolysis, but the others were autodigestion resistant. All enzymes had optimal pH values of 10.5-11.0, optimal temperatures of 40-45 degrees C for hydrolysis of a synthetic substrate, and were heat labile. These alkaline proteases seem to form a new subtilisin family, as judged by their aa sequences and phylogenetic analysis.
