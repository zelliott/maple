Sequences related to the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene have been identified on several human chromosomes. In the centromeric region of chromosomes 14 and 15, two NF1 pseudogenes have been described. Sequence comparison between NF1-related exons amplified from two yeast artificial chromosome clones hybridizing to chromosomal region 15q11.2 and published NF1-related sequences localized at 15q11.2 suggested that a third NF1 pseudogene resides in this chromosomal region. The previous localization of an NF1-related locus to the telomeric part of chromosome 15 could not be confirmed by us. Our findings further support pericentromeric spreading of partial NF1 gene copies at chromosome 15q11.2 during evolution.
