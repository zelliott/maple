We cloned a porcine ortholog of homeodomain transcription factor Msx1 from the porcine pituitary cDNA library. The amino acid sequence of Msx1 shows high conservation among mammalian species. RT-PCR for porcine fetal and postnatal pituitaries showed that Msx1 is already expressed at early fetal day 40, decreases to a low level before birth and then remarkably decreases after birth. On the other hand, Msx1 expression was observed in all pituitary-derived cell line tested, with most in a gonadotrope lineage LbetaT4. Transfection assay demonstrated that Msx1 markedly repressed the basal Cga and Fshb gene expression, while Lhb expression was affected slightly. Taken together, Msx1 may play a role in repressing gene expression in the fetal and postnatal periods.
