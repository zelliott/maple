The Mu-related transposon Tn5090, also called Tn402, was observed to be highly selective for targets clustered in or close to recombination sites of serine-type recombinases in plasmids R388 and RP1. Transposition to the par area of RP1 responded strongly to a deletion in the gene of resolvase ParA. A search in sequence databanks revealed further insertions of Tn5090/Tn402 close to different genes of resolvases. These results imply that the target selection of Tn5090 depends on a property that is shared among several serine recombinases.
