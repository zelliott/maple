This paper describes a biochemical study on the protein composition of crystalline inclusions (cores) from plant peroxisomes. By SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting, a catalase of 59 kDa was identified as the predominant protein component in purified cores from sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) cotyledons. A 55-kDa catalase was the only additional peptide detected. In contrast to in cores, the 55-kDa catalase was the major catalase protein in matrix fractions obtained from lysed peroxisomes. These findings suggested two peroxisomal populations of catalase differing in molecular structure and subperoxisomal compartmentation in sunflower cotyledons. Evidence for different amino acid sequences of the two catalases was found by peptide mapping with endoproteinase Glu-C, by expressing a cDNA encoding matrix catalase in Escherichia coli, and by partial amino acid sequencing of peptide fragments from 59-kDa core catalase. These results contradict the previous view that the formation of cores occurred via condensation of matrix catalase, and indicate that new concepts on the biogenesis and physiological function of plant peroxisomal cores need to be developed.
