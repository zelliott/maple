A novel Gram-positive, aerobic, rod-shaped and mycelia-producing bacterial strain, designated KLBMP 1050(T), was isolated from the stem of the oil-seed plant Jatropha curcas L. collected from Sichuan Province, south-west China. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the isolate KLBMP 1050(T) belonged to the genus Nocardioides, with the highest sequence similarity to Nocardioides albus KCTC 9186(T) (99.38 %) and Nocardioides luteus KCTC 9575(T) (99.03 %). However, the DNA-DNA relatedness of isolate KLBMP 1050(T) to these two type strains were 37.5 ± 3.5 and 33 ± 2.3 %, respectively. Strain KLBMP 1050(T) grew at the pH range 6-11, temperature range 10-32 °C and with 0-12 % NaCl. The physiological properties of strain KLBMP 1050(T) differ from those of N. albus KCTC 9186(T) and N. luteus KCTC 9575(T). The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained LL: -diaminopimelic acid and MK-8(H(4)) was the major respiratory quinone. The predominant cellular fatty acid of strain KLBMP 1050(T) was iso-C(16:0) (23.3 %). The total DNA G+C content was 70.1 mol%. On the basis of the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data, strain KLBMP 1050(T) represents a novel species of the genus Nocardioides, for which the name Nocardioides panzhihuaensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KLBMP 1050(T) (= KCTC 19888(T) = NBRC 108680(T)).
