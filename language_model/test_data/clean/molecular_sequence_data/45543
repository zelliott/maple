A heavy metal responsive gene PvSR3 (GenBank accession number U54703) encoding an acid dehydrin was isolated from a mercuric chloride-treated bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) leaf cDNA library by differential screening using cDNAs derived from treated and untreated plants. The PvSR3 cDNA is 981-bp long and has a 606-bp open-reading frame with a 202-residue-deduced amino acid sequence. The PvSR3 sequence contains two conserved repeats of the characteristic lysine-rich K segment (EKKGIMDKIKEKLPG) preceded by an 8-serine residue stretch, whereas the Y segment (DEYGNP) conserved motif is absent. The deduced protein has a calculated molecular weight of 23 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.2. Sequence similarity and comparative analysis showed that PvSR3 shares 70 and 73% similarity with the dehydrin of poplar and pepper, respectively. Southern hybridizations indicated that PvSR3 was a low copy-number gene. Northern blot analysis revealed that PvSR3 mRNA was weakly detected in seedling leaves. However, the gene expression was strongly stimulated by heavy metals, such as mercury, cadmium, arsenic, and copper, whereas virus infection and salt had little effect on it. In contrast, PvSR3 was not responsive to drought or abscisic acid (ABA), and was downregulated by UV radiation. Furthermore, PvSR3 was upregulated by the exogenous signaling molecules, including salicylic acid (SA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). It is suggested that PvSR3 is extremely related to heavy metal stress, and might play an important role in metal detoxification and resistance to the damage caused by heavy metals.
