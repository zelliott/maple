In order to evaluate the in situ degradative capabilities of microorganisms in an underground reactor facility housing two flowthrough columns filled with aquifer soil, we examined the distribution and phylogeny of gene transcripts encoding enzymes capable of catalyzing the cleavage of the chlorinated aromatic ring during transformation of the main pollutant, chlorobenzene. Initial biostimulation of the autochthonous bacteria in the originally anaerobic reactor columns was achieved by injecting nitrate and oxygen in the form of H(2)O(2). Two broad-range primer pairs were used for reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) of partial subunit genes of chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from RNA directly extracted from different groundwater and aquifer samples. Samples retrieved from the lowermost sections of the reactor columns, which were operated in upflow mode, were positive for the presence of chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase mRNA. On the other hand, chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase RT-PCR products were detected in a larger part of each reactor column, up to a zone 5.5 m above the bottom. Phylogenetic analyses of these chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase sequences clearly separated them into two main clusters, one of which was closely affiliated with the broad-spectrum chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas chlororaphis RW71. Analysis of sequences obtained from RT-PCR products amplified with catechol 2,3-dioxygenase primers revealed that their closest relative was the chlorocatechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene cbzE from Pseudomonas putida GJ31 (A. E. Mars, J. Kingma, S. R. Kaschabek, W. Reineke, and D. B. Janssen, J. Bacteriol. 181:1309-1318, 1999), with sequence similarities between 97.8 and 99.0%.
