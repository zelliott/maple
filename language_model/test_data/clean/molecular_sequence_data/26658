To investigate the genetic structure of the purplish Washington clam population, Saxidomus purpuratus Sowerby, in Korea. A portion of mitochondrial COI gene sequences (605 bp) for phylogenetic comparison was determined. Sequence analysis of 62 individuals collected from six regions revealed 13 haplotypes. Phylogenetic analysis using Phylogeny Inference Package (PHYLIP) subdivided the purplish Washington clam into two clades (termed clade A and B), weak supported groups (< 65 of bootstrap value). This haplotype subdivision was also in accordance with geographic separation; one each at Masan, Yeosu, Samcheonpo, Jubyeon and Geojedo, and the other at Sineju. Population genetic analysis subdivided these two population groups with a geographic distance (d = 0.431, p = 0.379). Furthermore, in the Sineju population, the maximum sequence divergence (2.67%) and minimum nucleotide diversity (0.0012426) were shown in which might be reflective of a relatively small population size and the geographical isolation of the population as compared with other populations. However, a very high migration rate (N(m) = 59.62-infinite) and a very low level of geographic distance (F(ST) = -0.076-0.055) were noted to exist among the South and East Sea populations, suggesting that individuals between populations should show a significantly active genetic mixing and migration regardless of geography. These findings allowed us to conclude that the purplish Washington clam populations occurring in the South and East Sea were formed with randomly dispersed individuals.
