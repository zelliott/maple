Oligonucleotide primers specific for intron 5 sequences were used to amplify a unique 718 bp fragment in the human GST mu gene. Using DNA from a panel of somatic cell hybrids it was possible to confirm the assignment of the GST1 locus to chromosome 1p and to refine localisation to 1p13 using Southern blot analysis of DNA from three-generation CEPH families and a GST mu specific DNA probe.
