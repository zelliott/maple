The drug cyclosporin A (CsA) exerts its immunosuppressive action by binding to the cytosolic protein, cyclophilin (CyP) and, as a complex, binding to and inhibiting the calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine threonine phosphatase, calcineurin. It is unknown whether a similar mode of action occurs during the drug's antiparasite activity. Calmodulin-binding proteins from the helminth parasites Hymenolepis microstoma and H. diminuta were purified by affinity chromatography, yielding single polypeptide bands of 60000 M(r), according to SDS-PAGE. These proteins were tested for calcineurin activity by the dephosphorylation of the RII peptide (part of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase). Both proteins were calcium- and calmodulin-dependent and were inhibited by mammalian cyclophilin complexed with cyclosporin A (IC50 values of 0.75 microgram CyP for H. microstoma and 0.90 microgram CyP for H. diminuta). However, neither of the parasite calcineurins was inhibited by H. microstoma cyclophilin/CsA. These data suggest the anthelmintic mode of action of CsA in these helminth models does not involve the inhibition of a signal transduction pathway requiring interaction with calcineurin.
