We have investigated the effect of chemotherapeutic and DNA damaging agents on binding of the tumor suppressor phosphoprotein p53 to its consensus DNA sequence. Activation of p53-DNA binding was seen for treatment with radiation, hydrogen peroxide, actinomycin D, Adriamycin, etoposide, camptothecin, 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C, and cisplatin. These results showed that DNA strand breaks were sufficient to lead to increased levels of p53. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide blocks the increase in p53 following DNA damage. The increase in p53 activation in camptothecin treated cells may result, at least in part, from an increased half-life of the protein and consequent increases in intracellular protein concentration.
