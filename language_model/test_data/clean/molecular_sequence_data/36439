The relationship of heat shock proteins and rheumatoid arthritis as well as the relevance of autoreactivity in this disease is unclear. T cells of six individuals (four expressing the DRB1*0401 allele, one harboring DRB1*0404 and one the DRB1*0407 allele) were cloned in the presence of 65kD mycobacterial heat shock protein (HSP60) in order to determine T cell receptors (TcR) used and the MHC class II restriction patterns of potentially relevant T cell clones (TcC). All TcC obtained were not specific for HSP60, but six TcC of one donor (HLA-DR4/HLA-DR5) were responsive towards autologous antigen-presenting cells. One TcC displayed authentic autoreactivity whereas five TcC reacted specifically to serum proteins. The amino acids (aa) of the MHC molecule, crucial for immune recognition were mapped to aa #71 or #86 of either maternal or paternal origin. The strictly autoreactive TcC did not recognize transfected L cells implicating specificity for self-peptides not presented by L cells or the involvement of adhesion molecules. Correlations between autoreactivity and TcR V(D)J sequences or N nucleotides of various "autoreactive" TcC were not evident.
