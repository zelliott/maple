The major coat protein of the filamentous bacteriophage M13 is inserted as an integral protein in the inner membrane of the Escherichia coli host upon infection. M13 coat protein is an ideal model membrane protein and has been the target of many biophysical studies. An overview is presented here of the application of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to the study of the structure and dynamics of M13 coat protein in several lipid-mimetic environments. The coat protein may be biosynthetically enriched with 13C- and 15N-labelled amino acids, allowing the resolution and assignment of individual nuclei. Structural fluctuations at selected sites have been monitored using 13C relaxation and isotope-detected amide hydrogen exchange kinetics. A model is proposed for the structure of a coat protein dimer in detergent micelles.
