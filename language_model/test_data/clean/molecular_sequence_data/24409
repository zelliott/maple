A previously established method for the identification of promoters recognized by a heterologous RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing a particular sigma factor was used to identify promoters dependent upon a sporulation specific sigma factor, sigma(RpoZ), of Streptomyces aureofaciens. Three new positive DNA fragments were identified, and these putative rpoZ-dependent promoters, P(ren24), P(ren57), and P(ren71), contained sequences similar to the consensus sequence of flagellar and chemotaxis promoters. However, only P(ren71) was active in S. aureofaciens. The promoter was induced at the time of aerial mycelium formation, and was inactive in an S. aureofaciens strain with an rpoZ-disrupted gene. The results suggest that the P(ren71) promoter is recognized by an RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing sigma(RpoZ) in S. aureofaciens. Sequence analysis of the region directed by P(ren71) revealed a gene, ren71, encoding a protein of 358 amino acids with an Mr 37,770. The deduced protein product showed end-to-end sequence similarity to the meta-cleavage compound hydrolase of Sphingomonas paucimobilis.
