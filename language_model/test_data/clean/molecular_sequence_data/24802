A branching enzyme (EC 2.4.1.18) gene was isolated from an extremely thermophilic bacterium, Rhodothermus obamensis. The predicted protein encodes a polypeptide of 621 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 72 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence shares 42-50% similarity to known bacterial branching enzyme sequences. Similar to the Bacillus branching enzymes, the predicted protein has a shorter N-terminal amino acid extension than that of the Escherichia coli branching enzyme. The deduced amino acid sequence does not appear to contain a signal sequence, suggesting that it is an intracellular enzyme. The R. obamensis branching enzyme was successfully expressed both in E. coli and a filamentous fungus, Aspergillus oryzae. The enzyme showed optimum catalytic activity at pH 6.0-6.5 and 65 degrees C. The enzyme was stable after 30 min at 80 degrees C and retained 50% of activity at 80 degrees C after 16 h. Branching activity of the enzyme was higher toward amylose than toward amylopectin. This is the first thermostable branching enzyme isolated from an extreme thermophile.
