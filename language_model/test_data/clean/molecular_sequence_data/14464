Strain WPAGA1T was isolated from marine sediment of the west Pacific Ocean. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the isolate belonged to the genus Flammeovirga. Strain WPAGA1T exhibited highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Flammeovirga yaeyamensis NBRC 100898(T) (98.1 %) and lower sequence similarity with Flammeovirga arenaria IFO 15982T (94.6 %) and other members of the genus Flammeovirga (<94.2 %). DNA-DNA relatedness studies showed that strain WPAGA1T was distinct from F. yaeyamensis NBRC 100898T and F. arenaria NBRC 15982T (43±4 % and 32±2 % relatedness values, respectively). Strain WPAGA1T could be distinguished from all known members of the genus Flammeovirga by a number of phenotypic features. However, the dominant fatty acids of strain WPAGA1T (iso-C15:0, C16:0 and C20:4ω6,9,12,15c), the major polyamine (cadaverine) and the G+C content of the chromosomal DNA (32.9 mol%) were consistent with those of members of the genus Flammeovirga. Based on phenotypic and chemotaxonomic features and 16S rRNA gene sequences, strain WPAGA1T can be assigned to the genus Flammeovirga as a representative of a novel species, for which the name Flammeovirga pacifica sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is WPAGA1T (=CCTCC AB 2010364T=LMG 26175T=DSM 24597T=MCCC 1A06425T).
