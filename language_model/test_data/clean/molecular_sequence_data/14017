A polycondensation of 2,3,6-tri-O-benzoyl-4-O-(2,3,4-tri-O-benzoyl-beta-D-galactopyranosyl)-al pha-D-mannopyranosyl hydrogenphosphonate in the presence of trimethylacetyl chloride has been used to synthesize a linear poly[beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-->4)-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl phosphate] representing the phosphoglycan part of the lipophosphoglycan from Leishmania donovani.
