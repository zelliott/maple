The Cerithioidea is a very diverse group of gastropods with ca. 14 extant families and more than 200 genera occupying, and often dominating, marine, estuarine, and freshwater habitats. While the composition of Cerithioidea is now better understood due to recent anatomical and ultrastructural studies, the phylogenetic relationships among families remain chaotic. Morphology-based studies have provided conflicting views of relationships among families. We generated a phylogeny of cerithioideans based on mitochondrial large subunit rRNA and flanking tRNA gene sequences (total aligned data set 1873 bp). Nucleotide evidence and the presence of a unique pair of tRNA genes (i.e., threonine + glycine) between valine-mtLSU and the mtSSU rRNA gene support conclusions based on ultrastructural data that Vermetidae and Campanilidae are not Cerithioidea, certain anatomical similarities being due to convergent evolution. The molecular phylogeny shows support for the monophyly of the marine families Cerithiidae [corrected], Turritellidae, Batillariidae, Potamididae, and Scaliolidae as currently recognized. The phylogenetic data reveal that freshwater taxa evolved on three separate occasions; however, all three recognized freshwater families (Pleuroceridae, Melanopsidae, and Thiaridae) are polyphyletic. Mitochondrial rDNA sequences provide valuable data for testing the monophyly of cerithioidean [corrected] families and relationships within families, but fail to provide strong evidence for resolving relationships among families. It appears that the deepest phylogenetic limits for resolving caenogastropod relationships is less than about 245--241 mya, based on estimates of divergence derived from the fossil record.
