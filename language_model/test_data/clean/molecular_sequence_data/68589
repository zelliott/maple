The abundant hydrophobic, proline-glutamine, and histidine-rich (over 90%) amelogenins constitute the major class of proteins in forming extracellular enamel matrix. These are thought to play a major role in the structural organization and mineralization of developing enamel. The present report describes the successful sequencing of the major human amelogenin protein, by use of both Edman degradation and cDNA sequencing. When Edman degradation was used, over 75% of the primary structure of the protein was determined. This sequence was supplemented with cDNA sequencing studies, which revealed the predicted sequence of this protein. Together, they provide the complete sequence of an important human enamel protein. The information complements recent studies on bovine and human amelogenin genes. A comparison between the present results and the protein sequences predicted from the corresponding human amelogenin genomic coding regions and that of cDNA sequences of other species is described.
