NF-R2 is a DNA-binding protein that interacts with the MDR1 gene proximal promoter sequence. We previously reported that NF-R2 binds within the promoter's -126 and -102 regions, which contain the ATTCAGTCA motif. In the present study, we have purified NF-R2 from the nuclear extract of K562/ADM cells, a multidrug-resistant cell line derived from human myelogenous leukemia K562 cells, using sequential chromatography on Sephacryl S-300, DEAE-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose and a DNA affinity column consisting of a repetitive synthetic ATTCAGTCA motif coupled to Sepharose. NF-R2 runs as a single protein of 75 kDa on SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) expression assay and gel mobility shift competition assay with mutated promoters revealed that the ATTCAGTCA motif is a positive regulatory element of MDR1 gene and that the motif is important for NF-R2 binding. These results suggest that NF-R2 may be involved in the positive regulation of the MDR1 gene transcription.
