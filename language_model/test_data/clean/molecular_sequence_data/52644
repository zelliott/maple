To elucidate the molecular mechanism of apical dominance, the expression patterns of genes that are preferentially expressed in dormant axillary buds of pea (Pisum sativum L. cv. Alaska) seedlings were investigated. We isolated two cDNA clones, cPsAD1 and cPsAD2 whose corresponding genes were named PsAD1 and PsAD2, from a cDNA library of dormant axillary buds using the differential display method. The deduced amino acid sequence of PsAD1 contains 87 residues and is rich in glycine residues in the amino terminal region. A search of the protein databases failed to find any sequences similar to PsAD1 protein except for the glycine-rich region. Northern blot analyses showed that PsAD1 mRNA mainly accumulated in dormant axillary buds and that its amount rapidly decreased after decapitation of the terminal bud. In situ hybridization analyses indicated that PsAD1 mRNA was localized in the apical meristem, procambia, and leaf primordia in dormant axillary buds that were competent to grow out but whose growth was temporarily suspended. That is, the expression of the PsAD1 gene is closely associated with the dormancy of axillary buds. The deduced amino acid sequence of PsAD2 contains 98 amino acid residues and is not similar to those of previously characterized proteins. PsAD2 mRNA accumulated in dormant axillary buds, roots, mature leaflets and elongated stems, suggesting that PsAD2 is involved in not only the dormancy of axillary buds but also the non-growing state in various tissues.
