Interferon (IFN)-gamma-induced expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) gene is implicated in the antimicrobial and antiproliferative effects of IFN-gamma in cell cultures. Earlier studies identified a 96 base pair (bp) regulatory region upstream of the IDO gene that conferred IFN-gamma response to the chloroamphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene linked to herpesvirus thymidine kinase promoter. The IFN-gamma-responsive region was further narrowed to a 67 bp fragment by 3' deletion. This 67 bp fragment contains several sequence elements of potential interest, including a 14 bp sequence homologous to the ISRE sequence found in IFN-alpha-inducible genes and two palindromic sequences (PE I and PE II) homologous to the GAS sequence identified in IFN-gamma-inducible genes. Site-directed mutagenesis studies showed that IFN-gamma-induced expression of IDO-CAT constructs involved cooperation between two elements: the ISRE homolog and the PE II (but not PE I). Either element alone with its flanking sequence was inadequate in conferring an IFN-gamma response to CAT reporter gene. Two IFN-gamma-regulated protein factors interacting with these two elements were identified. The factor binding to the ISRE region was induced with a slower kinetics, required new protein synthesis, and reacted with antibodies to IRF-1. The factor interacting with the PE II region appeared rapidly after treatment with IFN-gamma independently of new protein synthesis, and its binding to DNA probe was blocked by antibodies to p91 factor, reported to bind to GAS element.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
