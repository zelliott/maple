Ligand-activated epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) associate with coated pit adaptor proteins (AP2) in vivo, implying a mechanism for receptor retention in coated pits during internalization. Using an in vitro binding assay, we localized the adaptor binding determinant to residues 970-991 of EGFRs and confirmed specificity by competition with a synthetic peptide corresponding to this sequence. A mutant EGFR lacking this AP2 binding determinant did not associate with AP2 in vivo but demonstrated internalization and down-regulation kinetics indistinguishable from its wild-type counterpart. Immunocytochemistry confirmed ligand-induced internalization of the mutant EGFR. These data suggest that endocytic determinants are distinct from AP2 binding determinants and that processes other than association with AP2 regulate endocytosis of EGFRs.
