The b gene encodes a transcriptional regulator of the maize anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. Certain b alleles participate in paramutation, an allele-specific interaction that heritably alters transcription. The moderately transcribed B' allele heritably reduces the transcription of the highly transcribed B-I allele in a B'/B-I heterozygote, such that the B-I allele becomes B'. To identify the cis-acting sequences required for paramutation, we used B' or B-I alleles to isolate intragenic recombinants with B-Peru, an allele that is insensitive to paramutation and has distinct tissue-specific regulation. Physical mapping of the recombinant alleles showed that most of the crossovers were in a small region near the 5' end of the b-transcribed region. Analysis of the recombinant alleles revealed that the ability to cause and respond to paramutation and the control of tissue-specific expression both localize to the 5' region of the gene. The 3' boundary of these functions lies just upstream of the translation initiation codon. The 5' boundary has been estimated to be no more than 0.1 cM further upstream (1-150 kb). Thus, sequences critical for paramutation lie upstream of the b coding sequences and may include transcriptional regulatory sequences.
