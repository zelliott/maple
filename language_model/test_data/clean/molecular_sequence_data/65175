Promoter regions required for minus-strand and subgenomic RNA synthesis have been mapped for several plus-strand RNA viruses. In general, the two types of promoters do not share structural features even though they are recognized by the same viral polymerase. The minus-strand promoter of Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), a plant virus of the family Bromoviridae, consists of a triloop hairpin (hpE) which is attached to a 3' tRNA-like structure (TLS). In contrast, the AMV subgenomic promoter consists of a single triloop hairpin that bears no sequence homology with hpE. Here we show that hpE, when detached from its TLS, can function as a subgenomic promoter in vitro and can replace the authentic subgenomic promoter in the live virus. Thus, the AMV subgenomic and minus-strand promoters are basically the same, but the minus-strand promoter is linked to a 3' TLS to force the polymerase to initiate at the very 3'end.
