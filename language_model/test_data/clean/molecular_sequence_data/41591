High-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) gene has a universal sentinel function for nucleic acid-mediated innate immune responses and acts as a pathogenic mediator in the inflammatory disease. In an effort to identify the functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the bovine HMGB1 gene that affects the binding to its target microRNA, first, the expression of HMGB1 mRNA in different genotypes and its candidate bta-miR-223 was investigated. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results showed that the relative expression of HMGB1 mRNA in cows with the genotype GG is significantly higher than those in cows with the genotype AA (P < 0.05). The expression of bta-miR-223 was significantly upregulated by 1.95-fold (P < 0.05) in the bovine mastitis-infected mammary gland tissues compared with that in the healthy tissues. Subsequently, luciferase assay indicated that the HMGB1 expression was directly targeted by bta-miR-223 in human embryo kidney 293 T (HEK 293T) cells. One novel SNP (g. +2776 A > G) in the HMGB1 3'-UTR, altering the binding of HMGB1 and bta-miR-223, was found to be associated with somatic count scores in cows. Taken together, the g. +2776 A > G-GG was an advantageous genotype which can be used as a candidate functional marker for mastitis resistance breeding program.
