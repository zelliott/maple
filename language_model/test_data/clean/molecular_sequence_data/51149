A number of cDNA clones encoding a small (0.5-0.6 kb) transcript have been isolated from a monkey (Macaca fascicularis) epididymal cDNA library. DNA sequence analysis indicates that this abundant epididymal transcript is homologous to the human CAMPATH-1 (CDw52) antigen precursor, a GPI-anchored membrane glycoprotein previously described on lymphocytes and monocytes.
