The crystal structure of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase serves as a template for the catalytic core of all eukaryotic protein kinases. The various crystal structures are reviewed with particular emphasis on the numerous conserved residues that converge at the active site. The structures also reveal the importance of posttranslational modifications, including myristylation and phosphorylation.
