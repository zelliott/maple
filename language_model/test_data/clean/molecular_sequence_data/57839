A method for coupling 2,4-di[alpha-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl] deuteroporphyrin dimethyl ether (IX), DDPOH and its complexes with metals to the 5'- or 3'-end of oligonucleotides was elaborated. In the presence of an oxidizing agent (H2O2), Fe(III)DDP-derivatives of oligonucleotides modified single-stranded DNA. The reaction was strictly site-specific and occurred at two neighbouring guanosine residues. A few types of modification were observed: cross-linking, modification leading to DNA cleavage upon piperidine treatment, and direct chain scission. The total modification yield reached 90%. Covalent attachment of Fe(III)DDP-group to oligonucleotides increased the efficiency of their uptake and the melting temperature of their complementary complexes.
