Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+; MIM#604233) is a familial epilepsy syndrome characterized by phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. It was associated with mutations in the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel subunit gene (SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN1B) and ligand-gated gamma aminobutyric acid receptors genes (GABRG2, GABRD). We investigated the roles of SCN1A, SCN1B, and GABRG2 mutations in the etiology of Chinese GEFS+ families. Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes of 23 probands and their family members. The sequences of SCN1A, SCN1B, and GABRG2 genes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. The major phenotypes of affected members in the 23 GEFS+ families exhibited FS and FS+, whereas rare phenotypes afebrile generalized tonic-clonic seizures (AGTCS), myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (MAE), and partial seizures were also observed. A novel SCN1A mutation, p.N935H, was identified in one family and another novel mutation in GABRG2, p.W390X, in another family. However, no SCN1B mutation was identified. The combined frequency of SCN1A, SCN1B, and GABRG2 mutations was 8.7% (2/23), extending the distribution of SCN1A and GABRG2 mutations to Chinese GEFS+ families. There were still unidentified genes contributing to the pathogenesis of GEFS+.
