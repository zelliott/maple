Through a series of promoter deletions and gene transfer experiments we have examined the basal regulation and glucocorticoid-mediated repression of the rat epoxide hydrolase gene. Three regions of the 5' flanking sequence were found to influence the basal level of promoter function in H4IIE hepatoma cells. Region A (-891 to -355 bp) contains an apparent repressor of epoxide hydrolase expression, while regions B (-271 to -171 bp) and C (-141 to -85) were found to contain important sequences required for optimal promoter activity. Previous work has demonstrated that dexamethasone represses epoxide hydrolase transcription by approximately 50% in isolated rat liver nuclei, and, in this study, we have demonstrated that the ability of the epoxide hydrolase promoter to drive CAT expression is similarly repressed in H4IIE cells treated with 1 microM dexamethasone. Furthermore, the level of endogenous epoxide hydrolase mRNA is decreased by 70-88% in nontransfected H4IIE cells treated with dexamethasone. Interestingly, promoter activity was not decreased by dexamethasone in COS cells, which lack glucocorticoid receptors. The current data show that sequences from -42 to +110 bp are sufficient to support the dexamethasone response, and, furthermore, they suggest that repression may not require direct interaction of the ligand-receptor complex with the promoter region.
