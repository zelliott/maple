Together strong: Cooperative binding of organic (see picture, red) and inorganic fragments provides a strategy for the potent inhibition of protein-protein interactions. By targeting specific Lewis basic side chains in peripheral regions of the binding site for coordination to a rhodium(II) center, the affinity of otherwise weak ligands is improved.
