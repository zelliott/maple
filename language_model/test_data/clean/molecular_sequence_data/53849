Generic taxon-specific DNA probes that target an internal region of the gene (rbcL) encoding the large subunit of ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) were developed for two groups of marine phytoplankton (diatoms and prymnesiophytes). The specificity and utility of the probes were evaluated in the laboratory and also during a 1-month mesocosm experiment in which we investigated the temporal variability in RubisCO gene expression and primary production in response to inorganic nutrient enrichment. We found that the onset of successive bloom events dominated by each of the two classes of chromophyte algae was associated with marked taxon-specific increases in rbcL transcription rates. These observations suggest that measurements of RubisCO gene expression can provide an early indicator of the development of phytoplankton blooms and may also be useful in predicting which taxa are likely to dominate a bloom.
