Two novel Gram-positive actinobacteria, designated H97-3(T) and H83-5, were isolated from marine sediment samples and their taxonomic positions were investigated by a polyphasic approach. Both strains formed vegetative hyphae in the early phase of growth but the hyphae eventually fragmented into coccoid cells. The peptidoglycan type was found to be A4Î±. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H(4)), and the major fatty acids were anteiso-C(15:0), anteiso-C(17:0) and C(16:0). The DNA G+C content was 74.0-74.9 mol %. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that strains H97-3(T) and H83-5 represented novel members of the family Cellulomonadaceae. Their nearest phylogenetic neighbours were the members of the genus Oerskovia, with a similarity of 98.3-98.4 %. However, strains H97-3(T) and H83-5 were distinguishable from the members of the genus Oerskovia and the other genera of the family Cellulomonadaceae in terms of chemotaxonomic characteristics and phylogenetic relationship. The result of the DNA-DNA hybridization indicated that strains H97-3(T) and H83-5 belonged to the same species. Therefore, strains H97-3(T) and H83-5 represent a novel genus and species of the family Cellulomonadaceae, for which the name Sediminihabitans luteus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of S. lutes is H97-3(T) (=NBRC 108568(T) = DSM 25478(T)).
