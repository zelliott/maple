Human growth hormone (hGH) is a single chain, 22 kd-protein with two intramolecular disulfide bonds. The hGH gene is located on chromosome 17 at band q22-q24 and has four introns separating five coding exons. The expression of hGH is restricted to the pituitary and regulated by GHF-1 which binds to the hGH promoter acting in concert with several other more ubiquitous DNA binding proteins. The secretion of hGH is regulated by GH releasing hormone (GRH) and somatostatin. GRH controls GH synthesis by stimulating transcription of GH mRNA while somatostatin determines the timing and amplitude of GH pulses. Pulsatile GH secretion is influenced by a number of neurogenic, metabolic and hormonal factors.
