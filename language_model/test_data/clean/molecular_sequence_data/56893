Human IGFBP-1 is phosphorylated by cells in culture and is present in both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms in human fetal serum and amniotic fluid. We have found immunoprecipitable [32P]IGFBP-1 in the conditioned media of both Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (stabley transfected and secreting human IGFBP-1) and human hepatoma (HepG2) cells metabolically labelled with [32P]orthophosphate. Phosphoamino acid analysis of this [32P]IGFBP-1 demonstrates that only serine residues are phosphorylated. Four phosphorylated isoforms of IGFBP-1 can be separated from one nonphosphorylated form by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. Since we have shown that the nonphosphorylated form of IGFBP-1 has a lower affinity for IGF-I compared to phosphorylated forms and a greater potentiating effect of IGF-I actions, we determined which serine residues in human IGFBP-1 are phosphorylated. After metabolically labelling IGFBP-1 with 32P, the purified phosphoprotein was digested first with trypsin and then with endoproteinase Glu-C. By radiosequencing the resulting 32P-labelled phosphopeptides, we found 3 serine residues to be phosphorylated. Approximately 70% of incorporated 32P was attributed to Ser101, while Ser169 accounted for approximately 25% and Ser119 for 5%. To investigate the physiologic importance of Ser101, this residue (and the nonphosphorylated Ser98) were changed to alanine by site directed mutagenesis of a human IGFBP-1 expression vector, followed by transfection into CHO cells. The [Ala98,101]IGFBP-1 purified from the conditioned media of these cells had the following characteristics: 1) when labelled with [32P]orthophosphate, it contained 63% less radioactivity than wild type IGFBP-1; 2) when analyzed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, it contained none of the most rapidly migrating and most rapidly migrating and most highly phosphorylated isoform, more of the nonphosphorylated isoform, and more of the most slowly migrating phosphorylated isoform; and 3) its affinity for IGF-I was reduced 2.5-fold and was midway between wild type IGFBP-1 from transfected CHO cells and dephosphorylated IGFBP-1. We conclude that Ser101 represents the major site of phosphorylation of IGFBP-1 and that while phosphorylation of Ser101 increases affinity of IGFBP-1 for IGF-I, phosphorylation of Ser169 and/or Ser119 also contributes to the high affinity of fully phosphorylated IGFBP-1.
