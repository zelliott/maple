A panel of five neutralizing monoclonal antibodies was generated from mice immunized with an attenuated strain of Mengo virus. Four of the antibodies were used to select mutants of Mengo virus which were able to escape neutralization by the selecting antibody, but it was not possible to select mutants which could escape neutralization by the fifth antibody. The capsid coding region of the RNA genome of each mutant was directly sequenced to identify the mutation(s) responsible for the neutralization escape phenotype. These results are compared to those of a previous study in which immunogenic determinants recognized by neutralizing antibodies generated against pentameric capsid subunits were located on the external surface of the Mengo virion. We have confirmed the existence of the previously identified immunogenic determinant in VP3 (site 2) as well as an immunodominant determinant in VP2 (site 1). Two previously uncharacterized determinants, located in surface loops of VP1 (sites 3 and 4A), were also identified. None of the mutations conferring the neutralization escape phenotype was found near the surface depressions on the virion which are believed to be the receptor binding sites.
