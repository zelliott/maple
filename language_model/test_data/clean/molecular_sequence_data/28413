The nucleotide sequence for enolase gene of Bacillus subtilis was determined from recombinant clone pRE. The sequence was composed of 1570 bp which included the 1374 bp of the complete coding region, the 86 bp of the 5' noncoding region and the 110 bp of the 3' noncoding region containing a polyadenylation signal. In addition, the poly(A) tail was also found. A potential ribosome binding site was located 20 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon in the 5' noncoding region. The aminoacid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence was 558 aminoacids in length. The size of the mRNA was 1.5 kb by the northern transfer technique.
