tbpA, fur, and fldA homologs from two strains (9L and 3384Y) of the sheep pathogen Histophilus ovis were sequenced. The predicted TbpA proteins of these strains are homologs of the Pasteurella multocida TbpA protein and collectively represent the second example of a new subfamily of TonB-dependent receptors. tbpA transcripts were readily detected by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with RNA isolated from strain 9L grown under iron-restricted conditions in the presence or absence of bovine transferrin (Tf). However, with strain 3384Y and depending on the primer pair, tbpA transcripts were detected by RT-PCR predominantly when the RNA was from cells grown under iron-restricted conditions in the presence of bovine Tf. In both strains, the fldA homolog was found to be immediately upstream of fur and, based on RT-PCR, these genes are transcribed as a single unit; the availability of iron and the presence or absence of bovine Tf in the growth medium had no apparent effect on the relative amounts of the fldA-fur transcripts.
