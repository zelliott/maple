Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein that inhibits apoptosis elicited by multiple stimuli in a large variety of cell types. BMRP (also known as MRPL41) was identified as a Bcl-2 binding protein and shown to promote apoptosis. Previous studies indicated that the amino-terminal two-thirds of BMRP contain the domain(s) required for its interaction with Bcl-2, and that this region of the protein is responsible for the majority of the apoptosis-inducing activity of BMRP. We have performed site-directed mutagenesis analyses to further characterize the BMRP/Bcl-2 interaction and the pro-apoptotic activity of BMRP. The results obtained indicate that the 13-17 amino acid region of BMRP is necessary for its binding to Bcl-2. Further mutagenesis of this motif shows that amino acid residue aspartic acid (D) 16 of BMRP is essential for the BMRP/Bcl-2 interaction. Functional analyses conducted in mammalian cells with BMRP site-directed mutants BMRP(13Ala17) and BMRP(D16A) indicate that these mutants induce apoptosis through a caspase-mediated pathway, and that they kill cells slightly more potently than wild-type BMRP. Bcl-2 is still able to counteract BMRP(D16A)-induced cell death significantly, but not as completely as when tested against wild-type BMRP. These results suggest that the apoptosis-inducing ability of wild-type BMRP is blocked by Bcl-2 through several mechanisms.
