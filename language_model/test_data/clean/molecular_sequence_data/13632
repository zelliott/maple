Two kinds of layered atelocollagen materials cross-linked with hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDIC), starch dialdehyde and glyoxal were enzymatically treated by bacterial collagenase. Evaluating collagenase digestion assay for these material showed progressive differences, particularly in the group of samples cross-linked with HMDIC. This should offer the possibility of programmed enzymatic degradation. These materials may be toxicologically acceptable as proven by the short-term test used for cytotoxicity evaluation.
