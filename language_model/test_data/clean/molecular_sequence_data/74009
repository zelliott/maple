Several septicemic Escherichia coli O78 strains, isolated from different sources, were characterized phenotypically and genotypically. Two avian isolates, one of which is known to carry the AC/I fimbriae, hybridized with the sfa determinant in colony dot-blot assay. Southern hybridizations with specific sfa probes, following pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), showed positive hybridization to the same fragment in each of these strains. Determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the AC/I major subunit gene revealed high similarity to the sequence of the SfaA-II protein. These data suggest that the adhesin gene cluster, coding for AC/I fimbriae, belongs to the S-fimbrial adhesin family.
