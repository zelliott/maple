Transcription factor 1 (TF1) is the Bacillus subtilis phage SPO1-encoded member of the family of bacterial DNA-binding proteins that includes Escherichia coli HU and integration host factor (IHF). We have initiated a mutational analysis of the TF1 molecule to understand better its unique DNA-binding properties and to investigate its physiological function. We report here the consequences of mutating the putative DNA-binding "arms" of TF1. At position 61 in its primary sequence, TF1 contains a Phe residue in place of the Arg residue found in all other known members of the HU family. Substituting polar, uncharged residues for Phe61 substantially reduced the DNA-binding affinity and site-selectivity of TF1 in vitro, whereas the substitution of Tyr had no effect. Substituting Trp or Arg for Phe61 had little effect on the affinity of TF1 for SPO1 DNA, but altered the electrophoretic mobilities of protein-DNA complexes in non-denaturing gels. The Arg61 substitution increased the affinity of the protein for non-specific sites on thymine-containing DNA, thus reducing the natural preference of TF1 for (5-hydroxymethyluracil)-containing DNA. The Phe61-to-Arg mutation was also correlated with decreased phage yield and aberrant regulation of viral protein synthesis in vivo.
