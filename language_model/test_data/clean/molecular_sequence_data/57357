We report here the DNA sequence of a segment of chromosome XI of Saccharomyces cerevisiae extending over 7.8 kb. The segment contains four long open reading frames, YKL150, YKL153, YKL155 and YKL156, YKL155 corresponds to the CAP1 gene. YKL153 contains an intron and shows an extremely biased codon usage suggestive of a highly expressed protein. YKL156 is a homolog to UOG-1, an open reading frame associated with the cDNA clone of the mammalian growth/differentiation factor 1. YKL150 reveals common motifs to both the RNA polymerase II elongation factor of Drosophila melanogaster and to the yeast PPR2 gene product.
