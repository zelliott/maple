The complete nucleotide sequence of an avian adenovirus, the egg drop syndrome (EDS) virus, was determined. The total genome length is 33,213 nucleotides, resulting in a molecular weight of 21.9 x 10(6). The GC content is only 42.5%. Between map units 3.5 and 76.9, the distribution of open reading frames with homology to known genes is similar to that reported for other mammalian and avian adenoviruses. However, no homologies to adenovirus genes such as E1A, pIX, pV, and E3 could be found. Outside this region, several open reading frames were identified without any obvious homology to known adenovirus proteins. In the region organized similarly as other adenoviral genomes, most homologies were found to an ovine adenovirus (OAV strain 287). The highest level of amino acid identity was found for the hexon proteins of EDS and OAV. The virus-associated RNA (VA RNA) was identified thanks to the homology with the VA RNA of fowl adenovirus serotype 1 (FAV1). Similarities with FAV1 were also found in the fiber protein. Our results demonstrate that the avian EDS virus represents an intermediate between mammalian and avian adenoviruses. The nucleotide sequence and genomic organization of the EDS virus reflect the heterogeneity of the aviadenovirus genus and the Adenoviridae family.
