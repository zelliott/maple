Recently, we identified ganglioside GM2 activator protein (GM2AP) as a novel adipokine, and revealed that treatment of cultured cells with GM2AP impairs insulin signal transduction. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of GM2AP on glucose metabolism in vivo. Injection of recombinant GM2AP in mice significantly lowered blood glucose levels in glucose tolerance tests. Administration of GM2AP to mice for 10 days increased serum insulin levels, whereas the contents of glucose, leptin and FFA were significantly decreased. Stimulation of calcium influx and insulin secretion by GM2AP was observed in hamster insulinoma HIT-T15 cells. Blockage of GM2AP function by specific antibodies inhibited GM2AP-induced insulin secretion. These results provide novel insights into the physiological functions of GM2AP in obesity.
