The human multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2, symbol ABCC2) is a polytopic membrane glycoprotein of 1545 amino acids which exports anionic conjugates across the apical membrane of polarized cells. A chimeric protein composed of C-proximal MRP2 and N-proximal MRP1 localized to the apical membrane of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCKII) indicating involvement of the carboxy-proximal part of human MRP2 in apical sorting. When compared to other MRP family members, MRP2 has a seven-amino-acid extension at its C-terminus with the last three amino acids (TKF) comprising a PDZ-interacting motif. In order to analyze whether this extension is required for apical sorting of MRP2, we generated MRP2 constructs mutated and stepwise truncated at their C-termini. These constructs were fused via their N-termini to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and were transiently transfected into polarized, liver-derived human HepG2 cells. Quantitative analysis showed that full-length GFP-MRP2 was localized to the apical membrane in 73% of transfected, polarized cells, whereas it remained on intracellular membranes in 27% of cells. Removal of the C-terminal TKF peptide and stepwise deletion of up to 11 amino acids did not change this predominant apical distribution. However, apical localization was largely impaired when GFP-MRP2 was C-terminally truncated by 15 or more amino acids. Thus, neither the PDZ-interacting TKF motif nor the full seven-amino-acid extension were necessary for apical sorting of MRP2. Instead, our data indicate that a deletion of at least 15 C-terminal amino acids impairs the localization of MRP2 to the apical membrane of polarized cells.
