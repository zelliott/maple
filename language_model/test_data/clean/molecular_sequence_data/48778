Heme, which is abundant in hemoglobin and many other hemoproteins, is known to play an important role in electron transfer, oxygen transport, regulation of gene expression, and many other biological functions. With the belief that the aggregation of Aβ peptides forming higher order oligomers is one of the central pathological pathways in Alzheimer's disease, the formation of the Aβ-heme complex is essential as it inhibits Aβ aggregation and protects the neurons from degradation. In our studies, conventional molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the 1 Aβ + 1 heme and 2 Aβ + 4 hemes system, respectively, with the identification of several dominant binding motifs. We found that hydrophobic residues of the Aβ peptide have a high affinity to interact with heme instead of the histidine residue. We conclude that hydrophobic interaction plays a dominant role in the Aβ-heme complex formation which indirectly serves to physically prevent Aβ aggregation.
