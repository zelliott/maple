Thrombin, besides being a potent coagulation factor, exerts influence on endothelial and leukocyte functions and may thus be involved in the regulation of inflammatory reactions. The present study investigated whether thrombin stimulates the production of growth-related cytokine/melanoma growth-stimulatory activity (GRO alpha/MGSA) in endothelial cells. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) stimulated with thrombin were found to product GRO alpha/MGSA in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This action of thrombin was completely suppressed by preincubation with either hirudin or antithrombin-III (AT-III)-heparin. Interestingly, the thrombin receptor-activating peptide SFLLRN mimicked the action of thrombin. In addition, staurosporine, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, attenuated the production of GRO alpha/MGSA by thrombin, SFLLRN and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), but left the action of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) unchanged. These results suggest that catalytic activation of thrombin receptor by thrombin results in GRO alpha/MGSA production, at least in part, via a pathway involving PKC in HUVEC.
