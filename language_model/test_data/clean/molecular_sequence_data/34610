Most aspergilli that produce aflatoxin are members of Aspergillus section Flavi, however isolates of several Aspergillus species not closely related to section Flavi also have been found to produce aflatoxin. Two of the species, Aspergillus ochraceoroseus and an undescribed Aspergillus species SRRC 1468, are morphologically similar to members of Aspergillus section Circumdati. The other species have Emericella teleomorphs (Em. astellata and an undescribed Emericella species SRRC 2520) and are morphologically distinctive in having ascospores with large flanges. All these aflatoxin-producing isolates were from tropical zones near oceans, and none of them grew on artificial media at 37 C. Aflatoxins and sterigmatocystin production were quantified by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and confirmed by HPLC-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) detection. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted on these four species using A. parasiticus and Em. nidulans, (which produce aflatoxin and the aflatoxin precursor sterigmatocystin, respectively) for comparison. Two aflatoxin/sterigmatocystin biosynthesis genes and the beta tubulin gene were used in the analyses. Results showed that of the new aflatoxin-producers, Aspergillus SRRC 1468 forms a strongly supported clade with A. ochraceoroseus as does Emericella SRRC 2520 with Em. astellata SRRC 503 and 512.
