The Bacillus subtilis 168 chromosome is known to contain at least six DNA replication terminators in the terminus region of the chromosome. By using a degenerate DNA probe for the consensus terminator sequence and low-stringency hybridization conditions, several additional minor hybridizing bands were identified. DNA corresponding to the most intense of these bands was cloned and characterized. Although localized in the terminus region, it could not bind RTP and possibly represents a degenerate terminator. A search of the SubtiList database identified an additional terminator sequence in the terminus region, near glnA. It was shown to bind RTP and to function in blocking replication fork movement in a polar manner. Its orientation conformed to the replication fork trap arrangement of the other terminators. The low-stringency hybridization experiments failed to identify any terminus region-type terminators in the region of the chromosome where postinitiation control sequences (STer sites) are known to reside. The two most likely terminators in STer site regions, in terms of sequence similarity to terminus region terminators, were identified through sequence searching. They were synthesized and were found not to bind RTP under conditions that allowed binding to terminus region terminators. Neither did they elicit fork arrest, when present in a plasmid, under stringent conditions. It is concluded that the STer site terminators, at least the first two to the left of oriC, do not have the typical consensus A+B site makeup of terminus region terminators.
