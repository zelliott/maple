Mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (Apc) have been implicated in the occurrence of sporadic colon cancer. Various Apc knockout strains of mice have been created to better understand the function of this gene. In the present study, using gene targeting, we disrupted the mouse Apc gene at the end of exon 10 to compare its effect with the effects of other types of Apc gene disruption, all of which are on exon 15. The mice expressed a mutant form of mRNA that encoded 474 amino acids instead of 2845 amino acids due to exon duplication. In addition, these Apc(Delta474) knockout mice developed intestinal and mammary tumors. Since the most severe cases of familial adenomatous polyposis are associated with mutations on exon 15, our mutation at exon 10 was expected to result in a mild phenotype. However, the number of polyps that our mice developed was similar to that of other Apc knockout mice such as Apc(Min) and Apc(1309) mice. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been implicated in colorectal carcinoma. Apc(Delta474) mice treated with JTE-522, a novel COX-2-selective inhibitor, showed a significantly reduced number of polyps. These results suggest that COX-2 plays an important role in polypogenesis and COX-2-selective inhibitors can be used as new preventive therapeutics against colorectal tumors.
