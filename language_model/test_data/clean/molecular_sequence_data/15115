Coronin cDNA was cloned from the plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA was comprised of 449 residues and showed 60% identity to that of Dictyostelium discoideum coronin. Southern blot analysis suggested that the coronin gene present in the P. polycephalum genome might be a single copy. Coronin was expressed in diploid plasmodia, while it was not detected in haploid amoebae or spores.
