A standard pig flow karyotype (2N = 38 chromosomes) was defined by standardization of several flow karyotypes obtained from stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes of normal male and female pigs. Depending on the animals under study, the flow analysis of their chromosome suspensions gave rise to bivariate flow karyotypes comprising from 15 to 17 peaks, of which 11 to 15 represented single chromosomes. The results were used to propose a peak nomenclature. In addition, a male miniature pig lymphoblastoid cell line was characterized by flow cytogenetics. A very high-resolution flow karyotype, in which all peaks but one superimposed on those of the standard karyotype, was obtained. Peaks were assigned for chromosomes X and Y. Analysis of flow karyotypes obtained from translocated t(3,7)(p1.3;q2.1) pigs combined with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-linked sequences on flow-sorted chromosomes allowed identification of peaks 3 and 7 of normal pig chromosomes and of the derivative chromosomes associated with the t(3,7)(p1.3;q2.1) translocation.
