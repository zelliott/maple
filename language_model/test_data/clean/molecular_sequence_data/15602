The interactions of viral coat protein (CP) and host factors play an important role in viral replication and/or host defense mechanism. In this study, we constructed Nicotiana benthamiana cDNA library to find host factors interacting with Potato virus X (PVX) CP. Using yeast two-hybrid assay, we screened 3.3 x 10(6) independent yeast transformants from N. benthamiana cDNA library and identified six positive clones. One positive clone, named PVX CP-interacting protein 1 (NbPCIP1), is a plant-specific protein with homologue in N. tabacum (GenBank accession no. AB04049). We confirmed the PVX CP-NbPCIP1 interaction using yeast-two hybrid assay in yeast, protein-protein binding assay in vitro, and bimolecular fluorescent complementation assay in planta. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA level of NbPCIP1 increased in PVX-infected N. benthamiana plants as compared to that of healthy plants. The green fluorescent protein (sGFP)-fused NbPCIP1 (NbPCIP1-sGFP) was localized in ER or ER-associated granular-like structure of cells. When we co-express NbPCIP1-sGFP and red fluorescent protein (RFP)-fused PVX CP (PVX CP-RFP), which were introduced by transiently expressing these proteins in N. benthamiana protoplasts and epidermal cells, however, we observed the co-localization of these proteins in the inclusion body-like complex in areas surrounding nucleus. Transient over-expression and transgene silencing of NbPCIP1 assay analysis indicated that NbPCIP1 plays a critical role in viral replication during PVX infection in host plant.
