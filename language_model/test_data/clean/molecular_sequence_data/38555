A fraction of saponins from Quillaja saponaria Molina, QH-B, was fractionated by consecutive separations on three different reverse-phase HPLC systems. Eight compounds were isolated and the structures of these were elucidated mainly by sugar analysis and NMR spectroscopy. The structures consisted of a quillaic acid substituted with two different trisaccharides at C-3, beta-D-Galp-(1-->2)-[alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->3)]-beta-D-GlcpA and beta-D-Galp-(1-->2)-[beta-D-Xylp-(1-->3)]-beta-D-GlcpA, and a tetra- or pentasaccharide at C-28, beta-D-Xylp-(1-->4)-[beta-D-Glcp-(1-->3)]-alpha-L-Rhap-(1--> 2)-beta-D-Fucp and beta-D-Apif-(1-->3)-beta-D-Xylp-(1-->4)-[beta-D-Glcp-(1-->3) ]-alpha-L- Rhap-(1-->2)-beta-D-Fucp. These compounds were further substituted with an acyl group either at O-3 or O-4 of the fucose residue, which is the sugar linked to C-28 of the quillaic acid.
