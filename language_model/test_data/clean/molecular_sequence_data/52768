We previously have shown that DNA demethylation by chicken embryo 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylase (5-MCDG) needs both RNA and proteins. One of these proteins is a RNA helicase. Further peptides were sequenced, and three of them are identical to the mammalian G/T mismatch DNA glycosylase. A 3,233-bp cDNA coding for the chicken homologue of human G/T mismatch DNA glycosylase was isolated and sequenced. The derived amino acid sequence (408 aa) shows 80% identity with the human G/T mismatch DNA glycosylase, and both the C and N-terminal parts have about 50% identity. As for the highly purified chicken embryo DNA demethylation complex the recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli has both G/T mismatch and 5-MCDG activities. The recombinant protein has the same substrate specificity as the chicken embryo 5-MCDG where hemimethylated DNA is a better substrate than symmetrically methylated CpGs. The activity ratio of G/T mismatch and 5-MCDG is about 30:1 for the recombinant protein expressed in E. coli and 3:1 for the purified enzyme from chicken embryos. The incubation of a recombinant CpG-rich RNA isolated from the purified DNA demethylation complex with the recombinant enzyme strongly inhibits G/T mismatch glycosylase while slightly stimulating the activity of 5-MCDG. Deletion mutations indicate that G/T mismatch and 5-MCDG activities share the same areas of the N- and C-terminal parts of the protein. In reconstitution experiments RNA helicase in the presence of recombinant RNA and ATP potentiates the activity of 5-MCDG.
