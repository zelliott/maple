The dysregulation of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) is implicated in a wide variety of disease states. Here we report the design, synthesis, and screening of a combinatorial peptide library used to characterize the substrate specificity of PRMT1. The information gained from this approach was used to develop a PRMT1 inhibitor with enhanced selectivity.
