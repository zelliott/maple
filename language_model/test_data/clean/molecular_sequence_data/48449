Calcineurin B, the regulatory subunit of calcineurin, a serine/threonine protein phosphatase, is highly conserved throughout the evolutionary scale including trypanosomatids such as Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania major. Thus, in these flagellates the protein is required for mammalian host cell invasion and virulence and stress responses. With the aim of determining the presence of calcineurin B in Trypanosoma rangeli, a non-virulent trypanosome for mammals, the respective gene was amplified by PCR, cloned and sequenced. Two sequences of 531 bp in length showing a nucleotide polymorphism (314A>C) were obtained in spite of a single-copy gene was revealed by Southern blot. These sequences, probably the alleles from the gene, showed a 79% of identity with those from T. cruzi and clustered as the sister group of this trypanosome species in a Maximum Parsimony analysis. Deduced amino acid sequence comparison with trypanosomatids and other organisms through the phylogenetic scale as well as the obtained protein structural homology model suggested the presence of the four potential EF-hand regions and the corresponding calcium binding sites of the last three of these domains. Having assessed the expression of this protein in T. rangeli epimastigotes, and taking into account the following facts: (i) calcineurin inhibitors have inhibitory effect on the in vitro replication of T. cruzi, (ii) L. major promastigote growth is inhibited by chelating agents, and (iii) T. rangeli does not seem to productively infect mammalian cells, it is hypothesized herein that the function of this protein in T. rangeli is required for epimastigote growth.
