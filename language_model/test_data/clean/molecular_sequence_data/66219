A Babesia isolate that was morphologically distinct from Babesia capreoli and very similar to B. divergens was found in the blood of a roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) found dead in central Italy. Sequences corresponding to the full coding region of the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene were identical to a sequence reported for Babesia divergens from a reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) and 99.9% and 99.8% similar to those reported for B. capreoli and bovine origin B. divergens, respectively.
