The lck gene encodes a lymphocyte-specific protein-tyrosine kinase that is implicated in neoplastic transformation. We have determined the germ line organization of the murine lck gene and have isolated and characterized a rearranged lck allele in the murine lymphoma cell line LSTRA. The overall exon-intron organization of the normal lck gene is almost identical to that of avian c-src. In LSTRA DNA, an internally rearranged Moloney murine leukemia virus genome is interposed between two distinct promoters that normally generate lck transcripts differing only in 5' untranslated regions. The rearrangement appears to have been selected to permit splicing of transcripts that initiate from the Moloney virus promoter to an acceptor site located within the first exon 3' to the downstream promoter, thus generating an lck mRNA with a novel 5' untranslated region that may be more efficiently translated.
