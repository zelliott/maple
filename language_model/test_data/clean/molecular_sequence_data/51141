Six neutral glycosphingolipids (GL-1-GL-6) were obtained from eggs of the sea hare (Aplysia juliana) and were characterized by FABMS, 1H-NMR, partial acid hydrolysis, methylation studies and GC analysis of the component sugars, fatty acids and long-chain bases. The following structures were determined to be Glc beta 1-1Cer (89%) and Gal beta 1-1Cer (11%) for GL-1, Glc beta 1-1Cer (47%) and Gal beta 1-1Cer (53%) for GL-2 having hydroxy fatty acids in the ceramide moiety, Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer for GL-3, Fuc alpha 1-2Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer for GL-4, Gal alpha 1-2Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer for GL-5 and GalNAc alpha 1-3(Gal alpha 1-2)Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer for GL-6. The fatty acid composition of each glycosphingolipid, except for GL-2, which contained 2-hydroxypalmitic acid, consisted of mostly saturated C16-C20 acids, especially palmitic acid and stearic acid. The long-chain bases of all glycosphingolipids consisted mainly of branched nonadeca-4-sphingenine and octadeca-4-sphingenine. GL-6, which was one of the major glycosphingolipids, may be a precursor of a series of phosphonoglycosphingolipids which have been isolated from the skin of A. kurodai.
