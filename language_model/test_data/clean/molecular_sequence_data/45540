We have identified a GM2-activator protein (GM2AP) with highly unusual properties secreted by the nematode parasite Trichinella spiralis. Expression in Pichia pastoris resulted in a hyperglycosylated protein of 28 kDa, but the 18 kDa native protein was not glycosylated. The parasite GM2AP does not facilitate degradation of GM2 ganglioside by N-acetyl-beta-hexosaminidase A, although it does inhibit phospholipase D activity. Lack of the former activity might be explained by the absence of a domain implicated in binding to hexosaminidase. In addition, and contrary to data on the human GM2AP, the nematode homologue does not inhibit platelet activating factor-induced calcium mobilisation in neutrophils, but actually enhances mediator-induced chemotaxis.
