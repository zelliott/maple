A Staphylococcus warneri strain M, newly isolated from processed seafood (smoked Watasenia scintillans), produced an extracellular protease. The protease, designated to as m-PROM (the mature form of PROM), selectively cleaved the carbonyl side of glutamic acid residues in beta-casein. Sequence of N-terminal 27 amino acids of m-PROM, RANVILPNNDRHQINDTTLGHYAPVTF, was found to be similar to those of other glutamyl endopeptidases, V8 protease (Staphylococcus aureus strain V8) and SPase (S. aureus ATCC 12600). To determine the complete primary structure and precursor of PROM, its gene (proM) was cloned and sequenced. The gene proM was found to encode for a protein of 316 amino acids. The amino acid residues from 64 to 90 completely coincided with the N-terminal 27 amino acids of the m-PROM, suggesting that the N-terminal 63 amino acids region of p-PROM (the precursor form of PROM) might be processed posttranslationally. Moreover, the whole amino acid sequence deduced from the primary structure of proM shows significant similarity to those of other glutamyl endopeptidases, V8 protease and SPase. These results suggested that PROM belongs to the glutamyl endopeptidase class. PROM, however, differs from V8 and SPase proteases in the processing site and the C-terminal region.
