We have isolated two sheep IGF-II clones which have the same coding regions but have different 5'-untranslated regions. There is no homology between these 5'-UTR sequences which are homologous to exons 5 and 6 of the human IGFII gene. In humans these exons are transcribed only during fetal development, but in the sheep these transcripts were detected up to 28 weeks after parturition. The sizes of the sheep IGF-II mRNA transcripts are the same as those observed for the human gene, suggesting structural and transcriptional similarity between the human and sheep IGF-II genes. The sheep could therefore be a good model system in which to study IGF-II expression.
