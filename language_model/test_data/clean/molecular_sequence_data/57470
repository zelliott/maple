The W locus of mice encodes the c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase. Heterozygous WJic/+ and Wn/+ mice and homozygous Wf/Wf mice were similar in appearance; all of them have large depigmented areas lacking any well-defined pattern. The WJic, Wn, and Wf mutant alleles were characterized and their molecular nature was correlated with the mast cell differentiation in the skin and the biologic features of cultured mast cell (CMC). All WJic, Wn, and Wf were point mutations at the tyrosine kinase domain, and c-kit mRNA was normally transcribed from all of them. The mature 145-Kd form of the c-kit protein was produced from the WJic and Wf alleles, but not from the Wn allele. c-kit proteins produced by the WJic or Wf allele were expressed on the surface of CMCs, but those of the Wn allele were not. When double heterozygous mice were produced between W and WJic and between W and Wn, both W/WJic and W/Wn mice lacked skin mast cells. W/WJic CMCs and W/Wn CMCs did not survive in the coculture with fibroblasts. W/WJic CMCs normally attached to fibroblasts, but W/Wn CMCs did not. The defect of W/Wn CMCs in the attachment was attributed to the deficient extracellular expression of the c-kit protein. The number of skin mast cells was compared among WJic/+, Wn/+, Wf/+, and Wf/Wf mice. Mast cells decreased in WJic/+ and Wf/Wf mice, but not in Wn/+ and Wf/+ mice. Although the Wn was a point mutation at the kinase domain, the biologic effect of the Wn was comparable with that of the W mutant allele, which produces truncated c-kit protein without the transmembrane domain. The weak phenotype of Wn/+ mice may be explained by the deficient extracellular expression of c-kit proteins produced by the Wn allele. When WJic/WJic, Wn/Wn, and Wf/Wf CMCs were stimulated by the recombinant c-kit ligand, autophosphorylation activity was observed only in Wf/Wf CMCs. This result was consistent with the weak biologic effect of the Wf mutant allele.
