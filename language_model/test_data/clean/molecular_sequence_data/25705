A family of mutants of the P22 bacteriophage tailspike protein has been characterized as temperature sensitive for folding (tsf) by King and co-workers [King, J. (1986) Bio/Technology 4, 297-303]. There is substantial evidence that the tsf mutations alter the folding pathway but not the stability of the final folded protein. Several point mutations are known to cause the tsf phenotype; most of these occur in regions of the tailspike sequence likely to take up reverse turns. Hence, it has been hypothesized that the correct folding of the P22 tailspike protein requires formation of turns and that the mutations causing tsf phenotypes interfere at this critical stage. We have tested this hypothesis by study of isolated peptides corresponding to a region of the P22 tailspike harboring a tsf mutation. Comparison of the tendencies of wild-type and tsf sequences to adopt turn conformations was achieved by the synthesis of peptides with flanking cysteine residues and the use of a thiol-disulfide exchange assay. We find that the wild-type sequence, either as a decapeptide (Ac-CVKFPGIETC-CONH2) or as a dodecapeptide (Ac-CYVKFPGIETLC-CONH2), has a 3-5-fold greater tendency for its termini to approach closely enough to form the intramolecular disulfide than do the peptide sequences corresponding to the tsf mutant sequences, which have a Gly----Arg substitution (Ac-CVKFPRIETC-CONH2 or Ac-CYVKFPRIETLC-CONH2). A peptide with a D-Arg substituted for the Gly has a slightly higher turn propensity than does the wild type. Together with data from nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the oxidized peptides, this suggests that a type II beta turn is favored by the wild-type sequence. Our results on isolated peptides from the P22 tailspike protein support the model for its folding that includes reverse turn formation as a critical step.
