A 97-kDa protein present in the glucose transporter (GLUT4 isotype)-containing vesicles from rat adipocytes has been isolated, the sequences of two tryptic peptides were obtained, and on the basis of these its cDNA partially cloned. The 97-kDa protein is almost certainly identical to a major integral glycoprotein of this size in the rat adipocyte plasma membrane, since its predicted N-terminal sequence is the same as that recently determined for this glycoprotein by amino acid sequencing. Moreover, the predicted partial sequence (322 amino acids) of the 97-kDa protein is highly homologous to the corresponding region of a human placental amine oxidase, which was cloned simultaneously and proposed to be a secreted protein. The amino acid sequence of the 97-kDa rat/human amine oxidase indicates that the protein consists of a very short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain followed by a single transmembrane segment and a large extracellular domain containing the catalytic site. Thus this study establishes the 97-kDa rat/human amine oxidase as the first integral membrane amine oxidase to be cloned. The membrane amine oxidase was more abundant in the plasma membranes than the low density microsomes of the adipocyte, and in contrast to some other proteins found in GLUT4 vesicles, it did not redistribute to the plasma membrane in response to treatment of the cells with insulin.
