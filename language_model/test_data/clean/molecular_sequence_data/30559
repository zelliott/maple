By using a radioimmunoassay for neuromedin N (NMN), a hexapeptide in the neurotensin (NT) family, extracts of canine small intestine were found to contain primarily (greater than 75%) large molecular form(s) of NMN, whereas the predominant species in brain was NMN itself. Large NMN was highly basic (pI greater than 9) and during sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis gave two components of approximately 17 kDa (75%) and approximately 8 kDa (25%). Large NMN, like NT, was localized primarily to the mucosal layer of the jejunoileum. It was also present in highly purified (25% pure) mucosal N-cells, where it appeared to be concentrated within dense secretory vesicles. The amino acid sequence of a 21-amino acid fragment cleaved from the C-terminal region of large NMN was identical to residues 128-148 of the canine NT/NMN precursor predicted from cDNA work. These results suggest that tissue-specific processing of the NT/NMN precursor occurs in the dog, giving rise to NMN in brain and large NMN in small intestine.
