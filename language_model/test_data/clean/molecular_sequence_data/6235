Initiation factor eIF2 binds GTP and promotes the binding of methionyl-tRNA to ribosomes. Biochemical and sequence evidence suggests that the GTP might bind to either the beta- or gamma-subunit of eIF2. Mutations were made in the NKXD consensus elements found in both subunits and individual mutant forms were overexpressed in transiently transfected COS-1 cells. The effect on the translational efficiency of a reporter mRNA for dihydrofolate reductase was monitored. Mutations in the gamma-subunit cause severe repression of protein synthesis, whereas those in the beta-subunit are only mildly inhibitory. The results support the view that GTP binds exclusively to the gamma-subunit.
