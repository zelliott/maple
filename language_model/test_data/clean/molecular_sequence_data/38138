A total of 343 HIV-1-positive samples obtained between June 1996 and March 1999 was genetically characterized in the envelope region by HMA and/or sequencing. The env subtype distribution was as follows: 290 (84.6%) A, 22 (6.5%) B, 16 (4.7%) C, 8 (2.5%) D, 1 (0.03%) E, 1 (0.03%) F1, 4 (1.2%) G, and 1 (0.03%) H. For 77 samples the p24 region from the gag gene was also sequenced, and for 9 (11.6%) the subtypes between env and gag were different. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed the predominance of AG-IBNG-like viruses among gag and env subtype A sequences. HMA is relatively simple and requires less sophisticated technical facilities compared with sequencing, and in Senegal 323 (94.2%) of the 343 samples could be identified by this technique. However, in the actual configuration of the assay, discrimination between the recombinant AG-IBNG-like recombinant viruses, which are predominant in Senegal, and the nonrecombinant subtype A viruses is not possible.
