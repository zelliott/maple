Three major causative genes have been implicated as the cause of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD): the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1) and PSEN2. Although rare, a tau-related dementia with mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau gene (MAPT) has been identified in patients showing clinical presentations similar to those of AD.

We performed mutational analysis of APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, and MAPT in 10 Japanese families with early-onset dementia clinically diagnosed as probable Alzheimer's disease.

In 4 index patients, we identified 4 missense PSEN1 mutations, namely, L286V, G378E, L381V, and L392V. The mean age at onset in the patients with PSEN1 mutations was 39 years. In 2 families, we found the R406W mutation in MAPT. The mean age at onset of the patients carrying the R406W mutation was 52 years, and they presented with the peculiar AD-like phenotype without apparent behavioral or language problems.

These observations suggest that although PSEN1 mutations are the most frequent cause, the MAPT R406W mutation is an important cause of early-onset familial dementia clinically diagnosed as AD. Differentiation of patients with the MAPT mutation from AD patients by genetic testing would be meaningful, considering that a different therapeutic approach should be applied.
