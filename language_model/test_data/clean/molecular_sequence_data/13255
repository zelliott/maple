Translational silencing phenomena during spermatogenesis in the two model systems Drosophila and mouse are reviewed. Cis-acting sequences were identified in both species that are necessary for translational repression. While in Drosophila these elements so far have only been found in the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR), in the mammals such regions were identified both in the 5' as well as in the 3' UTR. In all cases, RNA-binding proteins interact with these regions, yet their specific role in the observed negative regulation of translation has to be established.
