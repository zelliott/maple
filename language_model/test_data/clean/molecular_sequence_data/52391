We have cloned and sequenced the gene for the 180 kDa subunit of the a polymerase from Drosophila melanogaster. The protein shows high similarity to the 180 kDa subunits from other species. Comparative expression analysis for the transcript, protein and enzymic activity suggests that control occurs mainly at the level of transcription. In situ analyses of the RNA suggest that high levels of the transcript are synthesised in the ovaries and deposited uniformly in the egg. Immunolocalisation of the 180 kDa polypeptide in whole embryos shows that its location is mainly nuclear; however, dispersal of the protein can be seen to occur during mitotic phases of the cell cycle.
