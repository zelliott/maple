The ADAR family of RNA-editing enzymes deaminates adenosines within RNA that is completely or largely double stranded. In mammals, most of the characterized substrates encode receptors involved in neurotransmission, and these substrates are thought to be targeted by the mammalian enzymes ADAR1 and ADAR2. Although some ADAR substrates are deaminated very promiscuously, mammalian glutamate receptor B (gluR-B) pre-mRNA is deaminated at a few specific adenosines. Like most double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding proteins, ADARs bind to many different sequences, but few studies have directly measured and compared binding affinities. We have attempted to determine if ADAR deamination specificity occurs because the enzymes bind to targeted regions with higher affinities. To explore this question we studied binding of rat ADAR2 to a region of rat gluR-B pre-mRNA that contains the R/G editing site, and compared a wild-type molecule with one containing mutations that decreased R/G site editing. Although binding affinity to the two sequences was almost identical, footprinting studies indicate ADAR2 binds to the wild-type RNA at a discrete region surrounding the editing site, whereas binding to the mutant appeared nonspecific.
