The association between melatonin system and the spontaneous development of the spinal deformities in the Hereditary Lordoscoliotic Rabbit, the natural animal model for idiopathic scoliosis, was studied.

To examine the implication for melatonin and its receptor in the spinal deformities of the natural animal model, the Hereditary Lordoscoliotic Rabbit.

We previously reported radiologic and histologic studies investigating the etiology of spinal deformities in a breed of Japanese White Rabbit, the Hereditary Lordoscoliotic Rabbit. These animals develop thoracic lordoscoliosis during growth and as such can be used as a model for human idiopathic scoliosis. Although previous studies in chickens have established that pinealectomy produces scoliosis, the cause of the condition is yet to be fully elucidated.

Serum melatonin levels in Hereditary Lordoscoliotic Rabbits were measured by radioimmunoassay and compared with those of Japanese White Rabbits (controls). The expression of melatonin receptor in the rabbit was detected by homology cloning to access the number of the melatonin receptor mRNA in the rabbit spinal cord by quantitative reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction.

Serum melatonin levels in Hereditary Lordoscoliotic Rabbits were significant higher than those of controls in each period until 20 weeks. We detected the expression of melatonin receptor mRNA in rabbit spinal cord. However, no significant quantitative differences were found in the level of expression of melatonin mRNA in the spinal cord between Hereditary Lordoscoliotic Rabbits and controls.

In relation to the present study, we suggest that causes of spinal deformities in the Hereditary Lordoscoliotic Rabbit may be the result of the contribution of melatonin receptors as well as that of altered serum melatonin levels in the Hereditary Lordoscoliotic Rabbit. Further studies will be required to investigate the expression of melatonin receptor in other tissues of the Hereditary Lordoscoliotic Rabbit as well as to delineate the role of melatonin in the pathogenesis of idiopathic scoliosis.
