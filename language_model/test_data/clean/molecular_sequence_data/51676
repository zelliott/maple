It has been found that staphylococcal enterotoxin B contains a proteolysis-sensitive sequence in the cysteine loop formed by two half-cystines located in the middle of the toxin polypeptide chain. Fragments of the enterotoxin formed as a result of its digestion in this region have been isolated, their N-terminal sequences have been determined and sites of proteolysis have been identified. It has been demonstrated that the N-terminal fragment of staphylococcal enterotoxin B is capable of activating T cell proliferation in the culture of human mononuclear cells practically to the same degree as the intact enterotoxin. The toxin's C-terminal fragment possesses an ability to activate calmodulin-dependent enzymes and is probably the toxicogenic part of the enterotoxin.
