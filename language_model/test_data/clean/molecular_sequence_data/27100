Caspase-like proteases have been demonstrated to be involved in plant programmed cell death (PCD). Here, the time scale of caspase-3-like protease activation was investigated in single living plant cells undergoing PCD induced by ultraviolet C (UV-C) overexposure. The real-time detection of caspase-3-like protease activation was achieved by measuring the degree of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) within a recombinant substrate containing enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) linked by a peptide possessing the caspase-3 cleavage sequence, DEVD, to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP; i.e. ECFP-DEVD-EYFP). Microscopic observations demonstrated that the ECFP-DEVD-EYFP fusion protein could be expressed correctly and the FRET from ECFP to EYFP could be found in transfected Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) protoplasts. At 30 min after exposure to UV-C, caspase-3-like protease activation indicated by the decrease in FRET ratio occurred, taking about 1 h to reach completion in single living protoplasts. Mutation in the DEVD tag or a caspase-3 inhibitor could prevent the changes in FRET ratio induced by UV-C treatment, confirming that the decrease in FRET ratio was due to the cleavage of fusion protein as a result of caspase-3-like protease activation. This activation was further confirmed by in vitro caspase-3 substrate assay and western-blot analysis, showing the occurrence of cleavage in ECFP-DEVD-EYFP protein but not in the protein with a mutant DEVD tag. In summary, these results represent direct evidence for the activation of caspase-3-like protease in UV-C-induced PCD, and the FRET technique is a powerful tool for monitoring key events of PCD in living cells in real time.
