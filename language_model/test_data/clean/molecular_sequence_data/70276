Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies were carried out for the title compounds at room temperature. The crystal packings are of the cage-type and isomorphous to that of beta-cyclodextrin (beta CD) hydrate. In both crystal structures, disorder and extensive thermal vibrations of the complexed guest molecules are observed. In beta CD-ethylene glycol.8H2O, one ethylene glycol molecule (disordered over two discrete sites) and three water molecules (four discrete sites) are included in the beta CD cavity. Within the beta CD cavity, all oxygen sites (ordered and disordered) are in positions occupied by water molecules in beta CD.12H2O; this is only possible because the ethylene glycol molecule adopts the low-energy conformation with the O-C-C-O torsion angle approximately 60 degrees and an O...O separation of 2.9 A, in which its hydroxyl groups can directly substitute for two hydrogen-bonding water molecules. In beta CD-glycerol.7.2H2O, one glycerol molecule (disordered over two discrete sites) and two water molecules (two fully occupied sites) are included in the beta CD cavity. The general situation in both compounds parallels that found earlier in beta CD-ethanol.8H2O. It is assumed that the disorder is dynamic, i.e., associated with jumps between the partially occupied molecular sites.
