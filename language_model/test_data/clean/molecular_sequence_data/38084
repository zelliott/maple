The insect diuretic hormone (DH) binds to their receptor in malpighian tubules, and stimulates water secretion and cAMP synthesis. Complementary DNA encoding a diuretic hormone receptor was cloned from the malpighian tubules of Bombyx mori. The cloned cDNA encodes a protein consisting of 391 amino acid residues with the seven transmembrane domains. The receptor protein is homologous with that of other insects, and is structurally related to G-protein coupled receptors such as corticotropin relating factor (CRF), secretin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide.
