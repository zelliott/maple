Rat brain inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) 3-kinase A was expressed in Escherichia coli in order to identify the amino acid residues involved in substrate ATP/Mg2+ binding. Two amino acid regions that are conserved in the catalytic domain of InsP3 3-kinase isoenzymes A and B had characteristics consistent with two ATP/Mg(2+)-binding motives. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on residues Lys-197, Lys-207 and Asp-414 to generate three mutant enzymes, referred to as C5 K197I, C5 K207I and C5 D414N. Comparison of the wild-type and mutant proteins with regard to enzymic activity revealed that C5 K197I exhibited 10% of control enzyme activity, C5 D414N was totally inactive and C5 K207I was fully active. The reduced levels of enzyme activity for C5 K197I and C5 D414N were correlated with an altered ability of the mutant enzymes to bind ATP/Mg2+, as determined by ATP-agarose affinity chromatography. Neither Ca2+/calmodulin binding nor InsP3 binding appeared to be affected. Mutant C5 K207I showed the same characteristics as the wild-type enzyme. Taken together, these results strongly indicated (i) that amino acid residues Lys-197 and Asp-414 are necessary for InsP3 3-kinase activity and form part of the ATP/Mg(2+)-binding domain, and (ii) that amino acid residues Lys-197, Lys-207 and Asp-414 are not involved in either InsP3 binding or enzyme stimulation by Ca2+/calmodulin.
