Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) has been implicated as an agent of pediatric diarrhea in the developing world. We have shown previously that EAEC adheres to HEp-2 cells by virtue of a plasmid-encoded fimbrial adhesin designated aggregative adherence fimbria I (AAF/I), the genes for which have been cloned and sequenced. However, not all EAEC strains express AAF/I. Using TnphoA mutagenesis, we have characterized a novel fimbria (designated AAF/II) which mediates HEp-2 adherence of the human-pathogenic strain 042. AAF/II is 5 nm in diameter and does not bind AAF/I antiserum, as determined by immunogold transmission electron microscopy. TnphoA identified a gene (designated aafA) which bears significant homology to aggA, the fimbrial subunit of AAF/I (25% identity and 47% similarity at the amino acid level). When hyperexpressed and purified by polyhistidine tagging, the AafA protein assembled into 5-nm-diameter filaments which bound anti-AAF/II antiserum. The cloned aafA gene complemented a mutation in the aggA gene to confer fimbrial expression from the AAF/I gene cluster, manifesting phenotypes characteristic of AAF/II but not AAF/I. The aafA mutant did not adhere to human intestinal tissue in culture, suggesting a role for AAF/II in intestinal colonization. By using DNA probes for AAF/I and AAF/II derived from fimbrial biosynthesis genes, we show that AAF/I and AAF/II are each found in only a minority of EAEC strains, suggesting that still more EAEC adhesins exist. Our data suggest that AAF adhesins represent a new family of fimbrial adhesins which mediate aggregative adherence in EAEC.
