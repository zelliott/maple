In Escherichia coli, osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (OPGs) are highly substituted by phosphoglycerol, phosphoethanolamine and succinyl residues. A two-step model was proposed to account for phosphoglycerol substitution: first, the membrane-bound phosphoglycerol transferase I transfers residues from membrane phosphatidylglycerol to nascent OPG molecules; second, the periplasmic phosphoglycerol transferase II swaps residues from one OPG molecule to another. Gene opgB was reported to encode phosphoglycerol transferase I. In this study, we demonstrate that the periplasmic enzyme II is a soluble form of the membrane-bound enzyme I. In addition, timing of OPG substitution was investigated. OPG substitution by succinyl residues occurs rapidly, probably during the backbone polymerization, whereas phosphoglycerol addition is a very progressive process. Thus, both phosphoglycerol transferase activities appear biologically necessary for complete OPG substitution.
