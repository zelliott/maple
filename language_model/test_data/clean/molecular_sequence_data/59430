We have isolated a chalcone synthase gene 2 (ST-CHS2) from potato by rapid amplification of cDNA ends by PCR. CHS2 cDNA had high homology to tomato LET-CHS2 (98%), petunia PHCHSJ (94%), potato ST-CHS1B (92%), petunia PHCHSA (92%), and LET-CHS1 (90%) at the overall 389-amino acid level. Genomic hybridization analysis indicated that CHS genes of potato comprise a family of at least six individual members.
