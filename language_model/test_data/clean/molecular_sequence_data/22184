Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is an inherited, intrinsic platelet defect characterized by a quantitative or qualitative change in the platelet glycoprotein complex IIb-IIIa (integrin alpha(IIb)beta3). The subunits are encoded by separate genes and both subunits must be expressed for a stable complex to form on the platelet surface; therefore, a defect in either gene can result in GT.
