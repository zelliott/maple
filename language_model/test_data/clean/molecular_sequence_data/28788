To study the changes in gene expression in senescent cells we applied the suppression subtractive hybridization of two cDNA pools isolated from human parenchymal kidney cells in the phase of exponential growth and cellular senescence in vitro. In addition to several genes known to be associated with cellular senescence, we identified a new gene, which is overexpressed in senescent kidney parenchymal cells. The full-length cDNA consists of 5226 nucleotides with an open reading frame (ORF) encoding 701 amino acids (Accession number: AJ306929). The gene product has a predicted molecular mass of 77.31 kDa. The ORF of the new gene shows significant homology to P-type ATPase family gene products and therefore was called AFURS1 (ATPase family homolog up-regulated in senescence cells). The consensus sequence phosphorylation site (DKTGTLT) is highly conserved. According to the GenBank database AFURS1 is mapped to the sequence segment NT_005535.3 at chromosomal region 3q26.32 and has 18 exons. The AFURS1 gene might have a role in cellular aging and tumor suppression as well.
