It has become increasingly clear that mRNA stability is an important determinant of mRNA abundance in virtually all organisms. Although our understanding of prokaryotic lower eukaryotic mRNA stability mechanisms has progressed considerably, little is known about mammalian mRNA stability mechanisms, particularly at the tissue and animal levels. This is due largely to the lack of suitable methods to approach the problem. In this study, we have developed and refined the 3'-end poly(A)-tailing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to detect degradation intermediates in vivo. Using an in vitro transcribed RNA as a template, we found that the method could be used to detect a homogeneous pool of RNA down to 0.1 ng. The addition of 10 microg of total RNA from tissues decreased the sensitivity limit to 4 ng. Detection limits of the technique were determined precisely by varying the concentrations of in vitro transcribed RNA in a constant amount of total RNA and varying the concentration of total RNA while maintaining a constant amount of in vitro transcribed RNA. Our overall results showed that the poly(A)-tailing PCR method could be used to detect specific RNA species of approximately 1000 nt in a pool of heterogeneous RNA in the range of 1 in 2500 to 1 in 10,000. To our knowledge, this is the most sensitive method to date for identifying mRNA degradation intermediates. Employing sense strand gene-specific primers in this method, we have discovered the class II and class III P-glycoprotein (Pgp) mRNA degradation intermediates in normal rat tissues. This method should serve as an additional tool to help us understand mRNA decay mechanisms in tissues and at animal levels.
