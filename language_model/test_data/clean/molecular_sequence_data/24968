Analyzing the Radiation of the Proenkephalin Gene in Tetrapods: Cloning of a Bombina orientalis Proenkephalin cDNA: A proenkephalin cDNA was cloned from the brain of the anuran amphibian, Bombina orientalis (Family: Discoglossidae). This cDNA is 1358 nucleotides in length, and contains an open reading frame that codes for 251 amino acids. Within the open reading frame there are seven opioid (YGGF) sequences. There were five Met-enkephalin (YGGFM) sequences that are flanked by sets of paired basic amino acid proteolytic cleavage sites and two C-terminally extended Met-enkephalin sequences: YGGFMRGY and YGGFMRF. No Leu-enkephalin sequences were found in B. orientalis proenkephalin. It was possible to align the amino acid sequences of proenkephalin from several vertebrate taxa (human, Australian lungfish, B. orientalis, Xenopus laevis, Spea multiplicatus) by inserting a minimum of nine gaps. This alignment was then used to analyze the corresponding nucleotides for each proenkephalin sequence using maximum likelihood. This analysis yielded a single tree. In this tree, the Australian lungfish sequence was the outgroup or the tetrapod ingroup. The amphibian sequences form a clade separate from the human sequence. The bootstrap value for the amphibian clade was 100%. Within the amphibian clade the Bombina sequence was the sister group to a clade composed of the X. laevis and S. multiplicatus sequences. The bootstrap value for the X. laevis/S. multiplicatus clade was 94%. Collectively, these data indicate that the sequence of Bombina proenkephalin may be more similar to the proposed ancestral anuran proenkephalin sequence, than either X. laevis or S. multiplicatus proenkephalin.
