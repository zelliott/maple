Olfactomedin (OLF) domain proteins maintain extracellular protein-protein interactions in diverse phyla. Only one OLF family member, amassin-1, has been described from the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, a basal invertebrate deuterostome. Amassin-1 mediates intercellular adhesion of coelomocytes (immunocytes). Here we describe the protein structural features of four additional OLF proteins, the total for the genome being five. Phylogenetically, four of these proteins (the amassins) form a subgroup among previously identified OLF proteins. The fifth OLF protein is within the colmedin subfamily and contains a type II transmembrane domain, collagen repeats, and an OLF domain. Sea urchin OLF proteins represent an intermediate diversification between protostomes and vertebrates. Transcripts of all five OLF family members are in coelomocytes and adult radial nerve tissue. Transcripts for some OLF proteins increase during late larval stages. Transcript levels for amassin-1 increase 1,000,000-fold, coinciding with formation of the adult urchin rudiment within the larval body.
