We describe a simple and efficient method of mutagenesis which we term the "megaprimer" method. The method utilizes three oligonucleotide primers to perform two rounds of polymerase chain reaction. In the method, the product of the first polymerase chain reaction is used as one of the polymerase chain reaction primers (a "megaprimer") for the second polymerase chain reaction. When a phage promoter and a translational initiation signal are attached to the appropriate oligonucleotide primer, the mutant protein can be generated without any in vivo manipulations. To illustrate the method, two mutations in the catalytic domain of the human factor IX gene have been generated. The substitution of megaprimers for oligonucleotide primers may have utility in other polymerase chain reaction-based methods.
