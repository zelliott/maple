A Gram-staining positive, endospore-forming, motile and rod-shaped bacterial strain, BR-29(T), was isolated from soil from west coast of the Korean peninsula, and its taxonomic position was investigated by a polyphasic study. Strain BR-29(T) grew optimally at around pH 7.5, at 30°C and in the presence of 0.5% (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain BR-29(T) fell into a clade comprising the type strains of Cohnella species, with which it exhibited 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of 92.8-96.4%. Strain BR-29(T) contained a cell wall peptidoglycan based on meso-diaminopimelic acid and MK-7 as the predominant menaquinone. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C(15:0), C(16:0) and iso-C(16:0). The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, lysylphosphatidylglycerol and two unidentified phospholipids; a minor amount of phosphatidylglycerol was present. The DNA G+C content was 54.9 mol%. Strain BR-29(T) could be differentiated from phylogenetically related Cohnella species by differences in phenotypic characteristics. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data, strain BR-29(T) represents a novel species of the genus Cohnella, for which the name Cohnella                         boryungensis sp. nov., is proposed. The type strain is BR-29(T) (= KCTC 13735(T) = CCUG 59598(T)).
