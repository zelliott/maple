We developed a sequence-ready physical map of a part of human chromosome 12p12.3-p13.2 where the natural killer gene complex (NKC) is located. The NKC includes a cluster of genes with structure similar to that of the Ca(2+)-dependent lectin superfamily of glycoproteins that are expressed on the surface of most natural killer (NK) cells and a subset of T cells. These killer cell lectin-like receptors (KLR) are involved in NK target cell recognition, leading to activation or inhibition of NK cell function. We used a number of sequence-tagged site (STS) markers from this region to screen two large insert bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries and a bacteriophage P1-derived (PAC) chromosome library. The clones were assembled into contiguous sets by STS content analysis. The 72-BAC and 11-PAC contig covers nearly 2 Mb of DNA and provides an average marker resolution of 26 kb. We have precisely localized 17 genes, 5 expressed sequence tags, and 49 STSs within this contig. Of this total number of STS, 30 are newly developed by clone-end sequencing. We established the order of the genes as tel-M6PR-MAFAL (HGMW-approved symbol KLRG1)-A2M-PZP-A2MP-NKRP1A (HGMW-approved symbol KLRB1)-CD69-AICL (HGMW-approved symbol CLECSF2)-KLRF1-OLR1-CD94 (HGMW-approved symbol KLRD1)-NKG2D (HGMW-approved symbol D12S2489E)-PGFL-NKG2F (HGMW-approved symbol KLRC4)-NKG2E (HGMW-approved symbol KLRC3)-NKG2A (HGMW-approved symbol KLRC1)-LY49L (HGMW-approved symbol KLRA1)-cen. This map would facilitate the cloning of new KLR genes and the complete sequencing of this region.
