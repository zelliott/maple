Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) is a neural cell adhesion molecule expressing the L2/HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope. MAG is heavily glycosylated containing 30% carbohydrate by weight. In this study, human MAG glycopeptides were isolated and sequenced. Of the 9 MAG sequons 7 were glycosylated and 1 was partially glycosylated at Asn106. Asn332 which was not recovered in the glycopeptide fractions was probably not glycosylated. Furthermore, preliminary data indicate that all MAG glycosylated sequons might bear the L2/HNK-1 epitope.
