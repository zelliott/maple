Antibodies specific for the 80-amino acid hypothetical protein encoded by the in-frame, 3'-extension of a human ubiquitin gene were produced in rabbits by immunization with a 14-residue synthetic peptide. When used to probe HeLa cell extracts for the non-ubiquitin product of this natural fusion gene, the antipeptide sera detected a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 16,000 Da by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. An immunoreactive protein of identical mobility was detected in organisms ranging from Acanthamoeba to man, indicating that the extension protein, like ubiquitin, is highly conserved. The immunoreactive protein was isolated from calf thymus, and direct sequencing revealed the first 16 amino acids to be identical to those predicted from the extension portion of the human cDNA. Thus, ubiquitin was no longer present at the amino terminus. The purified bovine extension protein failed to react with a ubiquitin-specific antibody indicating the absence of isopeptide-linked ubiquitin as well. Moreover, by denaturing gel permeation chromatography the extension has a molecular weight of 10,000 Da, a value that corresponds more closely to the size of the extension alone (9,000 Da) than to the intact fusion protein (17,500 Da). The extension protein, which was found in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of HeLa cells, persisted at high levels when protein synthesis was blocked with cycloheximide or puromycin. These results show that the 80-residue extension protein is the stable, processed product of the ubiquitin fusion gene.
