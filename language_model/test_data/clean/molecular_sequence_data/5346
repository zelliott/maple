The opportunistic pathogen Pneumocystis carinii (PC) is a frequent cause of a life-threatening pneumonia in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals and in other immunocompromised hosts. Specimens obtained from 128 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples from 123 HIV-positive patients with pulmonary disease and undergoing a diagnostic bronchoscopy were evaluated to detect this organism. We have developed a rapid DNA extraction procedure for nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using two sets of primers (pAZ102-E, pAZ102-H and P1 = 5'-CTAGGATATAGCTGGTTTTC-3' and P2 = 5'-TCGACTATCTAGCTTATCGC-3'). The results were compared using cytological techniques (direct wet mount, Giemsa, toluidine blue O) and related to the clinical follow-up of patients. The nested PCR had a 91% sensitivity and a 93% specificity. The effect of chemoprophylaxis and the evaluation of the follow-up of patients are discussed. Nested PCR may represent an important additional tool, along with current cytological methods, for the detection of P. carinii; however, at present it cannot replace routine microbiological methods more simple and less expensive.
