Voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) are generally considered as the main pathway for metabolite transport across the mitochondrial outer membrane. Recent proteomic studies on isolated symbiosome membranes from legume nodules indicated that VDACs might also be involved in transport of nutrients between plants and rhizobia. In an attempt to substantiate this, we carried out a detailed molecular and cellular characterization of VDACs in Lotus japonicus and soybean (Glycine max). Database searches revealed at least five genes encoding putative VDACs in each of the legumes L. japonicus, Medicago truncatula, and soybean. We obtained and sequenced cDNA clones from L. japonicus encoding five full-length VDAC proteins (LjVDAC1.1-1.3, LjVDAC2.1, and LjVDAC3.1). Complementation of a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutant impaired in VDAC1, a porin of the mitochondrial outer membrane, showed that LjVDAC1.1, LjVDAC1.2, LjVDAC2.1, and LjVDAC3.1, but not LjVDAC1.3, are functional and targeted to the mitochondrial outer membrane in yeast. Studies of the expression pattern of the five L. japonicus VDAC genes revealed largely constitutive expression of each throughout the plant, including nodules. Antibodies to LjVDAC1.1 of L. japonicus and the related POM36 protein of potato (Solanum tuberosum) recognized several proteins between 30 and 36 kD on western blots, including LjVDAC1.1, LjVDAC1.2, LjVDAC1.3, and LjVDAC2.1. Immunolocalization of VDACs in L. japonicus and soybean root nodules demonstrated their presence on not only mitochondria but also on numerous, small vesicles at the cell periphery. No evidence was found for the presence of VDACs on the symbiosome membrane. Nonetheless, the data indicate that VDACs may play more diverse roles in plants than suspected previously.
