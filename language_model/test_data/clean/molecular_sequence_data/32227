Surface levels of CCR5 on memory CD4(+) T cells influence HIV-1/AIDS susceptibility. Alternative promoter usage results in the generation of CCR5 mRNA isoforms that differ based on whether they contain or lack the untranslated exon 1. The impact of exon 1-containing transcripts on CCR5 surface expression is unknown. In this study, we show that the increased cell surface expression of CCR5 on primary T cells is associated with selective enrichment of exon 1-containing transcripts. The promoter that drives exon 1-containing transcripts is highly active in primary human T cells but not in transformed T cell lines. The transcription factors Oct-1 and -2 inhibit and enhance, respectively, the expression of exon 1-containing transcripts and CCR5 surface levels. However, polymorphisms at homologous octamer-binding sites in the CCR5 promoter of nonhuman primates abrogate the binding of these transcription factors. These results identify exon 1-containing transcripts, and the cis-trans factors that regulate the expression levels of these mRNA isoforms as key parameters that affect CCR5 surface expression levels, and by extension, susceptibility to HIV/AIDS among humans, and possibly, the observed interspecies differences in susceptibility to lentiviral infection.
