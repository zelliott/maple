Pubertal development was studied in male African catfish by immunocytochemical examination of pituitary gonadotrophs and by monitoring the responsiveness of gonadotropin (GTH) secretion to salmon GnRH analogue (sGnRHa) in vitro. Experiments were carried out with fish from 9 to 28 wk of age. Fish were assigned to four groups, according to the stage of spermatogenesis: I, spermatogonia alone; II, spermatogonia and spermatocytes; III, spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids; IV, all germ cell stages, including spermatozoa. Basal and sGnRHa-stimulated secretion of the LH-like GTH II increased 3- to 4-fold from stage I to II and from stage II to III, whereas a 15-fold increase was recorded from stage III to IV. The ED50 values of sGnRHa varied between 0.08 and 0.49 nM, stages II and III being less sensitive. The highest dosage of sGnRHa (100 nM) led to a reduction of GTH secretion. In the first three stages, the pituitary secreted large amounts of free alpha-subunit while free GTH II beta-subunit was not detected at any stage of development. Antisera against GTH II and its alpha- and beta-subunits were used for immunocytochemical studies. In stages I and II, two subtypes of gonadotrophs, which differed in the size and labeling intensity of their secretory granules, were present. Both types of granules were immunopositive for the two subunits of GTH II. In stages III and IV, only gonadotrophs of the subtype with the larger granules were found. Globules and irregular, membrane-bound masses (IMs), probably arising through fusion of secretory granules, appeared in the gonadotrophs in stage III and became more prominent in stage IV. Globules and IMs were immunopositive for the beta-subunit but negative for the alpha-subunit. We conclude that the two subtypes of gonadotrophs represent different developmental stages of GTH II-producing cells, as they shared immunolabeling for the alpha- and the beta-subunits of GTH II. The scarcity of GTH II beta-subunit may be rate-limiting for the amount of intact GTH II available for secretion, particularly at early stages of development. In contrast, at more advanced stages when the readily releasable pool of GTH II has greatly increased, the amount of GTH II also appears to be controlled by modification or elimination of the alpha-subunit from globules and IMs.
