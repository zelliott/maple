The human gene for gamma-glutamyl carboxylase is 13 kb in length and contains 15 exons. Transcription starts at a cytosine 217 base pair upstream of the first codon. There are two major transcripts in all tissues examined. They are distinguished by the presence of an Alu sequence in the 3' nontranslated end of the longer species. Relative mRNA levels for 12 bovine tissues are presented.
