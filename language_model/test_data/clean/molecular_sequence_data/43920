The hydrogenase gene cluster containing nine genes (hupSLCDFGHIJ) was identified by sequencing of an 8.8-kb DNA region from Pseudomonas hydrogenovora. To investigate the function of the hupC gene product, we isolated a hupC-null mutant (HID3) of P. hydrogenovora by introducing an in-frame deletion into the hupC. The mutant, HID3, could not grow autotrophically but retained half the level of hydrogenase activity of the wild-type strain. Results of the oxygen consumption test and Western blot analysis revealed that the hupC gene product is a b-type cytochrome but not involved in the hydrogenase maturation process.
