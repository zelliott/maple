The SOX genes comprise a large family related by homology to the HMG-box region of the testis-determining gene SRY. We have cloned and sequenced the human SOX4 gene. The open reading frame encodes a 474 amino acid protein, which includes an HMG-box. The non-box sequence is particularly rich in serine residues and has several polyglycine and polyalanine stretches. With somatic cell hybrids, human SOX4 has been mapped to Chromosome (Chr) 6p distal to the MHC region. There is no evidence for clustering of other members of the SOX1, -2, and -3 or SOX4 gene families around the SOX4 locus.
