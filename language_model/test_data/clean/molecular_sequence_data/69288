In the anterior segment of the mammalian eye, the ocular ciliary epithelium produces the aqueous humor, a fluid that nourishes and protects the avascular tissues from oxidative stress. This report details the results of a study of molecular cloning, sequencing, and expression of plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPx-P) from the bovine ocular ciliary epithelium. The bovine GPx-P cDNA contains an open reading frame of 226 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 24,860. The corresponding amino acid sequence showed an overall identity of 88% with the human GPx-P, 88.5% with the rat GPx-P, and 46.4% with the cellular bovine glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1). The levels of GPx-P and GPx-1 transcripts in ocular tissues were analyzed and the ciliary epithelium was found to express the highest levels of GPx-P transcripts in human and bovine eyes, whereas the cornea of calf eyes expressed the highest levels of GPx-1 transcripts. Surprisingly, the lens, on which oxidants have profound effects leading to cataract formation, expressed the lowest levels of GPx-P and GPx-1 transcripts in human donor eyes. These results provide new evidence of differential gene expression of the GPx-P and GPx-1 forms in the mammalian eye and stresses the functional role of the ocular ciliary epithelium in protecting the anterior segment of the eye from oxidative damage.
