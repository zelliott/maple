Studies on the reactivity of two synthetic tetrasaccharides as glycosyl acceptors showed that condensation of the methyl alpha-glycoside with a disaccharide donor afforded a hexasaccharide, but condensation of the methyl beta-glycoside with the disaccharide did not yield the corresponding hexasaccharide under the same conditions. A combination of theoretical results and 2D NMR indicated that the reactivity difference between the methyl alpha-glycoside and the methyl beta-glycoside was determined mainly by steric effects.
