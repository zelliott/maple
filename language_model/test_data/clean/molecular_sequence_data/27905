Neurons from peripheral and central nervous tissue as well as from established cell lines respond to low concentrations of laminin with rapid extension of axon-like processes. Two sites on laminin have been identified which stimulate neurite outgrowth, the major site residing at the end of the long arm of laminin. Recently laminin has been cloned and sequenced allowing for synthetic peptides to be prepared and tested for biological activity. We report here that antisera against synthetic peptides corresponding to A and to B1 chain sequences at the end of the long arm can partially inhibit laminin-mediated neurite outgrowth. Further, we show that a 19 amino acid synthetic peptide (CSRARKQAASIKVAVSADR) from the long arm of the laminin A chain is capable of stimulating neuronal-like process formation to almost the same extent as laminin and competes with laminin for stimulation of neurite outgrowth.
