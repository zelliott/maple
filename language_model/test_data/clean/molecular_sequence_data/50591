A number of nucleotide phosphoramidites are now available that permit the chemical synthesis of RNA, modified RNA and RNA-DNA chimeric oligonucleotides. Since the chemical strategy allows the introduction of a particular modification at any given site in a nucleotide polymer, very subtle and specific questions regarding structure-function relationships in RNA may be addressed.
