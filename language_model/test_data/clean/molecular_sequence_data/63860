A new monoterpene, sachalol, and three new monoterpene glycosides, sachalosides VI, VII, VIII, were isolated from Rhodiolae Radix, the roots of Rhodiola sachalinensis. The absolute stereostructures of new monoterpenes were elucidated on the basis of chemical and physicochemical evidence including the application of the modified Mosher's method.
