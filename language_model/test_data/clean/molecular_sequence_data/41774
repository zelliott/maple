The nucleotide sequence of a fragment of 2728 base pairs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome II has been determined. The sequence contains two open reading frames, one of them being incomplete. Deletion mutants of YBR11.21 are viable. YBR11.20 is identical to the recessive omnipotent suppressor SUP45 (SUP1).
