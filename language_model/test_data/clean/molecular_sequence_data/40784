Plasmid pB1000 is a small replicon recently identified as bearing bla(ROB-1) in animal and human Pasteurellaceae in Spain. We identified pB1000 in 11 bla(ROB-1)-positive Australian and North American Haemophilus influenzae isolates, suggesting a wider role for pB1000 in disseminating bla(ROB-1). Native H. influenzae conjugative elements can mobilize plasmids similar to pB1000 at a low frequency of 10(-8), and this might account for the infrequency of bla(ROB-1) compared to the rate of occurrence of bla(TEM-1). Altered penicillin-binding protein 3 was associated with an increased cefaclor MIC in 3 isolates.
