The reticulon-family member Nogo-A is a potent neurite growth inhibitory protein in vitro and may play a role in the restriction of axonal regeneration after injury and of structural plasticity in the CNS of higher vertebrates. Of the three major isoforms of Nogo, Nogo-A is mostly expressed in the brain, Nogo-B is found in a ubiquitous pattern, and Nogo-C is most highly expressed in muscle. Seven additional splice-variants derived both from differential splicing and differential promoter usage have been identified. Analysis of the TATA-less Nogo-A/B promoter (P1) shows that conserved GC-boxes and a CCAAT-box within the first 500bp upstream of the transcription start are responsible for its regulation. No major differences in the methylation status of the P1 CpG-island in tissues expressing or not expressing Nogo-A/B could be detected, suggesting that silencer elements are involved in the regulation. The specific expression pattern of Nogo-A/B is due to differential splicing. The basal Nogo-C promoter (P2) is regulated by a proximal and a distal element. The 5'UTR of Nogo-C harbours a negative control element. These data may help to identify factors that can modulate Nogo transcription, thus offering an alternative approach for Nogo neutralisation.
