During investigations of mycobiota in the coastal Arctic polythermal glaciers, different species of the ubiquitous genus Penicillium were isolated from the extreme subglacial environment. A group of Penicillium strains was obtained that did not belong to any known Penicillium species. This species was isolated in high numbers from the Kongsvegen subglacial ice and was not detected in the surrounding environment. A detailed analysis of secondary metabolite profiles, physiological and morphological characteristics, and partial beta-tubulin gene sequences showed that the proposed new species Penicillium svalbardense is closely related but not identical to Penicillium piscarium and Penicillium simplicissimum. It differs in the production of secondary metabolites and in the morphological features of conidia and penicilli, and it is therefore described as a new species.
