PCR and in-situ-Hybridization were used to detect EBV-DNA within Hodgkin- and Non-Hodgkin-Lymphomas. By the use of primers for the Bam H1 W fragment we could show EBV-DNA to be associated with 45% Hodgkin- and 25% T-Lymphomas, whereas we could not find EBV-DNA within B-Lymphomas. In about one third of the PCR-positive cases we could localize EBV-DNA mostly in the tumor cell nuclei by in-situ-hybridization.
