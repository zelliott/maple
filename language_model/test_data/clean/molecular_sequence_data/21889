A taxonomic study was carried out on two bacterial strains, PCP11(T) and PCP104, isolated from a tidal flat of the Yellow Sea, Korea. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence studies showed that these strains belonged to the family Cytophagaceae, phylum Bacteroidetes. Strains PCP11(T) and PCP104 shared 99.4 % sequence similarity and were related most closely to Reichenbachiella agariperforans KMM 3525(T) (95.8 and 96.0 % sequence similarity, respectively). Members of the genera Fulvivirga, Roseivirga, Fabibacter and Marinoscillum were the next closest relatives of the new isolates, with sequence similarities ≤ 91 %. The two isolates were Gram-staining-negative, strictly aerobic, gliding bacteria. They grew in the presence of 1-5 % NaCl, at pH 5.5-8.5 and at 4-35 °C. Strains PCP11(T) and PCP104 shared a number of physiological and biochemical properties with Reichenbachiella agariperforans KMM 3525(T), but they differed from this strain in the hydrolysis of biopolymers and in the production of carotenoid and flexirubin-type pigments. Both strains possessed iso-C(15 : 0), summed feature 4 (C(16 : 1)ω7c and/or iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH) and C(15 : 0) as major cellular fatty acids. The major respiratory quinone was menaquinone 7 (MK-7). The G+C contents of the genomic DNA of strains PCP11(T) and PCP104 were 39.6 and 41.9 mol%, respectively. On the basis of phenotypic data and phylogenetic inference, it is proposed that the two isolates represent a novel species, Reichenbachiella faecimaris sp. nov., with strain PCP11(T) ( = KACC 14523(T)  = JCM 16588(T)) as the type strain. Emended descriptions of the genus Reichenbachiella and Reichenbachiella agariperforans are also proposed.
