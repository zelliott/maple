The epitope of a calcium-dependent murine monoclonal antibody specific for human factor VII (Thim et.al., Biochemistry (1988) 27, 7785-7793) has been determined. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues 3 through 10 of factor VII eliminates the binding of this antibody but does not disturb the binding of a second antibody which binds nearby.
