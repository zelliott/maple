Amino acid sequence stretches similar to the four most conserved segments of positive strand RNA viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases have been identified in proteins of four dsRNA viruses belonging to three families, i.e. P2 protein of bacteriophage phi 6 (Cystoviridae), RNA 2 product of infectious bursa disease virus (Birnaviridae), lambda 3 protein of reovirus, and VP1 of bluetongue virus (Reoviridae). High statistical significance of the observed similarity was demonstrated, allowing identification of these proteins as likely candidates for RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Based on these observations, and on the previously reported sequence similarity between the RNA polymerases of a yeast dsRNA virus and those of positive strand RNA viruses, a possible evolutionary relationship between the two virus classes is discussed.
