A common feature of all epithelial cells is the presence of keratin proteins that assemble into an intermediate filament cytoskeletal network. Whereas other cell types often use a specific master transcription factor to coordinate cell type-specific transcription, analysis of transcriptional regulation of keratin genes suggests that specific groupings of widely expressed transcription factors, acting on clusters of recognition elements in the promoter regions, confer epithelia-specific transcription. We define such a cluster of three sites that binds five transcription factors in the human K5 keratin gene. Within this cluster, an unusual Sp1 site binds the Sp1 transcription factor and two additional proteins. Flanking the Sp1 site are an AP2 site and another sequence, Site A; each binds a transcription factor. Similar clusters of recognition sites for the same five transcription factors have been also identified in other keratin genes. Such clusters may play a role in epithelia-specific expression of keratins.
