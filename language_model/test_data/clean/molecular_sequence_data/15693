The usability of a quadrupole-quadrupole-time-of-flight (QqTOF) instrument for the tandem mass spectrometric sequencing of oligodeoxynuleotides was investigated. The sample set consisted of 21 synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides ranging in length from 5 to 42 nucleotides. The sequences were randomly selected. For the majority of tested oligonucleotides, two or three different charge states were selected as precursor ions. Each precursor ion was fragmented applying several different collision voltages. Overall 282 fragment ion mass spectra were acquired. Computer-aided interpretation of fragment ion mass spectra was accomplished with a recently introduced comparative sequencing algorithm (COMPAS). The applied version of COMPAS was specifically optimized for the interpretation of information-rich spectra obtained on the QqTOF. Sequences of oligodeoxynucleotides as large as 26-mers were correctly verified in >94% of cases (182 of 192 spectra acquired). Fragment ion mass spectra of larger oligonucleotides were not specific enough for sequencing. Because of the occurrence of extensive internal fragmentation causing low sequence coverage paired with a high probability of assigning fragment ions to wrong sequences, tandem mass spectra obtained from oligonucleotides consisting of 30 and more nucleotides could not be used for sequence verification neither manually nor with COMPAS.
