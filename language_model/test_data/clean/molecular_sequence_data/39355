Clinical stage (CS) is an established indicator of breast cancer outcome. In the present study, a cDNA microarray platform containing 692 genes was used to identify molecular differences between CSII and CSIII disease. Tumor samples were collected from patients with CSII or CSIII breast cancer, and normal breast tissue was collected from women without invasive cancer. Seventy-eight genes were deregulated in CSIII tumors and 22 in CSII tumors when compared to normal tissue, and 20 of them were differentially expressed in both CSII and CSIII tumors. In addition, 58 genes were specifically altered in CSIII and expression of 6 of them was tested by real time RT-PCR in another cohort of patients with CSII or CSIII breast cancer and in women without cancer. Among these genes, MAX, KRT15 and S100A14, but not APOBEC3G or KRT19, were differentially expressed on both CSIII and CSII tumors as compared to normal tissue. Increased HMOX1 levels were detected only in CSIII tumors and may represent a molecular marker of this stage. A clear difference in gene expression pattern occurs at the normal-to-cancer transition; however, most of the differentially expressed genes are deregulated in tumors of both CS (II and III) compared to normal breast tissue.
