We report the identification of a novel major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain (MICB) allele, provisionally designated as MICB-0114 pending the WHO Nomenclature Classification for the MICB locus. This new allele is identical to MICB-0103101v except for a single mutation of G to A in exon 4 that translates into an amino acid substitution from glutamic acid to lysine.
