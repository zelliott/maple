Lipocortin-1 mediates growth inhibition of glucocorticoids in A549 cells by suppressing the release of PGE2 necessary for their proliferation. We now show that 2 peptide fragments derived from the N-terminal portion of lipocortin-1 corresponding to amino-acids 13-25 and 21-33 also inhibited A549 cell growth and suppressed release of PGE2, whereas peptides 1-12 and 13-25 (Phe21; in which the tyrosine at position 21 was replaced by a phenylalanine residue) were inactive. Similarly, peptide 21-33 (Phe21) and a scrambled sequence of 13-25 failed to inhibit cell growth. Moreover, the EGF-induced stimulation of cell proliferation and PGE2 release in these cells was blocked by peptides 13-25 and 21-33, and also by peptides 1-12, 13-25 (Phe21) and 21-33 (Phe21), but not by a scrambled sequence of peptide 13-25.
