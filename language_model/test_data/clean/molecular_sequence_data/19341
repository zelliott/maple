A facultatively anaerobic, selenate- and arsenate-reducing bacterium, designated strain SF-1(T), was isolated from a selenium-contaminated sediment obtained from an effluent drain of a glass-manufacturing plant in Japan. The bacterium stained Gram-positive and was a motile, spore-forming rod capable of respiring with selenate, arsenate and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors. The major cellular fatty acids of the strain were iso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(17 : 1)omega10c and C(16 : 1)omega7c alcohol. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 42.8 mol%. Though the nearest phylogenetic neighbour was Bacillus jeotgali JCM 10885(T), with a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 99.6 %, DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed only 14 % relatedness between these strains, a level that is clearly below the value recommended to delimit different species. This, together with the phenotypic differences (utilization of electron acceptors, NaCl tolerance), suggests that strain SF-1(T) represents a novel species of the genus Bacillus, for which the name Bacillus selenatarsenatis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SF-1(T) (=JCM 14380(T)=DSM 18680(T)).
