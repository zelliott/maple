An actinobacterial strain was isolated from subarctic forest soil, and subjected to polyphasic taxonomic characterization. The cell-wall peptidoglycan comprised meso-diaminopimelic acid, alanine and glutamic acid. MK-9(H₄) was the predominant isoprenoid quinone, and iso-C₁₇:₀, iso-C₁₅:₀ and C₁₆:₀ were detected as the major cellular fatty acids. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that this organism was related to members of the suborders Kineosporiineae and Micrococcineae. The phenotypic properties readily differentiated this organism from the phylogenetic neighbours. Based on the phenotypic and genotypic evidence, the strain is assigned to a novel species of a novel genus: Angustibacter luteus gen. nov., sp. nov. with type strain TT07R-79(T) (=NBRC 105387(T) =KACC 14249(T)).
