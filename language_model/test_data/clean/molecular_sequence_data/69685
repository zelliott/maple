Using a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method, a cDNA for the complete coding region and part of the 5'-untranslated region of rat IL-13 was cloned from rat renal cortex RNA following the induction of anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody-induced glomerulonephritis. The coding region of IL-13 cDNA displays 74% and 87% sequence identity with the coding regions of human and mouse IL-13 cDNA, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence of rat IL-13 reveals 63% and 79% homology with the human and mouse proteins, respectively. Using the rat IL-13 cDNA as a molecular probe, increased production of IL-13 mRNA in renal and splenic tissue is demonstrated in the first 48 hours of antibody-induced glomerulonephritis in the rat. The data suggest a role for IL-13 in the inflammatory response in vivo.
