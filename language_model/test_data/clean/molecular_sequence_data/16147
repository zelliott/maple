The mating pheromone alpha-factor arrests Saccharomyces cerevisiae MATa cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Size control is also exerted in G1, since cells do not exit G1 until they have attained a critical size. A dominant mutation (DAF1-1) which causes both alpha-factor resistance and small cell size (volume about 0.6-fold that of the wild type) has been isolated and characterized genetically and by molecular cloning. Several alpha-factor-induced mRNAs were induced equivalently in daf1+ and DAF1-1 cells. The DAF1-1 mutation consisted of a termination codon two-thirds of the way through the daf1+ coding sequence. A chromosomal deletion of DAF1 produced by gene transplacement increased cell volume about 1.5-fold; thus, DAF1-1 may be a hyperactive or deregulated allele of a nonessential gene involved in G1 size control. Multiple copies of DAF1-1 also greatly reduced the duration of the G1 phase of the cell cycle.
