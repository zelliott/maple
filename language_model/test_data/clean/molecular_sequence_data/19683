We report three new beta-globin gene promoter mutations identified in newborns with hemoglobin (Hb) profiles consistent with Hb S/beta(+)-thalassemia (thal) (Hbs FSA). All three mutations are in close proximity to the conserved ATAA sequence located at positions -31 to -28 relative to the mRNA Cap site. Two cases involved single base substitutions at positions -25 (G-->C) and -32 (C-->T). The remaining case involved the deletion of two bases (-AA) at positions -27 and -26.
