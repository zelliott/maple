Pierisin-1, a cytotoxic protein found naturally in the cabbage butterfly, induces apoptosis of mammalian cells. Our recent studies suggest that pierisin-1 consists of an N-terminal ADP-ribosyltransferase domain, and a C-terminal region that binds to receptors on the surfaces of target cells and incorporates the protein into cells. The present study was undertaken to identify receptors for pierisin-1. The cross-linking and cloning experiments suggested that the proteins on cell membrane had no binding ability to pierisin-1. Inhibitory assays of fractionated lipids from human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, which are highly sensitive to pierisin-1, indicated neutral glycosphingolipids on the cell surface to show receptor activity. Inhibitory assays and TLC immunostaining using anti-pierisin-1 antibodies demonstrated two neutral glycosphingolipids as active components. Analysis of their structures with glycosphingolipid-specific antibodies and negative secondary ion mass spectrometry identified them as globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotetraosylceramide (Gb4). The receptor activities of Gb3 and Gb4 for pierisin-1 were also confirmed with these authentic compounds. Pierisin-1-insensitive mouse melanoma MEB4 cells were found to lack pierisin-1 receptors, including Gb3 and Gb4, but pretreatment of the cells with glycosphingolipid Gb3 or Gb4 enhanced their sensitivity to pierisin-1. Thus, Gb3 and Gb4 were proven to serve as pierisin-1 receptors. The C-terminal region of pierisin-1 consists of possible lectin domains of a ricin B-chain, containing QXW sequences, which are essential for its structural organization. Alteration of QXW by site-directed mutagenesis caused marked reduction of pierisin-1 cytotoxicity. Thus, our results suggest that pierisin-1 binds to Gb3 and Gb4 receptors at the C-terminal region, in a manner similar to ricin, and then exhibits cytotoxicity after incorporation into the cell.
