As part of the EEC yeast genome program, a fragment of 15,820 bp from the right arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XI has been sequenced. This fragment corresponds roughly to the centromere-distal half of cosmid pUKG046 and to a small fragment of cosmid pUKG096, which are located approximately 150 kb from the centromere. It contains four open reading frames (ORFs) which encode potential proteins of more than 100 amino acid residues, as well as the UBI2 gene which carries an intron and does not show up as an ORF in the sequence analysis programs. One of the putative proteins, YKR412, is very rich in serine and has significant homology at the carboxyl end to Nopp140 phosphoprotein. YKR413 has several predicted transmembrane domains. YKR15, which has been recently cloned as the MPL1 gene, encodes a polypeptide that shows homologies to myosin heavy chain and to the cytoskeleton protein Uso1.
