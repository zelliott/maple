We provide the complete PRNP CDS sequence for the African lion, which is different from the previously published sequence and more similar to other carnivore sequences. The newly obtained prion protein sequence differs from the domestic cat sequence at three amino acid positions and contains only four octapeptide repeats. We recommend that this sequence be used as the reference sequence for future studies of the PRNP gene for this species.
