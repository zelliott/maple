We isolated a cDNA clone, kan-1, from a rat liver cDNA library using a reverse transcriptase PCR cloning method. The kan-1 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 420 amino acids, and was 70 and 69% identical in nucleotide and amino acid sequences respectively with human liver bile acid-CoA-amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT). Thus Kan-1 is probably a rat homologue of human BAT (rBAT). Kan-1/rBAT mRNA was mainly expressed in the livers of adult rats and rats immediately after, but not before, birth. It was expressed in the hepatocytes, the sinusoidal endothelial cells and the Kupffer cells of the liver. An anti-Kan-1/rBAT polyclonal antibody detected a protein of molecular mass 46 kDa in the liver. After partial hepatectomy, the levels of Kan-1/rBAT mRNA decreased at 6 and 12 h in the regenerating liver. In a sepsis model, hepatic expression of Kan-1/rBAT mRNA decreased at 6 and 12 h after caecal ligation and puncture. The kinetics of Kan-1/rBAT mRNA expression suggests that it may play a role in acute-phase reactions.
