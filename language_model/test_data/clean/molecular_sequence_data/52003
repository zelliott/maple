Intron 22 of the human factor VIII gene was recently found to contain a gene, associated with a CpG island, which is transcribed in the direction opposite to factor VIII. We now report that another transcript emanates from the island and is transcribed in the same direction as factor VIII. The divergent transcripts originate within 122 bases of each other. The newly identified 5' exon in intron 22 potentially codes for eight amino acids and is spliced to exons 23-26, with the factor VIII reading frame maintained. The protein encoded by this transcript would include the factor VIII C2 domain, responsible for phospholipid binding and essential for coagulant activity.
