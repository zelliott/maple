In CNS synapses, the synaptic junctional complex with associated postsynaptic density is presumed to contain proteins responsible for adhesion between pre- and postsynaptic membranes and for postsynaptic signal transduction. We have found that a prominent, brain-specific protein (PSD-95) enriched in the postsynaptic density fraction from rat brain is highly similar to the Drosophila lethal(1)discs-large-1 (dlg) tumor suppressor protein. The dlg protein is associated with septate junctions in developing flies and contains a guanylate kinase domain that is required for normal control of cell division. The sequence similarity between dlg and PSD-95 suggests that molecular mechanisms critical for growth control in developing organisms may also regulate synapse formation, stabilization, or function in the adult brain.
