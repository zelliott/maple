The nucleotide sequences of 16 newly reported and 8 previously reported actin-encoding macronuclear DNA molecules in spirotrichs have been compared. As described for the eight previously reported molecules, the first 50 bases (noncoding) inside the telomere at both 5' strands in additional actin molecules are purine-rich. This anomalous base composition might serve as a signal to identify macronuclear molecules in micronuclear DNA during development. The 50-base segment upstream of the ATG in the 5' leaders of the actin molecules contains extensive, conserved sequence motifs that are possibly promoter elements. The 3' noncoding trailers contain virtually no conserved sequence motifs. With one exception, the 3' trailers contain a second stop codon (TGA) 36 bases on average downstream of the primary stop codon. Excluding Moneuplotes crassus, amino acid identities in actin I range from 78 to 100%, with variations distributed nonrandomly along the sequence. Phylogenetic trees based on the actin nucleotide sequences of 22 spirotrichs define the evolutionary relationships of their actin-encoding molecules. The actin phylogeny, while well supported by posterior probabilities, does not always coincide with the phylogeny defined in rDNA analyses or classical taxonomic classifications.
