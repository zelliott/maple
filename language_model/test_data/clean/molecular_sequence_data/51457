Six oligosaccharides were first formed from lactitol by a transgalactosylation reaction catalyzed by Aspergillus oryzae beta-D-galactosidase. From the results of methylation analysis, MS, and 1H- and 13C-NMR studies, it was concluded that these oligosaccharides are O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----4)-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----4)-D- glucitol, O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----3)-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----4)-D- glucitol, O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----4)-[O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----6)]- D- glucitol, O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----6)-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1---4)- glucitol, O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----4)-[O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl- (1----5)]-D-glucitol, and O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----4)-[O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----1)]- D-glucitol. The last three are newly observed oligosaccharides.
