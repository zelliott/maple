The role of "stream" of ribosomes upon translation of polycistronic mRNAs has been studied using an artificial polycistron. It has been found that the levels of activation of cistron Ci + 1 out of two adjacent cistrons (Ci and Ci + 1) depends, in addition to earlier described effects of mutual arrangement of initiation and termination signals, also on efficiency of translation of the foregoing cistron Ci. The results obtained lead to the conclusion that in polycistronic systems the levels of translation of cistron Ci + 1 can be regulated by "stream" of ribosomes resulted from translation of the proximal cistron Ci.
