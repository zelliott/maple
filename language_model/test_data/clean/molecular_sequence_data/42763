To assess the usefulness of computer-assisted modeling of mRNA as an aid in design of antisense DNA, the efficiency of inhibition of translation of rabbit beta-globin mRNA by various antisense sequences was compared with calculated structures of the mRNA. The model obtained by consideration of 30 lowest-energy computer-simulated structures is consistent with the high accessibility of the AUG initiation codon region known from digestion with nucleases and with previous antisense inhibition studies reported in the literature. Additional antisense inhibition data were obtained with 20-mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, targeted to regions of beta-globin mRNA differing moderately in their degree of participation in intramolecular folding. The efficiency of translation arrest by the oligonucleotides in cell-free expression systems (wheat germ extract and rabbit reticulocyte lysate) was obtained by measuring incorporation of [35S]methionine into total protein, and corrected for sequence-nonspecific inhibition using brome mosaic virus mRNA. In the presence of RNase H (wheat germ system), the inhibitory activity of the oligonucleotides showed correlation with the calculated secondary structure of mRNA, in particular at low oligonucleotide-to-mRNA ratios (correlation coefficient, 0.95). No correlation was observed in the reticulocyte lysate system, in which the inhibition is mediated by translational arrest.
