The gene encoding the gametocyte/gamete-specific membrane protein Pfs48/45 of Plasmodium falciparum has been cloned. The Pfs48/45 gene is a non-interrupted, single copy gene that codes for a hydrophobic, non-repetitive protein of 448 amino acid residues containing a putative signal peptide at the N-terminus, a hydrophobic C-terminus and 7 potential N-glycosylation sites. Antibodies directed against a Pfs48/45-glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein reacted with both the 45-kDa and 48-kDa proteins of gametocytes. When Pfs48/45 is expressed in the baculovirus-insect cell system the recombinant Pfs48/45 protein is targeted and exposed to the insect cell surface in such a configuration that it is recognized by transmission-blocking anti-45/48-kDa monoclonal antibodies.
