Mapping studies using a panel of 22 rodent-human somatic cell hybrids have helped to localize the Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (uromodulin) gene (UMOD), which has previously been reported to map to 16p13.11, to the region 16p12.3-qter. The combined results indicate that UMOD is located distal to D16S295 and proximal to D16S287 and in the region 16p12.3-16p13.11. Uromodulin is known to affect the formation of calcium-containing kidney stones, and this localization of UMOD will help in studies of families with autosomal forms of nephrolithiasis.
