The filamentous phage Ff (f1, fd, or M13) of Escherichia coli is assembled at the cell membranes by a process that is morphologically similar to that of pilus assembly. The release of the filament virion is mediated by excision from the membrane; conversely, entry into a host cell is mediated by insertion of the virion coat proteins into the membrane. The N-terminal domains of the minor virion protein pIII have the sole role of binding to host receptors during infection. In contrast, the C domain of pIII is required for two opposite functions: insertion of the virion into the membrane during infection and excision at the termination step of assembly/secretion. We identified a 28-residue-long segment in the pIII C domain, which is required for phage entry but dispensable for release from the membrane at the end of assembly. This segment, which we named the infection-competence segment (ICS), works only in cis with the N-terminal receptor-binding domains and does not require the equivalent ICS sequences in other subunits within the virion cap. The ICS contains a predicted amphipathic α-helix and is rich in small amino acids, Gly, Ala, and Ser, which are arranged as a [small]XXX[small]XX[small]XXX[small]XXX[small] motif. Scanning Ala/Gly mutagenesis of ICS showed that small residues are compatible with infection. Overall, organization of the C domain is reminiscent of α-helical pore-forming toxins' membrane insertion domains. The unique ability of pIII to mediate both membrane insertion and excision allowed us to compare these two fundamental membrane transactions and to show that receptor-triggered insertion is a more complex process than excision from membranes.
