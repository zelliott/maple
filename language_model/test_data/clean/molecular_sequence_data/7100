Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) play a role in biological processes such as cell growth and development, angiogenesis, and wound healing. Several genes have been shown to be induced by FGFs, but the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. We investigated the effect of FGF-2 (basic FGF) on the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. We found that the uPA gene is transcriptionally induced by FGF-2 as well as by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13 -acetate involving a PEA3/AP1 element located 2.4 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site; neither induction requires ongoing protein synthesis. Unlike 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induction, FGF-2 induction was not impaired by protein kinase C down-regulation. Analyses of various signaling molecules by Western blotting, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity assays, and transient transfection assays (cotransfection of a uPA-reporter gene construct with expression vectors for wild-type or dominant negative type of these molecules or for ERK-specific protein phosphatase MKP-1) showed that a Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK-2/JunD pathway is induced by FGF-2 and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, leading to the activation of the uPA gene.
