Strain Gsoil 348(T) was isolated from a ginseng field soil sample by selecting micro-colonies from one-fifth strength modified R2A agar medium after a long incubation period. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the strain is related to members of the phylum Armatimonadetes (formerly called candidate phylum OP10). Strain Gsoil 348(T) is mesophilic, strictly aerobic, non-motile and rod-shaped. It only grows in low nutrient media. The major respiratory quinones are menaquinones MK-11 and MK-10, and the main fatty acids are iso-C(15:0), iso-C(17:0), C(16:0) and C(16:1) Ï‰11c. The G+C content is 61.4 mol%. The 16S rRNA gene sequences in public databases belonging to the phylum Armatimonadetes were clustered here into 6 groups. Five of these groups constituted a coherent cluster distinct from the sequences of other phyla in phylogenetic trees that were constructed using multiple-outgroup sequences from 49 different phyla. On the basis of polyphasic taxonomic analyses, it is proposed that strain Gsoil 348(T) (= KACC 14959(T) = JCM 17079(T)) should be placed in Fimbriimonas ginsengisoli gen. nov., sp. nov., as the cultured representative of the Fimbriimonadia class. nov., corresponding with Group 4 of the phylum Armatimonadetes.
