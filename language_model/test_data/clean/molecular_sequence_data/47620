Mutations of the tumour suppressor p53 gene are found in a number of spontaneous canine cancers and may contribute to increased cytogenetic alterations and tumour formation. Using reverse transcription and DNA amplification, we isolated p53 cDNA from normal and tumour tissue of ten canine mammary cancer patients. DNA sequencing identified p53 mutations in three of the ten patients. These included tumour-associated p53 gene mutations within exons 2 and 5 and a germ line deletion of exons 3 to 7. These results support a role for p53 inactivation in canine mammary tumour formation and breed predisposition to cancer. Such information could prove invaluable in the successful outbreeding of inherited predisposition to cancer in the dog. A putative polymorphism was also identified at codon 69 in exon 4 and we discuss the possibility that similar polymorphisms may be associated with human breast cancer.
