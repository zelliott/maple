The membrane surrounding the central vacuole of plant cells contains an H(+)-translocating ATPase (H(+)-ATPase) and an H(+)-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase (H(+)-PPase). Both enzymes are abundant and ubiquitous in plants but the H(+)-PPase is unusual in its exclusive use of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) as an energy source. The lack of sequence identity between the vacuolar H(+)-PPase and any other characterized ion pump implies a different evolutionary origin for this translocase. The existence of the vacuolar H(+)-PPase, in conjunction with increasing recognition of PPi as a key metabolite in plant systems, necessitates reconsideration of ATP as the primary energy source for membrane transport in plant cells.
