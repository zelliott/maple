In animals, major classes of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) possess a Dbl (diffuse B-cell lymphoma)- homology (DH) domain that functions as a GEF-catalytic domain. However, no GEFs with the DH domain had been identified in plants. Recently, we found that the rice homolog of human SWAP70, Oryza sative (Os) SWAP70, containing the DH domain, exhibited GEF activity toward the rice Rho GTPase OsRac1, and regulates chitin-induced production of reactive oxygen species and defense gene expression in rice. ( 1)  Arabidopsis contains a single SWAP70 gene. A T-DNA insertion mutant of Arabidopsis SWAP70 was morphologically wild type. Measurement of in planta growth of Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 hrcC, a mutant incapable of type III effector delivery, revealed enhanced growth of the pathogen in the atswap70 mutant, indicating that AtSWAP70 is required for PAMP-triggered immunity. In addition, the atswap70 mutation reduced the RPM1-mediated hypersensitive response. These results suggested that AtSWAP70 plays a role in both PAMP- and effector-triggered immunity in Arabidopsis.
