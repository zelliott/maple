Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (Insp(3)Rs) and ryanodine receptors (ryRs) act as cationic channels transporting calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum to cytosol by forming tetramers and are proteins localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Despite the absence of classical calcium-binding motifs, calcium channeling occurs at the transmembrane domain. We have investigated putative calcium binding motifs in these sequences. Prediction methods indicate the presence of six transmembrane helices in the C-terminal domain, one of the three domains conserved between Insp(3)R and ryR receptors. The recently identified crystal structure of the K(+) channel, which also forms tetramers, revealed that two transmembrane helices, an additional pore helix and a selectivity filter are responsible for selective K(+) ion channeling. The last three TM helices of Insp(3)R and ryR are particularly well conserved and we found analogous pore helix and selectivity filter motif in these sequences. We obtained a three-dimensional structural model for the transmembrane tetramer by extrapolating the distant structural similarity to the K(+) channels.
