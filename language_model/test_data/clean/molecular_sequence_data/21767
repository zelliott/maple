The virus isolate H was identified by molecular biology,it was collected from Abelmoschus manihot plant showing leaf curl,yellow vein symptoms in Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plant.

The virus isolate H was observed in electron micrograph, and conformed detected by PCR using universal primer pair for the genus Geminivirus.

The results indicated that all sequences homologous to the specific fragment belonged to the genus Begomovirus of the family Geminiviridae. There was the highest similarity shared 95% homology at nucleotide between the specific fragment and DNA-A of Emilia yellow vein virus isolates.

These findings suggested that there was geminiviridea in Abelmoschus manihot, and the disease probably caused by Emilia yellow vein virus.
