Nitric oxide released in large amounts by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-containing pulmonary cells plays an important role in many aspects of lung function in health and disease. The aim of this study was to establish a permanent non tumor-derived alveolar epithelial cell line that exhibits the typical characteristics of an iNOS-expressing cell. Therefore, the pulmonary epithelial cell line L2 (adult rat) was incubated with lipopolysaccharide derived from Escherichia coli (serotype 0111:B4) and different cytokines. The strongest effect on iNOS gene expression and nitric oxide release could be detected when L2 cells were coincubated with interferon-gamma + tumor necrosis factor-alpha. iNOS complementary DNA concentration was 25 amol/microliters at 9h, and nitrite/nitrate levels were 99.43 +/- 3.97 nmol/10(6) cells at 24h, respectively. Our results show that L2 cells can be regarded as an appropriate model for investigating iNOS gene expression and nitric oxide functions in alveolar epithelial cells.
