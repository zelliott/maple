Using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a complement DNA encoding secreted superoxide dismutase (s-SOD) of a mouse kidney has been isolated and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of mouse s-SOD cDNA shares 79% identity with the rat seminal SOD sequence and 61% identity with the human SOD3 sequence. Northern blot analysis showed that mouse s-SOD is intensely expressed in the kidney and lung tissues and detectable in other tested tissues, including the brain. The mouse s-SOD gene was assigned to chromosome 5 using fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis and PCR analysis of mouse/hamster hybrid cells.
