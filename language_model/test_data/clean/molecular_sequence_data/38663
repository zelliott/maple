A putative novel murine serine protease, DISP, was identified by cDNA indexing and shown to be expressed primarily in distal gut. FISH analysis showed it to be localised to mouse chromosome 17A3. A possible human homologue for DISP has been identified. DISP is a novel member of clan SA/family S1 of the serine proteases, at present of unknown function.
