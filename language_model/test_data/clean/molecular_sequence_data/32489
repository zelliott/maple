AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) is central to sensing energy status in eukaryotic cells via binding of AMP and ATP to CBS (cystathionine beta-synthase) domains in the regulatory gamma subunit. The structure of a CBS-domain pair from human AMPK gamma1 in complex with the physiological activator AMP and the pharmacological activator ZMP (AICAR) is presented.
