The antinociception induced by beta-endorphin given supraspinally has been previously demonstrated to be mediated by the release of [Met5]enkephalin acting on delta-opioid receptors in the spinal cord. The present study was designed to determine what type of opioid receptors in the spinal cord is involved in beta-endorphin-induced antinociception in the rat. Antinociception was induced by beta-endorphin (0.6 nmol) given into nucleus raphe obscurus and was assessed by the tail-flick test in pentobarbital-anesthesized rats. Naltriben (0.6-6.0 nmol), a selective delta 2-opioid receptor antagonist, given intrathecally dose-dependently attenuated beta-endorphin-induced inhibition of the tail-flick response. On the other hand, 7-benzylidene naltrexone (2.1-64.3 nmol), CTOP (D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2, 0.09-2.8 nmol), or nor-binaltorphimine (1.4-40.8 nmol), selective delta 1-, mu-, and kappa-opioid receptor antagonists, respectively, did not block beta-endorphin-induced antinociception. The results of present study in rats are consistent with previous experiments in mice indicating that spinal delta 2-, but not delta 1-, mu- or kappa-opioid receptors are involved in beta-endorphin-induced inhibition of the tail-flick response.
