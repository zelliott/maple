The apolipoprotein B (apoB) variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) alleles containing larger repeat units is a risk factor for coronary heart disease. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) in entangled polymer solution was applied to the analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified apoB VNTR locus for DNA diagnosis of heart disease. The CE separation gives an excellent resolution of two alleles differing by one or two 16 bp repeat units in the DNA size range up to 600 bp with high speed. The apoB alleles differing in length by 2 or 4 repeat units are readily distinguishable by CE in the DNA size range from 600 to 1000 bp. The plate number achieved was 1 million plates per meter. CE combining with PCR provides an excellent technique for accurate determination of the number of repeat units of apoB VNTR alleles and differentiation of heterozygous from homozygous individuals. Using the CE technique, the apoB VNTR loci from some individuals in genotyping were examined towards precise DNA diagnosis for coronary heart disease.
