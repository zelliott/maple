The majority of chicken repetitive sequence is nuclear-membrane-associated sequence (CNM), which resides in a large number of microchromosomes (chromosomes 11-39) and is absent from macrochromosomes 1-5, ZW, and some of the intermediate chromosomes 6-10. Two repetitive families, EcoRI/XhoI, are confined to the female-specific W chromosome. The core repeat units of the three families are 21 bp, containing (A)3-5 and (T)3-5 clusters separated by 5-7-bp sequences. In this article, we describe the isolation and initial characterization of a novel repeat family that is related to CNM/EcoRI/XhoI families. The novel family, designated as PIR, consists of multiple types of partially inverted repeat units of about 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 kb. The PIR sequence is restricted to chicken chromosome 8, and accounts for about 3.8 mb, or 2500 copies of the 1.4-kb units, of the chicken genome. The evolution of PIR and related sequences is discussed.
