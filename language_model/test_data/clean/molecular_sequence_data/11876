A cDNA encoding human IL-17 (hIL-17) was cloned from a CD4+ T cell library. The predicted 155-amino acids sequence contains an N-terminal signal peptide and exhibits 72% amino acid identity with HVS13, an open reading frame from a T-lymphotropic Herpesvirus saimiri, and 63% with murine CTLA8. High levels of hIL-17 were induced from primary peripheral blood CD4+ T cells upon stimulation. When expressed in CV1/EBNA cells, recombinant hIL-17 was secreted in both glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms. A hIL-17.Fc fusion protein and supernatants from cells transfected with hIL-17 induced IL-6 and IL-8 production and enhanced the surface expression of the intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in human fibroblasts.
