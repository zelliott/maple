Monoclonal antibodies raised against particles of African Cassava mosaic virus, Indian Cassava mosaic virus or Okra leaf curl virus were used to test samples collected in Pakistan from begomovirus-infected plants. Epitope profiles obtained from cucurbits resembled those previously reported for Pakistani begomoviruses. In contrast, epitope profiles obtained from legumes showed little diversity and were quite distinct from these. DNA with nucleotide sequences typical of begomovirus DNA A components was amplified from selected mungbean samples. Comparisons of the sequences of the amplified DNA with other begomovirus DNA A sequences and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Pakistani mungbean viruses were isolates of the species Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus, which together with Mungbean yellow mosaic virus represents a distinct lineage of Old World begomoviruses.
