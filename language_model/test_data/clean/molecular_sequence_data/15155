cDNA coding for Brugia malayi pepsin inhibitor homolog (Bm-33) from the human filarial parasite was cloned in pRSET for large-scale expression and functional characterization. The pRSET-B cloned gene did not yield recombinant protein expression and the reason was attributed to the presence of an N-terminal signal peptide. The gene was subcloned in pRSET-A without a signal peptide and the 33 kDa histidine-tagged recombinant protein was purified by IMAC. All individuals from an endemic area generated IgG responses against Bm-33 in the order MF>CP>EN. Isotype analysis indicated an elevated IgG4 reactivity in the order MF>EN>CP. Bm-33-specific IgE levels were elevated in MF, CP and EN compared to non-endemic normals with no significant differences among the groups. Paraffin-embedded sections of Setaria digitata (cattle filarial parasite) stained with mouse anti-Bm-33 antibodies exhibited the hypodermal nature of Bm-33. These findings suggest that Bm-33 is an immunodominant antigen and contributes to filarial pathogenesis.
