The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene of 110 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients from the south-west of Germany was screened for 12 different mutations. This analysis resulted in an identification of 79% of all CF mutations and a complete genotype in 66% of the families. The most common mutation found was delta F508 (67%). Another 5 mutations accounted for a further 12.5% (4% G542X; 3% R553X; 3% N1303K; 2% 1717-1 G-->A; 0.5% G551D) whereas 6 mutations (R117H, A455E, delta I507, S549I, S549N, and R1162X) were not found. Fifty-four (49%) patients were delta F508 homozygotes and 18 (16.5%) were compound heterozygotes for delta F508 and one of the rarer mutations. These frequencies differ slightly from those found in the north of Germany and considerably from those reported from the south of Europe, which seems to be consistent with a north to south decline of the relative abundance of delta F508. Two patients, age 6 and 25 years, were compound heterozygotes for G542X and N1303K. The clinical features of the 6 year old were characterised by severe gastrointestinal and as yet only mild pulmonary complications whereas the 25 year old manifested severe pulmonary and gastrointestinal symptoms indicating that the N1303K mutation of the C-terminal CFTR nucleotide binding fold significantly impairs protein function in both the pancreas and the lungs.
