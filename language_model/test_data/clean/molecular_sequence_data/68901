In the present study, we report the application of polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis to the screening of seven functionally important factor IX gene (FIX) regions (total length 2.66 kb) in 9 unrelated haemophilia B patients of Portuguese or African origin. In eight of the patients an altered migration pattern of single-stranded DNA was observed. Direct sequencing of the relevant DNA fragments unveiled the following sequence alterations: two novel mutations, namely FIXBarcelos Thr-380-Pro and FIXLousada 9bp insertion at position 31,309 or 31,318; five mutations previously reported in other ethnic groups (FIXPorto Arg-145-His, FIXLuanda Gly-207-Arg, FIXPenafiel Arg-248-Gln, FIXSesimbra Arg-333-Gln, FIXCascais Arg-333-Stop); and a normal variant, G-->T transvertion at position 6,596 in intron 2. We propose hypothetical models for the generation of the 9 bp duplication (FIXLousada). We have performed molecular modeling studies in order to predict the structure of the variant FIX molecules.
