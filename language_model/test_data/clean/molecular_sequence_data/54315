The purpose of this study was to determine the existence of Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) at species level and the predominant species in the environment of moso bamboo plantations in Hangzhou, China. A total of 423 isolates were recovered from moso bamboo rhizhosphere soil samples of three sites on the selective medium during 2007-2008. Isolates were identified by Bcc-specific PCR assays, followed by recA-restriction fragment length polymorphism assays, species-specific PCR analysis, recA gene sequencing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme, and BOX-PCR fingerprinting for genomic diversity. Out of 423 isolates, 278 isolates were assigned to the following Bcc species, eight B. stabilis, 26 B. anthina, 193 B. pyrrocinia, and 51 B. arboris, which indicated B. pyrrocinia as the most dominant species followed by B. arboris. Moreover, false positives were observed in certain isolates of B. arboris while performing species-specific PCR test. Furthermore, the results of recA gene sequence similarity and MLST data demonstrated that nine isolates formed a single discrete cluster but were PCR negative to species-specific primers representing novel species may exist within the Bcc. In addition, BOX-PCR fingerprinting for all the Bcc isolates also showed the strain diversity. It is the first report of the existence of B. arboris and predominance of B. pyrrocinia in the moso bamboo environment.
