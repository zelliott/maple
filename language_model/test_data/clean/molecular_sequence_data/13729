A new cDNA clone, NGD5, has been identified from a subtraction cDNA library constructed with mRNA isolated from control neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 cells and cells treated for 48 h with the delta-opioid agonist, D-Ala2, D-Leu5 enkephalin (DADLE). NGD5 mRNA is decreased, in a naloxone-reversible manner, upon long-term treatment of NG108-15 cells with DADLE, indicating that this clone may be related to opioid receptor function. Northern analysis indicates that NGD5 mRNA is expressed in rat brain. Two similar nearly full-length NGD5 clones, NGD5A and NGD5B, were isolated from a lambda gt10 NG108-15 cDNA library and sequenced. The predicted 40-kDa peptide encoded for by the NGD5 cDNA has no significant homology to the recently cloned mu, delta or kappa opioid receptors nor to any other known proteins.
