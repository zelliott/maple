The post-translational modification of core histones plays an essential role in chromatin remodeling processes. We recently reported the occurrence of a novel histone modification, involving a epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine cross-link between a glutamine residue of histone H2B and a lysine residue of histone H4 in the testis of the starfish, Asterina pectinifera[Shimizu, T., Hozumi, K., Horiike, S., Nunomura, K., Ikegami, S., Takao, T., and Shimonishi, Y. (1996) Nature 380, 32]. In order to determine the complete structure of the modified histone heterodimer, p28 from both testis and sperm was purified. p28 was digested with Achromobacter lyticus protease I or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease to give proteolytic fragments that were separated by HPLC. Amino acid analysis, sequencing, and mass spectrometric analysis of the fragments showed that the amino acid sequences of these fragments are identical to those of both histones H2B and H4, except for two NH2-terminal peptides obtained by digestion with A. lyticus protease I. One of the peptides, K8, was identical to that reported previously, and the other was a here-to-fore unidentified peptide, which was designated K10. Amino acid and positive-ion FAB-MS/MS analyses of K10 showed that it to be a fragment, derived from Gly8-Lys10 of histone H2B and Gly9-Lys16 of histone H4. The yields of K8 and K10 were calculated to be 47 and 42%, respectively, expressed as the percent of the total amount of p28 used in the experiment. Based on these data, the structure of p28 was determined to be a heterodimer, composed of histones H2B and H4, formed through a transglutaminase-catalyzed acyl transfer reaction between Gln9 of histone H2B and Lys5 or Lys12 of histone H4.
