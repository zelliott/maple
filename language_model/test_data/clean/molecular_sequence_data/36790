Tobacco plants were transformed with the human gene for interferon-beta (IFN-beta). Transformation was determined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and expression was determined by Western blot analysis, by purifying the IFN from the transgenic plants, and by bioassays indicating its activity in human cells. Plants expressing IFN-beta were self-pollinated. IFN-beta-expressing progeny plants were selected and produced active IFN-beta, indicating stable transformation.
