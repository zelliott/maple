Bovine leukemia virus (BLV), like its closest relatives human T-cell leukemia virus-I and II, contain a 'px' gene, between the 'env' gene and the 3' long terminal repeat in its genome. A monoclonal antibody prepared against a synthetic oligopeptide whose sequence was deduced from highly conserved region of 'px' gene of BLV, was used to detect the presence of 'px' gene product in chronically BLV infected synchronised cells. By immunoperoxidase staining the 'px' gene product was detected maximum after 6-9 hr after synchronization in the nucleus of the cells which demonstrated the close interaction of it with viral DNA which is integrated with host cell genome.
