A methanol extract of Combretum erythrophyllum showed inhibitory bioactivities in a yeast-based microtiter assay for DNA-damaging agents. Bioassay-guided fractionation of this extract yielded two known bioactive compounds, combretastatin A-1 and (-)-combretastatin, and two new bioactive glucosides, combretastatin A-1 2'-beta-D-glucoside (1) and combretastatin B-1 2'-beta-D-glucoside (2). The structures of the new compounds were assigned by (1)H and (13)C NMR, DEPT, HMQC, and HMBC spectra.
