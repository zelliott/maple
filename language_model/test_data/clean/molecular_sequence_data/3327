The expression difference of trypsin gene between deltamethrin-resistant strain and -susceptible strain of Culex pipiens pallens was further investigated, and the results showed that the expression of trypsin gene were respectively 4.3 and 3.9 fold more in the resistant strain than in the susceptible strain, by reverse Northern blot and Northern blot assays. A full-length trypsin cDNA of 909 base pairs (GenBank/NCBI AY034060) with an open reading frame of 786 base pairs was cloned from the constructed cDNA library by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and the deduced protein of 261 amino acids was 55% homologous with Anopheles gambiae trypsin.
