We have isolated and sequenced the gene encoding the human embryonic/atrial myosin alkali light chain isoform (MLC-1emb/A). The gene is split into seven exons by six introns; the last exon, as in all MLC isoform genes sequenced to date, is completely 3' untranslated sequence. Comparison of the MLC-1emb/A isoform gene with the other MLC-1 genes showed that the exon-intron arrangement of the human MLC-1emb/A isoform gene is analogous to that of the other MLC-1 type isoform genes. We have also mapped the human MLC-1emb/A isoform gene to the long arm of chromosome 17; the corresponding mouse gene has been mapped to chromosome 11. This gene, together with a number of others such as the collagen(I) alpha 1, galactokinase, and thymidine kinase genes, is part of the largest syntenic group between mouse and man.
