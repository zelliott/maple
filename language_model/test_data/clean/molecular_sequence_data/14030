Forty intestinal spirochaete strains were investigated for nucleotide sequences related to the smpA locus from Serpulina hyodysenteriae by Southern hybridization of chromosomal DNA using the smpA locus from S. hyodysenteriae strain P18A as a probe and by PCR using primers internal to the smpA gene. The intensity of the hybridization signal at high stringency and positive PCR results suggested that 12 S. hyodysenteriae strains possessed a similar nucleotide sequence. PCR was negative for another 12 S. hyodysenteriae strains and the hybridization signal obtained from 11 of these was weak and one was negative. All S. hyodysenteriae strains hybridized under low stringency conditions. These results indicated that there is variation among the smpA loci of S. hyodysenteriae strains. Among seven strains of S. innocens, and the proposed species 'S. intermedius' and 'S. murdochii', hybridization was weak and no PCR products were obtained, suggesting that these species have sequences related to, but divergent from, the smpA sequences of strains of S. hyodysenteriae. Both gene probe hybridization and PCR analysis of nine strains of the proposed new genus 'Anguillina', including isolates from pigs and humans, gave negative results.
