Human cytomegalovirus and human herpesvirus-6 are closely related viruses which cause similar diseases, have similar cellular repositories of latent infection, and may be detected largely in the same types of clinical specimens. DNA amplification appears likely to play an increasing role in the diagnosis of recent and remote infection with these agents. A sensitive multiplex polymerase chain reaction was therefore developed for the two viruses and for human beta-globin DNA. Optimization of parameters such as the primers, primer concentrations, magnesium concentration, and buffer constituents was crucial in achieving a sensitive assay. Preliminary results indicated that the assay could simultaneously monitor DNA extraction from clinical specimens and allow detection of HCMV or HHV-6 in patients with diseases possibly caused by either pathogen.
