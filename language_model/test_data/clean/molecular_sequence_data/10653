A strain isolated from a biopsy sample taken from a slowly spreading skin granulation on a child's hand was found to have properties consistent with its classification in the genus Mycobacterium. An almost complete gene sequence of the 16S rRNA of the strain was determined following the cloning and sequencing of the amplified gene. The sequence was aligned with those available for mycobacteria, and phylogenetic trees were inferred with four tree-making algorithms. The organism, which formed a distinct phyletic line within the evolutionary radiation occupied by rapidly growing mycobacteria, was readily distinguished from members of validly described species of rapidly growing mycobacteria on the basis of its mycolic acid pattern and a number of other phenotypic features, notably its ability to form yellow pigmented colonies when incubated in the light. The name proposed for this new species is Mycobacterium novocastrense. The type strain is DSM 44203.
