A cDNA and two genomic clones comprising highly similar genes that encode a protein with a Myb-related DNA-binding domain were isolated from the resurrection plant Craterostigma plantagineum. The structure of cpm5 and cpm10 (Craterostigma plantagineum myb) genes consists of three putative exons encoding a protein of 36.6 kDa. The cDNA of cpm7 encodes a closely related protein of 36.8 kDa. The canonical Myb domain present in transcriptional activators of yeast, animals and plants was localized in the amino terminus of deduced Cpm5, Cpm7 and Cpm10 proteins and corresponds to the two Myb repeats found in plants. The Myb domain of Cpm deduced proteins and a short stretch of amino acids adjacent to this region are closely related to a myb gene from Arabidopsis thaliana which is expressed in response to osmotic stress and ABA. The rest of the deduced protein has no similarity to other reported sequences. The myb-related genes in the Craterostigma genome comprise a small gene family of 6-8 members as estimated by hybridization with a bona fide Myb domain probe. Northern blot experiments showed specific expression of cpm10 in undifferentiated callus tissue up-modulated by ABA and expression of cpm7 mRNA in roots up-regulated by dehydration.
