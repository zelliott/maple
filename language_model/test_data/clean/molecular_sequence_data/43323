Diversity within bacteria isolated from activated sludge and the Baltic sea and recognized by the rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probe ppT (designed by BRAUN-HOWLAND et al., 1993 to recognize C. testosteroni) was studied. The partial nucleotide sequences of 16S genes of the isolates revealed that the activated sludge and Baltic sea isolates each formed a separate group distinct from C. testosteroni. The analysis of phage and bacteriocin sensitivity as well as whole cell protein patterns revealed the same grouping, but in these characters also intragroup variation was observed. As a conclusion, neither of the studied groups were C. testosteroni, but they probably belong to two previously unknown species common in activated sludge or the Baltic sea.
