The 20-kDa ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-20K is induced specifically during a late stage of erythroid differentiation. Here we report the sequence of a murine cDNA encoding E2-20K. Northern blot analysis identified polyadenylated transcripts of 3.5 and 6.5 kb which are present at comparable levels in many nonerythroid tissues.
