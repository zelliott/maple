The structures of two new monodesmosidic and bisdesmosidic triterpenoid saponins (1 and 2) and the known compound delta 5-stigmasterol-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (3) as well as two new oleanane type triterpene lactone glycosides 4, 5 and a new sapogenin lactone 6 isolated from the stem bark of Albizia gummifera C.A. Smith (Mimosaceae) have been elucidated as 3-O-¿beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->2)-[alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl(1-->6) ]-beta-D- glucopyranosyl¿-oleanolic acid (1), beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl 3-O-¿beta-D-glucopyra-nosyl(1-->2)-[alpha-L-arabinopyrano syl(1-->6)]-beta-D- glucopyranosyl¿-oleanolate (2), 3 beta-¿O-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)-[O-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl(1-->6 )] beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy¿-machaerinic acid gamma-lactone (4), 3 beta-O-beta-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid (1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy]-machaerinic acid gamma-lactone (5), and A-homo-3a-oxa-5 beta-olean-12-en-3-one-28-oic acid (6), respectively. The complete assignment of the 1H and 13C resonances of 1, 2, 4 and 6 and of the peracetate of 5 were achieved by means of 2D-NMR studies.
