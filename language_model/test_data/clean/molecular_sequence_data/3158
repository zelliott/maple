The study reported here investigated the immunogenicity and protective potential of a lipid core peptide (LCP) construct containing a conserved region determinant of M protein, defined as peptide J8. Parenteral immunization of mice with LCP-J8 led to the induction of high-titer serum immunoglobulin G J8-specific antibodies when the construct was coadministered with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or administered alone. LCP-J8 in CFA had significantly enhanced immunogenicity compared with the monomeric peptide J8 given in CFA. Moreover, LCP-J8/CFA and LCP-J8 antisera opsonized four different group A streptococcal (GAS) strains, and the antisera did not cross-react with human heart tissue proteins. These data indicate the potential of an LCP-based M protein conserved region GAS vaccine in the induction of broadly protective immune responses in the absence of a conventional adjuvant.
