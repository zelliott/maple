A Gram-stain-negative, non-motile, non-spore-forming, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated DPG-28T, was isolated from seawater on the southern coast of Korea. Strain DPG-28T grew optimally at 30 °C and in the presence of 2 % (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain DPG-28T formed a coherent cluster with members of the genera Marivita and Gaetbulicola, with which it exhibited sequence similarity values of 97.8-98.5 %. The DNA G+C content of strain DPG-28T was 65.1 mol%. The predominant ubiquinone of strain DPG-28T was ubiquinone-10 (Q-10), consistent with data for the genera Marivita and Gaetbulicola. The cellular fatty acid profiles of strain DPG-28T and the type strains of Marivita cryptomonadis, Marivita litorea and Gaetbulicola byunsanensis were essentially similar in that the common predominant fatty acid was C18:1ω7c. Major polar lipids found in strain DPG-28T and the type strains of M. cryptomonadis, M. litorea and G. byunsanensis were phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and an unidentified aminolipid. From these data, it is proposed that Gaetbulicola byunsanensis be reclassified as a member of the genus Marivita, for which the name Marivita byunsanensis comb. nov. is proposed, with the type strain SMK-114T (=CCUG 57612T=KCTC 22632T), and that strain DPG-28T be classified in the genus Marivita. Differential phenotypic properties and genetic distinctiveness of strain DPG-28T demonstrated that this strain is distinguishable from M. cryptomonadis, M. litorea and G. byunsanensis. On the basis of the data presented, strain DPG-28T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Marivita, for which the name Marivita hallyeonensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is DPG-28T (=KCTC 23421T=CCUG 60522T). An emended description of the genus Marivita is also provided.
