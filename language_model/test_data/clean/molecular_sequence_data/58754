In the present study, we determined the sequence of group I self-splicing introns found in the large ribosomal RNA subunit of Candida albicans, Candida stellatoidea and the recently-described species Candida dubliniensis. It was found that both the intron and ribosomal RNA nucleotide sequences are almost perfectly identical between different C. albicans strains as well as between C. albicans and C. stellatoidea strains. Comparisons of ribosomal RNA sequences suggest that local isolates of atypical C. albicans from individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus can be assigned to the C. dubliniensis species. C. dubliniensis strains also harbor a group I intron in their ribosomal RNA, as observed in about 40% of C. albicans strains and all C. stellatoidea strains. This novel C. dubliniensis group I intron is identical to the C. albicans and C. stellatoidea intron, except for two widely divergent stem-loop regions. Despite these differences, the C. dubliniensis intron possesses self-splicing ability in an in vitro assay. Taken together, these data support the idea that C. albicans and C. stellatoidea should be joined together as variants of the same species while C. dubliniensis is a distinct but closely related microorganism. To our knowledge, the C. albicans and C. dubliniensis introns are the first example of a pair of homologous group I introns differing only by the presence of apparently facultative sequences in some stem-loops suspected to be involved in stabilization of tertiary structure.
