We have recently characterized Nicotiana cytoplasmic (cyt) tRNA(GCA)Cys as a novel UGA suppressor tRNA. Here we have isolated its corresponding (NtC1) and a variant (NtC2) gene from a genomic library of Nicotiana rustica. Both tRNA(Cys) genes are efficiently transcribed in HeLa cell nuclear extract and yield mature cyt tRNAs(Cys). Sequence analysis of the upstream region of the RAD51 single-copy gene of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome revealed a cluster of three tRNA(Cys) genes which have the same polarity and comprise highly similar flanking sequences. Of the three Arabidopsis tRNA(Cys) genes only one (i.e. AtC2) appears to code for a functional gene which exhibits an almost identical nucleotide sequence to NtC1. These are the first sequenced nuclear tDNAs(Cys) of plant origin.
