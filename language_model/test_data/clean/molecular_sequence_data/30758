cDNAs of metallothioneins (MTs) in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans were characterized. The MT-II clone encodes 62 amino acid residues and the predicted Mr is 6462. The MT-I clone contains an additional 12 residues at the C-terminal end, and the predicted Mr is 7959. There is a considerable similarity between MT-I and MT-II. Both of these proteins are cysteine-rich and, with a few exceptions, show a good alignment of cysteine residues. No obvious sequence relationship in the coding region was discernible between C. elegans MTs and mammalian MTs, aside from Cys-Cys, Cys-Xaa-Cys, and Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Cys segments. However, 3'-untranslated region of cDNAs of C. elegans MT-I and -II have some consensus sequences found in mammalian MT cDNAs, suggesting that these regions may have some roles in the regulation of MT-gene expression.
