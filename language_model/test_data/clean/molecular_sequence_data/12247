A comparative analysis of the amino acid sequence of glutamine synthetase (GS) of the photosynthetic purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides revealed that the enzyme is typical for first type procaryotic GSs and structurally resembles GSs of enteric bacteria. The data obtained indicate that the complex phenotype of purple bacterial mutants at the glnA gene coding for GS may be conditioned by specific regulation of nitrogen metabolism in bacterial cells rather than by structural-and-functional peculiarities of GS.
