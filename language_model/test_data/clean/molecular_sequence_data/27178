Mutations in the trafficking protein particle complex C2 protein (TRAPPC2), a mammalian ortholog of yeast Trs20p and a component of the trafficking protein particle (TRAPP) vesicle tethering complex, have been linked to the skeletal disorder spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda (SEDT). Intriguingly, the X-linked TRAPPC2 is just one of a complement of Trs20-related genes in humans. Here we characterize TRAPPC2L, a novel, highly conserved TRAPP-interacting protein related to TRAPPC2 and the uncharacterized yeast open reading frame YEL048c. TRAPPC2L and TRAPPC2 genes are found in pairs across species and show broad and overlapping expression, suggesting they are functionally distinct, a notion supported by yeast complementation studies and biochemical characterization. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of either TRAPPC2L or TRAPPC2 in HeLa cells leads to fragmentation of the Golgi, implicating both proteins in Golgi dynamics. Gradient fractionation of cellular membranes indicates that TRAPPC2L is found with a portion of cellular TRAPP on very low-density membranes whereas the remainder of TRAPP, but not TRAPPC2L, is found associated with Golgi markers. YEL048c displays genetic interactions with TRAPP II-encoding genes and the gene product co-fractionates with and interacts with yeast TRAPP II. Taken together these results indicate that TRAPPC2L and its yeast ortholog YEL048c are novel TRAPP-interacting proteins that may modulate the function of the TRAPP II complex.
