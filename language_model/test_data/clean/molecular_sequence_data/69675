A cDNA clone encoding the mouse angiotensin receptor subtype 2 (AT2 receptor) was isolated from a mouse fetal cDNA library. Mouse AT2 receptor full-length cDNA contains a 1089-base-pair open reading frame which encodes a protein of 363 amino acid residues. Hydropathy analysis reveals seven putative transmembrane domains. Specific binding of [125I]CGP42112A was demonstrated in membranes of COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA. Scatchard analysis and ligand displacement profile were typical of the AT2 receptor. Northern blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated that AT2 receptor mRNA was expressed abundantly in fetus and in a lesser amount in adult brain. Analysis of the mouse AT2 receptor gene reveals that the mouse AT2 receptor locus exists as a single copy in the genome, and that the gene does not contain introns in the coding region.
