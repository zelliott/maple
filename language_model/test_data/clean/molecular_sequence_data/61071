The first and second internal transcribed spacer sequences of 28 morphologically-defined species of horse strongyle were characterized, and specific oligonucleotide primers were designed for some species based on the nucleotide differences. Utilizing these primers, a PCR approach was developed for the specific amplification of ribosomal DNA of Strongylus vulgaris, Cyathostomum catinatum, Cylicocyclus nassatus, Cylicostephanus longibursatus or Cylicostephanus goldi. The method allowed the species-specific amplification of parasite DNA derived from faecal samples and/or copro-cultures, demonstrating the potential of the approach for the diagnosis of equine strongyloidosis. The establishment of this PCR assay also has implications for studying the biology and epidemiology of equine strongyles and anthelmintic resistance using faecal egg count reduction tests.
