The organization of the human heparin-binding neurite outgrowth promoting factor (HBNF) gene is presented. Based on Southern analysis and the isolation of genomic DNA clones from a lambda phage library, the minimum size of the gene is 42 kb. Sequences comprising the HBNF mRNA are contained in five exons which account for the 1650 nt mRNA size observed by northern analysis. From the structure of the gene it is predicted that a variant human HBNF cDNA with a three basepair deletion is a result of alternative splicing at the acceptor site of exon 5. Evidence is presented that indicates the existence of a variant HBNF protein, des-Ala119-HBNF, in bovine brain which has a corresponding amino acid deletion. This alternate form comprises approximately 20% of the total HBNF protein present in bovine brain.
