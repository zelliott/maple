In the current study, we have addressed the role of interferons (IFNs) in controlling the differentiation of pluripotent P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. Blocking IFN activity in the culture medium of differentiating cells with antibodies leads to a strong decrease in the degree of differentiation. The antibodies are active for a relatively short time. During this time, IFN-beta mRNA can be detected in the differentiating cells, as can increases of IFN stimulation response element-binding activity and NF-KB. The timing of IFN action also coincides with the accumulation of cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and with a drop in dsRNA unwindase-modificase activity. A model for the involvement of autoinduction of IFN by intracellular dsRNA in the control of differentiation in this system is presented.
