Nucleotide sequence of the bovine group C rotavirus Shintoku strain gene 3 was determined. Segment 3 is 2253 nucleotides (nt) in length and contains a long open reading frame (ORF) beginning at nt 22 and terminating at nt 2223. This ORF encodes a polypeptide of 733 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 83 kDa. The deduced gene 3 amino acid sequence shares 79% and 73% identities with VP4 of the porcine Cowden and human Bristol strains, respectively. Lack of high amino acid sequence homology in VP4 of bovine, porcine, and human group C rotaviruses indicates that the Shintoku strain represents a new P genotype.
