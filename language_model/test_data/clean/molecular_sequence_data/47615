From the culture broth of the mold Trichoderma viride NRRL 5243 a mixture of polypeptides, named trichovirins (TV), could be isolated and purified by chromatography on XAD-2 adsorber resin and Sephadex LH-20 gel. Chromatography on silica gel using chloroform/methanol 8:2 as eluent provided a mixture of peptides named TV I. Subsequent elution with chloroform/methanol 1:1 yielded a second group of peptides named TV II. That group could be separated into individual components by repetitive HPLC on an octadecylsilyl and a fluorocarbon stationary phase. The sequences of 12 peptides of TV II could be determined by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry of isolated peptides and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of methanolysates. The N-termini of the 18-mer peptides are acetylated and the C-termini consist of leucinol. Owing to the presence of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) residues and the bactericidal and hemolytic activity, the peptides belong to the family of peptaibol antibiotics.
