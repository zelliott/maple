A key element in the regulation of mammalian steroid biosynthesis is the 18 kDa peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), which mediates mitochondrial cholesterol import. PBR also possess an affinity to the tetrapyrrole metabolite protoporphyrin. The bacterial homolog to the mammalian PBR, the Rhodobacter TspO (CrtK) protein, was shown to be involved in the bacterial tetrapyrrole metabolism. Looking for a similar mitochondrial import mechanism in plants, protein sequences from Arabidopsis and several other plants were found with significant similarities to the mammalian PBR and to the Rhodobacter TspO protein. A PBR-homologous Arabidopsis sequence was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The recombinant gene product showed specific high affinity benzodiazepine ligand binding. Moreover, the protein applied to E. coli protoplasts caused an equal benzodiazepine-stimulated uptake of cholesterol and protoporphyrin IX. These results suggest that the PBR like protein is involved in steroid import and is directing protoporphyrinogen IX to the mitochondrial site of protoheme formation.
