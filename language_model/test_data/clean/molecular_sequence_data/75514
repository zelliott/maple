The effect of linear homopolymerization on the immunogenicity of synthetic peptides was studied using either haptenic peptides (representing amino acid sequences 103-115 and 133-147 of bovine rotavirus major protein) or immunogenic peptides TD-103-115 and TD-133-147 which were constructed by co-linear synthesis of the former peptides and an amino acid sequence representing a determinant recognized by T helper cells (TD). It was found that the two haptenic peptides were rendered immunogenic by linear homopolymerization. Moreover, homopolymerization also enhanced the immunogenicity of TD-103-115 but not that of TD-133-147. In the three cases where polymerization enhanced immunogenicity, a reinforced amphipathic pattern was predicted in the neighborhood of the junction of the monomers. The possibility that polymerization might have generated a new T cell determinant is discussed.
