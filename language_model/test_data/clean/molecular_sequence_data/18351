The structural organization of the upstream regulatory regions of the apolipoprotein genes is discussed in relation to tissue-specific gene expression. Comparison of the sequences of the regulatory and coding parts of the genes that make up this multigene family shows that some members of the family with homologous coding regions may differ in the organization of their regulatory regions (apoE compared with apoA-IV, apoC-III, or apoC-II). On the other hand, some apolipoprotein genes with different primary structures of their coding regions and different intron-exon organization show similarities in the structural organization of their regulatory regions (e.g. apoC-III and apoB).
