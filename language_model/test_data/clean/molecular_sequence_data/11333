Glucuronyl C5-epimerases catalyze the conversion of D-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) to L-iduronic acid (IdceA) units during the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans. An epimerase implicated in the generation of heparin/heparan sulfate was previously purified to homogeneity from bovine liver (Campbell, P., Hannesson, H. H., Sandbäck, D., Rodén, L., Lindahl, U., and Li, J.-p. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 26953-26958). The present report describes the molecular cloning and functional expression of the lung enzyme. The cloned enzyme contains 444 amino acid residues and has a molecular mass of 49,905 Da. N-terminal sequence analysis of the isolated liver enzyme showed this species to be a truncated form lacking a 73-residue N-terminal domain of the deduced amino acid sequence. The coding cDNA insert was cloned into a baculovirus expression vector and expressed in Sf9 insect cells. Cells infected with recombinant epimerase showed a 20-30-fold increase in enzyme activity, measured as release of 3H2O from a polysaccharide substrate containing C5-3H-labeled hexuronic acid units. Furthermore, incubation of the expressed protein with the appropriate (GlcUA-GlcNSO3)n substrate resulted in conversion of approximately 20% of the GlcUA units into IdceA residues. Northern analysis implicated two epimerase transcripts in both bovine lung and liver tissues, a dominant approximately 9-kilobase (kb) mRNA and a minor approximately 5-kb species. Mouse mastocytoma cells showed only the approximately 5-kb transcript. A comparison of the cloned epimerase with the enzymes catalyzing an analogous reaction in alginate biosynthesis revealed no apparent amino acid sequence similarity.
