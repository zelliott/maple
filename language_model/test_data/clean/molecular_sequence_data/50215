A study was made of the interaction between restriction endonucleases recognizing CCNGG (SsoII and ScrFI) or CCA/TGG (MvaI and EcoRII) DNA sequences and a set of synthetic substrates containing 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-dideoxy-D-ribofuranose or 9-[1'-hydroxy-2'-(hydroxymethyl)ethoxy] methylguanine (gIG) residues replacing either one of the central nucleosides or dG residues in the recognition site. The non-nucleotide inserts (except for gIG) introduced into the recognition site both increase the efficiency of SsoII and change its specificity. A cleavage at the noncanonical position takes place, in some cases in addition to the correct ones. Noncanonical hydrolysis by SsoII occurs at the phosphodiester bond adjacent to the point of modification towards the 5'-end. With the guanine base returned (the substrate with gIG), the correct cleavage position is restored. ScrFI specifically cleaves all the modified substrates. DNA duplexes with non-nucleotide inserts (except for the gIG-containing duplex) are resistant to hydrolysis by MvaI and EcoRII. Prompted by the data obtained we discuss the peculiarities of recognition by restriction endonucleases of 5-membered DNA sequences which have completely or partially degenerated central base pairs. It is suggested that SsoII forms a complex with DNA in an 'open' form.
