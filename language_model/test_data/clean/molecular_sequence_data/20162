Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), an inhibitor of insulin signalling, was characterized in Aedes aegypti. Surprisingly, six splice variants were identified: three with alternative terminal exons (AaegPTEN2 : 3 : 6) and three formed by intron retention (AaegPTEN1 : 4 : 5). All variants encoded active phosphatase domains. Variants with alternative terminal exons also encoded C2 and COOH-domains, and AaegPTEN6 encoded a PDZ binding motif. These three variants also had unique expression patterns. AaegPTEN2 was expressed primarily in the ovary. AaegPTEN3 was predominant in heads and midguts, and throughout development, except early embryogenesis. AaegPTEN6 was expressed in fat body, ovaries, and throughout development. Intron retention variants were weakly expressed in most samples. These expression patterns suggest that AaegPTEN variants play unique roles in regulating insulin's pleiotropic effects.
