Various components of the beta-casein fraction from bovine milk were separated by preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). They included the genetic variants beta A1, beta A2, beta A3, and an unknown component previously denoted beta X [S. Visser et al., J. Chromatogr. 548 (1991) 361-370]. Tryptic digests of these components were compared by RP-HPLC and most peaks were analysed by mass spectrometry (MS). The tryptic map of beta X was closest to that of beta A1, but with a few mutually different peak components. Electrospray ionisation MS revealed that in the beta X map these components had relative molecular masses of 16 higher than the corresponding ones in the beta A1 map. The main differential peaks represented the 114-169 fragments of beta A1 and beta X, respectively, which were both purified and then cleaved with cyanogen bromide. In the resulting mixtures, each of which contained three fragments, the corresponding peptides representing the 145-156 sequence showed the 16 relative molecular mass difference. In beta X this sequence contained a Leu residue at position 152 instead of the Pro-152 in beta A1, as established by fast-atom bombardment MS-MS. The Leu could be discriminated from an Ile residue by the presence of a side-chain-specific, D-type fragment ion in the MS-MS spectrum of the beta X CNBr peptide. The sequence of the two homologous 145-156 fragments was confirmed by regular amino acid sequence analysis. In accordance with internationally accepted guidelines for the nomenclature of milk proteins, the new genetic variant has been named beta-casein F-5P.
