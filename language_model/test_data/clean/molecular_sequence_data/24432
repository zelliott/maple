The phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) is widespread among bacteria where it mediates carbohydrate uptake and often serves in carbon control. Here we present cloning and analysis of the monocistronic ptsI gene of Corynebacterium glutamicum R, which encodes PTS Enzyme I (EI). EI catalyzes the first reaction of PTS and the reported ptsI was shown to complement the corresponding defect in Escherichia coli. The deduced 59.2-kDa EI of 564 amino acids shares more than 50% homology with EIs from Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, and Lactobacillus sake. Chromosomal inactivation of ptsI demonstrated that EI plays an indispensable role in PTS of C. glutamicum R and this system represents a dominant sugar uptake system. Cellobiose was only transported and utilized in adaptive mutants of C. glutamicum R. Cellobiose transport was also found to be PTS-dependent and repressed by PTS sugar glucose.
