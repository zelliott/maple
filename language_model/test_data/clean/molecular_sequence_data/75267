The Fos protein complex and several Fos-related antigens bind directly or indirectly to a common sequence element that is similar to the consensus binding site for HeLa cell activator protein 1 (AP-1). This element is present in a negative regulatory sequence in the differentiation-sensitive adipocyte gene, aP2; in a transcriptional enhancer for the Gibbon ape leukemia virus; and in a region of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long terminal repeat partially characterized as a negative regulatory element. The protein level and binding activity of Fos and Fos-related antigens increase rapidly after calcium ionophore treatment of a CD4+ human lymphoblast cell line, H9. These data suggest that several proteins may associate with the AP-1 binding site. Moreover, temporally regulated control of the level of each protein could represent a mechanism for modulation of these putative mediators of gene expression.
