We discovered the presence of a unique spliceosomal intron in the F1 copy of elongation factor-1alpha (EF-1alpha) restricted to the bee family Colletidae (Hymenoptera: Apoidae). The intron ranges in size from 101 to 1044 bp and shows no positional sliding. Our data also demonstrate the complete absence of this intron from exemplars representing all other bee families, as well as from close hymenopteran relatives. A review of the literature finds that this intron is likewise absent from all other arthropods for which data are available. This provides unambiguous evidence for a relatively recent intron insertion event in the colletid common ancestor and, at least in this specific instance, lends support to the introns-late hypothesis. The comparative distribution of this novel intron also supports the monophyly of Colletidae and the exclusion of the Stenotritidae from this family, providing an example of the potential of some introns to act as robust markers of shared descent.
