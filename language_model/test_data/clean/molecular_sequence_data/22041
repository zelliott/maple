Leuconostoc argentinum, Leuconostoc lactis and ten related strains from Romanian dairy products formed a single cluster, clearly separated from other Leuconostoc species, after numerical analysis of repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR patterns, whole-cell protein profiles (SDS-PAGE) and fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP) band patterns. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis confirmed a very high similarity between both type strains and representative dairy isolates (>99.6 %). DNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed high relatedness values between the type strains of L. argentinum and L. lactis and between these strains and representative Romanian strains. These data and the lack of phenotypic distinctive characteristics demonstrate that L. argentinum and L. lactis are synonymous.
