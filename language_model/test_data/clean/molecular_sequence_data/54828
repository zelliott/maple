5,8-Linoleate diol synthase (5,8-LDS) of Aspergillus fumigatus was cloned, expressed, and compared with 7,8-LDS of the Take-all fungus. Replacements of Tyr and Cys in the conserved YRWH and FXXGPHXCLG sequences abolished 8R-dioxygenase (8-DOX) and hydroperoxide isomerase activities, respectively. The predicted α-helices of LDS were aligned with α-helices of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) to identify the 8-DOX domains. N-terminal expression constructs of 5,8- and 7,8-LDS (674 of 1079, and 673 of 1165 residues), containing one additional α-helix compared to cyclooxygenase-1, yielded prominent 8R-DOX activities with apparently unchanged or slightly lower substrate affinities, respectively. Val-328 of 5,8-LDS did not influence the position of oxygenation in contrast to the homologous residues Val-349 of COX-1 and Leu-384 of 10R-dioxygenase. We conclude that ~675 amino acids are sufficient to support 8-DOX activity.
