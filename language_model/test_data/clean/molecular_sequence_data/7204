The cyclophilins are a family of proteins that exhibit peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase, EC 5.2.1.8) activity and bind the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A (CsA) to varying degrees. We have isolated a cDNA clone encoding a novel cyclophilin from the human filarial parasite Brugia malayi. This gene possesses an N-terminal domain homologous to cyclophilins from diverse phyla (49-60% amino acid sequence identity) and a hydrophilic C-terminal domain. The cyclophilin domain was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and found to possess peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity, with a kcat/Km value of 7.9 x 10(6) M-1 s-1. A histidine residue in lieu of tryptophan in the highly conserved CsA-binding site suggests that B. malayi cyclophilin is more closely related to the cyclophilin-like proteins described recently from natural killer (NK) cells, plants, and the 40 kDa cyclophilins from mammals. In accordance with the histidine-containing CsA-binding domain, the B. malayi enzyme was relatively insensitive to inhibition by CsA, since an IC50 value of 860 nM (compared to 19 nM for human cyclophilin A) was determined.
