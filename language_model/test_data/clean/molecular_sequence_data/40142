Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an arrhythmogenic disease characterized by adrenergic-induced arrhythmias in the form of bidirectional and PVT. CPVT is a distinct clinical entity associated with a high mortality rate of up to 50% by the age of 30 yr. Recently, the molecular diagnostics of this disease have become increasingly important because underlying mutations can be found in more than 60% of the identified CPVT patients. Along with the fact that treatment with beta-blockers has a favorable outcome in CPVT patients, and given the risk of sudden death, the identification of causative mutations in CPVT is important because it can greatly augment early diagnosis and subsequent preventive strategies. In this chapter, we describe the molecular diagnostics, as performed in our lab, of the three genes known to be involved in CPVT, the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene, the cardiac calsequestrin gene, and the inwardly rectifying potassium channel KCNJ2.
