Bacterial translation initiation factor IF2 is a multidomain protein that is an essential component of a system for ensuring that protein synthesis begins at the correct codon within a messenger RNA. Full-length IF2 from Escherichia coli and seven fragments of the protein were expressed, purified, and characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) methods. Interestingly, resonances of the 6 kD IF2N domain located at the extreme N terminus of IF2 can be clearly identified within the NMR spectra of the full-length 97-kD protein. (15)N NMR relaxation rate data indicate that (1) the IF2N domain is internally well ordered and tumbles in solution in a manner that is independent of the other domains of the IF2 protein, and (2) the IF2N domain is connected to the C-terminal regions of IF2 by a flexible linker. Chemical shifts of resonances within the isolated IF2N domain do not significantly differ from those of the corresponding residues within the context of the full-length 97-kD protein, indicating that IF2N is a structurally independent unit that does not strongly interact with other regions of IF2. CD and NMR data together provide evidence that Domains I-III of IF2 have unstructured and flexible regions as well as substantial helical content; CD data indicate that the helical content of these regions decreases significantly at temperatures above 35 degrees C. The features of structurally well-ordered N- and C-terminal domains connected by a flexible linker with significant helical content are reminiscent of another translation initiation factor, IF3.
