Phosphoglycerate kinase sequences were obtained for 313 aligned bases of 41 individuals from 39 marsupial species. In contrast to previous molecular analyses, the relationships suggested by these data show a high level of congruence with morphologically defined orders and families. Four main monophyletic lineages are recognizable. These are the monogeneric orders Microbiotheria (Dromiciops australis) and Notoryctemorphia (Notoryctes typhlops), a grouping of the American orders Didelphimorphia and Paucituberculata, and the Australasian species other than N. typhlops. Within the Australasian lineage, there are again four main monophyletic groups; the Dasyuridae, two peramelemorph (bandicoot) lineages (one comprised of pseudogene sequences) and the Diprotodontia. This topology is not greatly affected by the exclusion of pseudogenes except that a clade of syndactylous species (Peramelemorphia plus Diprotodontia) is recovered. Two other peramelemorph pseudogenes have inserts of about 1 kb with high levels of similarity to LINE 1 elements. The Diprotodontia is notable for its relative lack of intersequence variation in comparison to the Dasyuromorphia.
