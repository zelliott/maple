The pseudorabies virus glycoprotein III (PrV-gIII) has been identified previously as the major viral component binding to a heparin-like receptor on the surface of target cells. The amino acid sequence of gIII contains three regions corresponding to consensus sequences for heparin binding. A synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 134 to 141 of PrV-gIII bound heparin in a dot blot assay. In contrast, a synthetic peptide derived from amino acids 290-299 of PrV-gIII did not bind heparin. We therefore conclude that the region containing amino acid 134-141 is involved in binding to the heparin-like cellular receptor.
