To investigate the structural basis of anion selectivity of Drosophila GABA-gated Cl(-) channels, the permeation properties of wild-type and mutant channels were studied in Xenopus oocytes. This work focused on asparagine 319, which by homology is one amino acid away from a putative extracellular ring of charge that regulates cation permeation in nicotinic receptors. Mutation of this residue to aspartate reduced channel conductance, and mutation to lysine or arginine increased channel conductance. These results are consistent with an electrostatic interaction between this site and permeating anions. The lysine mutant, but not the arginine mutant, formed a channel that is permeable to cations, and this cannot be explained in terms of electrostatics. The lysine mutant had a 25-mV reversal potential in solutions with symmetrical Cl(-) and asymmetrical cations. The permeability ratio of K(+) to Cl(-) was determined as 0. 33 from reversal potential measurements in KCl gradients. Experiments with large organic cations and anions showed that cation permeation can only be seen in the presence of Cl(-), but Cl(-) permeation can be seen in the absence of permeant cations. Measurements of permeability ratios of organic anions indicated that the lysine mutant has an increased pore size. The cation permeability of the lysine-containing mutant channel cannot be accounted for by a simple electrostatic interaction with permeating ions. It is likely that lysine substitution causes a structural change that extends beyond this one residue to influence the positions of other channel-forming residues. Thus protein conformation plays an important role in enabling ion channels to distinguish between anions and cations.
