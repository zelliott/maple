Molecular ecological techniques were applied to analyze the bacterial diversity of two oligotrophic microbial fuel cells (MFCs) enriched using river water or artificial wastewater (AWW) as fuel. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the PCR amplified 16S rDNA showed that different microbial communities were present in the two MFCs and these were different from the river sediment used to initiate the enrichment. Nearly complete 16S rDNA was amplified and sequenced. Over 80% of the clones were Proteobacteria. Betaproteobacteria were the dominant clones (46.2%) in MFCs fed with river water, and about 64.4% of the clones in MFCs fed with AWW were Alphaproteobacteria. Actinobacteria were found only in the MFC fed with AWW, and Deltaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi and Verrucomicrobia in the MFC fed with river water. Many clones were related to uncultured bacteria, some with homology less than 95%, indicating that many novel bacteria were enriched in the oligotrophic MFCs.
