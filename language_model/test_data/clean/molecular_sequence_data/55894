By using spinal cord neurons cultured in chemically defined medium, a double labeling procedure, and blockage with antisense oligonucleotides, we show that induction of c-fos and the subsequent transactivation of the prodynorphin gene are coupled events, triggered by serotonin1A receptor agonists. Addition of the specific 1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) to the culture, at concentrations similar to that needed for transactivation of the prodynorphin gene, also significantly increases cAMP levels. Furthermore, in rats depleted of serotonin by intrathecal administration of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, the induction of prodynorphin after noxious stimulation is dramatically decreased compared with the induction in sham-operated rats. These results suggest that the expression of the prodynorphin gene in spinal cord is under the control of the raphe-spinal efferents containing serotonin.
