The rat possesses two pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitors (PSTI-61 and -56). PSTI-61 has been known to stimulate cholecystokinin (CCK) release, whereas PSTI-56 did not. Both PSTIs are synthesized in the pancreatic acinar cells. CCK has a trophic effect on pancreatic acinar cells, and the exclusion of bile-pancreatic juice from the intestine has been known to be a most potent stimulator of CCK release. In the present study, we examined whether the mRNA levels of PSTI-61 and -56 produced by bile-pancreatic juice diversion were different from each other and compared the changes in CCK mRNA levels in the small intestinal mucosa and the plasma and intestinal CCK concentrations. Male Wistar rats were prepared with internal fistula and bile-pancreatic juice was excluded from the proximal intestine, being introduced into the distal ileum. Rats were sacrificed 1, 3, and 7 days after the operation. The concentrations of plasma and intestinal CCK and the levels of mRNA of CCK in the intestinal mucosa and PSTIs in the pancreas were significantly increased by bile-pancreatic juice diversion. The increase in the mRNA level of PSTI-61 was significantly higher than that of PSTI-56. Administration of CCK antagonist inhibited these changes but administration of CCK agonist could not fully reproduce these changes. These studies suggest that bile-pancreatic juice regulates gene expression of CCK and PSTIs and that the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression of PSTI-61 and -56 may be different.
