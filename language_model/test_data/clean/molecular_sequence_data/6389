DNA polymorphisms generated by the random amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction (RAPD PCR) were used to analyse 41 isolates investigated in the European Fusarium sambucinum Project (EFSP). Employing ten arbitrary (10-mer) oigonucleotides and simple repeat sequences (M13, (GACA)4) as single primers, informative banding patterns typical for identifying European populations of Fusarium sambucinum Fuckel s. str., F. torulosum (Berk. & Curt.) Nirenberg and F. venenatum Nirenberg were obtained.
