An interferon-induced 15-kDa protein is synthesized from a precursor of higher molecular weight; the precursor contains 165 amino acids (17 kDa), whereas the stable product (15 kDa) contains 156 amino acids. The stable 15-kDa form is derived from the precursor 17-kDa form by the removal of eight amino acids from the COOH terminus and the methionine from the NH2 terminus. The existence of the precursor 17-kDa protein can be demonstrated after brief periods of in vivo labeling with [35S]methionine and by translation of mRNA in vitro.
