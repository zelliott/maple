In this article, we document the first complete genome sequence of an isolate of bluetongue virus serotype 16 (BTV16) from a goat in India. The virus was isolated from an in-contact goat from an animal farm in Chennai where clinical disease occurs in sheep. The total size of the genome is 19,185 bp. The information provided for full-length sequences of all 10 segments will help in understanding the geographical origin and transmission of the Indian isolate of BTV16 as well as its comparison with global isolates of BTV16 of sheep, cattle, and other host species origins.
