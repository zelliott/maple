We previously reported the isolation of novel methanogens by using a new cultivation method, referred to as the coculture method. Here, we extended our coculture method to various anaerobic environmental samples. As a result, we successfully cultivated some uncharacterized methanogens in coculture enrichments and eventually isolated a new methanogen, within the order Methanomicrobiales.
