Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a rare autosomal dominant disease, characterized by the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas. The NF2 gene has been assigned to chromosome 22. Cataract and other eye abnormalities are frequently seen in NF2 patients. The specific association of eye abnormalities and NF2 might be caused by a genetic change on chromosome 22 that affects both the NF2 gene and a physically linked crystallin gene. In order to test this hypothesis, we regionally localized the known crystallin genes (i.e. CRYBB2, CRYBB2P1, CRYBB3, and CRYBA4) on chromosome 22. Crystallin gene-specific probes were hybridized to an extended panel of human x rodent somatic cell hybrids containing various portions of chromosome 22. It was found that all crystallin genes map to a very small region on chromosome 22 that is physically separate from the NF2 gene region by at least 160 kb of DNA. In addition, we found that the beta B crystallin genes (CRYBB2, CRYBB2P1, and CRYBB3) are clustered on a 300 kb SacII fragment and that the beta A4 crystallin gene (CRYBA4) is not part of this cluster. We conclude that the ocular manifestations in many NF2 patients are probably not the primary consequence of rearrangements on chromosome 22 that involve both the NF2 gene and a nearby beta crystallin gene.
