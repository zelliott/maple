A bacterial isolate, strain XM415(T), obtained from soil of Tibet in China was characterized using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Strain XM415(T) was aerobic, Gram-negative, gliding, rod-shaped, oxidase-negative and catalase-positive. Strain XM415(T) showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Lysobacter niastensis GH41-7(T) (96.0 %). Ubiquinone Q-8 and branched fatty acids, such as iso-C(16 : 0) (24.0 %), iso-C(15 : 0) (22.6 %), iso-C(17 : 1)omega9c (6.7 %), iso-C(14 : 0) (6.1 %) and iso-C(11 : 0) 3-OH (5.2 %), were predominant in strain XM415(T) as well as in all type strains of recognized Lysobacter species. The DNA G+C content of XM415(T) was 63.5 mol%. The genotypic and phenotypic data show that strain XM415(T) represents a novel species of the genus Lysobacter, for which the name Lysobacter ximonensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is XM415(T) (=CCTCC AB 207091(T) =NRRL B-51263(T)).
