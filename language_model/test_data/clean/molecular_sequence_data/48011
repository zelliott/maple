The suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) method was used to isolate differentially expressed genes during carnation flower maturation. Five cDNA clones, designated as carnation flower maturation-induced (CFMI), were verified as flower maturation-induced cDNAs. Sequence analysis of five CFMI (CFMI-5, CFMI-6, CFMI-7, CFMI-9, and CFMI-10) clones revealed that one of the clones, CFMI-5, showed high sequence similarity to the cysteine proteinase inhibitor gene, predicted to be involved in flower maturation. The full length cDNA clone CFMI-5 was 531 nucleotides (nts) long and consisted of an open reading frame of 294 nucleotides, encoding a 98 amino acid protein, 12 nucleotides of 5'-untranslated region and 3'-untranslated region (225 nts) with a poly(A)+ tail. The predicted CFMI-5 amino acid sequence had a conserved sequence Gln-Val-Val-Ala-Gly, which corresponds to the active site of proteinase inhibition. Northern blot analysis revealed tissue-specific expression of CFMI-5 transcripts, as the transcripts were expressed preferentially in petals and styles. A PCR-based cDNA subtraction method, termed suppression subtractive hybridization, was identified as a rapid method to screen differentially expressed genes in a short time.
