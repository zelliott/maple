A sensitive method for detection of pathogenic Entamoeba histolytica DNA in drained fluids from liver abscess patients, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), has been developed. The PCR employs oligonucleotide primers specific for the gene encoding the 30 kDa molecule of pathogenic E. histolytica. Liver abscess fluids (19 samples), from 14 patients with a presumptive amebic liver abscess, were examined microscopically and by the PCR method. Only two of the 19 samples were positive microscopically, whereas all 19 samples tested positive by PCR. This technique can be used to confirm the diagnosis of amebic liver abscess.
