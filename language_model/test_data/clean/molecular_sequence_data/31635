Human adenovirus (HAdV) type 14 had been infrequently associated with outbreaks of febrile respiratory illness (FRI) until the HAdV-14p1 emerged in 2006 and rapidly spread in the United States. Here, we report an outbreak of FRI caused by HadV-14p1 that occurred in 2011 at a primary and middle school in China.

The basic information of the outbreak was recored; throat swabs were collected from 17 patients, polymerase chain reaction, A549 cell culture, and sequencing were used to identify the pathogen of the outbreak..

Total of 43 students were infected in this outbreak. Boys were more than girls. We identified 11 HAdV-positive specimens and 6 HAdV isolates. Genetic analysis showed that the complete hexon, fiber, and E1A sequences of isolates were nearly 100% identical with other HAdV-14p1 sequences deposited in GenBank.

HadV-14p1 has caused outbreaks of pneumonia and mortality among adults in the United States and Europe. It may cause similar conditions among Chinese adults due to poor hygiene and sanitation. It seems prudent for China to develop a national surveillance system to determine the etiology of severe respiratory diseases and deaths among adults and school-aged children.
