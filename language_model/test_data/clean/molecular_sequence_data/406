Deletion and alanine-substitution mutants of the Tomato spotted wilt virus NSm protein were generated to identify domains involved in tubule formation, movement and symptomatology using a heterologous Tobacco mosaic virus expression system. Two regions of NSm, G(19)-S(159) and G(209)-V(283), were required for both tubule formation in protoplasts and cell-to-cell movement in plants, indicating a correlation between these activities. Three amino acid groups, D(154), EYKK(205-208) and EEEEE(284-288) were linked with long-distance movement in Nicotiana benthamiana. EEEEE(284-288) was essential for NSm-mediated long-distance movement, whereas D(154) was essential for tubule formation and cell-to-cell movement; indicating separate genetic controls for cell-to-cell and long-distance movement. The region I(57)-N(100) was identified as the determinant of foliar necrosis in Nicotiana benthamiana, and mutagenesis of HH(93-94) greatly reduced necrosis. These findings are likely applicable to other tospovirus species, especially those within the 'New World' group as NSm sequences are highly conserved.
