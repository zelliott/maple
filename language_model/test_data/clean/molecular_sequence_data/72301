We report the discovery of four novel human putative G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) genes. Gene GPR20 was isolated by amplifying genomic DNA with oligos based on the opioid and somatostatin related receptor genes and subsequent screening of a genomic library. Also, using our customized search procedure of a database of expressed sequence tags (dbEST), cDNA sequences that partially encoded novel GPCRs were identified. These cDNA fragments were obtained and used to screen a genomic library to isolate the full-length coding region of the genes. This resulted in the isolation of genes GPR21, GPR22 and GPR23. The four encoded receptors share significant identity to each other and to other members of the receptor family. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of GPR20 and GPR22 in several human brain regions while GPR20 expression was detected also in liver. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to map GPR20 to chromosome 8q, region 24.3-24.2, GPR21 to chromosome 9, region q33, GPR22 to chromosome 7, region q22-q31.1, and GPR23 to chromosome X, region q13-q21.1.
