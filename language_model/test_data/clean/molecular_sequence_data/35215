To assess the association between a rs7903146(C/T) polymorphism of TCF7L2 gene and metabolic syndrome (MS), plasma lipoprotein, and plasma adiponectin (PA) in Chinese Korean and Han populations from Yanbian region.

Polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing were used to determine the genotype of rs7903146 in 310 Chinese Korean (190 in case group and 120 in control group) and 344 Chinese Han (255 in case group and 89 in control group). ELIAS was used to test serum insulin (INS) and PA.

The frequency of T allele was higher in ethnic Han compared with ethnic Koreans (0.022 vs. 0.008), lower than that of Europeans (0.279) and Africans (0.257), but similar to those of Beijing Chinese and Japanese. For ethnic Korean Chinese, the frequencies of TT and CT genotypes as well as the T allele in patients with EH were significantly higher than those of the control group (P< 0.01), which also showed an increasing trend for both MS and T2DM groups (P=0.09 and P=0.07, respectively). By contrast, for Chinese Han, the frequencies of genotypes and particular allele in patients with MS, T2DM and EH showed no significant difference from those of the control group. For T2DM, EH, and control groups, PA level of individuals with CT or TT genotypes was significantly higher compared with that of the CC genotype (P< 0.05). The TC and LDL-C levels were significantly higher in T2DM, MS and EH groups compared with those of the control group. The PA level was lower in MS group compared with the control group.

The T allele of SNP rs7903146 of TCF7L2 gene may be a risk factor for EH in Chinese Korean population from Yanbian region. The T allele also affects the PA level; lower PA is a risk factor for MS. The rs7903146 polymorphism showed a racial and ethnic difference.
