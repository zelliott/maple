Dehydration-Responsive Element Binding ( DREB) transcription factors, specifically binding with dehydration reponsive element (DRE), activate a variety of stress-responsive genes in plants under abiotic stresses (dehydration, high salt and low temperature). Using PCR and homologous EST search, we isolated a DREB-like gene from Yinxin poplar (Populus alba x P. alba var. pyramidalis) named PaDREB2. Yeast One-hybrid experiment demonstrated that PaDREB2 protein could function as a DREB transcription factor activating target gene expression by specifically binding to DRE cis-element. To study the expression pattern of PaDREB2, RT-PCR was carried out. And the results showed that PaDREB2 is induced by low temperature, drought and high salt.
