Identification and characterization of eight enterovirus 71 samples isolated from Yunnan province.

Collecting specimens from cases of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD), samples were identificated by RT-PCR, isolated the virus with cells. The isolating virus passaged in vero cells, and the vpl genes sequencing. Immunization the mice with the virus, neutralization test and cross-protection test were conducted with those antisera.

All samples were identified as EV71, and eight strains had cytopathic effect (CPE) in vero cells, some antisera titers were more than 1:10,000.

Eight strains of the virus grow well in vero cell, antiserum showed protection against EV71 A and C4 genotype.
