A synthetic gene coding for human angiogenin was cloned in pUR290 plasmid in frame with beta-galactosidase, both parts of the resultant fused protein being joined through an Asp-Pro sequence. The fused protein, synthesised in E. coli cells upon IPTG induction and isolated as inclusion bodies, possessed angiogenic activity on the chick chorioallantois membrane and was cleaved upon acid treatment to yield free angiogenin.
