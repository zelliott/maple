The putative repressor protein Cng (10kDa on an SDS gel) for the lytic pathway of Lactobacillus plantarum phage &phi;g1e was purified using the Escherichia coli Pt7 system, and its DNA-binding ability for the seven operator-like sequences, the GATAC-boxes (Gb1 to Gb7), was investigated in vitro. In gel-shift assays, Cng selectively bound to the DNA fragments containing the GATAC-box(es). In addition, DNase I footprinting analysis with supercoiled DNA demonstrated that Cng can specifically cover about a 25bp region centered around each of the GATAC-boxes, although two boxes, Gb4 and Gb6, were only partially protected. Moreover, protein crosslinking experiments using glutaraldehyde suggested that Cng most likely functions as a dimer. On the other hand, the binding ability of Cpg for the GATAC-boxes in supercoiled DNA was also examined under the same conditions as in Cng; unlike Cng, Cpg covered Gb4 and Gb6 completely sufficiently as well as the other five boxes. Thus, the present and previous [Kakikawa et al., Gene 215 (1998) 371-379; 242 (2000) 155-166] results indicate a possibility that the two proteins Cng and Cpg selectively bind to the GATAC-boxes that act as operators, and can decide between the lytic or lysogenic pathways through repression of the promoter activity of P(R) as well as P(L).
