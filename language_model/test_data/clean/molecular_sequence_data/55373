With the intensive application of sulfonamides in aquaculture and animal husbandry and the increase of sulfonamides discharged into the environments, there is an increasing need to find a way to remediate sulfonamide-contaminated environments. Two bacterial strains capable of degrading sulfonamides, HS21 and HS51, were isolated from marine environments. HS21 and HS51 were identified as members of Escherichia sp. and Acinetobacter sp., respectively, based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Degradation of each sulfonamide by Escherichia sp. HS21 and Acinetobacter sp. HS51 was characterized using capillary electrophoresis. About 66 or 72% of sulfapyridine and 45 or 67% of sulfathiazole contained in the media was degraded by Escherichia sp. HS21 or Acinetobacter sp. HS51, respectively, after incubation for 2Â days. The supernatant from culture of Escherichia sp. HS21 or Acinetobacter sp. HS51 grown in sulfapyridine or sulfathiazole contained media had much attenuated cytotoxicity against HeLa cells. These results suggest that Escherichia sp. HS21 and Acinetobacter sp. HS51 are new bacterial resources for biodegrading sulfonamides and indicate the potential of isolated strains for the bioremediation of sulfonamide-polluted environments.
