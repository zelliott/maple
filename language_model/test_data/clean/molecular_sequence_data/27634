Refined secondary structure models supported by phylogenetic evidence have been derived for the 3' terminal domain of large subunit rRNA (the region that exists as a separate 4.5 S molecular entity in chloroplast ribosomes) through a comparative analysis of all the pro- and eukaryotic sequences at present available. While several universally conserved features of secondary structure are found, a few diversified structural elements are also detected which are specific to one of the primary kingdoms, eubacteria, archaebacteria, or eukaryotes. Remarkably, some appear to be selectively preserved during the evolution of the primary kindgom, suggesting they represent functionally important structures. Thus, although the role of this 3' terminal domain in ribosomal function still remains unknown, its mode of sequence variation clearly points to a significant diversification of its function among the primary kindgoms.
