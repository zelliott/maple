We have examined the amino terminal membrane anchoring domain of Arabidopsis thaliana 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (Hmg1p), a key enzyme of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. Using both in vitro and in vivo approaches, we have analyzed a series of recombinant derivatives to identify key structural elements which play a role in defining Hmg1p transmembrane topology. Based on our results, we have proposed a topological model for Hmg1p in which the enzyme spans the lipid bilayer twice. We have shown the two transmembrane segments, designated TMS1 and TMS2, to be structurally and functionally inequivalent in their ability to direct the targeting and orientation of reporter proteins. Furthermore, we provide evidence indicating both the extreme amino terminal end and carboxyl terminal domain of the protein reside in the cytosol. This model therefore provides a key basis for the future examination of the role of the transmembrane domain in the targeting and regulation of Hmg1p in plant cells.
