Comparison in virus-seeded mineral water of three detection methods for enteroviruses, direct hybridization, cell culture, and reverse transcription into cDNA followed by polymerase chain reaction and hybridization, showed that the last procedure was 10 to 1,000 times more sensitive than detection by cell culture and 10(5) to 10(7) times more sensitive than direct hybridization. The presence of naturally occurring enteroviruses was also demonstrated in activated sludge and in concentrated and non-concentrated surface water samples by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-hybridization. However, in activated sludge and in concentrated surface waters, enzymatic amplification was sometimes inhibited by contaminants.
