The zeste locus plays a central role in transvection phenomena, where the synaptic pairing of chromosomes carrying genes with which zeste interacts influences the expression of these genes. To explore the possible functions of the zeste gene product in this process, we have determined the DNA sequences both of a fragment of Drosophila genomic DNA capable of rescuing mutant zeste phenotypes, and of a near full-length cDNA clone derived from the 2.4-kb zeste mRNA. These data show that the zeste gene is interrupted by two small introns, and suggest that the majority of zeste sequences are contained within an intron of another transcriptional unit of opposite polarity. A large region of the predicted zeste product is comprised almost exclusively of glutamine and alanine residues. A domain near the N terminus of this protein, which is sufficient for site-specific DNA binding, is highly charged, as is the C-terminal region of the protein. A breakpoint of the rearrangement In (1)e(bx), which is associated with a za-like phenotype, is found within sequences encoding the zeste product, and would produce a truncated protein. The neomorphic mutation zv77h is correlated with a 300-bp deletion of sequences determining the untranslated 5' leader of the zeste messenger, but may also remove the initiating ATG codon, resulting in a zeste protein with an altered N terminus.
