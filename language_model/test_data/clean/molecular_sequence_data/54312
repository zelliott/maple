Benazolin-ethyl has been used on a wide range of weeds present in various crops since 1964. Because benazolin-ethyl is a potential hazard to the environment and human health, it is important to remove this herbicide from the environment. However, to the best of our knowledge, no report is available in the literature regarding the microbial degradation of benazolin-ethyl by bacteria. In this study, one strain named cd-1, which is capable of degrading benazolin-ethyl, was isolated from benazolin-ethyl wastewater treatment pool. The isolate was identified as Methyloversatilis sp. according to its morphological, physiological, biochemical properties, and 16S rRNA gene sequences analysis. This strain utilizes benazolin-ethyl as the sole carbon source. and degrades 100 mg l⁻¹ benazolin-ethyl to non-detectable level within 48 h. Three metabolites were identified as benazolin, 7-chloro-3-methylbenzo[d]thiazol-2(3H)-one, and 2-chloro-6-(methyleneamino)benzenethiol based on the MS/MS and GC/MS analyses. The first step involved in the degradation of benazolin-ethyl was the cleavage of the ester bond to form benazolin. Benazolin was subsequently subjected to demethylation for decomposition into 7-chloro-3-methylbenzo[d]thiazol-2(3H)-one and methanol. The last step was to form 2-chloro-6-(methyleneamino)benzenethiol.
