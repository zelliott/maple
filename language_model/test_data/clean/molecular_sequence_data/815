Neuroendocrine regulatory peptides (NERP)-1 and NERP-2 are derived from distinct regions of VGF, a neurosecretory protein that was originally identified as a product of a nerve growth factor-responsive gene in rat PC12 cells. The amino acid length of human NERP-1 is 26, and that of rat NERP-1 is 25. Human and rat NERP-2 are both 38 amino acid peptides. NERPs colocalize with vasopressin in the storage granules of the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei in the hypothalamus of both rats and humans. Administration of NERPs suppresses hypertonic saline- or angiotensin II-induced vasopressin release from the hypothalamus and pituitary. Thus, VGF is a precursor of multiple bioactive peptides with diverse neuroendocrine functions, and NERPs are novel hypothalamic peptides involved in the control of body fluid homeostasis by regulating vasopressin release.
