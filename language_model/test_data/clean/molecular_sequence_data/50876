The primary structure of the bovine retinal calcium binding protein P26 has been determined by the parallel analysis of the protein and the corresponding cDNA. This protein is identical to recovering and shares 59% homology with visinin, a cone specific calcium binding protein from chicken retina. P26 was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein and, after purification by affinity chromatography on IgG-Sepharose 6, cleaved off with enteropeptidase.
