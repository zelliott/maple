The entire rat pepsinogen C gene has been isolated from a rat genomic library, using the rat pepsinogen C cDNA as a probe. Southern blot analysis showed that there exists at least two rat pepsinogen C genes. The nucleotide sequences of the coding regions and the 5'- and 3'-flanking regions of one of the rat pepsinogen C genes have been determined. This gene is split into 9 exons interrupted by eight intervening sequences. The 5'-flanking region is similar to that of the human pepsinogen C gene, but only the former has the core sequence of the Sp1 binding site. The amount of transcripts of the rat pepsinogen C genes was found to increase during development, and a similar increase was shown to be induced by injection of hydrocortisone. As a candidate of a factor which regulates the transcription, we found a 25-kDa protein by Southwestern blotting. It binds to a specific site in the 5'-flanking region of the gene only in the presence of Mg2+ ion, and it is present in the nuclear fraction of the gastric mucosa but not of the liver.
