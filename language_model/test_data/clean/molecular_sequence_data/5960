A number of cellular proteins and viral spike proteins are cleaved at a basic recognition sequence. To characterize the membrane traffic step at which this proteolysis occurs we have studied the intracellular processing site of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) spike precursor p62 in BHK21 cells. The p62 is endoproteolytically cleaved at a tetrabasic Arg-His-Arg-Arg recognition sequence. Previously, it has been shown that the SFV p62 remains uncleaved when accumulated to the trans-Golgi network (TGN/20 degrees C block site). We show here that exit from the trans-Golgi is required for the cleavage of p62. Proteolytic processing was inhibited in synchronized assays when the 20 degrees C transport block was released in the presence of brefeldin A, energy inhibitors (azide and deoxyglucose; carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, CCCP) or an effector of trimeric G proteins, AlFn. Endocytosed antibodies against the SFV spike glycoproteins or antibodies against a peptide corresponding to the enzymatically active motif of furin inhibited cleavage of p62 at a post-TGN location. The results indicate a post-TGN communication step between exocytic and endocytic elements. Kinetic experiments suggested that this communication may involve an early compartment of the endocytic pathway.
