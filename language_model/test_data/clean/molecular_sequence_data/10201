Spinach plastocyanin has been expressed in Escherichia coli and exported to the periplasmic space. The effects of codon usage, expression system, growth length, and temperature on expression levels in LB medium were investigated. A stretch of codons, rare in E. coli, was identified and replaced with highly expressed codons, increasing the yield by at least 20%. Plastocyanin was more efficiently expressed under the T7 promoter than under the lac promoter. Maximum yields were obtained at 37 degrees C when growing the cells for 16 h after induction. The optimized expression system produced 38 mg holoprotein per liter culture. In this system it was also possible to express plastocyanin in minimal medium, at a yield of 10 mg per liter. N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry showed that plastocyanin was correctly processed. The expressed plastocyanin was purified to homogeneity, as shown by an A278/A597 ratio of 1.0, and together with amino acid analysis and the determination of oxidized and total copper contents, both the absorption coefficients for epsilon 278 and for epsilon 597 were determined to be 4700 M-1 cm-1.
