We have previously shown that type I procollagen pro-alpha1(I) chains from an osteogenesis imperfecta patient (OI26) with a frameshift mutation resulting in a truncated C-propeptide, have impaired assembly, and are degraded by an endoplasmic reticulum-associated pathway (Lamand√©, S. R., Chessler, S. D., Golub, S. B., Byers, P. H., Chan, D., Cole, W. G., Sillence, D. O. and Bateman, J. F. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 8642-8649). To further explore the degradation of procollagen chains with mutant C-propeptides, mouse Mov13 cells, which produce no endogenous pro-alpha1(I), were stably transfected with a pro-alpha1(I) expression construct containing a frameshift mutation that predicts the synthesis of a protein 85 residues longer than normal. Despite high levels of mutant mRNA in transfected Mov13 cells, only minute amounts of mutant pro-alpha1(I) could be detected indicating that the majority of the mutant pro-alpha1(I) chains synthesized are targeted for rapid intracellular degradation. Degradation was not prevented by brefeldin A, monensin, or NH(4)Cl, agents that interfere with intracellular transport or lysosomal function. However, mutant pro-alpha1(I) chains in both transfected Mov13 cells and OI26 cells were protected from proteolysis by specific proteasome inhibitors. Together these data demonstrate for the first time that procollagen chains containing C-propeptide mutations that impair assembly are degraded by the cytoplasmic proteasome complex, and that the previously identified endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of mutant pro-alpha1(I) in OI26 is mediated by proteasomes.
