A novel actinomycete, strain H647-1T, which was isolated from soil of Mt. Halla, Jeju Island, Republic of Korea, was subjected to phenotypic and genotypic characterization. The organism, which produces warty spore chains arranged in hooks or spirals on the aerial mycelium, was shown to have chemotaxonomic characteristics consistent with assignment to the genus Actinomadura. A comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the organism formed a distinct clade within the evolutionary radiation of the family Thermomonosporaceae and that it was closely associated with members of the genus Actinomadura, but possessed a 22 nt extended loop between positions 453 and 479 of the 16S rRNA gene sequence (Escherichia coli numbering). A broad range of phenotypic and genetic data supported the suggestion that this organism represents a novel species of the genus Actinomadura, for which the name Actinomadura hallensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is strain H647-1T (= IMSNU 50760T = KCTC 9992T = KCCM 42245T = NRRL B-24436T).
