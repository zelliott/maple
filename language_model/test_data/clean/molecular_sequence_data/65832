An unknown gene, SLC10, was cloned by spliced leader-based polymerase chain reaction from Taenia solium. The full length of SLC10 was found to be 635 bp, encoding an 18.223 kDa protein. ELISA results showed that none of 70 normal and 75 cysticercosis sera samples reacted with purified recombinant SLC10 protein. Using an immunohistochemical method, it was revealed that the native SLC10 protein distributed extensively in inner cyst walls but not in the scolex in Cysticercus cellulosae. Together with predicted results, it is suggested that the SLC10 protein is a non-secretory structural protein, which is not involved in induction of the host's immune reactions against infection at least at the larval stage.
