We identified and cloned the rabbit SP-B gene, encoding the pulmonary surfactant-associated protein, and sequenced its upstream region from -2635 to +428, including a much larger fragment of the upstream region than has previously been reported for an SP-B for any species. Rabbit SP-B showed substantial homology to its human counterpart in the coding and noncoding regions immediately upstream from the TATAA box. Using a luciferase (Luc) reporter gene (luc) construct we measured promoter activity with a 212-bp fragment (SPB212) from nucleotides (nt) -41 to -252, inclusive. SPB212 functioned as an active promoter in this assay. Further, we identified, cloned and sequenced the cDNA encoding a unique DNA-binding protein, N, that bound SPB212 at approx. -195. When the N cDNA was cloned into the expression vector pKC4 and cotransfected with the luc reporter construct, N significantly enhanced Luc production, but only in the presence of dexamethasone. Therefore, we identified and sequenced a functional promoter region upstream from rabbit SP-B, and isolated and characterized a DNA-binding protein that confers enhanced glucocorticoid responsiveness on this promoter.
