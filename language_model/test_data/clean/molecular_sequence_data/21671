Meiosis is a special type of cell division present in all organisms that reproduce by sexual reproduction. It ensures the transition between the sporophytic and gametophytic state and allows gamete production through meiotic recombination and chromosome number reduction. In this paper, we describe a technique for the isolation of Arabidopsis thaliana male meiocytes. From this cellular material, it was then possible to develop large-scale transcriptome studies using CATMA microarrays and thus to obtain an overview of genes expressed during Arabidopsis meiosis. The expression profiles were studied with either stringent statistical criteria or by performing clustering. Both methods resulted in gene clusters enriched in meiosis-specific genes (from 14- to 55-fold). Analysis of these data provided a unique set of genes that will be pivotal to further analysis aimed at understanding the meiotic process.
