Successful parasitization by Cryptosporidium parvum requires multiple disruptions in both host and protozoan cell membranes as cryptosporidial sporozoites invade intestinal epithelial cells and subsequently develop into asexual and sexual life stages. To identify cryptosporidial proteins which may play a role in these membrane alterations, hemolytic activity was used as a marker to screen a C. parvum genomic expression library. A stable hemolytic clone (H4) containing a 5.5-kb cryptosporidial genomic fragment was identified. The hemolytic activity encoded on H4 was mapped to a 1-kb region that contained a complete 690-bp open reading frame (hemA) ending in a common stop codon. A 21-kDa plasmid-encoded recombinant protein was expressed in maxicells containing H4. Subclones of H4 which contained only a portion of hemA did not induce hemolysis on blood agar or promote expression of the recombinant protein in maxicells. Reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR analysis of total RNA isolated from excysted sporozoites and the intestines of infected adult mice with severe combined immunodeficiency demonstrated that hemA is actively transcribed during the cryptosporidial life cycle.
