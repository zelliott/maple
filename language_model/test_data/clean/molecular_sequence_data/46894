The crystal structure of Escherichia coli adenylate kinase (AKe) revealed three main components: a CORE domain, composed of a five-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by alpha-helices, and two peripheral domains involved in covering the ATP in the active site (LID) and binding of the AMP (NMPbind). We initiated a long-term NMR study aiming to characterize the solution structure, binding mechanism and internal dynamics of the various domains. Using single (15N) and double-labeled (13C and 15N) samples and double- and triple-resonance NMR experiments we assigned 97% of the 1H, 13C and 15N backbone resonances, and proton and 13Cbeta resonances for more than 40% of the side chains in the free protein. Analysis of a 15N-labeled enzyme in complex with the bi-substrate analogue [P1,P5-bis(5'-adenosine)-pentaphosphate] (Ap5A) resulted in the assignment of 90% of the backbone 1H and 15N resonances and 42% of the side chain resonances. Based on short-range NOEs and 1H and 13C secondary chemical shifts, we identified the elements of secondary structure and the topology of the beta-strands in the unliganded form. The alpha-helices and the beta-strands of the parallel beta-sheet in solution have the same limits (+/- 1 residue) as those observed in the crystal. The first helix (alpha1) appears to have a frayed N-terminal side. Significant differences relative to the crystal were noticed in the LID domain, which in solution exhibits four antiparallel beta-strands. The secondary structure of the nucleoside-bound form, as deduced from intramolecular NOEs and the 1Halpha chemical shifts, is similar to that of the free enzyme. The largest chemical shift differences allowed us to map the regions of protein-ligand contacts. 1H/2H exchange experiments performed on free and Ap5A-bound enzymes showed a general decrease of the structural flexibility in the complex which is accompanied by a local increased flexibility on the N-side of the parallel beta-sheet.
