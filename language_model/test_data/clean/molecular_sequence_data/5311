Three nonsense codons and an unusual initiation codon were located within the putative coding region of the atpB gene of chloroplast DNA of the hornwort Anthoceros formosae. Nucleotide sequencing of cDNA prepared from transcripts revealed extensive RNA editing. The unusual initiation codon ACG was changed to AUG and three nonsense codons were converted into sense codons. In total 15 C residues of the genomic DNA were replaced by U residues in the mRNA sequences, while 14 U residues were replaced by C residues. This is the highest number of editing events for a chloroplast mRNA reported so far. Partial editing was also shown in a cDNA clone where 23 sites were edited but six sites remained unedited, representing the existence of premature mRNA. The expected two-dimensional structure of the mRNA shows the existence of a sequence complementary to every editing site, which can produce continuous base pairing longer than 5 bp, suggesting that mispairing in the double strand is the site determinant for RNA editing in Anthoceros chloroplasts. Comparison of the cDNA sequence with other chloroplast genes suggests that the mechanism arose in the first land plants and has been reduced during evolution.
