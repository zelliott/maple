We have cloned and determined the nucleotide sequence of a novel kallikrein-like mRNA, designated rKlk10*, from rat submandibular gland and kidney with the aid of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This cDNA contains 737 base pairs comprising the sequence encoding a mature protein of 235 amino acid residues, partial zymogen peptide, and 3' noncoding sequence. Sequence comparisons showed that rKlk10 mRNA shares 87 and 88% sequence identity with rat tissue kallikrein at nucleic acid and amino acid levels, respectively. It encodes a 26,428-Da acidic protein whose derived amino acid sequence matches completely with the partial amino acid sequence of a kallikrein-like enzyme designated as T-kininogenase, K10 protein, or antigen-gamma purified from rat submandibular gland [Xiong et al. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 2822-2827; Gutman et al. (1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 784, 1-5; Berg et al. (1991) Biochem. J. 280, 19-25]. The protein encoded by rKlk10 retains the key amino acid residues determining kallikrein cleavage specificity. Northern blot analysis with an rKlk10-specific oligonucleotide probe showed that its mRNA level in the submandibular gland is decreased dramatically by administration of the beta agonist isoproterenol. Tissue-specific expression of rKlk10 was analyzed by Northern blotting and Southern blotting of PCR-amplified cDNA, which showed that rKlk10 is expressed at high levels in the submandibular gland and low levels in the kidney but not in seven other tissues including prostate, liver, heart, adrenal gland, testes, pituitary, and pancreas. rKlk10 cDNAs cloned from the kidney and submandibular gland show sequence identity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
