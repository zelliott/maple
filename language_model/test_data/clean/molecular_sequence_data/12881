HIV-1 positive patients from Tanzanian villages near Shirati were examined for urinary excretion of the human polyomaviruses JC and BK using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). BK virus (BKV) was detected in 11 of 23 individuals tested. The BKV DNA sequences were all closely related to prototype Gardner strain and BKV (DUN). In contrast, a new type of JCV, termed Type 3 [or JCV (Shi)], was identified in seven of these same 23 individuals by comparison with Type 1 and Type 2 sequences of the VP1/intergenic/T antigen region of U.S., European and Asian strains. This suggests that JCV and BKV, although closely related, have different evolutionary histories within the African population. The six BKV regulatory regions amplified all showed the archetypal configuration. However, two of the seven JCV regulatory regions showed rearrangements: a small deletion and an inverted repeat. JCV causes a fatal demyelinating disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), in about 5% of AIDS patients in Europe and the U.S.A., but only one case has been reported in Africa. Our results suggest that this rarity of PML is not due to the absence of JCV in the African population.
