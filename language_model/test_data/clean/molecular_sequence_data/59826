The 1882-bp nucleotide sequence of the cryptic plasmid pNB2 isolated from the thermophilic bacterium Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum was determined. pNB2 DNA has very low GC content (27%) and may serve as a model for studying the modes of maintenance and replication of AT-rich DNA under conditions of thermophilic growth. The plasmid sequence revealed three open reading frames (ORFs) which would encode polypeptides of 289, 68 and 59 amino acids, respectively, and these proteins were synthesized in E. coli extracts primed with the plasmid. We found that the product of ORF289 may be initiated at the non-ATG start codon, TTG, and has similarities with the conserved motifs of Rep proteins encoded by rolling circle (RC) plasmids of the pC194/pUB110 family. Southern hybridization analysis of lysates of C. thermosaccharolyticum cells harboring pNB2 revealed single-stranded intermediates, suggesting that this plasmid is able to replicate in clostridial cells via the RC mechanism. The most significant similarities are found between pNB2 Rep protein and the Rep proteins of three RC plasmids of the pC194 family (pTB913, pBC1 and pST1) isolated from thermophilic bacteria. Comparative analysis of these Rep proteins showed that despite the significant level of divergence, these Rep proteins share a high degree of similarity in the regions of five well-known conserved domains of RC Rep proteins and fall into two groups in accordance with the similarities found in their active sites.
