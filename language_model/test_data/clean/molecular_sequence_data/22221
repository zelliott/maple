The activity of retinoid receptors activity can be regulated by various extracellular stimuli. In an effort to understand the molecular basis for this phenomenon, the role of beta-arrestins was investigated. Beta-Arrestins constitute a class of proteins involved in the internalization of agonist-activated receptors. They have also been linked to MAPK activation suggesting a direct involvement in signaling cascades. Here, we report that beta-arrestin 2 stimulates the transcriptional activation of the retinoid RAR and RXR receptors. Of all the retinoid receptors, the RAR beta2 subtype showed the strongest sensitivity to beta-arrestin 2 action. Interestingly, this event requires the presence of the MAP kinase ERK2, but not that of JNK or P38. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that Ser 22 and Leu 217 are critical residues of the RAR beta2 receptor through which beta-arrestin 2 effects are mediated. More importantly, we demonstrate that the induction of PC12 growth inhibition by Nerve Growth Factor is indeed dependent upon RAR beta2 transcriptional activation in a beta-arrestin 2- and ERK2-dependent manner.
