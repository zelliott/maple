Tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), a multidomain protease essential for development and disease, releases the ectodomains from many transmembrane proteins in a regulated fashion. To understand the mechanism underlying the regulation of TACE activity, we sought to identify the cause of ectodomain shedding deficiencies in two mutated CHO sublines designated M1 and M2. Transfection of expression vectors for human and mouse TACE restored ectodomain shedding of TNF-alpha and TGF-alpha, suggesting that defects in the TACE gene contribute to the phenotype of M1 and M2 cells. The overall levels of endogenous TACE forms in M1 cells were significantly lower than those found in their parental cells, whereas only TACE zymogen, but not its mature form, was detectable in M2 cells. Molecular analyses suggested that M1 cells contained only one expressible TACE allele encoding an M435I point mutation in the catalytic center of the protease, and M2 cells produced two TACE variants with distinct point mutations in the catalytic domain (C225Y) and the cysteinerich/disintegrin domain (C600Y). Overexpression of the C225Y and C600Y TACE by transient transfection largely compensated for maturation defects in the variants but failed to restore TNF-alpha and TGF-alpha release in the shedding-defective CHO cell lines and fibroblasts derived from TACE-null mouse embryo. Further mutagenesis and functional analyses demonstrated that Cys(600) was absolutely essential for ectodomain shedding, suggesting that Cys(600), similar to Cys(225), participates in disulfide bonding, which is critical for both the processing and catalysis of TACE.
