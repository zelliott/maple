In higher vertebrates, reactive gliosis resulting from injury to the central nervous system (CNS) is characterized by a rapid increase in immunoreactivity (IR) to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Little is known about the extracellular signals that initiate the increase in GFAP-IR following CNS injury. We demonstrated recently [T.H. Oh, G.J. Markelonis, J.R. Von Visger, B. Baik, M.T. Shipley, Acidic pH rapidly increases immunoreactivity of glial fibrillary acidic protein in cultured astrocytes, Glia 13 (1995) 319-322] that a rapid increase in GFAP-IR can be evoked in mature astrocyte cultures by exposing the cells to an acidic medium. We investigated the intracellular pathway(s) involved in initiating increased GFAP-IR, a hallmark of reactive astrocytes. The increase in GFAP-IR produced by exposure to acidic medium was blocked by pretreatment with nickel ions, by such blockers of L-type calcium channels as nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem, by calpain inhibitor I, or by the intracellular calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM. At physiological pH, treatment with the calcium ionophore, A23187, resulted in increased GFAP-IR which could be blocked by pretreatment with calpain inhibitor I. Astrocytes exposed to low pH exhibited a marked increase in a GFAP fragment with a molecular weight of 48 kDa. In astrocytes exposed to acidic medium, alpha-fodrin, a selective endogenous substrate of calpain, was also found to be hydrolyzed producing fragments with molecular weights of 120-150 kDa. As anticipated, pretreatment with calpain inhibitor I prevented the proteolytic degradation of both GFAP and alpha-fodrin in these samples. These results suggest that the initial increase in GFAP-IR after CNS injury appears to be linked to Ca(++) influx, and is mediated further by a proteolytic process that seemingly involves the activation of the calcium-dependent protease, calpain I.
