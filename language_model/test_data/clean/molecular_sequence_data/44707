The distal short arm of human chromosome 1 (1p) is rearranged in a variety of malignancies, and several genetic diseases also map to this region. We have constructed an integrated transcript map to precisely define the positions of genes and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) previously mapped to 1p35-p36, a region spanning approximately 40 Mb. To anchor the integrated map, a framework genetic map was constructed with 24 genetic markers and a marker order of 1000:1 odds, yielding an average resolution of 2.8 cM. An additional 106 genetic markers were localized relative to the framework genetic map. To place markers more precisely within 1p35-p36, a chromosome 1-specific, radiation-reduced hybrid (RH) panel was created. Individual DNA fragments of the RH panel were identified and ordered by PCR with the framework genetic map. A total of 250 markers, including 142 genes and ESTs, were mapped by PCR against the RH panel. The map has an observed resolution of 800 kb, and the results closely match and more precisely define previous mapping information for most markers. This map will help to identify candidate genes for genetic diseases mapping to distal 1p and is fully integrated with existing genetic and RH maps of the human genome.
