We present the cloning and structural analysis of a novel member of the large family of trypsin-related serine proteases. Northern blot analysis shows that this protease, in adult tissues, is expressed almost exclusively in the human testis. In addition, a larger transcript was detected in relatively high abundance in several embryonic tissues, indicating different functions during embryonic and adult life. Sera raised against this protease was used to locate the expression in adult tissues to the testosterone producing cells of the testis, the interstitial Leydig cells. We therefore propose the name leydin for this novel protease. Leydin is clearly distinct from acrosin, the other testis-specific serine protease which is expressed by the spermatocytes. Leydin is probably a two-chain protease such as acrosin, prostasin, and coagulation factor XI. The heavy chain consists of 246 amino acids, corresponding to a molecular mass of 27384 Da and a net charge of +10.76. The size of the light chain is between 9 and 18 amino acids depending on the site of proteolytic cleavage, which remains to be determined. The amino-acid residues surrounding the active site indicate a trypsin-like cleavage specificity. The presence of two dibasic sequences Arg-Arg and Lys-Arg at the N-terminus of the heavy chain indicate that one or more subtilisin-like endopeptidases are responsible for the processing of leydin. However, leydin may also be activated by a trypsin-like enzyme, possibly by auto catalysis.
