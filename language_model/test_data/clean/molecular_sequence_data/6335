Thermoactinomyces vulgaris R-47 produces two alpha-amylases, TVA I, an extracellular enzyme, and TVA II, an intracellular enzyme. Both enzymes hydrolyze pullulan to produce panose, and also hydrolyze cyclodextrins. We cloned and sequenced the TVA I gene. The TVA I gene consisted of 1833 base pairs, and the deduced primary structure was composed of 611 amino-acid residues, including an N-terminal signal sequence consisting of 29 amino-acid residues. The similarity between the amino-acid sequence of mature TVA I with those of other pullulan/cyclodextrin-hydrolyzing enzymes, such as TVA II and Bacillus stearothermophilus neopullulanase, was only 30%, although that of TVA II with neopullulanase was 48%. TVA II prefers specific small oligosaccharides and alpha- and beta-cyclodextrins. Whereas kcat/Km values of TVA I for pullulan were larger than that of TVA II, and TVA II could not hydrolyze starch completely. TVA II was inhibited by maltose, the hydrolysate of starch, which seems to be the reason for inefficient hydrolysis of starch. These kinetic properties indicate that TVA I and TVA II have differential physiological roles in sugar metabolism extracellularly and intracellularly, respectively.
