A 14.8 kb DNA fragment from the chromosome of Yersinia pestis TWJ was cloned and the restriction map constructed. The fragment designated as T16 and its subfragments were tested in dot-hybridization with strains of Yersinia genus and other members of Enterobacteriaceae. A species-specific DNA probe (designated MK) was constructed on the basis of the T16 fragment. As judged from restriction analysis, blot-hybridization experiments and, partially, sequencing, significant homology exists between the MK DNA probe and this one developed by Bardarov et. al. (1990). A repeated sequence in two copies was discovered in the MK fragment.
