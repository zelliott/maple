The purpose of this study was to develop a porcine CBG cDNA probe in order to examine the porcine CBG mRNA expression in major tissues from the postnatal pig. The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted to develop the porcine CBG cDNA probe using total RNA extracted from liver of 40-day-old pig. The RT-PCR product was subcloned into the pGEM vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and subjected to restriction enzyme treatments and DNA sequencing. Northern blot analysis was conducted using total RNA extracted from samples (approximately 200 mg) of liver, lung, kidney, and whole adrenal tissue that were collected from pigs on day 3 (n = 2) or day 40 (n = 2) postpartum. A 500 bp partial porcine CBG cDNA encoded 166 amino acids and had 83, 78, and 77% homology to a 494-nucleotide sequence of CBG from sheep, human, and rabbit, respectively. The deduced peptide sequence of the partial porcine CBG showed 77, 62, 60, and 51% homology to sheep, human, rabbit, and rat CBG sequences, respectively. An approximately 1.53 kb CBG mRNA was detected only in the liver tissue. In conclusion, the development of a partial CBG cDNA for swine makes it possible to study the ontogeny and the regulation of CBG synthesis at the molecular level and, based on tissues examined in this study, the liver appears to be the primary source of CBG biosynthesis in the postnatal pig.
