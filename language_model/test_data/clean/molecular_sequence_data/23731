Different complex structures of the pol gene have been identified in 284 HIV-1 B/F recombinant sequences obtained from a group of 587 patients under treatment failure from Argentina. To analyze the mosaic structures of these viral sequences and to determine their phylogenetic relationship, the 284 partial pol gene sequences of BF recombinant viruses were amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. Intersubtype breakpoints were analyzed by bootscanning. Phylogenetic relationships were determined by means of neighbor-joining trees. The analysis of the sequences showed multiple phylogenetic topologies clustering within intersubtype BF reference sequences. At least three different mosaic patterns were found compared to previously described BF-type viruses with unequal distribution in the studied population. The analysis also showed that HIV-1 BF recombinant viruses with diverse mosaic structures are phylogenetically related in their F segments and in selected B fragments with the F1 subtype and with BF recombinant viruses from Brazil, respectively, suggesting a common recombinant ancestor. No association was observed between the prevalence of each mosaic pattern and the frequency of major drug-resistance mutations in PR and RT.
