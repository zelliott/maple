Methylarginines inhibit nitric oxide synthases (NOS). Cellular concentrations of methylarginines are determined in part by the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH; EC 3.5.3. 18). We have cloned human DDAH and identified and expressed a second novel DDAH isoform (DDAH I and II respectively). DDAH I predominates in tissues that express neuronal NOS. DDAH II predominates in tissues expressing endothelial NOS. These results strengthen the hypothesis that methylarginine concentration is actively regulated and identify molecular targets for the tissue and cell-specific regulation of methylarginine concentration.
