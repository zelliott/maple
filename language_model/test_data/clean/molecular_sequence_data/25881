An alcohol dehydrogenase was shown to be induced in Aspergillus nidulans by periods of anaerobic stress. This alcohol dehydrogenase was shown to correspond to the previously described cryptic enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase III (McKnight et al. 1985), by analysis of a mutation in the structural gene of alcohol dehydrogenase III, alcC, created by gene disruption. Survival tests on agar plates showed that this enzyme is required for long-term survival under anaerobic conditions. Northern blot analysis and gene fusion studies showed that the expression of the alcC gene is regulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Thus there are mechanisms in this filamentous fungus allowing survival under anaerobic stress that are similar to those described in higher plants.
