Disseminated disease by Aspergillus granulosus has been reported only once previously in a cardiac transplant recipient. We report a fatal central nervous system infection in a lung transplant recipient. Key features of this species in the section Usti include growth at 37 degrees C and large, randomly spaced aggregates of variably shaped HÃ¼lle cells.
