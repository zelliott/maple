A polymerase chain reaction-based polymorphic assay procedure (RAPD) was used to study the genetic diversity of intermediate host snails within the genus Bulinus. Genetic differentiation was detected between two closely related species: Bulinus globosus and Bulinus umbilicatus. Evidence is presented demonstrating the potential of RAPD markers for differentiating populations of B. forskalii from different countries (Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Ivory Coast) or from the same country (Cameroon). RAPDs may be also used to identify offspring from cross- and self-fertilized hermaphrodite bulinid snails. RAPDs provide a cost-effective and routine method for genetic studies of snails transmitting schistosomiasis and for the evaluation of diversity between snail populations.
