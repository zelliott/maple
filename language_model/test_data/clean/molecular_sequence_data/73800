The human gene for basonuclin, a zinc-finger protein of keratinocytes, has been cloned, sequenced and assigned to chromosome 15. The transcription unit spans nearly 29 kb of sequence. The coding region is distributed over five exons, and the three pairs of zinc fingers are encoded by the last two. The 5' flanking sequence and first exon are unusually rich in G+C and in CpG dinucleotides. This region contains numerous target sites for the transcription factor Sp1.
