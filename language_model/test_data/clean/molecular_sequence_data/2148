Tryptic digests of elephant pituitary prolactin (elePRL) were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and paper electrophoresis. From the amino acid composition, the amino acid sequencing of selected peptides, and from their alignment with expected tryptic peptides from ovine prolactin (oPRL), the primary sequence of elePRL is proposed.
