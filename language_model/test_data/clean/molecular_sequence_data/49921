This paper reports the identification of five preprogalanin complementary deoxyribonucleic acids encoding preprogalanin peptides in the goldfish. Preprogalanin 1A, 1B and 1C are encoded in galanin gene 1 and 2A and 2B are encoded in gene 2. Preprogalanin 1B and 2B have a 24 amino acids insert in the mature peptide region and form 1C has a deletion of 23 amino acids in the middle of the galanin message associated peptide region. The mature peptides from the preprogalanin 1A and 1C are 29 amino acids. However, the mature peptide is 31 amino acids from preprogalanin 2A, 53 amino acids from 1B and 55 amino acids from 2B. The physiological significance of multiple forms of galanin peptide is unknown. Organization of galanin gene 1, which is similar to the mammalian galanin gene has been identified. Expression of preprogalanin messenger ribonucleic acids was widely detected in goldfish brain and several peripheral tissues.
