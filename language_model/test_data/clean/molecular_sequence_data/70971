Substantial progress has been made in understanding Ag presentation to T cells; however, relatively little is known about the location and frequency of cells presenting viral Ags during a viral infection. Here, we took advantage of a highly sensitive system using lacZ-inducible T cell hybridomas to enumerate APCs during the course of respiratory Sendai virus infection in mice. Using lacZ-inducible T cell hybridomas specific for the immunodominant hemagglutinin-neuraminidase HN421-436/I-Ab and nucleoprotein NP324-332/Kb epitopes, we detected APCs in draining mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs), in cervical lymph nodes, and also in the spleen. HN421-436/I-Ab- and NP324-332/Kb-presenting cells were readily detectable between days 3 and 9 postinfection, with more APCs present in the MLN than in the cervical lymph nodes. Interestingly, no infectious virus was detected in lymphoid tissue beyond day 6, suggesting that a depot of noninfectious viral Ag survives, in some form, for 2-3 days after viral clearance. Fractionation of the MLN demonstrated that APC frequency was enriched in dendritic cells and macrophages but depleted in the B cell population, suggesting that B cells do not form a large population of APCs during the primary response to this virus.
