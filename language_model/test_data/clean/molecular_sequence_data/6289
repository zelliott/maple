The PII protein in the glutamine synthetase cascade transduces the nitrogen signal, as sensed by uridylyltransferase, both to the NRII/NRI two-component system and to adenylyltransferase, to regulate the activity of glutamine synthetase. Here we describe the amplification of a chromosomal DNA fragment from Escherichia coli which contains the sequence of a PII homologue. The derived amino acid sequence of this DNA fragment is 67% identical to E. coli PII. It contains the conserved tyrosine residue which is known to be the site of uridylylation in PII. E. coli is the first organism in which two different PII proteins have been detected.
