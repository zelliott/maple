The bacterial strain Gp_4_7.1T, isolated from the marine sponge Isops phlegraei collected at the Sula Ridge off the Norwegian coast, was characterized. The isolate was a motile spirillum that was monopolarly and monotrichously flagellated. It was aerobic, Gram-negative, oxidase-positive and catalase-negative. Optimal growth occurred between 20 and 30 degrees C, at pH 7-8 and with a salt concentration of 2-3 % (w/v). The isolate showed a relatively restricted nutritional profile. Substrate utilization tests were only positive for arabinose. Enzyme tests were positive for esterase lipase C8, lipase C14, leucine arylamidase and naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase. The strain was not able to reduce nitrate. The major cellular fatty acids were C16:1 omega7 and C16:0. The DNA G+C content was 62.6 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison classified the strain as a member of the order Oceanospirillales in the class Gammaproteobacteria. Strain Gp_4_7.1T formed a distinct phyletic line with less than 94 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to its closest relatives with validly published names. Based on the determined data, it is proposed that the strain represents a novel species in a new genus, Spongiispira norvegica gen. nov., sp. nov.; the type strain of Spongiispira norvegica is Gp_4_7.1T (=DSM 17749T =NCIMB 14401T).
