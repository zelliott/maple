A human orthologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae YVH1 protein-tyrosine phosphatase is able to rescue the slow growth defect caused by the disruption of the S. cerevisiae YVH1 gene. The human YVH1 gene is located on chromosome 1q21-q22, which falls in a region amplified in human liposarcomas. The evolutionary conserved COOH-terminal noncatalytic domain of human YVH1 is essential for in vivo function. The cysteine-rich COOH-terminal domain is capable of coordinating 2 mol of zinc/mol of protein, defining it as a novel zinc finger domain. Human YVH1 is the first protein-tyrosine phosphatase that contains and is regulated by a zinc finger domain.
