Based on the hypothetical 3D structure of neuropeptide Y (NPY), NPY 1-4-Aca-25-36, a 17 amino acid analogue, has been synthesized replacing the sequence NPY 5-24 by epsilon-aminocaproic acid (Aca). This low-molecular weight deletion analogue showed nearly comparable receptor affinity to NPY. In order to elucidate the structural requirements for receptor recognition each amino acid of 1-4-Aca-25-36 was exchanged by its D-enantiomer, glycine and L-alanine. In addition distinct amino acids were replaced by closely related residues. Multiple peptide synthesis was applied using Fmoc-strategy and BOP activation. Binding assay was performed on rabbit kidney membrane preparations. The results of structure affinity studies suggest that the C-terminal tetrapeptide NPY 33-36 is essential for receptor recognition.
