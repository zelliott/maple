Recent studies have demonstrated that depletion of amino acids results in the induction of several genes and that a genomic cis-element termed amino acid response element (AARE) is required for the induction. System x(c)(-) is an anionic amino acid transport system highly specific for cystine and glutamate, and its activity is known to be induced by cystine deprivation. This transporter is composed of two protein components, xCT and 4F2 heavy chain, and xCT is thought to mediate the transport activity. In the present study, the molecular mechanism for the induction of xCT by amino acid deprivation has been investigated. In mouse NIH3T3 cells, the activity of system x(c)(-) and xCT mRNA is induced not only by deprivation of cystine but also by deprivation of other amino acids. Two AAREs, each located in the opposite direction with an intervening sequence, were found in the 5'-flanking region of the mouse xCT gene. Promoter analysis revealed that both AAREs were necessary for the maximal induction of xCT mRNA in response to the amino acid deprivation. Glucose deprivation had no effect on the induction of the activity of system x(c)(-). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that ATF4, but not ATF2, is involved in the amino acid control of xCT expression. These results demonstrate that xCT is a new member of the proteins whose transcriptional control by the amino acid deprivation is mediated by AARE.
