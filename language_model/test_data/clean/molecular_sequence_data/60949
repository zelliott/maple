Inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein has been observed in a large number of human cancers. Overexpression of p53 induces either growth arrest or programmed cell death (apoptosis). The growth arrest function of p53 is mediated by induction of p21 (WAF1/CIP1), but the mechanisms underlying p53-dependent apoptosis are still largely unknown. To investigate these mechanisms, we have identified six differentially expressed transcripts in a human colon cancer cell line undergoing p53-dependent apoptosis. One of the p53-responsive genes showed significant homology to Drosophila peroxidasin, an extracellular matrix-associated peroxidase, and is likely to be its human homologue. Our results suggest a possible connection between p53-dependent apoptosis and the production of reactive oxygen species.
