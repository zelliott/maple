Primate immune adherence receptors are erythrocyte complement receptors (E-CR) that favorably influence the clearance of circulating immune complexes (IC). The human E-CR is the type one complement receptor (CR1), most commonly expressed as a 220 kDa protein containing 30 short consensus repeats (SCRs). The chimpanzee E-CR is a 75 kDa protein composed of eight SCRs, and is encoded by an ortholog of human CR1-like (CR1L), a genetic element related to CR1. Human CR1L was previously identified from genomic clones that predict exons for seven SCRs, and there have been no reports of CR1L expression. The purpose of this study was to determine if human CR1L is expressed. Amplification of human bone marrow cDNA using primers specific for CR1/CR1L yielded a product similar to chimp CR1L encoding sequence. The first 6.5 SCRs matched 100% with the predicted human CR1L sequence, while the second half of SCR 7 was homologous to the comparable chimp CR1L sequence but with a stop codon. Expression in COS-7 cells yielded a human CR1L protein of approximately 50 kDa that exhibited binding specificity for iC4 but not for iC3. Neither northern nor western blot analysis of human bone marrow revealed the presence of the CR1L transcript or protein. However, northern blot analysis of various other lymphoid tissue identified a candidate CR1L transcript in human fetal liver. PCR amplification of a cDNA panel of human fetal tissue confirmed the presence of the CR1L transcript in fetal liver, and to a lesser extent in fetal spleen and thymus. Thus, expression of the CR1L transcript appears to be limited to hematopoietic and fetal lymphoid tissue.
