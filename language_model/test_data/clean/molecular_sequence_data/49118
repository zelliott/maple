A novel promoter in IS10R (OUTIIp) has been found in one of its ends in an inverted position relative to promoter pOUT. OUTIIp shows characteristics similar to those of rpoS-dependent promoters such as a gearbox expression pattern. It is under catabolite repression and positively regulated by ppGpp or conditioned media. This opens new challenges in IS10R transposition.
