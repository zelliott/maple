We describe a new approach for the production of peptides using a combination of recombinant DNA technology, chemical synthesis, and proteinase-catalyzed processing. An artificial substance P-precursor is produced as a beta-galactosidase (1-459) fusion protein containing nine copies of the decapeptide sequence Arg-Leu-Arg-Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Gln-Gln-Phe. The fusion protein accumulates in E. coli as insoluble inclusion bodies which are easily isolated and purified. The decapeptide blocks are selectively cleaved from the insoluble fusion protein by alpha-chymotrypsin. Alternatively, a dodecapeptide ester is produced when a dipeptide ester is included in the chymotrypsin reaction mixture. This peptide ester is converted converted to substance P by papain-catalyzed acyl transfer and subsequent tryptic cleavage. These results demonstrate that peptides can be readily produced by a combination of recombinant DNA technology and proteinase-catalyzed conversion. The approach allows incorporation of groups other than natural amino acids into oligo- and polypeptides.
