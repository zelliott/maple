The complete sequences of genomic and defective interfering (DI) RNAs of carnation Italian ringspot tombusvirus (CIRV) were determined. The genome (4760 nt) has an organization identical to that reported for other tombusviruses except that the pre-readthrough domain of the viral replicase encoded by the 5'-proximal open reading frame (ORF) is larger. In particular, the N-terminal region of this protein differs from the corresponding region of the other members of the genus Tombusvirus and Carmovirus. Two DI RNAs were found in infected tissues whose sequences were completely derived from genomic RNA. The smaller molecule (474 nt) is contained completely within the larger molecule (656 nt), which suggests that it is derived from the larger one.
