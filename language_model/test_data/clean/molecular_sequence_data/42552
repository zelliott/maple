Viruses take advantage of the host's protein modification and targeting pathways to modify their own proteins and to ensure that they assume active configurations and locate appropriately for assembly. In many viruses, one recurrent theme in such processes is exploitation of cellular protein acylation pathways for the addition of myristic and palmitic acid to capsid or envelope proteins.
