Glutathione S-transferase P (GST-P) lost the enzymatic activity by 7-fluoro-4-sulfamoyl-2, 1, 3-benzodiazole (ABD-F), a thiol-group chemical modifier, but did not by methylmethanethiol-sulfonate. Both ABD-F and methylmethanethiolsulfonate reacted with Cys47 and Cys101. These two cysteine residues were site-directedly mutated with serine residues. Only the Cys101Ser lost the enzymatic activity by the treatment of ABD-F. On carbon 13 NMR experiments, a NMR signal of S-[13C]CH3 adduct to Cys47 did not show any change by the addition of S-hexylglutathione. These facts revealed that Cys47 did not locate at the active site, and a bulky adduct to Cys47 hindered the binding of substrates to the active site.
