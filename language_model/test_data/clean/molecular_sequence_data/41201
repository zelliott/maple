Previous studies indicate that the H3 influenza virus has the ability to establish infection upon interspecies transmission and poses a threat to mammals. Therefore, it is important to enhance the surveillance of H3 avian influenza viruses (AIVs). In this study, A/duck/Shanghai/C84/2009(H3N2) (C84) was isolated from a live poultry market in Shanghai, China. Using PCR and sequencing analyses, we obtained the whole-genome sequence of this virus. The H3N2 virus proved to be a novel multiple-gene reassortant AIV whose genes were derived from H3N2, H4N6, H6N2, and H9N2. Knowledge regarding the complete genome sequence of the C84 virus will be useful for epidemiological surveillance.
