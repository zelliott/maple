The locust oviduct bioassay system was used to assess the ability of a variety of peptides to induce oviductal contractions. Proctolin analogues were three orders of magnitude less potent than proctolin. Proctolin supra-analogue and Arg-Tyr-Leu-Ala-Thr demonstrated high activity. Perhaps the most significant finding was the discrepancy between the high binding capacity of the proctolin analogue Arg-Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr and its relatively low myotropic activity. This observation argues for a crucial role for the leucine residue in activating the proctolin receptor. Several other myotropic peptides were tested for their effect on oviduct contractions. FMRFamide caused contractions at doses several orders of magnitude higher than proctolin. The FLRFamide leucomyosuppression inhibited proctolin-induced contractions. In addition, myomodulin and catch relaxing peptide caused oviductal contractions at low concentrations. The enkephalins had no effect when applied alone but potentiated proctolin-induced oviduct contractions. The mechanism of the potentiation is not known. The data argue for the presence of several binding sites on the oviduct membrane.
