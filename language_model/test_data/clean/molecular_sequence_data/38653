A clone encoding the putative copper chaperone protein Sheep Atx1 Homologue (SAH) was isolated from a sheep liver cDNA library. The 466-bp cDNA encoded a predicted protein of 68 amino acids, with 44 and 81% amino acid identity to the yeast Atx1 and human Atox1 copper chaperone proteins, respectively. The characteristic MTCxxC and KTGK motifs were conserved in SAH. Northern blot analysis revealed an abundant 0.5-kb mRNA in all tissues examined. Elevated hepatic copper content did not affect the level of SAH mRNA in the liver. Analysis of SAH mRNA in the developing liver revealed low levels of expression in the foetal period, with a steady increase to adult levels occurring during development. In vitro two-hybrid analysis demonstrated SAH interacted with the amino terminal portion of the sheep Wilson's disease protein (ATP7B). The extent of this interaction was significantly reduced by the addition of the copper chelator bathocuproine disulfonic acid to the media. These results suggest SAH is a functional copper chaperone that is able to interact with ATP7B in a copper-dependent manner to facilitate copper transport into the secretory pathway.
