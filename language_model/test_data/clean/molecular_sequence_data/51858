The nucleotide sequence of the tcpC gene has been determined. It encodes a 53995-Da protein precursor with a signal sequence and cleavage site typical of a number of outer membrane lipoproteins, which are cleaved by the equivalent of signal peptidase II (Lsp) of Escherichia coli. The location of the tcpC gene is such that it is predicted to be translationally coupled to the 5' and 3' flanking genes, tcpY and tcpD, respectively, indicating that it forms part of an operon. Together with the lipoprotein signal sequence and the several hydrophobic domains it seems likely that TcpC is a surface-anchored trans-outer membrane lipoprotein.
