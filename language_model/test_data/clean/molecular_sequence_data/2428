We performed the cloning and sequencing of the der(14) breakpoint of a new chromosomal translocation involving the 14q32 immunoglobulin locus. This t(9;14)(p11;q32) translocation was found in a case of malignant lymphoma occurring in human alpha heavy chain disease. A rearranged alpha 1 gene fragment was cloned and shown to contain chromosome 9 information by Southern blotting on sorted chromosomes and by in situ hybridization. Sequence analysis of the junction point region established that the breakage occurred 3' to the heavy chain joining region. In contrast to the data obtained in other translocations affecting 14q32 immunoglobulin locus, the recombination did not involve the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus specific recombination signals on chromosome 14, or homologous sequences on chromosome 9. In the present case, the existence of two almost perfect inverted repeats flanking the junction point suggests that the translocation originated from a local pairing of the two chromosomes 9 and 14. Chromosome 9 fragments sequenced in the vicinity of the breakpoint did not share significant homology with sequences listed in GenBank and EMBL data bases.
