The paleoherb species Asarum caudigerum (Aristolochiaceae) is important for research into the origin and evolution of angiosperm flowers due to its basal position in the angiosperm phylogeny. In this study, four MADS-box-containing transcripts were isolated from A. caudigerum by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses indicated that they possess high homology to AP3 subfamily genes, which have been shown previously to be involved in petal and stamen development in eudicots. Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and in situ hybridization analyses showed AcAP3-A expression mainly in the second whorl (stamens) and AcAP3-B expression in whorls 1 and 3 (perianth and carpels). Compared with eudicot AP3 homologs, premature translation termination codons were caused by an insertion in the K1 domain of AcAP3-C, and by a deletion in the 7th exon of AcAP3-D. Sequence analyses suggested that the A. caudigerum AP3 lineage had undergone gene duplication and subfunctionalization, diverging in expression patterns during perianth, stamen, and carpel development. Based on comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses, we concluded that subfunctionalization has likely contributed to the persistence of two functional AP3 paralogs, that two other copies may have become pseudogenes, and that these AP3 duplication and subfunctionalization events may have contributed to the evolution of the unusual floral morphology of A. caudigerum.
