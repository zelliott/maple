We report that the GAGE gene family of human Cancer/testis antigen (CTA) genes is likely to be in an early stage of its evolution. Members of this gene family are tandemly arranged on the X chromosome only in human, chimpanzee and macaque genomes and share a very high similarity. Phylogenetic trees show that the GAGE gene family began to duplicate after the split of human and chimpanzee. The estimated ages of the duplication events range from 4 million years ago to the present. The Ka/Ks values between the duplicates are significantly greater than 1, indicating that the mutation rate is higher in coding regions than non-coding regions of the genes, which suggests that the GAGE gene family is under positive selection. These findings indicate that the GAGE gene family may be a newly formed gene family undergoing rapid functional evolution.
