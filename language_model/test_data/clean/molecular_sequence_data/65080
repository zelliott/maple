The spread of clonally related carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa producing the metallo-beta-lactamase SPM-1 was found in Recife, Brazil. Upstream of bla(SPM-1), a novel common region (CR4) was identified, comprising an open reading frame, orf495, whose product shares significant identity with putative recombinases, such as Orf513. CR4 may be responsible for mobilization and expression of bla(SPM-1).
