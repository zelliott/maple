The K15 gene product of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a transmembrane protein that is encoded by the last open reading frame of the KSHV genome. The K15 protein has been implicated in modulation of B-cell signal transduction and activation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-kappaB signal transduction pathways. Here we report the identification of the transcriptional start site of the full-length K15 gene in KSHV-positive BCBL-1 cells. We have mapped the K15 transcriptional start site to a position 152 nucleotides upstream from the translation start site by rapid amplification of cDNA ends and RNase protection assays. We have also characterized the K15 promoter element. To analyze the cis-acting elements necessary to regulate K15 gene expression, a series of 5' promoter deletion constructs were generated and subcloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. Transcriptional assays with these mutant promoters demonstrated that chemical induction in latently infected KSHV-positive BCBL-1 cells activated K15 transcription. In addition, K15 promoter transactivation was also mediated by the viral immediate-early protein Orf50/Rta, suggesting that the K15 gene is actively transcribed during lytic replication.
