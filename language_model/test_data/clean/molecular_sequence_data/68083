Nitric oxide (NO) may mediate the hypotension of septic shock, but the effect of endotoxin on inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression remains unclear. We studied the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment in vivo on iNOS mRNA expression using reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction. The iNOS mRNA was absent or negligible in any tissue studied from control rats, but was markedly increased in lung, liver, spleen, skeletal muscle and kidney from LPS-treated rats. The LPS-induced increase in iNOS mRNA was prevented by dexamethasone. Our results indicate that LPS treatment in vivo induces the expression of an iNOS mRNA via a dexamethasone-sensitive mechanism, and thus provide direct molecular evidence for the involvement of NO in septic shock.
