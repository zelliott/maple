To determine the advantage of U1 small nuclear RNA as a ribozyme vector (U1-Rz) to inhibit HCV replication in vivo.

The 3rd stem-loop was substituted by HCV core specific ribozyme to construct an U1-Rz eucaryotic expression plasmid. Then it was co-transfected with pCMV/T7-NCRC Delta-luc into Huh7 cell line mediated by lipofectin. The cell lysis supernatant was subjected to Western blot and lumenometer to determine the luciferase levels.

A U1 snRNA chimeric ribozyme was constructed successfully. Both Rz and U1-Rz inhibited luciferase expression in Huh7 by 48.64% and 87.46%, respectively.

Rz has more efficacy in cells when using U1 snRNA delivery system. U1 can be an efficient vector for HCV specific ribozyme.
