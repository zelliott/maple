1. Two paralytic peptides were isolated and identified from hemolymph of Trichoplusia ni Hubner. 2. These peptides cause rapid, rigid paralysis when injected into the lepidopteran insect, Manduca sexta. 3. The paralytic dose (ED50) of one peptide is 0.05 micrograms/g and the other is 0.9 micrograms/g. 4. Sequences are very similar to paralytic peptides from the hemolymph of other lepidopteran insects.
