Proteophosphoglycans (PPG) are a large family of extensively glycosylated proteins with some unusual and unique features. The ppg gene family is conserved in at least three Leishmania species and localises to chromosome 35. Previous studies using standard discontinuous SDS-PAGE have been incapable of resolving PPG heterogeneity with most material failing to enter the resolving gel. We have exploited a continuous electrophoretic system, which allows for the first time the separation and characterisation of a low molecular weight population of PPG polypeptides. We provide evidence of surface expressed and developmentally regulated forms. Among those, we identify for the first time the previously described membrane-bound PPG and a form of filamentous fPPG, which is altered, or absent in two of the three L. major isolates examined.
