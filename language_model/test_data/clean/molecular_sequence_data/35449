The main aim of this work was to study molecular characterization of a DNA fragment conferring resistance to Cu(II) in Sinorhizobium meliloti CCNWSX0020. The strain CCNWSX0020, resistant to 1.4 mmol l(-1) Cu(II) in tryptone-yeast extract medium was isolated from Medicago lupulina growing in mine tailings of Fengxian County, China. The availability of the complete genome sequence of S. meliloti CCNWSX0020 provides an opportunity for investigating genes that play significant roles in Cu(II) resistance. A copper resistance gene, with a length of 1,445 bp, encoding 481 amino acids, designated omp, was identified by cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism from S. meliloti CCNWSX0020. The expression of omp gene strongly increased in the presence of Cu(II). The omp-defective mutants display sensitivities to Cu(II) compared with their wild types. The Cu(II)-sensitive phenotype of the mutant was complemented by a 1.5-kb DNA fragment containing omp gene. BLAST analysis revealed that this gene encoded a hypothetical outer membrane protein with 75 % similarity to outer membrane efflux protein in Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae 3841. These studies suggested that the omp product was involved in the Cu(II) tolerance of S. meliloti CCNWSX0020.
