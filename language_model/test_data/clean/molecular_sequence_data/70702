BN46/51 is an acidic protein found in the granular component of the nucleolus of the amebo-flagellate Naegleria gruberi. When Naegleria amebae differentiate into swimming flagellates, BN46/51 is found associated with the basal body complex at the base of the flagella. In order to determine the factors responsible for targeting BN46/51 to a specific subnucleolar region, cDNAs coding for both subunits were isolated and sequenced. Two clones, JG4.1 and JG12.1 representing the 46 kDa and 51 kDa subunits, respectively, were investigated in detail. JG12.1 encoded a polypeptide of 263 amino acids with a predicted size of 30.1 kDa that co-migrated with the 51 kDa subunit of BN46/51 when expressed in yeast. JG4.1 encoded a polypeptide of 249 amino acids with a predicted size of 28.8 kDa that co-migrated with the 46 kDa subunit of BN46/51. JG4.1 was identical to JG12.1 except for the addition of an aspartic acid between positions 94 and 95 of the JG12.1 sequence and the absence of 45 amino acids beginning at position 113. The predicted amino acid sequences were not closely related to any previously reported. However, the sequences did have 26-31% identity to a group of FKPBs (FK506 binding proteins) but lacked the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase domain of the FKBPs. Both subunits contained two KKE and three KKX repeats found in other nucleolar proteins and in some microtubule binding proteins. Using 'Far Western' blots of nucleolar proteins, BN46/51 bound to polypeptides of 44 kDa and 74 kDa. The 44 kDa component was identified as the Naegleria homologue of fibrillarin. BN46/51 bound specifically to the nucleoli of fixed mammalian cells, cells which lack a BN46/51 related polypeptide. When the JG4.1 and JG12.1 cDNAs were expressed in yeast, each subunit was independently targeted to the yeast nucleolus. We conclude that BN46/51 represents a unique nucleolar protein that can form specific complexes with fibrillarin and other nucleolar proteins. We suggest that the association of BN46/51 with the MTOC of basal bodies may reflect its role in connecting the nucleolus with the MTOC activity for the mitotic spindle. This would provide a mechanism for nucleolar segregation during the closed mitosis of Naegleria amebae.
