Uptake of Salmonella typhimurium into murine macrophage cells caused transcriptional downregulation of a mRNA population in eukaryotic cells after 2 h of infection. The cloned cDNA that was identified showed extensive homology with a murine alpha 1,2-mannosidase gene involved in N-oligosaccharide processing. These findings suggest a disruption of eukaryotic protein processing after phagocytosis of S. typhimurium by the murine macrophage cells.
