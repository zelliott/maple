The CC chemokines are a closely related subfamily of the chemokine superfamily. Most of the CC chemokine genes form a cluster on chromosome 11 in mice and chromosome 17 in humans. To date, 11 and 16 functional genes have been localized within the mouse and human clusters, respectively. Notably, some of the genes within these clusters appear to have no counterparts between the two species, and the orthologous relationships of some of the genes are difficult to establish solely on the basis of amino acid similarity. In this study, we have taken a comparative genomic approach to reveal some of the features that may be involved in the dynamic evolution of these gene clusters. We sequenced a 122-kb region containing five chemokine genes of the mouse CC cluster. This mouse sequence was combined with those determined by the Mouse Genome Sequencing Project, and the entire sequence of the mouse CC cluster was compared with that of the corresponding cluster in the human genome by percent identity plot and dot-plot analyses. Although no additional chemokine genes have been found in these clusters, our analysis has revealed that numerous gene rearrangements have occurred even after the diversification of rodents and primates, resulting in several species-specific chemokine genes and pseudogenes. In addition, phylogenetic analysis and comparison of the genomic sequences unambiguously identified the orthologous relationships of some of the chemokine genes in the mouse and human CC gene clusters.
