The high molecular weight basic nuclear proteins (HMrBNPs), which are tightly bound to sperm chromatin in winter flounder, are made up of imperfect reiterations of simple peptide sequences that contain phosphorylatable DNA-binding motifs. Genomic Southern blots hybridized with probes to the coding and non-coding regions of HMrBNP mRNA showed that HMrBNP sequences form a complex multi-gene family. Previously, one gene (2B) was used to establish an evolutionary link between histone H1 and the HMrBNPs. Further examination of this complex, multi-gene family has now revealed that the majority of the HMrBNP genes are linked as 4.5 kb direct tandem repeats that each contain a 2.8 kb coding region and a 1.7 kb intergenic region (IR). These findings, combined with the cloning of the IR, established that the tandemly repeated genes lack introns and code for the abundant 3 kb HMrBNP mRNAs that produce the prominent 110 kDa HMrBNP. Southern blotting of DNAs from other righteye flounder species showed that HMrBNP multi-gene families were present in closely related species, though with substantial differences in restriction patterns and band intensities, but were not detected in more distantly related flounders. These observations are consistent with recent and rapid elaboration of the HMrBNP gene family.
