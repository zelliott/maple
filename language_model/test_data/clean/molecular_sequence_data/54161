HIV fusion inhibitors may be classified into three groups. Peptides binding to HR1 include T1249, C30, and T20 (enfuvirtide). Peptides binding to HR2 include 5-helix. XTT formazan, NB-2, and NB-64 are nonpeptide fusion inhibitors. Genotypic testing for drug resistance is used more commonly than phenotypic testing because of its lower cost, wider availability, and shorter turnaround time. The aim of the study was to predict the efficacy of fusion inhibitors for AIDS patients in our population. A total of 100 specimens were collected. The viral RNA was isolated and nucleotides of the required regions were sequenced using the BigDye terminator method. It is concluded from this study that viruses in our population may show resistance to C30 and T20 whereas the other fusion inhibitors may be effectively used for our population.
