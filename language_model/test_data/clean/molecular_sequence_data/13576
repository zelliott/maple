Pyelonephritis-associated pili (Pap) expression in Escherichia coli is subject to a phase variation control mechanism that is regulated by the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp), PapI, and deoxyadenosine methylase (Dam). In previous work, we found that the differential Dam methylation of two target sites in pap regulatory DNA, GATC-I and GATC II, is essential for the transition between active and inactive pap transcriptional states. Here, we identify six Lrp binding sites within the pap regulatory DNA, each separated by about three helical turns. Lrp binds with highest affinity to three sites (1, 2 and 3) proximal to the papBAp promoter. A mutational analysis indicates that the binding of Lrp to sites 2 and 3 inhibits pap transcription, which is consistent with the fact that Lrp binding site 3 is located between the --35 and --10 RNA polymerase binding region of papBAp. The addition of PapI decreases the affinity of Lrp for sites 1, 2 and 3 and increases its affinity for the distal Lrp binding sites 4 and 5. Mutations within Lrp binding sites 4 and 5 shut off pap transcription, indicating that the binding of Lrp to this pap region activates pap transcription. The pap GATC-I and GATC-II methylation sites are located within Lrp binding sites 5 and 2, respectively, providing a mechanism by which Dam controls Lrp binding and Pap phase variation.
