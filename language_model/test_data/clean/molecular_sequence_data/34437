A gene encoding phytoene desaturase (crtI) in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway of Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461, an industrial gellan gum-producing strain, was cloned and identified. This gene is predicted to encode a 492-amino acid protein with significant homology to the phytoene desaturase of other carotenogenic organisms. Knockout of crtI gene blocked yellow carotenoid pigment synthesis and resulted in the accumulation of colorless phytoene, confirming that it encodes phytoene desaturase. Further research indicates that the yield of gellan gum production by crtI gene knockout mutants is almost the same as that by the wild-type strain. In addition, a recovery method based on the colorless fermentation broth of the crtI gene knockout mutant was investigated. Compared to the volume of alcohol for the parent strain, much less alcohol (30%) is required in this recovery process; thus, the costs of downstream purification of gellan gum can be substantially reduced.
