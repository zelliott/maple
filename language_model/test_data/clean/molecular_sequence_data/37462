Headpin (SERPINB13) is a novel member of the serine proteinase inhibitor (Serpin) gene family that was originally cloned from a keratinocyte cDNA library. Western blot analysis using a headpin-specific antiserum recognized a protein with the predicted M(r) of 44kDa in lysates derived from a transformed keratinocyte cell line known to express headpin mRNA. Similarity of the reactive-site loop (RSL) domain of headpin, notably at the P1-P1(') residues, with other serpins that inhibit cysteine and serine proteinases suggests that headpin may inhibit similar proteinases. This study demonstrates that recombinant headpin indeed inhibits cathepsins K and L, but not chymotrypsin, elastase, trypsin, subtilisin A, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, plasmin, or thrombin. The second-order rate constants (k(a)) for the inhibitory reactions of rHeadpin with cathepsins K and L were 5.1+/-0.6x10(4) and 4.1+/-0.8x10(4)M(-1)s(-1), respectively. Headpin formed SDS-stable complexes with cathepsins K and L, a characteristic property of inhibitory serpins. Interactions of the RSL domain of headpin with cathepsins K and L were indicated by cleavage of headpin near the predicted P1-P1(') residues by these proteinases. These results demonstrate that the serpin headpin possesses specificity for inhibiting lysosomal cysteine proteinases.
