Interaction between viral proteins and RNAs has been studied in rotavirus-infected cells. The use of UV cross-linking followed by immunoprecipitation and labeling with T4 polynucleotide kinase allowed us to detect interactions between RNA and nonstructural viral proteins. The RNAs linked to the nonstructural protein NSP3 have been identified as rotavirus mRNAs, and the sequences of the RNase T1-protected fragments have been established. These sequences correspond to the 3' end sequence common to all rotavirus group A genes. We also show that the last 3' nucleotide is cross-linked to the protein and that monomeric and multimeric forms of NSP3 are bound to rotavirus mRNA. The role of NSP3 in rotavirus replication is discussed in the light of our results and by comparison with other RNA-binding proteins of members of the Reoviridae family.
