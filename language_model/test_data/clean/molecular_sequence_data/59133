We have investigated the relationship between peritoneal murine macrophage cytoskeleton and nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS). Activation of the cells with lipopolysaccharide plus interferon-gamma (LI) induced iNOS, detected by nitrite or by labeled L-citrulline production and by a specific antibody against macrophage iNOS. Addition of cytochalasin B (a microfilament-depolymerizing agent) caused a dose-dependent inhibition in NO production by macrophages, whereas colchicine (a microtubule depolymerizing agent) inhibited it only by 20% and not dose-dependently. Addition of cytochalasin B together with LI abolished nitrite and L-citrulline accumulation as well as the amount of iNOS antigen in activated macrophage. Moreover, addition of cytochalasin B 6 or 12 h after stimulus, also decreased the nitrite and L-citrulline production by macrophages although iNOS antigen content by Western blot was the same in the presence or in the absence of cytochalasin B added 12 h after activation. Since cytochalasin B failed to inhibit iNOS activity directly, its inhibitory effects on NO production by macrophages is likely to be indirect, through microfilament network in central regions of cells, but not in filaments seen at pseudopodia or edging processes. Our findings demonstrate that disruption of microfilaments but not of microtubules prevents the iNOS induction process and inhibits its enzymatic activity in activated macrophages.
