A 10-year-old boy on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis had low-grade fever, pain and tenderness of the right shoulder; he had no history of infection or exposure to tuberculosis. The underlying granulomatous infection was diagnosed by histological examination of bone and the polymerase chain reaction with primer sequences specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Special stains and cultures were negative. The initiation of antituberculous therapy was followed by a sharp improvement in the fever, malaise and shoulder pain within several weeks. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is common in patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis and the diagnosis is difficult. The clinician must recognise the high and early mortality rate in order to initiate an aggressive diagnostic approach and early therapy.
