In 1986 and 1987 foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype A was isolated from outbreaks of disease in Saudi Arabia and Iran. Selected virus isolates were antigenically distinct from the prototype A22 virus strain (A22/Iraq/64), but were serologically related to each other. However, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that whilst the respective Saudi Arabian structural polypeptides were homogeneous, those from an Iran isolate were distinct. Direct sequencing of part of the P-1D (VP1) gene demonstrated considerable difference in nucleotide homology between the two groups of viruses; the Saudi Arabian viruses were closely related to each other but only distantly related to both the A22 prototype virus strain and the Iranian virus isolate. The latter viruses were only slightly more closely related to each other. Thus there appeared to be at least two distinct FMDV type A variants co-circulating in the Middle East, both of which differed considerably from the classical A22 subtype.
