During zygotic embryogenesis of turnip-tops (Brassica rapa L. cv. Rapa), the polygalacturonase activity (PG; EC 3.2.1.15), measured as a decrease in viscosity of polygalacturonic acid, reached a high when the desiccation process in the seeded silique was triggered and the valves had lost more than 70-75% of their moisture (45-50 DPA). The PG activity was not detected in any phases of developing seeds. This work also characterizes a cDNA with an open reading frame of 1303 bp and that codes for a putative PG called BrPG1. This falls into the category of clade-B, which includes PG related to shattering and abscission processes. The deduced BrPG1 sequence predicted a 434-residue-long precursor protein (46.7kDa) with a transit peptide sequence 23 amino acids long. A molecular mass of 44.3 kDa was calculated for the mature form of BrPG1, which showed high sequence similarity to PGA1 (97%) of B. napus (X98373) and ADPG1 (87%) of Arabidopsis thaliana (AJ002532). All conserved amino acids at the catalytic site of PGs belonging to clade-B were preserved on BrPG1. This BrPG1 gene was specifically expressed in the silique valves of turnip-tops and was temporally expressed at the beginning of its desiccation.
