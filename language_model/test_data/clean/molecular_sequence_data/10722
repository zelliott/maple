Mature Brassica oleracea pollen grains are covered with a lipophilic pollen coat containing a variety of proteins. Screening of an anther cDNA expression library for the coding sequences of such proteins resulted in the isolation of a number of cDNA clones encoding glycine-rich oleosins. The proteins were shown to be attached to the lipophilic coat material only and to be absent elsewhere in the plant. Within the coat, several forms of the pollen coat oleosin with different molecular weights were detected. The forms are encoded by different transcripts that originate from a single gene. Expression of this gene is restricted to the tapetum and is quantitatively regulated by the water content of the anther. Similar oleosins were found in the pollen coat of B. alboglobra and B. napus.
