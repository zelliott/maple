Batken virus, isolated from mosquitoes and ticks, was tentatively classified as a member of the family Bunyaviridae. Here we show that Batken virus is inhibited by the interferon-induced Mx1 protein of mice which selectively blocks the growth of orthomyxoviruses, including Thogoto and Dhori viruses. Furthermore, we show that Batken virus multiplication is characterized by accumulation of viral proteins in the nucleus and by budding of viral particles from the cell surface. Serological cross-reactions between Batken and Dhori viruses revealed a phylogenetic relationship of these viruses, as previously also proposed by D. K. Lvov. Fragments of the Batken virus glycoprotein and nucleoprotein genes were amplified by RT-PCR. The deduced amino acid sequences were similar to the corresponding Dhori virus sequences. Therefore, Batken virus should be classified into the newly established genus Thogotovirus of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Finally, our results demonstrate that Mx1 susceptibility of orthomyxoviruses is a reliable marker in the hunt for new family members.
