The concentration of estramustine phosphate required to inhibit the assembly or to induce the disassembly of chick brain MAP2:tubulin microtubules is markedly dependent upon the microtubule protein concentration. Analysis of this relationship shows that estramustine phosphate and tubulin compete for common MAP2 sites, that MAP2 can bind 5-6 moles.mole-1 estramustine phosphate, and that the Kd of these sites is congruent to 20 microM estramustine phosphate. It is proposed that two molecules of estramustine phosphate interact with each of the three tubulin-binding sites of MAP2 and inhibit the MAP2:tubulin interaction by neutralising two highly conserved basic residues.
