Eight novel small RNAs that were encoded in the regions corresponding to the introns of protein-coding genes were isolated from Caenorhabditis elegans. Seven of them showed a typical snoRNA secondary structure: one C/D snoRNA and six H/ACA snoRNAs. The remaining one RNA did not show any homology to other RNAs in a database. Four of the seven isolated snoRNAs could form base pairings with parts of rRNAs, suggesting that they are potential pseudouridilation sites and methylation sites. The results of our study suggest that there are more as-yet-unidentified small ncRNAs of which genes are located in the intron regions of protein-coding genes in C. elegans.
