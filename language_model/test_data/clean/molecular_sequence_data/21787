The diversity of attached and free-living Actinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, was investigated in a mesotrophic lake during two periods of contrasting phytoplankton dominance. Comparison analyses showed a phylogenetic difference between attached and free-living communities for the two bacterial groups. For Betaproteobacteria, the betaI clade was detected at all sampling dates in free-living and attached bacterial communities and was the dominant clade contributing to 57.8% of the total retrieved operational taxonomic units (OTUs). For Actinobacteria, the acIV cluster was found to be dominant, followed by acI contributing to 45% and 25% of the total retrieved OTUs, respectively. This study allows the determination of eight new putative clades among the Betaproteobacteria termed lbI-lbVIII and a new putative clade named acLBI belonging to the Actinobacteria. The seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton and zooplankton communities have been reflected as changes in distinct bacterial phylotypes for both attached and free-living communities. For attached communities, relationships were observed between Actinobacteria and Chrysophyceae, and between Betaproteobacteria and Dinophyceae and Chlorophyceae biomass. On the other hand, within free-living communities, few actinobacterial clades were found to be dependent on either nutrients or phytoplankton communities, whereas Betaproteobacteria were mainly associated with biological parameters (i.e. phytoplankton and copepod communities).
