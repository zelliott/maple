Escherichia coli gyrA43 and gyrB203 alleles conferring temperature-sensitive (ts) growth encoded Gly751-->Asp and Pro171-->Ser substitutions in the DNA gyrase A and B subunits, respectively. A plasmid-borne gyrA43 allele was genetically dominant over a chromosomal quinolone-resistant gyrA gene at 30 degrees C but not at 42 degrees C. These results and others confirm the ts phenotype of the mutation, the first to be identified in the C-terminal DNA binding/complex stabilizing domain of gyrase A protein. By contrast, the Pro171-->Ser mutation is located near the ATP-binding site of gyrase B protein and could interfere with energy coupling during DNA supercoiling. These data are discussed in regard to recently described gyrA(ts) mutations that affect the control of chromosome segregation.
