A rat brain cDNA library has been constructed in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression vector and used to isolate genes that can function in yeast to suppress the phenotypic effects of RAS2val19, a mutant form of the RAS2 gene analogous to an oncogenic mutant of the human HRAS gene. One cDNA, DPD, was cloned and its genetic and biochemical properties were characterized. A DPD product would share 80% amino acid sequence identity with the Drosophila melanogaster dunce-encoded protein over an extended region. We have shown that the DPD protein is a high-affinity cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase.
