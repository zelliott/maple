Many viruses encode proteinases that are essential for infectivity, and are consequently attractive chemotherapeutic targets. The biochemistry and structure of the human immunodeficiency virus proteinase have been characterized extensively, and potent peptide-mimetic inhibitors have been developed. Techniques and strategies used to improve the efficiency of these compounds are likely to be applicable to other viral proteinases.
