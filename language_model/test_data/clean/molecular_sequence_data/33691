Streptococcus pyogenes causes severe invasive infections: the post-streptococcal sequelae of acute rheumatic fever (RF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD), acute glomerulonephritis, and uncomplicated pharyngitis and pyoderma. Efforts to produce a vaccine against S. pyogenes began several decades ago, and different models have been proposed. Here, we describe the methodology used in the development of a new vaccine model, consisting of both T and B protective epitopes constructed as synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins. Two adjuvants were tested in an experimental inbred mouse model: a classical Freund's adjuvant and a new adjuvant (AFCo1) that induces mucosal immune responses and is obtained by calcium precipitation of a proteoliposome derived from the outer membrane of Neisseria meningitides B. The StreptInCor vaccine epitope co-administrated with AFCo1 adjuvant induced mucosal (IgA) and systemic (IgG) antibodies as preferential Th1-mediated immune responses. No autoimmune reactions were observed, suggesting that the vaccine epitope is safe.
