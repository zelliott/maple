There are few data on African children infected with nonclade B HIV-1 in endemic settings, which limits generalizations about pathogenesis and progression. Genotypic and phenotypic variations in host immunogenetics and HIV-1 negative factor (nef) accessory protein may influence disease progression and have frequently been characterized in subjects infected with clade B HIV-1.

In this descriptive study, we report nef gene sequence variation and host genetic polymorphisms in 32 Kenyan children, including 12 slow progressors.

Phylogenetic analysis identified HIV-1 clades A, C and D and a recombinant A/D subtype. Grossly defective nef genes or significant changes from relevant clade reference sequences were not identified in children with delayed disease progression.

nef sequence variations may not be common in perinatally infected African children. Further studies are warranted in HIV-1-infected subjects in settings where infection is endemic.
