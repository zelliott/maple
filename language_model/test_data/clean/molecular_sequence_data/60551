The complete coding sequence of rainbow trout IL-1beta has been obtained. The gene contains a short 5' UTR (97 bp), a 780 bp open reading frame and a 466 bp 3' UTR, which includes a polyadenylation signal, 7 ATTTA motifs and an 18 bp poly A tail. The predicted amino acid sequence (260 amino acids) contains 3 potential glycosylation sites, with a predicted molecular weight of 29 kDa, and shows between 49 and 56% amino acid similarity to mammalian IL-1betas and 57% similarity to carp IL-1beta. Greatest homology was apparent within the secondary structure of the gene, with few of the amino acids known to bind to the IL-1 receptor being conserved. No ICE cut site was apparent but multiple alignment with mammalian sequences allowed a putative mature peptide of 166 amino acids to be identified, in which Ala(95)would be the amino terminus. Northern blot analysis showed that whilst no IL-1beta expression was detectable in head kidney leukocytes immediately after isolation, expression could be induced by stimulation with LPS for 4 h in culture. Similarly, with isolated head kidney macrophages expression was significantly increased following stimulation with LPS.
