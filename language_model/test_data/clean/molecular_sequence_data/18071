The ABA-induced MA12 cDNA from maize, which encodes a set of highly phosphorylated embryo proteins, was used to isolate the corresponding genomic clone. This gene, called RAB-17 (responsive to ABA), encodes a basic, glycine-rich protein (mol. wt. 17,164) containing a cluster of 8 serine residues, seven of them contiguous. It is a homologue of the rice RAB-21 gene (Mundy J, Chua NH, EMBO J 7; 2279-2286, 1988). Phosphoamino acid analysis of the isolated protein indicates that only the serine residues are phosphorylated and a putative casein-type kinase phosphorylatable sequence was identified in the protein. The pattern of expression and in vivo phosphorylation of the RAB-17 protein was studied during maize embryo germination and in calli of both meristematic or embryonic origin. ABA treatment induced the synthesis of RAB-17 mRNA and protein in calli, however, the RAB-17 proteins were found to be highly phosphorylated only in embryos.
