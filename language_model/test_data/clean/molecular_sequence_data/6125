The nucleotide sequence of the phage 186 genome from 46.3-52.5% was determined and was found to contain two open reading frames highly similar to the tail sheath gene FI and tail tube gene FII of phage P2. The reading frames were identified as genes J and I by marker rescue experiments. A late promoter pJ was identified by galK reporter and primer extension studies. Northern analysis suggested that the pJ transcript predominantly terminated immediately after gene I, although some transcripts could extend to the terminator tB at 67.3%.
