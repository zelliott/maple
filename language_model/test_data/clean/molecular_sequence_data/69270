The 3'-end of the cDNA encoding the smg GDP dissociation stimulator (smg GDS) protein shares 100% homology with the previously published expressed sequence tag 00038 site. This site extends the 3'-end of the smg GDS gene by 212 bp. It has been localized to human chromosome 4. Here, we have refined the localization of smg GDP to human chromosome 4q21-q25 using a mapping panel of rodent/human somatic cell hybrids containing different parts of chromosome 4. This chromosomal localization of smg GDP to 4q21-25 overlaps with a region of allele loss in primary hepatocellular carcinoma (4q13-q26).
