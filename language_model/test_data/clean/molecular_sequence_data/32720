Haplotype distribution, gene flow, and population genetic structure of the ark shell (Scapharca broughtonii) were studied using a partial sequence of a mitochondrial COI gene. The sequence analysis of 100 specimens obtained from a total of seven localities-five in Korea, one in China, and one in Russia- revealed 29 haplotypes, ranging in sequence divergence from 0.1% to 2.1%. Among these, the most frequent haplotype, SB16, was extensively distributed over study areas, especially in all Korean localities. This extensive distribution consequently resulted in the near absence of statistically significant genetic distance. Also, a high rate of gene flow was characteristic among localities in Korea. A test of genetic population structure showed that the ark shell in Korea formed a large genetic group. Moreover, an AMOVA test to determine the allocation of the genetic variance showed that most of the variance was distributed between localities, instead of within localities. However, a significant population differentiation was found between geographic populations [i.e., Jinhae (locality 6) in Korea and Sangdong (locality 5) in China and Vladivostok (locality 7) in Russia] based on geographic distance and population structure. These distinct groups may be associated with geographic characteristics and barriers. The results suggest that most of the ark shell populations in Korea caused considerable distribution to form a genetically homogeneous and intermixing structure, whereas some of the Korean and Chinese and Russian populations had a significantly different genetic structure.
