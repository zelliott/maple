Although the full sequence of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome has been known for more than a decade, effective genetic antivirals have yet to be developed. Here we show that, of 22 regions examined, one highly conserved sequence (ACTCTTTGGCAACGA) near the 3' end of the HIV-1 gag-pol transframe region, encoding viral protease residues 4 to 8 and a C-terminal Vpr-binding motif of p6(Gag) protein in two different reading frames, can be successfully targeted by an antisense peptide nucleic acid oligomer named PNA(PR2). A disrupted translation of gag-pol mRNA induced at the PNA(PR2)-annealing site resulted in a decreased synthesis of Pr160(Gag-Pol) polyprotein, hence the viral protease, a predominant expression of Pr55(Gag) devoid of a fully functional p6(Gag) protein, and the excessive intracellular cleavage of Gag precursor proteins, hindering the processes of virion assembly. Treatment with PNA(PR2) abolished virion production by up to 99% in chronically HIV-1-infected H9 cells and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with clinical HIV-1 isolates with the multidrug-resistant phenotype. This particular segment of the gag-pol transframe gene appears to offer a distinctive advantage over other regions in invading viral structural genes and restraining HIV-1 replication in infected cells and may potentially be exploited as a novel antiviral genetic target.
