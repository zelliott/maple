The structural elucidation of the polar lipids in Halobacterium trapanicum is reported with particular emphasis on a new sulfated disaccharide derivative of 2,3-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol. The full structural designation of this glycolipid is 2,3-di-O-phytanyl-1-O- (mannopyranosyl-(2-sulfate)-alpha-D-1-2-glucopyranosyl-alpha-D)-sn-glyce rol. The value of glycolipid structures in the taxonomy of halophilic Archaea is also discussed.
