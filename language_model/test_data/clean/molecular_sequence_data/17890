In our studies of VLA-3 we have shown (i) that a single integrin (VLA-3) can bind to multiple ligands by different mechanisms, involving RGD and non-RGD sites, which are regulated differently by divalent cations. Also we showed from the primary sequence of VLA-3 that it is only distantly related to the other cleaved alpha subunits. In our studies of VLA-2 we have shown that a single integrin may have at least three functional forms, depending on the cell type where expressed. In addition, we have expressed functional VLA-2 in RD cells, resulting in both Coll and Lm binding functions in vitro, and increased tumor cell metastasis in vivo in nude mice.
