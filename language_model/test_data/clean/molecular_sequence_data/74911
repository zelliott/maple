We present in this paper the nucleotidic sequence of the FUR4 gene encoding the uracil permease in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The deduced amino acid sequence of the permease has 633 residues; it consists of many hydrophobic stretches, only the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the protein (about 100 and 50 amino acids respectively) being mostly hydrophilic. No N-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide is present, although it is shown in this work that the biosynthesis of the uracil permease goes through the secretion/glycosylation pathway. Using the results of three different methods, allowing the prediction of transmembrane alpha helices in proteic sequences, we drew a model of folding of the permease in the membrane.
