O-polysaccharides were isolated from the lipopolysaccharides of Escherichia coli O40 and Shigella dysenteriae type 9 and studied by chemical analyses along with (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy. The following new structure of the O-polysaccharide of E. coli O40 was established: -->2)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->4)-beta-D-Manp-(1-->4)-alpha-D-Galp-(1-->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1--> TheO-polysaccharide structure of S. dysenteriae type 9 established earlier was revised and found to be identical to the reported structure of the capsular polysaccharide of E. coli K47 and to differ from that of the E. coli O40 polysaccharide in the presence of a 3,4-linked pyruvic acid acetal having the (R)-configuration (RPyr): -->2)-beta-D-Galp3,4(RPyr)-(1-->4)-beta-D-Manp-(1-->4)-alpha-D-Galp-(1-->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->
