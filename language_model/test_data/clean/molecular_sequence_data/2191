The entire gene for chicken cartilage matrix protein (CMP) has been isolated and characterized by restriction mapping, electron microscopy, nuclease S1 mapping, and sequence analysis. The gene, which is present in a single copy in the chicken genome, is 18 kilobase pairs long and comprises eight exons and seven introns. It has two transcription initiation sites, 8 base pairs from each other. A sequence very homologous to the consensus nuclear factor III binding-site sequence, a CAT- and a TATA-like sequence are found in the promoter region and ATTAAA is used as a polyadenylation signal. The nucleotide sequence defines a primary translation product of 493 amino acids which consists of a 23-amino acid signal peptide and two large repeated domains connected by an epidermal growth factor module. Amino acid sequences homologous to those of the repeated domains are present in the type A repeats of von Willebrand factor, complement factors B and C2, and in the alpha chains of the integrins Mac-1, p150,95, and LFA-1. The exon-intron structure indicates that the CMP gene may have arisen by exon duplication and exon shuffling during evolution. The GT-AG splice rule cannot be applied for the excision of the last intron of the CMP pre-mRNA. The donor splice site of intron G is basically different from the consensus sequence indicating that a novel type of splicing mechanism might exist in cartilage.
