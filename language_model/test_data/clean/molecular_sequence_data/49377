Bulb of Fritillaria cirrhosa is an important traditional Chinese herbal medicine. According to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (1995), it is commonly used as an antitussive and expectorant. Many young bulbs from species of Fritillaria are similar to those of F. cirrhosa, but they are different in price and quality. Therefore, there are many young bulbs from species of Fritillaria that could fake those of F. cirrhosa on the commercial market. The coding region of 5S-rRNA is highly conserved in higher eukaryotes. The 5S-rRNA spacer region sequences of F. thunbergii, F. pallidiflora, F. ussuriensi, F. delavayi, F.cirrhosa, F. anhuiensis, F. puqiensis were cloned by PCR with a pair of primers located within the conserved coding region. Based on sequences analyses of the 5S-rRNA spacer region from the 7 species, a specific sequence was found in F. cirrhosa. A pair of specific primers was designed for differentiating the bulbs of F. cirrhosa from each other by PCR. This result indicated that the method is rapid, more accurate and applicable in identification of the bulbs of F. cirrhosa at the DNA level.
