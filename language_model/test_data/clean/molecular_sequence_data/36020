The synthesis and biological activity of a bifunctional, heterodimeric insect neuropeptide analog are described. The heterodimer is composed of the C-terminal pentapeptide active core regions of the leucokinin/achetakinin and pyrokinin neuropeptide families linked via their N-terminal amino groups with a succinyl diacid moiety. Members of the leucokinin/achetakinin family can induce fluid secretion in malpighian tubules of the house cricket, Acheta domesticus, whereas the pyrokinins demonstrate activity in a cricket oviduct myotropic bioassay. No cross-activity is observed for the two neuropeptide families in these bioassays. However, the heterodimer elicits responses in both Acheta bioassays. Such a bifunctional analog may in future serve as a template for the design of stable, bifunctional pest insect control agents of greater efficiency.
