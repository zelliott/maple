The lack of reagents or molecular probes specific for the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) receptor has hindered characterization of the molecular mechanism(s) by which CNTF influences the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of cells of the vertebrate nervous system. We have developed methods for the detection and separation of cells expressing CNTF receptors by using a variety of binding assays based on a genetically engineered CNTF molecule containing an "epitope tag" at its C-terminus. These assays have allowed us to identify several neuronal cell lines, as well as embryonic and adult neurons in primary cultures, that bind CNTF and functionally respond to CNTF by rapidly activating the transcription of immediate early primary response genes.
