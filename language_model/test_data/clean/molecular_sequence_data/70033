Two DNA sequences were cloned from the genome of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) by cross-hybridization with the human minisatellite sequence 33.6. The rice sequences consisted of tandem direct repeats, which showed significant similarity to the 33.6 consensus sequence. Profiles capable of distinguishing different rice cultivars were detected by cross-hybridization with a DNA probe amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from one of the rice minisatellite sequences.
