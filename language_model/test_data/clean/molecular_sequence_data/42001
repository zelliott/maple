A cosmid clone containing the ovine and C epsilon and C alpha immunoglobulin heavy chain genes was isolated and characterised. Restriction mapping and sequence analysis showed a high degree of similarity between the bovine and ovine C epsilon loci. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of sheep genomic DNA revealed Mendelian inheritance of polymorphisms with identical variation in allele size for various restriction enzymes. This identical variation suggested that a deletion of approximately 100 bp existed at the 5' end of the smaller alleles.
