Four non-enzymatic polypeptides from Naja nigricollis crawshawii venom were recently isolated and shown to inhibit plasma coagulation and platelet aggregation. We have now determined the amino acid compositions, amino terminal sequences and direct lytic activity of these anticoagulants. The results of these studies allow us to identify the anticoagulants as cardiotoxins. The anticoagulant activity of these cardiotoxins is far more potent than that of other cardiotoxins previously reported to have anticoagulant activity.
