All reverse transcriptases (RTs) so far examined are known to possess in common a stretch of 7 amino acids called the YXDD box. Various mutations were introduced in vitro into the nucleotide sequence coding for this box of Moloney murine leukaemia virus (Mo-MuLV) RT. The YXDD box of Mo-MuLV could be replaced by the counterpart of a Drosophila retrotransposon, 17.6, without loss of activity, while virtually complete loss of activity was detected in the case of replacement of the YXDD box of Rous sarcoma virus RT. Amino-acid substitution at position X resulted in significant change in divalent metal ion preference and enzyme activity, thus indicating that the YXDD box possibly constitutes a part of the active center of RT through metal ion binding.
