MicroRNAs regulate gene expression by repressing translation or directing sequence-specific degradation of their complementary mRNA. We recently reported that miR-203 is down-regulated, and its exogenous expression inhibits cell growth in canine oral malignant melanoma tissue specimens as well as in canine and human malignant melanoma cells. A microRNA target database predicted E2F3 and ZBP-89 as putative targets of microRNA-203 (miR-203). The expression levels of E2F3a, E2F3b, and ZBP-89 were markedly up-regulated in human malignant melanoma Mewo cells compared with those in human epidermal melanocytes. miR-203 significantly suppressed the luciferase activity of reporter plasmids containing the 3'-UTR sequence of either E2F3 or ZBP-89 complementary to miR-203. The ectopic expression of miR-203 in melanoma cells reduced the levels of E2F3a, E2F3b, and ZBP-89 protein expression. At the same time, miR-203 induced cell cycle arrest and senescence phenotypes, such as elevated expression of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma and other markers for senescence. Silencing of E2F3, but not of ZBP-89, inhibited cell growth and induced cell cycle arrest and senescence. These results demonstrate a novel role for miR-203 as a tumor suppressor acting by inducing senescence in melanoma cells.
