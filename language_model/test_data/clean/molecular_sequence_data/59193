The published sequence of the insertion element ISH28 contained many small ORFs that were difficult to interpret. We resequenced the entire element and found seven nucleotide differences. The corrected sequence of ISH28 is 938 bp long, and now reveals a single open reading frame of 828 bp. The putative protein is highly similar (49% aa identity) to the predicted transposase of ISH1.
