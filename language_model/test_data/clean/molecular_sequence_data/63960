Lactobacillus sp. LA2 (DSM15502) and related strains (LA2 group) possess strong beer-spoilage ability. The 16S rDNA sequence of LA2 strain is virtually indistinguishable from that of L. collinoides, generally considered to be nonbeer-spoilage bacteria. The aim of this study was to identify the genetic marker to distinguish between Lactobacillus sp. LA2 group and L. collinoides and to provide a rapid means of identifying beer-spoilage strains belonging to Lactobacillus sp. LA2 group.

The 16-23S rDNA intergenic spacer (ITS) regions of Lactobacillus sp. LA2 and L. collinoides JCM1123T were sequenced to identify a genetic marker to distinguish between the two groups. As a result, 300 and 500 bp ITS regions of Lactobacillus sp. LA2 were found to be almost identical with those of L. collinoides JCM1123T. Sequence comparison analysis between Lactobacillus sp. LA2 and L. collinoides JCM1123T revealed that the two contiguously located nucleotides are absent in both ITS regions of Lactobacillus sp. LA2. Based on the sequence difference, we have designed specific PCR primers with a minor modification to the primer sequence that can differentiate between beer-spoilage Lactobacillus sp. LA2 group and nonbeer-spoilage L. collinoides.

The PCR-based method has been developed to identify Lactobacillus sp. LA2 group, providing a rapid and sensitive means of determining the beer-spoilage ability of detected bacterial strains.

The substitution of one nucleotide, located at the third position to the 3'-end in the primer sequence, enhanced the specificity of the PCR method while retaining sufficient sensitivity. The nucleotide gap identified in this study appeared to serve as a useful genetic marker that can differentiate 12 beer-spoilage Lactobacillus sp. LA2 group strains from its close relatives that exhibit no beer-spoilage ability.
