Nr2e3 is a nuclear hormone receptor that is involved in rod photoreceptor differentiation. The Nr2e3 gene was previously identified in humans, mice, zebrafish and chicken. In all species, Nr2e3 expression is restricted to the retina and is believed to have a role in rod photoreceptor specification and maintenance. Here we report the identification and characterization of the Xenopus Nr2e3. We found that Nr2e3 is primarily expressed in developing rod photoreceptors. In contrast to other species, Nr2e3 is also expressed in the notochord and pineal gland during Xenopus laevis development.
