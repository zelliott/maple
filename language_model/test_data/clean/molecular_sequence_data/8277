Magnetic isolation of endocytic vesicles from Dictyostelium discoideum was accomplished after feeding the amoebae with iron oxide particles. Proteins associated with the endocytic vesicles were resolved by SDS-PAGE and digested 'in-gel' with endoproteinase Lys-C or Asp-N to generate peptides for amino acid sequencing. This strategy allowed the identification of the major protein constituents of the vesicles: namely, the A, B, D, E and 110 kDa subunits of a vacuolar type H(+)-ATPase, actin, a Rab 7-like GTPase, a p34 protein corresponding to a new cysteine proteinase and the 25 kDa product of a recently sequenced D. discoideum open reading frame.
