Herein we report a 10.9 kb deletion and a 95 bp inversion in a patient with severe hemophilia B (factor IXHB209). With the addition of factor IXHB209, three of six characterized deletions in the factor IX gene are now known to include inversions. A high frequency of combined deletions and inversions has not previously been described in a human gene.
