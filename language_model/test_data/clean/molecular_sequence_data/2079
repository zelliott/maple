A cell-free system of nuclear extracts from BHK21 cells has been developed to catalyse recombination in vitro between the DNA of adenovirus type 12 (Ad12) and two different hamster preinsertion sequences. The pBR322 cloned 1768 bp fragment p7 and the 3.1 kbp fragment p16 from BHK21 hamster DNA had previously been identified as the preinsertion sites corresponding to the junctions between Ad12 DNA and hamster DNA in cell line CLAC1 and in the Ad12-induced tumour T1111(2), respectively. Preinsertion sequences, which had recombined previously with foreign (Ad12) DNA, might again be recognized by the recombination system even in a cell-free system. PstI cleaved Ad12 DNA and the circular or the EcoRI linearized p7 or p16 preinsertion sequences were incubated with nuclear extracts. Recombinants were isolated by transfecting the DNA into recA- Escherichia coli strains and by screening for Ad12 DNA-positive colonies. Without a selectable eukaryotic marker, all Ad12 DNA positive recombinants were registered. Out of a total of greater than 90 p7-Ad12 DNA recombinants, 21 were studied by restriction-hybridization, and four by partial nucleotide sequence analyses. Among the p16-Ad12 DNA recombinants, four were analysed. The sites of linkage between Ad12 DNA and p7 or p16 hamster DNA were all different and distinct from the original CLAC1 or T1111(2) junction site between Ad12 and hamster DNA. The in vitro recombinants were not generated by simple end-to-end joining of the DNA fragments used in the reaction but by genetic exchange. Thirteen of the 25 recombinants were derived from the 61-71 map unit fragment of Ad12 DNA. Recombination experiments between Ad12 DNA and four randomly selected unique or repetitive hamster DNA sequences of 1.5-6.2 kbp in length did not yield recombinants. Apparently, the p7 and p16 hamster preinsertion sequences recombined with Ad12 DNA with a certain preference.
