Bacteria of the genus Proteus are facultative pathogens which commonly cause urinary tract infections. Based on the serological specificity of the O-chain polysaccharide of the lipopolysaccharide (O-polysaccharide, O-antigen), strains of P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris have been classified into 60 serogroups. Studies on the chemical structure and serological specificity of the O-antigens aim at the elucidation of the molecular basis and improvement of the serological classification of these bacteria.

The O-polysaccharide was prepared by acetic acid degradation of the lipopolysaccharide isolated from dried bacterial mass of each strain by hot phenol/water extraction. (1)H- and (13)C-NMR spectroscopy was used for structural studies. Serological studies were performed with rabbit O-antisera using enzyme immunosorbent assay, passive hemolysis test, and the inhibition of reactions in these assays as well DOC-PAGE and Western blot.

Four Proteus strains belonging to serogroups O17 and O35 were found to possess similar O-polysaccharide structures, in particular having the same carbohydrate backbone built up of tetrasaccharide repeating units. However, they differ in the presence or absence of additional substituents, such as phosphoethanolamine in P. mirabilis O17 and glucose in P. penneri O17, as well as in the pattern and degree of O-acetylation of various monosaccharide residues. Serological studies also showed close relationships between the O-antigens studied.

Based on these data it is proposed to reclassify strain P. mirabilis PrK 61/57, formerly representing the O35 serogroup, into the serogroup O17 in the Kauffman-Perch classification system of Proteus.
