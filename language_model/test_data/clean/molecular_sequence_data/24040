Protease-encoding nucleotide sequences of 27 HIV-1 variants isolated in Russia and other CIS countries from seropositive intravenous drug-users were analyzed. None of the above persons did ever take antiretroviral drugs. The nucleotide sequences were shown to belong to subtypes A and to be have a high degree of genetic homogeneity (0.00-3.23; mean--1.38 +/- 0.79). No isolates contained any primary mutations of resistance to protease inhibitors. At the same time, above one half of the isolates bore the V771 substitution, which, according to published data, is the secondary mutation of resistance that conditions a higher resistance to Nelfinavir. Moreover, the substitution was associated with 2 synonymous mutations in triplets 31 and 78, which denotes a single origin for all V771 variants.
