pMRA17 cloned from Pseudomonas K-62 plasmid pMR26 specified the resistance to both organic and inorganic mercurials. DNA sequence of this broad-spectrum resistant mer operon was determined. The 5504-bp sequence includes six open reading frames (ORFs), five of which were identified as merR, merT, merP, merA and merB in order by analysis of deletion mutants and by comparison with the DNA and amino acid (aa) sequences of previously sequenced mer operons. The merB encoding organomercurial lyase showed a less identity than the other mer genes with those from other broad-spectrum resistance operons. The remaining ORF named merE, located between merA and merB, had no significant homology with the published mer genes and seemed to be a new gene which may involve in phenylmercury resistance. Induction experiments and maxicell analyses of the mer-polypeptides revealed that pMRA17 mer operon expressed mercurial-inducible phenotype and the merB and merE as well as the merA were under the control of MerR which could activate not only by mercuric ion but also by organomercurials.
