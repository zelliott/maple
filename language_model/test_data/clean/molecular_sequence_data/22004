GYF domains are small, versatile adaptor domains that recognize proline-rich sequences (PRS). They are present in most eukaryotic species sequenced so far, but in contrast to other PRS-recognition domains (PRD), GYF domains have not experienced the same amplification in metazoa during evolution. Mutational and structural analysis has shown the conserved signature W-X-Y-X(6-11)-GPF-X(4)-M-X(2)-W-X(3)-GYF to be the site of interaction with proline-rich peptides. In contrast, composition and length of the C-terminal half of GYF domains are not conserved. Similar to other PRD, GYF domains bind to many different PRS that converge on a minimal consensus sequence. All GYF domains analyzed so far selected for the core motif PPG, whereas amino-acid preferences adjacent to this motif vary. As a result of this analysis, two subfamilies have been identified: CD2BP2-type and SMY2-type GYF domains. The latter subfamily comprises most GYF domains and is characterized by a shorter beta(1)-beta(2) loop and an aspartate instead of the tryptophan found at position 8 in CD2BP2-type GYF domains. Recent analysis of binding specificities for GYF domains allowed identification of novel interaction partners. Thereby proteomics has contributed to a functional understanding of GYF domain-containing proteins and sets the stage for a more systematic investigation of their functions in vivo.
