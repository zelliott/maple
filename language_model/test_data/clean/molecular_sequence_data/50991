Significant advances have been made in elucidating the structure of Na+ cotransport proteins. Some fifteen of these low-abundance proteins have been cloned, sequenced and functionally expressed. They are members of the 12 membrane-spanning superfamily and they segregate into two groups, the Na+/glucose (SGLT1) and Na+/Cl-/GABA (GAT-1) families. SGLT1 transporters are expressed in bacteria and animal cells, while GAT-1 transporters are mostly expressed in the brain. None have yet been found in plants.
