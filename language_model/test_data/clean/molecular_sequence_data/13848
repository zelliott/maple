Specific domains of the NS4 and NS5 gene products of hepatitis C virus have been identified using hydrophilicity profiles for the prediction of potential immunogenic regions, and epitope scanning techniques. Peptides synthesised on the basis of such data show excellent reactivity in the ELISA format. Introduction of a glycine-glycine spacer between two peptides (NS4-12 and NS5-44) to give a single chimeric peptides does not appear to impair immunoreactivity. An ELISA based on the chimeric peptide and a Core-NS3 recombinant protein correctly diagnoses a cohort of haemodialysed patients, three commercial HCV panels and the sera of a negative control population.
