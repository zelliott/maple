Natural killer T (NKT) cells play an important role in controlling cancers, infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases. Although the rhesus macaque is a useful primate model for many human diseases such as infectious and autoimmune diseases, little is known about their NKT cells. We analyzed V alpha 24TCR+ T cells from rhesus macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) and interleukin-2. We found that rhesus macaques possess V alpha 24TCR+ T cells, suggesting that recognition of alpha-GalCer is highly conserved between rhesus macaques and humans. The amino acid sequences of the V-J junction for the V alpha 24TCR of rhesus macaque and human NKT cells are highly conserved (93% similarity), and the CD1d alpha1-alpha2 domains of both species are highly homologous (95.6%). These findings indicate that the rhesus macaque is a useful primate model for understanding the contribution of NKT cells to the control of human diseases.
