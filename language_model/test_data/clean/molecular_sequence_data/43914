To contribute to the possibility of studying in greater detail the biological significance of Sda-containing glycans as occur in Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein, the following three spacer-linked tetrasaccharides have been synthesized: the Sda determinant alpha-Neu p5Ac-(2-->3)-[beta- D-GalpNAc-(1-->4)]-beta-D-Galp-(1-->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->O)(CH2)5NH 2 (1), the Gal-analogue alpha-Neup5Ac-(2-->3)-[beta-D-Galp-(1-->4)]-beta-D-Galp-(1-->4) -beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->O)(CH2)5NH2 (2), and the GlcNAc-analogue alpha-Neup5Ac-(2-->3)-[beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->4)]- beta-D-Galp-(1-->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->O)(CH2)5NH2 (3). The general trisaccharide acceptor 5-azidopentyl (methyl 5-acetamido-4,7,8,9-tetra-O-acetyl-3,5-dideoxy- D-glycero-alpha-D-galactonon-2-ulopyranosylonate)-(2-->3)-(2 ,6-di-O-benzyl- beta-D-galactopyranosyl)-(1-->4)-3,6-di-O- benzyl-2-deoxy-2-phthalimido-beta-D-glucopyranoside was prepared, using methyl (phenyl 5- acetamido-4,7,8,9-tetra-O-acetyl-3,5-dideoxy-2-thio-D-glycero-D-galacto- non- 2-ulopyranosid)- onate as the sialyl donor. For the syntheses of 1, 2, and 3 the glycosyl donors 3,4,6-tri-O- acetyl-2-deoxy-2-phthalimido-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl bromide, 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-alpha-D- galactopyranosyl bromide, and 3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-2-phthalimido -beta-D-glucopyranosyl trichloroacetimidate, respectively, proved to be the most suitable.
