To evaluate the genetic stability of the CAM-70 measles vaccine strain we have performed 10 serial passages of the seed lot virus FMS-7 in chicken embryo fibroblasts primary cultures (CEF) under production conditions. The nucleotide sequences of the seed lot virus, the virus from a vaccine vial (third passage) and from the 10th passage were determined and compared with each other and with sequences from other sources. The full genome analysis of the CAM-70 vaccine still considers it as the most divergent among all vaccine strains. The nucleotide sequence analyses of viral genomes from the three CAM-70 passage levels have demonstrated that they are identical. This study shows that the measles CAM-70 vaccine virus is highly adapted to its cultivation conditions and that its genetic stability contributes, in part, to the safety profile of the vaccine.
