Using carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) subgroup-specific degenerate PCR primers, we have identified three new CEA gene family member L/N exons (CGM9, CGM10, and CGM11) and all previously reported L/N exons of the CEA subgroup (CEA, BGP, NCA, CGM1, CGM2, CGM6, CGM7, and CGM8). This suggests that the CEA subgroup contains 11 genes. CGM9, CGM10, and CGM11 seem to be pseudogenes. A deletion of an asparagine in CGM9 results in loss of a glycosylation site, which is conserved throughout the CEA gene family. We have previously suggested the number of genes in the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) subgroup to be 11, which together with this study indicates that the CEA gene family contains 22 genes in all. Parsimony analysis of the CEA subgroup interrelationships suggests that CGM7 occupies the most primitive position within the CEA subgroup, being a sister group to the rest. CEA, BGP, NCA, and CGM1 form a fairly well-supported group within the CEA subgroup.
