Enterococcus faecalis EJ97 produces a cationic bacteriocin (enterocin EJ97) of low molecular mass (5,327.7 Da). The complete amino acid sequence of enterocin EJ97 was elucidated after automated microsequencing of oligopeptides generated by endoproteinase GluC digestion and cyanogen bromide treatment. Transfer of the 60-kb conjugative plasmid pEJ97 from the bacteriocinogenic strain E. faecalis EJ97 to E. faecalis OG1X conferred bacteriocin production and resistance on the recipient. The genetic determinants of enterocin EJ97 were located in an 11.3-kb EcoRI-BglII DNA fragment of pEJ97. This region was cloned and sequenced. It contains the ej97A structural gene plus three open reading frames (ORFs) (ej97B, ej97C, and ej97D) and three putative ORFs transcribed in the opposite direction (orfA, orfB, and orfC). The gene ej97A translated as a 44-amino-acid residue mature protein lacking a leader peptide with no homology to other bacteriocins described so far. The product of ej97B (Ej97B) shows strong homology in its C-terminal domain to the superfamily of bacterial ATP-binding cassette transporters. The products of ej97C (Ej97C) and ej97D (Ej97D) could be proteins with 71 and 64 residues, respectively, of unknown functions and with no significant similarity to known proteins. There are two additional ORFs (ORF1 and ORF6) flanking the ej97 module, which have been identified as a transposon-like structure (tnp). ORF1 shows similarities to transposase of the Lactococcus lactis element ISS1 and is up to 50% identical to IS1216. This is flanked by two 18-bp inverted repeats (IRs) that are almost identical to those of ISS1 and IS1216. ORF6 (resEJ97) shows strong homology to the resolvase of plasmid pAM373 and up to 40 to 50% homology with the recombinase of several multiresistant plasmids and transposons from Staphylococcus aureus and E. faecalis. These data suggest that EJ97 could represent a new class of bacteriocins with a novel secretion mechanism and that the whole structure could be a composite transposon. Furthermore, two additional gene clusters were found: one cluster is probably related to the region responsible for the replication of plasmid pEJ97, and the second cluster is related to the sex pheromone response. These regions showed a high homology to the corresponding regions of the conjugative plasmids pAM373, pPD1, and pAD1 of E. faecalis, suggesting that they have a common origin.
