A method is presented for rapid sequencing and mapping of elements which support autonomous replication in yeast. The strategy relies on a novel phage M13 vector which allows detection of ARS (autonomously replicating sequence) function in cloned fragments. Deletion mapping of an ARS element linked to the HO gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has identified a 57-bp region 3' to the gene, which is essential for autonomous replication. This region shows sequence homology to other ARS elements.
