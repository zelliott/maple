The potential regulatory role of delta protein kinase C (delta PKC) in murine erythroleukaemia cell differentiation was studied by using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting the translation initiation region of mouse delta PKC mRNA. Cell treatment with antisense oligonucleotides, at a concentration of 20 microM, followed by hexamethylenebisacetamide induction, produced a specific 2-fold increase in the differentiation rate of both slowly and rapidly differentiating murine erythroleukaemia cell clones. Cell permeabilization by a cationic lipid resulted in a decrease of one order of magnitude in the amounts of antisense oligonucleotides necessary to elicit the maximal response, and accelerated the kinetics of the stimulatory effect. These changes in murine erythroleukaemia cell differentiation rates, observed in both cell clones, were associated with 60% and 50% decreases, respectively, in delta PKC immunoreactive protein in slowly and rapidly differentiating cells. The present results indicate strongly that basal levels of delta PKC in murine erythroleukaemia cells are essential in regulating the initial differentiation rate of these cells in response to chemical induction, and provide further evidence that this PKC isoform plays a fundamental role in maintaining the undifferentiated phenotype of murine erythroleukaemia cells.
