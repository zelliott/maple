The past few years have been significant advances in our understanding of eukaryotic genomes. In the field of parasitology, this is best exemplified by the application of genome mapping techniques to the study of genome structure and function in the protozoan parasite, Leishmania. Although much is known about the organism and the diseases it causes, molecular genetics has only recently begun to play a major part in elucidating some of the unusual characteristics of this interesting parasite. Mapping of the small (35 Mb) genome and determination of the functional role of genes by the application of in vitro homologous gene targeting techniques are revealing novel avenues for the development of prophylactic measures.
