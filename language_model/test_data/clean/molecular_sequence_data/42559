Bordetella pertussis and Bacillus anthracis each produce a virulence-associated, calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase toxin, which generates increased levels of cyclic AMP in eukaryotic cells. The two proteins share sequence similarities in their catalytic domains. The remaining regions display different structural and functional organizations that account for the differences both in interaction of the two toxins with target cells and in the resulting disease symptoms.
