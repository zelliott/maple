To investigate the roles of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) envelope (Env) proteins gp46 and gp21 in the early steps of infection, the effects of the 23 synthetic peptides covering the entire Env proteins on transmission of cell-free HTLV-1 were examined by PCR and by the plaque assay using a pseudotype of vesicular stomatis virus (VSV) bearing the Env of HTLV-1 [VSV(HTLV-1)]. The synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 400 to 429 of the gp21 Env protein (gp21 peptide 400-429, Cys-Arg-Phe-Pro-Asn-Ile-Thr-Asn-Ser-His-Val-Pro-Ile-Leu-Gln-Glu-Arg-P ro-Pro-Leu-Glu-Asn-Arg-Val-Leu-Thr-Gly-Trp-Gly-Leu) strongly inhibited infection of cell-free HTLV-1. By using the mutant peptide, Asn407, Ser408, and Leu413, -419, -424, and -429 were confirmed to be important amino acids for neutralizing activity of the gp21 peptide 400-429. Addition of this peptide before or during adsorption of HTLV-1 at 4 degrees C did not affect its entry. However, HTLV-1 infection was inhibited about 60% when the gp21 peptide 400-429 was added even 30 min after adsorption of HTLV-1 to cells, indicating that the amino acid sequence 400 to 429 on the gp21 Env protein plays an important role at the postbinding step of HTLV-1 infection. In contrast, a monoclonal antibody reported to recognize the gp46 191-196 peptide inhibited the infection of HTLV-1 at the binding step.
