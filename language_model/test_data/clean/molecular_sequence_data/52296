Type IIA and IIB von Willebrand disease (vWD) result from defects in von Willebrand factor (vWF). Although both type IIA and IIB vWD are characterized by the absence of high molecular weight multimers in plasma, vWF from patients with type IIA vWD demonstrates a decreased affinity for the platelet receptor glycoprotein Ib (GPIb), whereas vWF from patients with type IIB vWD show an increased affinity for GPIb. To investigate how structural alterations in vWF affect its interaction with GPIb, we reproduced the reported potential mutations in type IIA and IIB vWD in vWF cDNA and expressed the recombinant proteins in COS-1 cells. The type IIA vWF potential mutation was represented by a G-->A transversion which results in the substitution of Lys for Glu at position 875 in the mature vWF subunit (rvWFLys875). The type IIB vWF mutation corresponds to a duplicated ATG codon, resulting in three contiguous methionines starting at position 540-541 in the normal vWF sequence (rv-WFduplMet540-541). The subunit composition and multimeric structure of both mutant proteins were similar to the wild-type rvWF. The rvWFLys875 bound to fixed platelets in the presence of ristocetin similar to wild-type rvWF. The rvWFduplMet540-541 bound to fixed platelets in the absence of agonist. The rvWFLys875 appears to interact normally with GPIb, and the decreased affinity for the platelet receptor observed in plasma is probably a consequence of prior reduction in multimeric size resulting from the defect. In contrast, the duplication of Met540-541 increases the reactivity of vWF for its platelet receptor.
