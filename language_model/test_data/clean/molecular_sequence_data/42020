Population studies among Japanese were carried out at the D1S80 locus by the polymerase chain reaction and subsequent analysis in agarose gel electrophoresis. A total of 58 genotypes and 25 alleles ranging from 16 to 45 repeat units were observed in a population group of 121 unrelated individuals. The alleles with 18, 24 and 30 repeat units were found to be most common. Some large alleles with more than 42 repeat units were first observed in this study. Statistical tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium showed that no significant deviations could be found in this Japanese population sample. The values of the mean exclusion chance and the discriminating power (DP) were calculated to be 0.76 and 0.91, respectively. The observed heterozygosity was 0.91.
