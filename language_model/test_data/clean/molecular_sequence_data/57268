A series of highly potent, structurally novel, non-nucleoside RT inhibitors has been described. Low nanomolar concentrations of 5-chloro-3-(phenylsulfonyl)-indole-2-carboxamide (1) inhibit the HIV-1 RT enzyme in vitro and HTLVIIIb viral spread in MT-4 human T-lymphoid cells. Good oral bioavailability was observed in rhesus monkeys upon oral dosing of 1 as a suspension in methocel. When compared to other non-nucleoside inhibitors (e.g. 15-18), 1 possesses improved inhibitory potency with respect to the wild-type RT, as well as the K103N and Y181C mutant enzymes. Additional studies within this class of inhibitors are in progress.
