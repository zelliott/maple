An extracellular pectinase (PECI) was purified to apparent homogeneity from liquid state cultures of the thermophilic fungus Acrophialophora nainiana by ultrafiltration and a combination of gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatographic procedures. The molecular masses of PECI were 35,500 and 30,749 Da, as determined by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, respectively. It was more active at 60 degrees C and pH 8.0 and showed high stability at 50 degrees C with half-life of 7 days. However at 60 and 70 degrees C, PECI was much less stable with half lives of approximately 20 and 3 min, respectively. The thermostability of purified PECI was also investigated by fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Fluorescence revealed that the unfolding transition region was observed between 45 and 70 degrees C. A major decrease in the stability was found at 70 degrees C. Circular dichroism measurements at pH between 5.0 and 9.0 showed a transition temperature (T(m)) range of 50-55 degrees . The thermodynamic analysis of these results showed that EPGI is thermal stable protein exhibiting maximum stability (DeltaG(25)) of 22.65 and 19.19 kcal/mol at pH 8.0 and 9.0, respectively. The apparent K(m) value on pectin from citrus fruits was 4.22 mgml(-1). PECI exhibited no detectable activity of pectin methylesterase, endo-polygalacturonase, mannanase, xylanase and cellulase. However, it showed exo-polygalacturonase and pectin lyase activities. The presence of carbohydrate was detected in the pure PECI. It was activated by l-tryptophan, DEPC, DTT, DTNB, DTP, l-cystein and beta-mercaptoethanol and inhibited by NBS, Fe(2+), Cu(2+), Zn(2+), Mn(2+), Al(3+) and Ca(2+). The enzyme showed homology with a pectin lyases from Xanthomonas campestris and Bacillus licheniformis.
