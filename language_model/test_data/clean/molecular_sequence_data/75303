The major trypsin inhibitor from seeds of Jobs' tears (Coix lachryma-jobi) was purified by heat treatment, fractional precipitation with (NH4)2SO4, ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, gel-filtration on Sephadex G-75 and preparative reverse-phase HPLC. The complete amino acid sequence was determined by analysis of peptides derived from the reduced and S-carboxymethylated protein by digestion with trypsin, chymotrypsin and the S. aureus V8 protease. The polypeptide contained 64 amino acids with a high content of cysteine. The sequence exhibited strong homology with a number of Bowman-Birk inhibitors from legume seeds and similar proteins recently isolated from wheat and rice.
