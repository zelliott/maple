The nucleotide sequences of the outer surface protein C gene (ospC) from Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato isolates representing six different restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) ribotype groups were determined, and the deduced amino acid sequences were aligned in comparison with the previously published OspC protein sequences. The sequence similarity analysis revealed the high sequence variability of OspC protein, and the degree of amino acid similarity ranged from 53.8 to 100% among 25 isolates. It has been reported that the representatives belonging to the three species of B. burgdorferi sensu lato showed a species-specific amino acid sequence motif at positions 23 to 35 (B. Wilske, S. Jauris-Heipke, R. Lobentanzer, I. Pradel, V. Preac-Mursic, D. RÃ¶ssler, E. Soutschek, and R.C. Johnson, J. Clin. Microbiol. 33:103-109, 1995). Alignment with the OspC sequences of RFLP ribotype group IV, V, and VI isolates revealed that a sequence motif of all the isolates was quite similar to that of Borrelia garinii. A phylogenetic analysis based on OspC protein sequences also showed that most of the Japanese isolates were closely related to the species B. garinii. THe RFLP ribotype group IV species is predominant among clinical isolates of Lyme disease patients, reservoir rodents, and adult ticks in Japan. Although the isolates differed from type strains of the three delineated genospecies in genetic and immunological characteristics, it is likely that the spirochetes diverged within the species level. Therefore, the representatives of ribotype groups IV, V, and VI appear to have evolved within B. garinii and to have adapted to an Asiatic habitat, and there appeared to be a sufficient ecological pressure to allow bacterial species level development.
