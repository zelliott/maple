We report the structure and the functional activity of the promoter region of ace-1, the gene encoding acetylcholinesterase of class A in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that ace-1 was trans -spliced to the SL1 spliced leader and that transcription was initiated at a cluster of multiple starts. There was neither a TATA nor a CAAT box at consensus distances from these starts. Interspecies sequence comparison of the 5' regions of ace-1 in C. elegans and in the related nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae identified four blocks of conserved sequences located within a sequence of 2.4 kilobases upstream from the initiator ATG. In vitro expression of CAT reporter genes in mammalian cells allowed the determination of a minimal promoter in the first 288 nucleotides. In phenotype rescue experiments in vivo, the ace-1 gene containing 2.4 kilobases of 5' flanking region of either C. elegans or C. briggsae was found to restore a coordinated mobility to the uncoordinated double mutants ace-1(-);ace-2(-)of C. elegans. This showed that the ace-1 promoter was contained in 2.4 kilobases of the 5' region, and indicated that cis -regulatory elements as well as coding sequences of ace-1 were functionally conserved between the two nematode species. The pattern of ace-1 expression was established through microinjection of Green Fluorescent Protein reporter gene constructs and showed a major mesodermal expression. Deletion analysis showed that two of the four blocks of conserved sequences act as tissue-specific activators. The distal block is a mesodermal enhancer responsible for the expression in body wall muscle cells, anal sphincter and vulval muscle cells. Another block of conserved sequence directs expression in pharyngeal muscle cells pm5 and three pairs of cephalic sensory neurons.
