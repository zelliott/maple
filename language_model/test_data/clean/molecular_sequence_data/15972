The cDNA of human mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (E.C.2.6.1.1.) was isolated from a human liver cDNA library using a rat mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase cDNA as probe. The sequence of this cDNA gives a predicted aminoacid sequence for the human presequence and for the human mature protein exhibiting respectively 93% and 95% homology with rat sequences. A Northern blot of total RNA, isolated from various human tissues and hybridized with this cDNA, revealed a single 2.4 Kb RNA band. Mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase RNA was clearly detected in human kidney, placenta, stomach and spleen as well as in both fetal and adult liver.
