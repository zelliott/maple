Cucullanid nematodes identified morphologically as Dichelyne (Cucullanellus) pleuronectidis (Yamaguti, 1935) were collected from the ridged-eye flounder Pleuronichthys cornutus (Temminck & Schlegel) (Pleuronectiformes: Pleuronectidae) in the East China Sea. Their examination using light microscopy and, for the first time, scanning electron microscopy, revealed several important, but previously unreported morphological features and the presence of remarkable morphological differences in the intestinal caecum and deirids among some individuals. Consequently, specimens of D. pleuronectidis were characterised using molecular methods by sequencing and analysing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the ribosomal DNA to test whether the present material with broad range of morphological variability, represents a complex of sibling species or a single species. The results of molecular analyses proved that the differences in the intestinal ceacum and deirids should be considered as intraspecific variation and that the nematode material collected from P. cornutus in the East China Sea represented a single species, D. pleuronectidis. These new morphological and genetic data contributed to an accurate diagnosis of this hitherto insufficiently known nematode and also indicated that a more rigorous study based on morphological and genetic data with broader representation of the Cucullanidae is required to assess whether the traditionally used diagnostic character of absence or presence of intestinal ceacum is of generic importance in distinguishing Dichelyne and Cucullanus.
