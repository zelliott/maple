The sensitivity and specificity of two influenza C virus assays, solid-phase and overlay assays, were investigated using naturally occurring 9-O-acetylated GD(3), rat serum glycoproteins containing 60% of N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid, and synthetically O-acetylated sialylated compounds. The sensitivity of the solid-phase assay was higher for glycoproteins containing N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid than for gangliosides, and also differed for various 9-O-acetylated gangliosides. The overlay assay was less sensitive for all glycoconjugates tested. For virus recognition the presentation of the sialic acid within the molecule and the structure of the sialic acid are essential. Investigation of gangliosides from human melanomas and normal skin with the influenza C virus assay showed an increase of O-acetylation of sialic acids in most tumour samples and the occurrence of several O-acetylated gangliosides.
