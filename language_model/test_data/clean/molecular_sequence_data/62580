To elucidate the progression of gastric marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type, we analyzed a case presenting simultaneously with MALT lymphoma of the stomach and lung, and a gastric high-grade diffuse large lymphoma. The rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) variable regions were analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay. Clonal relationship was shown between the gastric high-grade and the pulmonary low-grade lymphoma. The gastric MALT lymphoma was not related to the other manifestations. Translocation t(11;18) was not detected in the gastric high-grade lymphoma. MALT lymphomas at various locations and with different histologies may derive from a common precursor cell. Lymphomas at identical sites may have different stem cells.
