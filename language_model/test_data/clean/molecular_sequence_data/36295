Neuromedin B is a 10-amino-acid mammalian peptide of the bombesin family. We have used a specific radioimmunoassay and Northern blot hybridisation to investigate the possible synthesis of neuromedin-B-like immunoreactivity in the human pituitary gland. The concentration of immunoreactive neuromedin B in whole human pituitary was 15.2 +/- 4.2 pmol/g wet weight in males and 12.8 +/- 2.7 pmol/g wet weight in females (mean +/- SEM, n = 10). In pituitary tumour extracts, neuromedin B immunoreactivity was 9.1 +/- 1.7 pmol/g wet weight (mean +/- SEM, n = 14) in inactive tumours, 18.4 +/- 6.9 pmol/g wet weight (mean +/- SEM, n = 4) in somatotrophs and 10.4 +/- 2.7 pmol/g wet weight (mean +/- SEM, n = 2) in prolactinomas, with no apparent significant difference between the groups. Gel permeation chromatography of pituitary extracts revealed two immunoreactive peaks, the major one of which corresponded in position to that of neuromedin B-32 and a later minor peak to the position of the neuromedin B-10 standard. On fast protein liquid chromatography, neuromedin-B-like immunoreactivity again eluted in two peaks, a minor peak corresponding to the synthetic neuromedin B standard, and a major more hydrophobic peak which was the big neuromedin B form. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+RNA from human pituitaries revealed the presence of a hybridising band of between 750 and 850 base pairs. These results suggest that neuromedin B is synthesised in the human pituitary gland where it may be of importance in the regulation of pituitary function. Furthermore, the adenomatous condition is not associated with abnormal levels of this peptide.
