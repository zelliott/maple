Little is known about either the frequency of occurrence of enhancers or the interrelationships of various enhancers in mammalian genomes. Previous reports described a potent, transcriptional enhancer within the sequence termed "Xrep," a human X chromosomal genomic clone (Riley et al., 1986; Riley, 1989a). Additional Xrep-related sequences reside on the human X chromosome. A probe for the Xrep enhancer hybridized with multiple restriction fragments located on the X chromosome. Two of the fragments cross-hybridizing with the enhancer had identical enhancer-like sequences but dissimilar flanking sequences. However, both of the sequenced enhancers were flanked by poly(GT) repeats strongly implicated in the generation of polymorphisms. A third sequence cross-hybridizing to the enhancer probe was found, in chromatin form, to be extremely DNase I hypersensitive.
