The base sequence of a specific DNA region identified as the promoter is investigated by means of the quantity S(r) corresponding to "superdelocalizability" of oxygen ion of each phosphate for the ten DNA dimer units ([XY/Y'X']2-) and ([XY/Y'X']2- + H+)-complexes. A mechanism is proposed of how RNA polymerase can recognize its transcription site (phosphate), and is applied to the Escherichia coli promoters, lacUV5, recAp, rrnEpl, and rrnEp2. The result explains fairly well the character of the promoters experimentally found.
