Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) is a critical activator of neuronal apoptosis induced by a diverse array of neurotoxic insults. However, the downstream substrates of GSK-3beta that ultimately induce neuronal death are unknown. Here, we show that GSK-3beta phosphorylates and regulates the activity of Bax, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member that stimulates the intrinsic (mitochondrial) death pathway by eliciting cytochrome c release from mitochondria. In cerebellar granule neurons undergoing apoptosis, inhibition of GSK-3beta suppressed both the mitochondrial translocation of an expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Bax(alpha) fusion protein and the conformational activation of endogenous Bax. GSK-3beta directly phosphorylated Bax(alpha) on Ser163, a residue found within a species-conserved, putative GSK-3beta phosphorylation motif. Coexpression of GFP-Bax(alpha) with a constitutively active mutant of GSK-3beta, GSK-3beta(Ser9Ala), enhanced the in vivo phosphorylation of wild-type Bax(alpha), but not a Ser163Ala mutant of Bax(alpha), in transfected human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. Moreover, cotransfection with constitutively active GSK-3beta promoted the localization of Bax(alpha) to mitochondria and induced apoptosis in both transfected HEK293 cells and cerebellar granule neurons. In contrast, neither a Ser163Ala point mutant of Bax(alpha) nor a naturally occurring splice variant that lacks 13 amino acids encompassing Ser163 (Bax(sigma)) were driven to mitochondria in HEK293 cells coexpressing constitutively active GSK-3beta. In a similar manner, either mutation or deletion of the identified GSK-3beta phosphorylation motif prevented the localization of Bax to mitochondria in cerebellar granule neurons undergoing apoptosis. Our results indicate that GSK-3beta exerts some of its pro-apoptotic effects in neurons by regulating the mitochondrial localization of Bax, a key component of the intrinsic apoptotic cascade.
