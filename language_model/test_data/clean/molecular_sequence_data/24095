During vertebrate embryogenesis, the paraxial mesoderm becomes segmented in a rostro-caudal progression and gives rise to the somites. In this paper we report the isolation of a Xenopus orthologue of paraxis, a member of a family of basic helix-loop-helix proteins, which has been suggested to play a role in paraxial mesoderm development. Xenopus paraxis is initially expressed in the presomitic paraxial mesoderm and later in the dorsal portion of the developing somites. Finally, paraxis expression becomes restricted to the most dorso-lateral region of mature somites.
