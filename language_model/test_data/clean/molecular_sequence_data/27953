The heavy and light chain V region sequences of an IgG anti-DNA autoantibody (PME77), derived from a lupus-prone (NZB x NZW)F1 mouse have been determined by mRNA sequencing. The V kappa gene segment belongs to the V kappa 1A gene sub-group and is found in several (NZB x NZW)F1 and MRL lpr/lpr anti-DNA antibodies, as well as in other antibodies of unrelated specificities. The VH gene segment appears to represent a unique gene or a subfamily of the large J558 VH gene family of the mouse, and is highly related to a germ-line sequence of a major anti-DNA idiotype (H130, IgM) of MRL mice. This anti-DNA-related VH segment has not been found, so far, to be expressed in antibodies with specificities for external or synthetic antigens; therefore, expression of such specificities may be regulated by powerful mechanisms of self tolerance in the healthy animal. In addition, both the heavy and light chain of the PME77 IgG antibody were found to contain somatic point mutations with a high ratio of replacement to silent mutations in complementarity determining regions. This IgM to IgG sequence relationship suggests an affinity maturation process, which is driven by the autoantigen.
