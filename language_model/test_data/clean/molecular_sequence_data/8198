The Caenorhabditis elegans ubq-2 gene encodes a fusion of ubiquitin and a 52-amino-acid ribosomal protein. This single copy gene is both cis- and trans-spliced. It is expressed in all life stages of the worm and its transcript abundance is unaffected by heat stress. Transgenic analysis shows that expression of ubq-2 is regulated by an upstream promoter and a downstream element. The downstream element is required for ubq-2 promoter activity in embryos and in cells of the somatic gonad, including the distal tip cells, sheath cells, spermathecal cells, and cells of the uterus. The gonad-specific activity of the downstream regulator is transferable to a stress gene promoter such that heat-inducible expression of the transgene occurs in the somatic gonad. Stress-inducible beta-galactosidase expression in the gonad does not occur in all life stages, but is initiated late in the second or early in the third larval stage, when differentiation of gonadal tissues begins. Expression of a beta-galactosidase fusion protein from constructs containing the downstream ubq-2 regulator causes abnormalities of the gonad and embryonic lethality. Gonad abnormalities include arrested development and general disorganization. These abnormalities may be related to the overexpression of ubiquitin in the gonad.
