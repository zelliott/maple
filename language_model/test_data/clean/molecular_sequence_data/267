A Gram-positive, non-spore-forming actinomycete, designated strain CC 0387(T), was isolated from a sediment sample from the Baltic Sea, Germany. Classification using a polyphasic approach and comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that strain CC 0387(T) belonged to the genus Promicromonospora and displayed more than 3 % 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence from all Promicromonospora species with validly published names. Strain CC 0387(T) did not produce aerial mycelium. Substrate mycelia were yellowish white to pale orange-yellow and fragmented into bacillary or coccoid elements. The cell wall contained lysine and alanine. Whole-cell hydrolysates contained galactose, glucose, rhamnose and ribose. The polar lipid profile consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, an unknown phospholipid and an unknown glycolipid. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H(4)) (86 %). The G+C content of the DNA was 71.87 mol%. Based on morphological, chemotaxonomic, phenotypic and genetic characteristics, strain CC 0387(T) (=CCTCC AA208024(T)=DSM 21481(T)) represents a novel species, for which the name Promicromonospora flava sp. nov. is proposed.
