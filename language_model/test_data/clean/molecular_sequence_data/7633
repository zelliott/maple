The high seroprevalence of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) in African green monkeys (AGMs) without immunological defects in their natural hosts has prompted consideration of SIV-infected AGMs as a model of apathogenic SIV infection. Study of the molecular mechanisms of SIVagm asymptomatic infection could thus provide clues for understanding the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency viruses. Regulatory genes could be candidates for genetic control of SIVagm apathogenicity. We have characterized Vpr, Tat, Rev, and Nef genes of two SIVagm strains isolated from naturally infected sabaeus monkeys captured in Senegal. The results provide further evidence that SIVagm from West African green monkeys is the most divergent class of AGM viruses, with structural features in long terminal repeat sequences and Vpr and Tat genes that distinguish them from viruses isolated from other AGM species (vervet, grivet, and tantalus monkeys).
