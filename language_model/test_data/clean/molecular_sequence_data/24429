We have isolated a full-length cDNA clone that encodes for a Schizosaccharomyces pombe homolog of the dual-specificity protein kinase of the LAMMER family, lkh1 (lammer kinase homolog). The proposed Lkh1 protein contains 575 amino acids. The lkh1(+) null mutant is viable, but exhibits flocculation upon reaching stationary phase in liquid media and filamentous adhesion growth on solid media. Analysis of the flocculation activity of the lkh1(+) null mutant indicates that asexual aggregation of S. pombe cells into floccules is divalent cation-dependent and galactose-specific. We also demonstrate that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae LAMMER kinase homolog, Kns1, can substitute for the Lkh1 function in S. pombe.
