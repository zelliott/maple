The phosphatidylserine receptor (PSR) was originally described as the putative receptor for phosphatidylserine, which is displayed on the outer membrane leaflet of apoptotic cells as a so-called 'eat me' signal. Since then, contradictory findings about this protein have been published. A common characteristic of all PSR loss-of-function experiments in vertebrates has been neonatal lethality accompanied by severe developmental defects. However, impairment of phagocytosis has only been detected in some of these experiments. Furthermore, several groups have shown that PSR localizes to the nucleus. Structural in silico analysis of PSR indicates that it has a JumonjiC domain, and the molecular features characteristic of Fe(II)-dependent and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases. This review summarizes the current status of research on the PSR protein.
