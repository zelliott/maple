A modified (aFT9m) and a degenerate (aFT9d) version of the rotavirus G9-specific primer (aFT9) allowed strains that were previously untypable, because of point mutations accumulating at the primer binding site, to be G typed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The strains were collected during 2001-2002 in Italy in hospitals of the Apulia region, from children affected by severe rotavirus-associated enteritis. Using a wide selection of G9 rotaviruses detected worldwide, sequencing of the G9 untypable strains, sequence comparison, and phylogenetic analysis showed that the Italian strains have strong genetic similarity (< or =99.4%) to G9 rotaviruses identified recently in many parts of the world and different from the old G9 strains identified during the 1980s (less than 90%). Genetic variation of G9 rotaviruses explains the constraints encountered in the typing assays and presumably accounts, together with genetic reassortment events, for the emergence on a global scale of the G9 serotype.
