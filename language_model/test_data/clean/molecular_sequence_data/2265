The perinatal lethal form of osteogenesis imperfecta often results from mutations which disrupt stable assembly, delay secretion, and cause excessive posttranslational modification of type I procollagen molecules. One such mutation was efficiently characterized by an indirect method of RNA sequence analysis. The mutation initially was localized in procollagen by mapping the distribution of abnormal posttranslational modification within the triple helical domain of mutant molecules. Total RNA was isolated from osteogenesis imperfecta cells in culture, cDNA was synthesized using alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) specific primers, and fragments of cDNA suspected to harbor the mutation were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction technique and then cloned in M13 vectors. Sequence analysis of the amplified cDNA revealed a new, heterozygous Gly----Val substitution at residue 256 of the triple helical domain of alpha 1(I) chains produced by the perinatal lethal osteogenesis imperfecta cells. The nature and location of the mutation were confirmed by sequence analysis of amplified genomic DNA. A Gly----Val substitution has not previously been associated with the lethal form of osteogenesis imperfecta, and this mutation has the most amino-terminal location within the alpha 1(I) chain triple helical domain reported to date.
