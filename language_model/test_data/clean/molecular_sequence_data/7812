We have previously described studies of a 22 kDa active fragment of the LasA proteinase. In follow-up studies of LasA, we have discovered the separate existence of a 23 kDa proteinase which shares many of the enzymatic properties of LasA, including the ability to lyse heat-killed staphylococci. However, this apparent serine proteinase, which we designate LasD, is distinct from the 22 kDa active LasA protein for the following reasons: (i) the N-terminal sequence of LasD shares no homology with LasA or the LasA precursor sequence; (ii) Pseudomonas aeruginosa LasA mutant strains AD1825 and FRD2128 do not produce LasA yet produce LasD; and (iii) specific antibodies to each proteinase do not show any cross-reactivity. LasD appears to be produced as a 30 kDa protein, which is possibly cleaved to produce a 23 kDa active fragment. The purified LasD fragment (23 kDa) shows strong staphylolytic activity only at higher pH conditions, while LasA exhibits staphylolytic activity over a broad pH range. In addition to their ability to cleave at internal diglycine sites, both the LasD and LasA endoproteinases efficiently cleave beta-casein.
