Two novel oligosaccharides with the sialyl-Le(a) structure were isolated from human milk using a monoclonal antibody, MSW 113. These oligosaccharides were purified by affinity chromatography on a column of the immobilized monoclonal antibody and by high-performance liquid chromatography, and structurally characterized by a combination of 600-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The structural studies indicated the structures of these oligosaccharides to be: [formula: see text]
