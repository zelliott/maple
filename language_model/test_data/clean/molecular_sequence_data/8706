The construction of a gene encoding Lys-human proinsulin, its direct expression in E. coli, and the simple purification procedure are described here. The temperature inducible promotor was employed for induction in a very short time. The expression level could reach 20-30%. After simple downstream processing and only one step of Sephadex G50 purification, 150 mg recombinant Lys-human proinsulin with a purity of up to 90% could be obtained easily from 1 L of high density fermentation medium. The obtained product is in the form of Met-Lys-human proinsulin because of the failure of the bacterial host to remove the initiator methionine residue. The Lys-human proinsulin could be changed into human insulin by trypsin and carboxypeptidase B treatment in later steps. After separation with DEAE-Sephadex A25, human insulin with expected amino acid composition and full native biological activity could be obtained with a yield of 50 mg/L of fermentation medium.
