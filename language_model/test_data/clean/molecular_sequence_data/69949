We have previously mapped the human azoospermia factor to a deletion in Y chromosome interval 6 (subinterval XII-XIV). We now report the isolation and characterization of a gene family located within this deletion. Analysis of the predicted protein products suggests a possible role in RNA processing or translational control during early spermatogenesis. The Y chromosome RNA recognition motif (YRRM) family includes a minimum of three members expressed specifically in the testis. Interphase in situ results and Southern blot analysis indicate that several further YRRM sequences map within interval 6. Several mammalian species show Y chromosome conservation of YRRM sequences. We have detected deletions of YRRM sequences in two oligospermic patients with no previously detectable mutation.
