Three peptide fragments of the kringle 5 region of plasminogen and their respective N- and C-terminus maleimido derivatives conjugated to Cys34 of human serum albumin were evaluated in vitro using a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration assay and a human plasma stability assay. The N-terminus maleimido derivative of the 64 to 74 segment of kringle 5 conjugated to human serum albumin possessed remarkable anti-migratory activity.
