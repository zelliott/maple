The tetracycline resistance determinant on plasmid pVM111 from an avian strain of Pasteurella multocida mediates tetracycline resistance by a regulated active efflux mechanism. DNA coding for the determinant did not hybridize at high stringency with DNA representing a group of common tetracycline resistance determinants. The DNA sequence, however; revealed a structural gene and a repressor gene which had significant (37 to 64%) sequence similarities with previously described classes of efflux-type tetracycline resistance genes from members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The new determinant has been assigned to class H.
