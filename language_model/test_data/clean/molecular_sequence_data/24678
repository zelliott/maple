Self-incompatibility (SI) is a genetic mechanism that restricts inbreeding in flowering plants. In the nightshade family (Solanaceae) SI is controlled by a single multiallelic S locus. Pollen rejection in this system requires the interaction of two S locus products: a stylar (S)-RNase and its pollen counterpart (pollen S). pollen S has not yet been cloned. Our understanding of how this gene functions comes from studies of plants with mutations that affect the pollen but not the stylar SI response (pollen-part mutations). These mutations are frequently associated with duplicated S alleles, but the absence of an obvious additional allele in some plants suggests pollen S can also be deleted. We studied Nicotiana alata plants with an additional S allele and show that duplication causes a pollen-part mutation in several different genetic backgrounds. Inheritance of the duplication was consistent with a competitive interaction model in which any two nonmatching S alleles cause a breakdown of SI when present in the same pollen grain. We also examined plants with presumed deletions of pollen S and found that they instead have duplications that included pollen S but not the S-RNase gene. This finding is consistent with a bipartite structure for the S locus. The absence of pollen S deletions in this study and perhaps other studies suggests that pollen S might be required for pollen viability, possibly because its product acts as an S-RNase inhibitor.
