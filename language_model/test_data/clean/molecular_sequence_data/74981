A synthetic peptide derived from vaccinia virus growth factor (VGF) was used as an immunogen to prepare antiserum able to immunoprecipitate native VGF from both vaccinia virus-infected cell lysate and cell-free medium. Pulse-chase, tunicamycin treatment, and carbohydrate trimming experiments revealed that VGF is synthesized as a 19-kilodalton (kDa) precursor which is rapidly modified to a high-mannose-type 22-kDa protein. This cell-associated form is further processed into a 25-kDa polypeptide which, after proteolytic cleavage, releases the mature VGF into the medium as a 22-kDa glycoprotein.
