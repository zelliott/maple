The amino acid sequences of seventeen family G xylanases and the two known family H cellulases have been compared by hydrophobic cluster analysis. A weak but significant similarity was demonstrated between these two families suggesting that these enzymes share the same molecular mechanism and catalytic residues and that they have related 3D folds. The major differences were found in the N-terminal regions.
