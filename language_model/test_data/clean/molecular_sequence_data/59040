The neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits alpha3 and alpha7 have different assembly behavior when expressed in heterologous expression systems: alpha3 subunits require other subunits to assemble functional nAChRs, whereas alpha7 subunits can produce homomeric nAChRs. A previous analysis of alpha7/alpha3 chimeric constructs identified a domain comprising the first putative membrane-spanning segment, M1, as essential to homomeric assembly. The present study dissected further this domain, identifying three amino acid residues, which are located at the most intracellular third of the M1 transmembrane segment, as important in the assembly of homomers. Moreover, formation of homooligomeric complexes seems to require a compatible accommodation between this region and certain residues of the second transmembrane segment, M2. Thus, compatibility between defined domains of the M1 and M2 transmembrane segments appears as a determinant factor governing homomer association of nAChR subunits.
