Brucella melitensis is an intracellular pathogen that induces chronic infection in humans. Here, we report the genome sequences of 16M and its two derivatives, 16M1w and 16M13w, which were allowed to adapt in vivo for 1 and 13 weeks, respectively. Our findings contribute to the investigation of adaptive mutations and mechanisms of chronic infection by B. melitensis.
