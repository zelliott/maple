A novel and generally applicable method is described for the detection of homology in distantly related proteins using a new domain sequence database that contains over 20,000 protein sequence segments of known function. The use of the method is illustrated on distantly related domains shared by complement components C1S and C1R, calcium-dependent serine proteinase and bone morphogenetic protein 1. New homologies are shown between human adducin and the actin-binding domains of alfa-actinin and dystrophin.
