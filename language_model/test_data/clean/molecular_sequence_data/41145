A Gram-positive, aerobic, non-motile actinomycete, strain MN08-A0264(T), was isolated from soil sampled in Mongolia. The isolate formed pale to moderate yellowish brown colonies and branched substrate mycelium. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain MN08-A0264(T) belonged to the genus Cryptosporangium and exhibited 97.9 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Cryptosporangium aurantiacum IMSNU 22120(T), 97.7 % with C. minutisporangium IFO 15962(T), 97.2 % with C. arvum IFO 15965(T) and 96.8 % with C. japonicum IFO 15966(T). The allocation of the isolate to the genus Cryptosporangium was supported by chemotaxonomic data: menaquinone MK-9(H(6)) with minor amounts of MK-9(H(8)) and MK-9(H(4)), major amounts of iso-C(16 : 0), C(18 : 1)9c and C(17 : 0) 10-methyl, a polar lipid profile comprising phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and glycolipids, and whole-cell sugars glucose, galactose, acofriose (3-0 methylrhamnose), mannose, ribose, arabinose, xylose and rhamnose (trace). DNA-DNA relatedness (5-20 %) differentiated the isolate from its closest neighbours. The physiological and biochemical tests allowed the differentiation of strain MN08-A0264(T) from members of the genus Cryptosporangium. Thus, strain MN08-A0264(T) represents a novel species, for which the name Cryptosporangium mongoliense sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MN08-A0264(T) ( = NBRC 105887(T)  = VTCC D9-27(T)).
