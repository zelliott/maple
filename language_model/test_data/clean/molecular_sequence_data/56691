The vaccinia virus VH1 gene product is a dual specificity protein phosphatase with activity against both phosphoserine- and phosphotyrosine-containing substrates. We investigated the potential presence of VH1 analogs in other viruses. Hybridization and sequence data indicated that a phosphatase related to the VH1 phosphatase is highly conserved in the genomes of smallpox variola virus and other orthopoxviruses. The open reading frames from the raccoonpox virus and the smallpox variola virus Bangladesh major strain genomes encoding the VH1 analogs were sequenced and found to be highly conserved with the vaccinia virus VH1. An open reading frame from the baculovirus Autographa californica has sequence similarity to the VH1 phosphatase. The viral proteins appear to be structurally related to the cell cycle control protein p80cdc25. A recombinant phosphatase expressed from the baculovirus gene was found to share with the VH1 phosphatase the ability to hydrolyze substrates that contained both phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine.
