The stage-specific translational control of maternal mRNAs is determined by their differential polyadenylation and deadenylation. In the past year, a growing number of cis-acting elements that both positively and negatively regulate polyadenylation and deadenylation have been delineated. Considerable progress has been made on the biochemical characterization and regulation of trans-acting polyadenylation and deadenylation factors. This review summarizes these advances and their relevance to the roles of polyadenylation and deadenylation in translational control.
