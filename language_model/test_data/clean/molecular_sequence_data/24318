The macaque sperm surface protein PH-20 is a hyaluronidase, but it also interacts with hyaluronic acid (HA) to increase internal calcium ( [Ca(2+)](i) ) in the sperm cell. A region of the PH-20 molecule, termed Peptide 2 (aa 205-235), has amino acid charge homology with other HA binding proteins. The Peptide 2 sequence was synthesized and two recombinant PH-20 proteins were developed, one containing the Peptide 2 region (G3, aa 143-510) and one without it (E12, aa 291-510). On Western blots, affinity-purified anti-Peptide 2 IgG recognized the 64 kDa band corresponding to PH-20 in acrosome intact sperm and, under reducing conditions, recognized the whole 67 kDa PH-20 and the endoproteolyzed N-terminal fragment of PH-20. HA conjugated to a photoaffinity substrate specifically bound to sperm surface PH-20. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that Fab fragments of anti-Peptide 2 IgG bound to the head of live sperm. Biotinylated HA was bound by Peptide 2 and by sperm extracts in a microplate binding assay, and this binding was inhibited by Fab fragments of anti-Peptide 2 IgG. Biotinylated HA bound to the G3 protein and this binding was inhibited by anti-Peptide 2 Fab, but HA did not bind to the E12 protein. Fab fragments of anti-Peptide 2 IgG inhibited the increase in [Ca(2+)](i) induced in macaque sperm by HA. Our results suggest that the Peptide 2 region of PH-20 is involved in binding HA, which results in the cell signaling events related to the elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) during sperm penetration of the cumulus.
