By screening a pigeon genomic DNA library, we isolated a recombinant phage clone containing the alpha(A)-globin gene. The DNA sequence of the approximately 6kbp-long insert fragment of the phage clone was determined. The sequence suggested the existence of pigeon alpha(D)-globin gene located 3.1 kbp upstream from the alpha(A)-globin gene. The expression of the alpha(D)-globin in late embryo was also shown by the N-terminal amino-acid sequence of the intact globin chain. These results show that two adult alpha-globin genes, alpha(A) and alpha(D), exist in the pigeon genome, and the alpha(D)-globin is expressed at the late embryo stage. The stage-specific expression suggests the existence of regulatory elements and factors interacting to inhibit transcription at the adult stage.
