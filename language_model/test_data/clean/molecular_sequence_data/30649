Replication-dependent histone mRNAs are prime examples of nonpolyadenylated mRNAs. We isolated and characterized cDNAs and a genomic clone for a replication-dependent histone H2A.1 mRNA which segregated into the poly(A)+ fraction during mRNA isolation through an oligo(dT)-cellulose column. However, the results of sequencing of the genomic clone suggested that the mRNA did not contain a poly(A) tail. Instead, the genomic sequence revealed a nonterminal oligo(A) tract directly upstream from the typical 3'-terminal hairpin loop of replication-dependent histone mRNAs. The nonterminal oligo(A) tract consisted of 14 adenylate residues interrupted by one guanylate residue (A4GA10). We concluded that this short oligo(A) stretch mediated binding of the mRNA to oligo(dT) even after stringent washes with 0.1 M NaCl, indicating that rather short oligo(A) sequences can ensure binding to oligo(dT)-cellulose. The cDNA and genomic clones contained an AAATAAG sequence at the end of the coding region. It has been suggested that this sequence contains a polyadenylation signal in some yeast and mouse transcripts, but it does not function as a polyadenylation signal in the histone transcript described in this paper.
