Mycobacterium bolletii is a rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacterium first characterized in 2006. Here, we report a case of disseminated infection caused by M. bolletii in a young adult patient. To our knowledge, this is the first case of disseminated M. bolletii infection in an otherwise healthy young adult.
