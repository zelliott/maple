Three strictly anaerobic, methanogenic strains JH1(T), JH4 and JH8 were isolated from rumen of the Korean native cattle (HanWoo; Bos taurus coreanae) in South Korea. The colonies were circular, opaque, and slightly yellowish. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene and mcrA (encoding α subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase) sequences confirmed the affiliation of the novel strains with the Methanobacteriales, and Methanobrevibacter wolinii SH(T) was the most closely related species. The 16S rRNA gene and mcrA sequence similarities between strains JH1(T), JH4 and JH8 and M. wolinii SH(T) were 96.2 and 89.0 % respectively, and DNA-DNA hybridization of the isolates and M. wolinii DSM 11976(T) showed a 20 % reassociation. Strain JH1(T) exhibited 92 % DNA-DNA relatedness with strains JH4 and JH8, and their 16S rRNA gene and mcrA sequences were identical. Cells stained Gram-positive and were non-motile rods, 1.5-1.8 µm long and 0.6 µm wide. The strains were able to use H2/CO2 and formate. The optimum temperature and pH ranges for growth were 37-40 °C and pH 6.5-7.0. The DNA G+C content of strain JH1(T) was 28 mol%. Based on data from this study using a polyphasic approach, the three strains represent a novel species of genus Methanobrevibacter, for which the name Methanobrevibacter boviskoreani sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is JH1(T) ( = KCTC 4102(T) = JCM 18376(T)).
