We examined 158 strains belonging to different Aeromonas species isolated from hospitalized acute diarrhoea cases for susceptibility to quinolones. Compared to other species, a high percentage of the A. caviae strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. Based on MIC values, 6 A. caviae strains were selected and the nucleotide sequences for the quinolone-resistant-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB and parC genes were analysed. In resistant strains, double mutations (Ser(83)-->Ile and Asp(87)-->Asn) and a single mutation (Ser(80)-->Ile) were detected in the QRDR of gyrA and parC, respectively.
