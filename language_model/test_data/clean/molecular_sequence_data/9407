Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are rare genetic disorders characterized by impaired neuromuscular transmission. They are caused by mutations in synaptic, presynaptic and post synaptic proteins. Rapsyn is a postsynaptic peripheral membrane protein that anchors the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor to the motor endplate. CMS patients of Iraqi and Persian Jewish origin, carry a common founder mutation in the E box of the RAPSN promoter region (-38A-G) that causes impaired transcriptional activities of the promoter region. We describe a Persian Jewish family with two siblings affected with typical CMS, harboring the common heterozygous (-38A-G) E-box mutation associated with a previously unreported heterozygous p.224 insT causing an insertion of Threonine in the TPR6 domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first mutation in the TPR6 domain and might give supportive evidence to the role of this domain in rapsyn self association and consequently co-clustering with AchR in the post synaptic membrane.
