Six individual peptides of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule H-2Kb were synthesized. Intravenous injection of peptide 6 into mice prolonged the survival of Kb (BL/6 or B10.MBR) skin grafts on allogeneic R101 and B10.AKM mice, respectively. This was specific, as control skin grafts from Kk (B10.BR) or Kd (DBA/2) donors, respectively, were rejected at the same time in both control and peptide-treated mice. The optimal doses for peptide 6, which is from the alpha 2 domain, were defined. The test system was the inhibition of proliferation in vitro of naive lymph node cells by syngeneic mitomycin c-treated spleen cells from R101 mice preimmunized with irradiated stimulator splenocytes of Kb (BL/6) origin. Down-regulation was specific, as proliferation in response to third-party allogeneic stimulator Kk (B10.BR) splenocytes was not inhibited. Of the six peptides of H-2Kb tested, potent down-regulatory cells were induced by peptides 2 (alpha 1 domain) and 5 and 6 (alpha 2 domain). The greatest down-regulatory activity was obtained by giving peptide 2 to mice that had already been immunized against H-2Kb by injecting EL4 cells. Under the same conditions, injecting peptide 2 did not induce any cytotoxic T cells. In contrast, specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) were induced when cells from primed mice were incubated for 4 days with heated stimulator cells from BL/6 mice. The data suggest that peptides from MHC class I molecules activate precursors of down-regulatory T cells, but not of CTL, and this may explain their ability to prolong skin allograft survival.
