We studied the effects of ozone exposure and dexamethasone on inducible nitric synthase (iNOS) gene expression in Brown Norway rats in vivo. Using a murine iNOS cDNA probe, we detected a 4.4 kb iNOS mRNA by Northern analysis in rat lung. The iNOS signal was weak in control lungs, but increased in lungs exposed to ozone (3 ppm, 6 h). Ozone-induced iNOS mRNA expression was time-dependent, with maximal expression at 2 h, declining by 8 h and increasing again at 24 h postexposure. Dexamethasone significantly reduced the iNOS mRNA expression in the lungs of both controls and ozone-exposed rats. These results demonstrate that ozone inhalation induces iNOS expression in vivo, thus providing evidence at the molecular level for the possible involvement of nitric oxide generation in ozone-induced pulmonary inflammation or lung damage.
