Biosynthesis of caffeoylquinic acids occurs via the phenylpropanoid pathway in which the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) acts as a key-control enzyme. A full-length cDNA (pF6), corresponding to a PAL gene (CcPAL1), was isolated by screening a Coffea canephora fruit cDNA library and its corresponding genomic sequence was characterized. Amplification of total DNA from seven Coffea species revealed differences in intronic length. This interspecific polymorphism was used to locate the gene on a genetic map established for a backcross progeny between Coffea pseudozanguebariae and C. dewevrei. The CcPAL1 gene was found on the same linkage group, but genetically independent, as a caffeoyl-coenzyme A-O-methyltransferase gene, another gene intervening in the phenylpropanoid pathway. In the same backcross, a lower caffeoylquinic acid content was observed in seeds harvested from plants harbouring the C. pseudozanguebariae CcPAL1 allele. Involvement of the CcPAL1 allelic form in the differential accumulation of caffeoylquinic acids in coffee green beans is then discussed.
