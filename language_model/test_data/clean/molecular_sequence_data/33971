C282Y and H63D are two common variants of the hemochromatosis protein HFE. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells stably transfected to express either wild type HFE (WT-HFE), or the C282Y or H63D allele were analyzed for effect of expression of the mutant proteins on transcription of 14 enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism. Cells expressing the C282Y variant showed significant increases (>2-fold) in transcription of five genes and decreases in two compared to that seen for cells expressing WT-HFE, while cells expressing the H63D variant showed an elevation in transcription of one gene and a decrease in two. These changes were seen as alterations in ganglioside composition, cell surface binding by the binding subunit of cholera toxin, expression of sphingosine-kinase-1 and synthesis of sphingosine-1-phosphate. These changes may explain why C282Y-HFE is a risk factor for colon and breast cancer and possibly protective against Alzheimer's disease while H63D-HFE is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases.
