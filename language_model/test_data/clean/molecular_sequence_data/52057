Human serum was found to contain an inhibitor of constitutive interleukin-1 (IL-1) production by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs). Purification of the serum activity by anion exchange chromatography, molecular sieve HPLC, and hydroxyl apatite chromatography yielded material 82% pure with a molecular weight of 17 kDa by SDS-PAGE. Amino acid sequencing revealed the purified inhibitor to be transthyretin (TTR), a liver-derived protein. There was a 42.6% reduction in the production of spontaneous IL-1 activity in EC supernatants after coculture with 10 micrograms/ml TTR. TTR was subsequently found by ELISA to inhibit LPS-stimulated IL-1 production by cells of the human monocytic leukemia line THP-1 by 47.1 +/- 9.4%, whereas a less striking but still significant inhibition of monocyte-derived IL-1 beta production was also observed. Inhibition of IL-1 secretion correlated with increased IL-1 mRNA synthesis in both THP-1 cells and monocytes. Furthermore, TTR was associated with increased intracellular concentrations of IL-1 beta. These data suggest that TTR functions by inhibiting processing of newly synthesized peptide for secretion. This novel inhibitory effect of TTR on the production of IL-1 activity suggests a previously unrecognized endogenous antiinflammatory mediator.
