The sensitivity to antineoplastic agents of subpopulations of haematopoietic cells during cancer chemotherapy is an open question. The performance of natural killer (NK) cells, possibly assisting the elimination of tumour cells under drug treatment might be of particular interest. We examined the expression of the transmembrane multidrug transporter mdr1/P-glycoprotein in NK-cells (CD56+) enriched from the peripheral blood or the umbilical cord blood from healthy donors by indirect immunocytofluorescence using the monoclonal P-glycoprotein antibody C219 and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach with amplimers specific for the human mdr1 cDNA. As the antibody C219 apparently cross-reacts with the human mdr3 gene product whose functions are as yet unclear we also checked expression of this gene by PCR using mdr3 specific amplimers. Distinct, but rather inhomogeneous mdr1/P-glycoprotein expression was found in NK-cells enriched from the peripheral blood. NK-cells enriched from the umbilical cord blood showed quite strong mdr1 expression levels throughout, exceeding the values found in the moderately multidrug-resistant cell line CCRF VCR 100 which is permanently cultivated in the presence of 100 ng/ml vincristine. Mdr1/P-glycoprotein expression was mirrored by lowered sensitivities of the cultivated NK-cells towards actinomycin D or adriamycin. The drug sensitivity could be modulated by treatment of the cells with the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. Expression of the mdr3 gene was low or absent in all NK-cell samples examined so far.
