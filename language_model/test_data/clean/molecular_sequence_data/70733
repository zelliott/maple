A novel HLA-B51 allele, B*5113, was identified in a Kolla Amerindian individual from North-West Argentina. HLA-B*5113 differs from B*51011 by two nucleotide substitutions, one synonymous, the other nonsynonymous. The resulting amino acid difference at residue 116 in the HLA-B molecule's peptide binding site is likely to affect the nature of the peptides which bind to this molecule. The finding of this novel allele supports previous findings of increased diversity at HLA-B in Amerindian groups.
