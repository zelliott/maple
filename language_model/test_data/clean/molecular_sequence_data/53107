A Mycobacterium bovis gene coding for a putative MalE maltose binding protein was cloned and its full-length sequence determined. Database searches revealed 99.9% identity with IpqY, encoding a putative sugar uptake protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv. The deduced protein product showed high sequence similarity to MalE-like proteins from a variety of bacterial species, including Mycobacterium leprae. Analysis of flanking database sequences from M. tuberculosis and M. leprae revealed the presence of malF-, malG- and malK-like genes. Comparison of these mycobacterial sequences with other maltose operons has allowed us to deduce a unique genomic arrangement of the genes involved in the uptake of maltose in members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and M. leprae.
