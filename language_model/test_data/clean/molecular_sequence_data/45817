Termites are eusocial insects with a well-defined caste system, which is an example of polyphenism. This polyphenism is based on hormonally controlled differential gene expression. In the damp-wood termite Hodotermopsis sjostedti, we induced differentiation into the soldier caste by using juvenile hormone analogue treatment. We then investigated specific gene expression, which appeared during the hormonal response and triggered caste differentiation, using fluorescent differential display. A candidate cDNA sequence with similarity to cytochromes P450, CYP6AM1, was characterized and its transcript shown to be repressed between 1 and 3 days after hormone treatment. CYP6AM1 was specifically expressed in the fat body of pseudergates and soldiers. The putative function of this P450 is discussed with respect to the caste differentiation system.
