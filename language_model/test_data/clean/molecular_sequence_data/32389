4'-Hydroxyphenyl alpha-glucoside and 4'-hydroxyphenyl beta-glucoside were polymerized with horseradish peroxidase. The isolated dimers were found to have linkages at C3' of the hydroxyphenyl moieties and proved to be fluorescent. Low accumulation of oligomers was attributed to increasing electrochemical reactivity with polymerization degrees, which were expected from the levels of highest occupied molecular orbital.
