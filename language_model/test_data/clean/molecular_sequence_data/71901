CooA, a member of the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) family, is a CO-sensing transcription activator from Rhodospirillum rubrum that binds specific DNA sequences in response to CO. The location of the CooA-binding sites relative to the start sites of transcription suggested that the CooA-dependent promoters are analogous to class II CRP-dependent promoters. In this study, we developed an in vivo CooA reporter system in Escherichia coli and an in vitro transcription assay using RNA polymerases (RNAP) from E. coli and from Rhodobacter sphaeroides to study the transcription properties of CooA and the protein-protein interaction between CooA and RNAP. The ability of CooA to activate CO-dependent transcription in vivo in heterologous backgrounds suggested that CooA is sufficient to direct RNAP to initiate transcription and that no other factors are required. This hypothesis was confirmed in vitro with purified CooA and purified RNAP. Use of a mutant form of E. coli RNAP with alpha subunits lacking their C-terminal domain (alpha-CTD) dramatically decreased CooA-dependent transcription of the CooA-regulated R. rubrum promoter PcooF in vitro, which indicates that alpha-CTD plays an important role in this activation. DNase I footprinting analysis showed that CooA facilitates binding of wild-type RNAP, but not alpha-CTD-truncated RNAP, to PcooF. This facilitated binding provides evidence for a direct contact between CooA and alpha-CTD of RNAP during activation of transcription. Mapping the CooA-contact site in alpha-CTD suggests that CooA is similar but not identical to CRP in terms of its contact sites to the alpha-CTD at class II promoters.
