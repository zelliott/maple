Chemokines may be important in the pathogenesis of glomerular leukocyte infiltration in antiglomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibody (Ab) glomerulonephritis (GN). We studied the expression of the C-C chemokines [macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, and RANTES] and C-X-C chemokines [platelet factor 4 (PF4), interferon-inducible protein of 10 kDa (IP-10), MIP-2, and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC)] at 30 min, 3, 6, 9, 15, and 24 h after induction of heterologous-phase anti-GBM Ab GN in Lewis rats. There was a rapid induction of CINC, MIP-2, MCP-1, and MIP-1 alpha mRNAs in the glomeruli of nephritic rats 30 min after administration of the anti-GBM Ab, whereas increases in PF4 and IP-10 mRNAs were not seen until 3 h. The mRNA expression of PF4, MIP-1 alpha, MIP-2, and IP-10 peaked at 3 h, whereas CINC and MCP-1 peaked at 6 and 15 h, respectively. By comparison, the expression of RANTES mRNA in rats with anti-GBM Ab GN did not differ from those of control rats. These changes in chemokine gene expression were associated with glomerular polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and monocyte/macrophage infiltration which peaked at 3 h (20.8 +/- 11.1 PMN/glomerulus) and 24 h (8.2 +/- 1.0 ED-1 cells/glomerulus), respectively. The administration of dexamethasone suppressed glomerular chemokine mRNA expression (60-98%) at both 3 and 15 h, which was associated with a 50-100% reduction in glomerular PMN and monocyte/macrophage infiltration, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
