Investigations of intraindividual sequence diversity in mtDNA are a key step in exploring the linkage between somatic mutations in mtDNA and mitochondrial genome evolution. This paper reports a directional cloning procedure enabling the isolation of multiple copies of the D-loop region of the mitochondrial genome from the fish Ameiurus nebulosus. Sequence analysis of 708 D-loop molecules revealed eight mutants, an average intraindividual mutation frequency of 1.12%. Three different types of mutations were detected but each derived from a single mutational event. By contrasting the spectrum of nucleotide variation at multiple biological levels, one can investigate the effects of spontaneous mutations on genome evolution. Such hierarchical analysis suggested shifts in the type and distribution of mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) mutations at different biological levels, indicating the need to recognize three different rates of mtDNA sequence change from the cellular to population level.
