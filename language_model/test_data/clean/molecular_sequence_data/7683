In this paper we describe the genomic organization of the mouse 3-Methyladenine DNA Glycosylase (MPG) gene and localize three putative regulatory elements around this gene. The MPG gene plays a key role in the excision repair of methylated adenine residues and has been localized upstream of the alpha-globin gene cluster in human and mouse. The human MPG gene has been fully characterized, whereas up to now only the cDNA sequence of the mouse MPG gene had been published. Here, we describe a detailed restriction map, the intron/exon structure, the CpG-rich putative promoter sequence, and the exact localization of the mouse MPG gene with respect to the murine alpha-globin gene cluster. Our analysis reveals a remarkable different exon/intron structure of the mouse MPG gene compared with its human homolog. Two prominent DNase hypersensitive sites (HSS) were found 0.1 and 1.5 kb upstream of the coding sequence. In addition to these elements, an erythroid prominent HSS was mapped at the intron/exon boundary of the last exon. The characterization and localization of the MPG gene in mouse makes it now possible to carry out transgenic and gene targeting experiments and are essential to understand the control of gene expression of the MPG gene in particular and of the whole region in general.
