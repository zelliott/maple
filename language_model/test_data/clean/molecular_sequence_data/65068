Phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on four unidentified Gram-positive staining, catalase-negative, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus-like organisms recovered from the teeth of horses. SDS PAGE analysis of whole-cell proteins and comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated the four strains were highly related to each other but that they did not correspond to any recognised species of the genus Streptococcus. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed the unidentified organisms form a hitherto unknown sub-line within the Streptococcus genus, displaying a close affinity with Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus ferus and related organisms. Sequence divergence values of > 5% with these and other reference streptococcal species however demonstrated the organisms from equine sources represent a novel species. Based on the phenotypic distinctiveness of the new bacterium and molecular chemical and molecular genetic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown species be classified as Streptococcus devriesei sp. nov. The type strain of Streptococcus devriesei is CCUG 47155T (= CIP 107809T).
