In microorganisms and plants the first step in the common pathway leading to the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds is the stereospecific condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and D-erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) giving rise to 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP). This reaction is catalyzed by DAHP synthase (DAHPS), a metal-activated enzyme, which in microorganisms is the target for negative-feedback regulation by pathway intermediates or by end products. In Escherichia coli there are three DAHPS isoforms, each specifically inhibited by one of the three aromatic amino acids.

The crystal structure of the phenylalanine-regulated form of DAHPS complexed with PEP and Pb2+ (DAHPS(Phe)-PEP-Pb) was determined by multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing utilizing the anomalous scattering of Pb2+. The tetramer consists of two tight dimers. The monomers of the tight dimer are coupled by extensive interactions including a pair of three-stranded, intersubunit beta sheets. The monomer (350 residues) is a (beta/alpha)8 barrel with several additional beta strands and alpha helices. The PEP and Pb2+ are at the C-ends of the beta strands of the barrel, as is SO4(2-), inferred to occupy the position of the phosphate of E4P. Mutations that reduce feedback inhibition cluster about a cavity near the twofold axis of the tight dimer and are centered approximately 15 A from the active site, indicating the location of a separate regulatory site.

The crystal structure of DAHPS(Phe)-PEP-Pb reveals the active site of this key enzyme of aromatic biosynthesis and indicates the probable site of inhibitor binding. This is the first reported structure of a DAHPS; the structure of its two paralogs and of a variety of orthologs should now be readily determined by molecular replacement.
