Human myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (hNmt) catalyzes the transfer of myristate from CoA to the amino-terminal Gly residue of a number of cellular proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, to structural and nonstructural proteins encoded by retroviruses, hepadnaviruses, picornaviruses, and reoviruses, as well as to several transforming tyrosine kinases. hNmt has been purified 230-fold from an erythroleukemia cell line. The monomeric enzyme has no associated methionyl aminopeptidase activity. To determine the enzyme's kinetic mechanism, we examined the effect of covariation of subsaturating concentrations of myristoyl-CoA and peptide substrate on initial velocity. Double-reciprocal plots excluded a double displacement (ping-pong) mechanism. Product inhibition studies indicated that CoA was a noncompetitive inhibitor against myristoyl-CoA and a mixed-type inhibitor against peptide substrates. Together these results are consistent with a sequential ordered mechanism where, in a typical catalytic cycle, myristoyl-CoA binds to apoenzyme before peptide followed by release of the CoA and then myristoylpeptide products. This kinetic mechanism is identical to that described for Saccharomyces cerevisiae N-myristoyl-transferase (Nmt1p) and emphasizes the impact that regulation of myristoyl-CoA pool size and accessibility may have in modulating protein N-myristoylation in these two species. Comparative studies of the peptide substrate specificities of hNmt and Nmt1p using a panel of 12 octapeptides revealed distinct differences in their tolerance for amino acid substitutions at positions 3, 4, 7, and 8 of parental peptides derived from the amino-terminal sequences of known N-myristoyl-proteins. This finding contrasts with our recent observation that the acyl-CoA substrate specificities of hNmt and Nmt1p are highly conserved and suggests that these differences in peptide recognition provide an opportunity to develop species-specific enzyme inhibitors.
