To analyze the mechanism of interstitial nephritis in patients with Sj√∂rgren's syndrome (SS), we examined the TCR repertoire of infiltration T cells in kidney, labial salivary glands, and PBLs using a PCR. The repertoire of the TCR V beta gene on infiltrating T cells from the kidneys of SS patients was more restricted than those on infiltrating T cells in labial salivary glands and PBL. The TCR V beta 2 gene was expressed predominantly in six of seven (86%) SS patients. Junctional sequences of cDNAs encoding the V beta 2 gene on infiltrating T cells in the kidneys of five SS patients showed that some of the cells expanded clonally, indicating Ag-driven stimulation rather than superantigen-induced proliferation. The same V beta 2 clones in the kidney were not detected in labial salivary glands of the same SS patients; the conserved amino acid (arginine at position 96) in the CDR3 region of the V beta 2 gene was found at a frequency of 48.0% in the kidney, whereas it was detected in only 15.4% of the clones in lips. In conclusion, these findings suggest the possibility that T cells that infiltrate the kidneys of SS patients with interstitial nephritis might recognize different autoantigens than those that infiltrate labial salivary glands.
