The gene encoding the 5S rRNA for Leptospira interrogans serovar canicola strain Moulton was isolated and sequenced. The 5S rRNA gene occurs as a single copy within the genome and encodes a 117-nucleotide-long RNA molecule. The 5S rRNA gene is flanked at both the 5' and 3' ends by regions of A + T-rich sequences, and the 5'-flanking region contains a promoter sequence. L. interrogans has a unique and remarkable organization of the 5S rRNA gene. The 5S rRNA molecule exhibits a strong similarity to typical eubacterial 5S rRNA in terms of overall secondary structure, while the primary sequence is conserved to a lesser degree. Restriction analysis of the 5S rRNA gene indicated that the DNA sequence including the 5S rRNA gene is highly conserved in the genomes of parasitic leptospires.
