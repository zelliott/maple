The mammalian genome contains two genes encoding phosphoglycerate kinase; the pgk-1 gene is X-linked and is expressed in all cells except sperm, while the pgk-2 gene is expressed exclusively in sperm cells. The mouse genome contains no pseudogenes derived from pgk-2. On the other hand, the genomes of Balb/c and C3H/He strain mice contain six other regions with sequences homologous to those of pgk-1 cDNA. These pgk-related sequences are likely derived from the pgk-1 gene by retroposition because all are located on autosomal chromosomes and because none appear to be interrupted by introns. Two of the presumed pseudogenes contain sequences homologous to all regions of the pgk-1 cDNA while the other four genomic regions were truncated at the 5', 3', or both ends. One of the truncated pseudogenes was sequenced. Its pgk-related sequence was not flanked by direct repeats, suggesting that loss of the 5' and/or 3' ends of this retrogene may have occurred following its integration into the genome. Our evidence suggests that pgk-1-derived retroposons arose initially more than 100 million years ago and have continued to arise until so recently that some are unique to different mouse strains.
