The mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx) has been shown to be infected with an STLV-1 closely related to HTLV-1. Two distinct STLV-1 subtypes (D and F) infect wild mandrills with high overall prevalence (27.0%) but are different with respect to their phylogenetic relationship and parallel to the mandrills' geographic range. The clustering of these new STLV-1mnd sequences with HTLV-1 subtype D and F suggests first, past simian-to-human transmissions in Central Africa and second, that species barriers are easier to cross over than geographic barriers.
