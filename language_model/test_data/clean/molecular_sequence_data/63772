Two novel elements (CFG1 and PYG1) of Mag lineage of Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposons were cloned from Zhikong scallop (Chlamys farreri) and Japanese scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis). The total length of the CFG1 element is 4826 bp, including 5'-LTR (192 bp), the entire ORF (4047 bp) and 3'-LTR (189 bp). The entire ORFs of both CFG1 and PYG1 elements are composed of 1348 aa and do not have any frameshifts. Their closest relative is Jule element from the poeciliid fish (Xiphophorus maculatus). On average, the diploid genome of C. farreri contains approximately 84 copies of CFG1 elements. We summarize the major features of CFG1, PYG1 and other elements of Mag lineage of the Ty3/Gypsy group. mRNA expression of CFG1 element in larvae increases gradually before the gastrulae stage and decreases gradually afterward, whereas in adductor such expression in adductor muscle and digestive gland are lower than those in other tissues. Overall, mRNA expression of CFG1 element in the early larvae is significantly higher than that in adult tissues. In muscle tissue, while the promoter and partial GAG domain of CFG1 element are unmethylated, the partial RT domain is highly methylated. These results suggest that CFG1 expression may be controlled by a post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism that is associated with coding-region (RT domain) methylation.
