In this study we report the full length (7.4 kb) sequence of two Australian bovine enterovirus (BEV) isolates, K2577 and SL305 and the partial sequence of a third isolate, 66/27, which are the prototypes of the three major serological groups of BEV in Australia. Australian BEV isolates have not previously been related to the international classification of BEV into the major serotypes BEV-1 and BEV-2. The sequences of the three representative Australian isolates were compared to the full length sequence of a Northern Ireland isolate (VG527) classified as BEV-1, as well as two partial sequences of isolates from the United States and the United Kingdom classified as BEV-2. All three Australian isolates were classified as BEV-1 on the basis of closer nucleotide and amino acid similarity to the 5'-UTR and capsid proteins of VG527 than to the BEV-2 isolates (79-81% versus 76-77% nucleotide identity in the 5-UTR, and 86-98% versus 65-77% amino acid identity in the capsid proteins). These results indicate that most if not all Australian BEV are BEV-1. The remainder of the genome, which encodes non-structural proteins involved in viral replication, showed high sequence homology as has been observed among such genes in other enteroviruses. A system for full-length amplification of BEV isolates was also developed and the K2577 isolate was cloned to obtain a full-length, infectious DNA copy of the BEV genome. When RNA transcripts of BEV amplification products were transfected into MDBK cells infectious particles were produced. These virus particles were identical to the original virus isolates. This system can be used as a basis for the development of BEV-vectored vaccines as well in further molecular studies of bovine enteroviruses.
