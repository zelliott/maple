14-3-3 proteins are a family of highly conserved polypeptides that function as small adaptors that facilitate a diverse array of cellular processes by binding phosphorylated target proteins. One of these processes is the regulation of the cell cycle. Here we characterized the role of Bmh1, a 14-3-3 protein, in the cell cycle regulation of the fungus Ustilago maydis. We found that this protein is essential in U. maydis and that it has roles during the G2/M transition in this organism. The function of 14-3-3 in U. maydis seems to mirror the proposed role for this protein during Schizosaccharomyces pombe cell cycle regulation. We provided evidence that in U. maydis 14-3-3 protein binds to the mitotic regulator Cdc25. Comparison of the roles of 14-3-3 during cell cycle regulation in other fungal system let us to discuss the connections between morphogenesis, cell cycle regulation and the evolutionary role of 14-3-3 proteins in fungi.
