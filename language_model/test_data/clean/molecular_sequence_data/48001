Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas occur with increased frequency (3-6%) in HIV-infected individuals. These AIDS-associated lymphomas (AALs) exhibit characteristics that distinguish them from lymphomas in the general population. A proposed model for the pathogenesis of AAL includes the following: (1) Tumorigenesis is multistep; (2) tumors occur in long-term survivors; (3) tumors are of clonal B cell origin; (4) HIV acts early and is an indirect effector; (5) tumor cells are infected with EBV; and (6) specific genetic lesions occur in tumor cells. Many aspects of this process remain to be tested in an animal model system. Since 1984, necropsy examinations have been performed on more than 1000 SIV-infected rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys at the Tulane Regional Primate Research Center. Lymphoid malignancies were detected in a proportion of SIV-infected animals. These SAIDS-associated lymphomas (SALs) have been studied to determine the extent to which their pathological features recapitulate a working model for the pathogenesis of AAL. The results show that lymphomas occur in SIV-infected rhesus macaques at 4% incidence, similar to that of AAL, and that the incidence of SAL in cynomolgus macaques is eightfold higher. Analysis of SAL from both species of macaques demonstrated significant similarity to the hallmark pathobiological features of AAL. These findings indicate that the HIV-infected human and the SIV-infected macaque share a common pathobiology and mechanism of lymphomagenesis.
