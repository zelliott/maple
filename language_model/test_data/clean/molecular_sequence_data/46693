We have identified and cloned a human nuclear protein that dramatically increases DNA binding of transcription factors that contain a basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA binding domain. We show that this bZIP enhancing factor (BEF) functions as a molecular chaperone. BEF stimulates DNA binding by recognizing the unfolded leucine zipper and promoting the folding of bZIP monomers to dimers; the elevated concentration of the bZIP dimer then drives the DNA binding reaction. Antisense experiments indicate that BEF is required for efficient transcriptional activation by bZIP proteins in vivo. Our results reveal protein folding in the nucleus as a step at which sequence-specific DNA binding proteins can be regulated.
