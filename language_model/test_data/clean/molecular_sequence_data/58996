The matrix metalloproteinase, matrilysin, is thought to play an important role in the early steps of tumor progression. We determined the chromosome location of the matrilysin gene (MMP7) by Southern and PCR analysis of two different panels of somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization of metaphase chromosomes. Matrilysin maps to the region, 11q21-->q22, adding MMP7 to the cluster of matrix metalloproteinase genes that have already mapped to this region.
