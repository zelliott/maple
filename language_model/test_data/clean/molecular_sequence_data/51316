A chimeric inhibitor of cysteine proteinases, YGGFLQVVAGK.amide, was synthesized for use in examining SAR of its cystatin and opioid domains. Analogs were prepared by solid-phase syntheses and evaluated for inhibition of rat brain cathepsin L (E.C. 3.4.22.15) and papain (E.C.3.4.22.2), or binding to rat brain opioid receptors using tritiated DSLET (delta), DAGO (mu) and U69593 (kappa) in competitive binding assays. Cystatin consensus analogs QVVAGK- or N-Ac.QVVK.amide were weakly active as inhibitors, but were enhanced 10-fold to 20-fold with N-terminal L-, FL-, GFL-, GGFL-, or YGGFL, yielding Ki 3 microM and 26 microM for cathepsin L and papain, respectively. YGGFL itself was inactive, but expressed inhibition with N-terminal Q-, QV-, QVV-, etc. Highest activity was found with YGGFLQVK.amide (Ki, 2 microM). N-Dns analogs differentially increased inhibition for papain, whereas an N-Ac-cyclic peptide, N-Ac-CKYGGFLQVVKC.amide, was 2-fold to 10-fold less potent than the two-domain inhibitor. Chimeric peptides containing YGGFL were equipotent as delta-ligands (Ki, 1.7-3.7 nM), but were 2-fold to 10-fold more potent as mu ligands (3.7-11 nM) versus YGGFL itself (37 nM). Two analogs with -QVVAK- and -QVK.amide expressed kappa-binding properties. These data demonstrate the feasibility of using chimeric peptides as probes for exploring enzyme catalysis, and the potential for targeting inhibitors to endosomal or lysosomal compartments via receptor-mediated uptake in cells.
