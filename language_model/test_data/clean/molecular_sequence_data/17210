The spontaneous occurrence of protein AA-type of amyloidosis varies among animal species. As reactive AA-type of amyloidosis has never been detected in the blue fox, we obtained acute phase sera to search for amyloid-protective elements. The purified SAA fraction was characterized by mass and sequence analyses to disclose any unique domains in the amino acid sequence. The data revealed an SAA protein with heterogeneities in several positions, and showed the typical insertion between positions 69 and 70. By comparing the amino acid sequence with that from other mammals, no unique sequence could be observed. However, a C-terminal fragment of apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) was found attached to the SAA. The amino acid sequence of the ApoA-I fragment revealed a partially blocked and ragged N-terminus. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of ApoA-I with that from the dog showed that the ApoA-I fragment started about position 190, had an intact C-terminus, and showed an identical sequence in all positions, except one. Based on the data, we suggest an interaction of the C-terminal fragment of ApoA-I with the SAA protein that inhibits the AA fibrillogenesis in the blue fox.
