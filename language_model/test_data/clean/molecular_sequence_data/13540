Tandemly repeated DNA sequences about 60 bp in length, which may be isolated by digestion with FokI restriction endonuclease, were studied by means of molecular and cytological hybridization in Vicia faba and other Vicia species. The results obtained can be summarized as follows: (i) FokI repeats are almost species specific to V. faba, since they hybridize to a minimum extent to genomic DNA of only two out of five related species; (ii) these tandemly repeated elements display variability in structure even within one and the same array, where different repeats may share not more than 71% homology; (iii) their redundancy in the genome of V. faba is remarkably high and varies largely between land races (copy numbers per haploid, 1C, genome range from 21.51 x 10(6) to 5.39 x 10(6)); (iv) FokI repeats are clustered in differing amounts in each subtelocentric pair of the chromosome complement and are missing or present in a nondetectable amount in the submetacentric pair; (vi) chromosome regions that bear these repeats associate closely to varying degrees in interphase nuclei. These results are discussed in relation to possible functional roles that tandemly repeated DNA sequences such as the FokI elements might play.
