The gal locus from Haemophilus influenzae was cloned and sequenced. Four genes were identified by amino acid homology: galT, galK, galM and galR. The coding direction of galT, galK and galM is divergent from that of galR. There are non-coding intergenic regions between galR and galT, galT nd galK, and galK and galM. Deletion-insertion mutations constructed in galK and galE, which is in lic3, were moved into the H. influenzae chromosome generating each of the single mutants as well as the double gal mutant. Even when grown on complex media, the double mutant failed to react with an anti-lipopolysaccharide monoclonal antibody known to react with a digalactoside epitope. Both the galE single and the galE galK double mutants were serum-sensitive and relatively avirulent in infant rats, indicating a critical role for galactose metabolism, and providing evidence to support a central role for lipopolysaccharide, in H. influenzae virulence.
