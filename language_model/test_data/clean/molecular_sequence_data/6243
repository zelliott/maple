The PRINS method allows a rapid and specific detection of human chromosomes in situ. We have adapted the PRINS protocol to human sperm. Estimates of disomy have thus been performed for chromosomes 9, 12, 16 and 21 by using alpha-satellite DNA specific primers. The frequencies of disomy ranged from 0.27% to 0.31%. No significant difference was found. These data agree with the hypothesis of an equal distribution of non-disjunctions among chromosomes in male meiosis.
