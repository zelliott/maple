Wild tomato plants of Lycopersicon peruvianum var. dentatum were transformed with pG11 plasmid having human beta-interferon (hIFN-beta) and NPTII genes. Transformation was demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and ELISA assay. Expression of hIFN-beta gene was identified by Western blot analysis. Transgenic plants produced seeds and F1 generation inherited integrated traits.
