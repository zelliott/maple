The pcp gene, encoding a pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase (PYRase), was cloned from a lambda GT11 genomic library prepared from Staphylococcus aureus FDA 574 and sequenced. The pcp gene is located 740 bp downstream from cna, a gene that encodes a collagen-binding adhesin in S. aureus. S. aureus pcp encodes a 212-amino-acid (aa) polypeptide. The pcp gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and the PYRase purified to homogeneity. The recombinant enzyme exhibited biological activity, as determined using the chromogenic substrate L-pyroglutamyl-beta-napthylamide. Biochemical analysis of the PYRase using thiol-blocking chemicals suggested that the enzyme belongs to the cysteine peptidase family. Moreover, multiple sequence alignment revealed a high degree of similarity to previously described bacterial PYRases. This family of peptidases has been used to selectively remove the N-terminal pyrrolidone carboxylic acid residue found on certain blocked proteins and peptides prior to aa sequencing. However, the exact biological role of PYRases has yet to be elucidated.
