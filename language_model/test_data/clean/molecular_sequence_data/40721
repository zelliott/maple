A hypocrealean Coleoptera pathogen with characteristic part-spores, collected from Khao Yai National Park and Kaeng Krachan National Park in Thailand, is reported. The overall morphology was similar to Cordyceps barnesii, which is known from Sri Lanka, with ascospores disarticulating into four unusually long part-spores that were 30-40 Î¼m long. This disarticulation and part-spore size is, so far, unique within Cordyceps sensu lato. The Thai material was identified with C. barnesii and its placement in the genus Ophiocordyceps was confirmed. Multigene analyses based on the ribosomal small subunit, RPB1 and RPB2 genes revealed the close relationship of the Thai material to Ophiocordyceps konnoana as well as O. ravenelii, O. superficialis, and O. nigrella (all of which have significantly smaller part-spores). However, Ophiocordyceps barnesii and these related species were all characterised by dark-brown to purplish stromata and an affinity for melolonthid larval hosts. No anamorph was seen in the field and was not produced in the slow-growing cultures.
