The phylogenetic relationships of Frankia strains infective on Gymnostoma with other Frankia strains was analyzed. Partial sequencing of the 16S rDNA and use of specific primers showed that the Frankia strains present in Gymnostoma are phylogenetically close to Elaeagnus-infective strains. This finding was confirmed by using the sequences of the hypervariable nifDK intergenic spacer. The strains present in Gymnostoma nodules were close to one another. Clustered with Elaeagnus-infective strains, and distantly related to Casuarina and Alnus-infective strains. Morphological observations of strains and cross-inoculation trials showed that Gymnostoma-infective strains are indistinguishable from Elaeagnus-infective strains. Results of both phenotypic and genotypic approaches indicate that Gymnostoma-infective strains are Elaeagnus infective and not Casuarina infective.
