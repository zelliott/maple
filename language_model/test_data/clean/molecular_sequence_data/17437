Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels encoded by tax-4 and tax-2 genes are required for chemo- and thermo-sensation in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we report the identification and the characterization of cng-3, a new CNG channel gene, found in C. elegans. CNG-3 contains six putative transmembrane regions and a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain that show high homology with CNG channels of higher animals as well as TAX-4. The expression of cng-3 is detected from early stages in worm development and restricted in five sensory neurons of amphid including AFD neuron. While a cng-3 null mutant displays normal chemotaxis to volatile odorants, the mutant worms exhibit impaired thermal tolerance. These results indicate that CNG-3, a new member of CNG channel subunits, may play a critical role in sensation or response of thermal stress in C. elegans.
