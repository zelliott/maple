A cDNA encoding subunits 8 and 6 of mitochondrial ATPase of the cephalochordate lancelet (Branchiostoma lanceolatum), a direct ancestor of vertebrates, has been cloned and sequenced. A unique transcript encodes the 8 and 6 subunits. In the course of isolation of the 5' end of the ATPase 8 subunit gene, we also determined the sequence of the 5' adjacent tRNA-Lys gene. The anticodon used by mitochondrial tRNA-Lys is TTT.
