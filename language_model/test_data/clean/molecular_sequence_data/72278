Gorlin's syndrome or nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a familial or hereditary predisposition to basal cell carcinomas (generally multiple and of early onset), odontogenic keratocysts (jaw cysts), palmar and plantar pits, a wide variety of developmental defects, as well as cancers such as medulloblastomas and ovarian fibromas. The gene for NBCCS has been mapped to human chromosome region 9q22.1-q31 by linkage analysis and by cytogenetic evidence of deletions in this region in patients with the syndrome. This is supported by loss of heterozygosity in tumors of polymorphic marker loci flanked by D9S197 and D9S180. We have utilized sequence tagged site (STS) mapping and somatic cell hybrid panel analysis to construct two overlapping yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contigs spanning this region of the genome. We used the YAC contigs to identify a new zinc finger gene containing a highly informative microsatellite locus.
