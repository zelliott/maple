CD226 is one of the main activating receptors on natural killer cells, and it can induce cytotoxicity to target cells through interaction with its ligands CD155 or CD112. CD226 is also involved in T cell differentiation, activation, and cytotoxicity. The expression of CD226 on natural killer cells and T cells can be regulated by cytokines and chemical stimuli; however, the mechanism of the regulation of the CD226 gene is still unknown. In this study, we have identified two promoters in the human CD226 gene named P1 and P2, which are located at -810 to -287 bp and +33 to +213 bp, respectively, and a negative regulation element between P1 and P2. Both P1 and P2 can be regulated by phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) and calcium ionophore (A23187). Bioinformatics analysis shows that, within this CD226 gene region, there are putative binding sites for transcription factors AP-1, Sp1, PEA3, and Ets-1. We have found that transcription factor activating protein-1 (AP-1) can up-regulate CD226 promoters P1 and P2 in human hepatocarcinoma cells, a hepatocarcinoma cell line with low expression of endogenous AP-1 and Ets-1. Interestingly, the transcription factor Ets-1 promotes AP-1-induced P2 activity but inhibits AP-1-induced P1 activity for which a 10-bp AP-1/Ets-1 composite site (CCTTCCTTCC) in P1 may be responsible.
