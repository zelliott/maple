Recently, complex O-glycosylation of the cytoplasmic/nuclear protein Skp1 has been characterized in the eukaryotic microorganism Dictyostelium. Skp1's glycosylation is mediated by the sequential action of a prolyl hydroxylase and five conventional sugar nucleotide-dependent glycosyltransferase activities that reside in the cytoplasm rather than the secretory compartment. The Skp1-HyPro GlcNAcTransferase, which adds the first sugar, appears to be related to a lineage of enzymes that originated in the prokaryotic cytoplasm and initiates mucin-type O-linked glycosylation in the lumen of the eukaryotic Golgi apparatus. GlcNAc is extended by a bifunctional glycosyltransferase that mediates the ordered addition of beta1,3-linked Gal and alpha1,2-linked Fuc. The architecture of this enzyme resembles that of certain two-domain prokaryotic glycosyltransferases. The catalytic domains are related to those of a large family of prokaryotic and eukaryotic, cytoplasmic, membrane-bound, inverting glycosyltransferases that modify glycolipids and polysaccharides prior to their translocation across membranes toward the secretory pathway or the cell exterior. The existence of these enzymes in the eukaryotic cytoplasm away from membranes and their ability to modify protein acceptors expose a new set of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins to potential prolyl hydroxylation and complex O-linked glycosylation.
