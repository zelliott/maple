Previously we have identified and characterized three murine microbicidal proteins purified from the granule fraction of cells from the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7. During these studies evidence was obtained for the presence of an additional antimicrobial protein in the cytosolic fraction of RAW264.7 cells that had been activated with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). In this study we have purified this protein, designated ubiquicidin, to apparent homogeneity and demonstrated that it is a cationic, small (Mr 6654) protein. Ubiquicidin displayed marked antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium. Using a gel overlay procedure evidence was obtained that the protein also displays activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and an avirulent strain of Yersinia enterocolitica. Aminoterminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis of purified ubiquicidin indicated that it is most likely identical to the ribosomal protein S30. This protein is produced by posttranslational processing of the Fau protein, a 133-amino-acid fusion protein consisting of S30 linked to an unusual peptide with significant homology to ubiquitin. The fau gene has been reported to be expressed in a variety of tissues in humans and various animal species. The presence of ubiquicidin in the cytosol of macrophages may serve to restrict the intracellular growth of microorganisms. In addition, because macrophage disintegration will likely lead to release of ubiquicidin into the extracellular environment, it may contribute to host defense after macrophage death.
