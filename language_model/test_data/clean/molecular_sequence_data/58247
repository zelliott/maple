Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), a 30-kDa protein involved in the transport of cholesterol to inner mitochondrial membrane during stimulation of steroid hormone biosynthesis, has recently been cloned from human adrenals and MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells. We examined the regulation of StAR mRNA accumulation upon induction of steroidogenesis in immortalized rat granulosa cells. Granulosa cells were transfected with SV40 DNA alone (POGS5); with SV40 DNA and Ha-ras oncogene (POGRS1); with SV40 DNA, Ha-ras oncogene and LH/CG receptor (GLHR15) or with FSH receptor (GFSHR17) or with the beta 2-adrenergic receptor (G beta 2AR13) expression plasmids. Cells were cultured to confluency and then stimulated for 24 h with oFSH (4 nM), hCG (2.4 nM), isoproterenol (10 microM) or forskolin (50 microM). By quantitative RT-PCR, StAR mRNA was undetectable in non-steroidogenic cells (transfected with SV40 DNA alone, POGS5) either in the presence or in the absence of forskolin. In contrast, variable amount of the message was detected in all steroidogenic cell lines cotransfected with SV40 DNA and Ha-ras. Moreover, an increase in the StAR mRNA expression was evident in all steroidogenic cells upon stimulation with their respective agonists, concomitantly with enhanced progesterone production. The RT-PCR product was sequenced and the 379 base pairs of rat StAR were found to be 93% and 86% identical to mouse and human cDNA, respectively. The deduced 126 amino acid sequence was 95%, 88% and 88% identical to the mouse, human and bovine deduced protein sequences. We conclude that StAR message is expressed only in the steroidogenic rat granulosa cells and can be upregulated by FSH, hCG, isoproterenol and forskolin in the appropriate cell lines. In addition, we find that the rat StAR cDNA exhibit a high degree of homology with the mouse and human sequences.
