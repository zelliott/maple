The serum amyloid P component (SAP)-like pentraxin Limulus polyphemus SAP is a recently discovered, distinct pentraxin species, of known structure, which does not bind phosphocholine and whose N-terminal sequence has been shown to differ markedly from the highly conserved N terminus of all other known horseshoe crab pentraxins. The complete cDNA sequence of Limulus SAP, and the derived amino acid sequence, the first invertebrate SAP-like pentraxin sequence, have been determined. Two sequences were identified that differed only in the length of the 3' untranslated region. Limulus SAP is synthesised as a precursor protein of 234 amino acid residues, the first 17 residues encoding a signal peptide that is absent from the mature protein. Phylogenetic analysis clusters Limulus SAP pentraxin with the horseshoe crab C-reactive proteins (CRPs) rather than the mammalian SAPs, which are clustered with mammalian CRPs. The deduced amino acid sequence shares 22% identity with both human SAP and CRP, which are 51% identical, and 31-35% with horseshoe crab CRPs. These analyses indicate that gene duplication of CRP (or SAP), followed by sequence divergence and the evolution of CRP and/or SAP function, occurred independently along the chordate and arthropod evolutionary lines rather than in a common ancestor. They further indicate that the CRP/SAP gene duplication event in Limulus occurred before both the emergence of the Limulus CRP variants and the mammalian CRP/SAP gene duplication. Limulus SAP, which does not exhibit the CRP characteristic of calcium-dependent binding to phosphocholine, is established as a pentraxin species distinct from all other known horseshoe crab pentraxins that exist in many variant forms sharing a high level of sequence homology.
