The mouse cholecystokinin type-A receptor (CCK(A)R) gene was cloned and sequenced, and the exon/intron boundaries were determined by cDNA cloning. The gene, approximately 10 kb in length, contains the entire coding region, and consists of five exons. The deduced amino acid sequence was homologous with that of other species, with the exception of an additional DNA sequence encoding 7 amino acids in exon 5. A region of the 5' end of exon 2 appeared to be alternatively spliced, and generated an isoform shorter by 52 bases. The shorter isoform may encode an 48 amino acid open reading frame due to frameshift of translation. These two mRNA isoforms were expressed equally in the mouse gallbladders.
