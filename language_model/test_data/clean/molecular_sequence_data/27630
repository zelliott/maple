The complete amino acid sequence of human and chicken liver microsomal cytochrome b5 was determined. The amino termini of cytochrome b5 from four other mammalian species were examined in order to determine their complete covalent structure. As in the rat species, cytochrome b5 preparations from man, rabbit, calf and horse had an acetylated alanine as the first residue. In contrast, the pig cytochrome had alanine at the amino terminus. The amino terminus of the chicken cytochrome b5 was also unmodified, and extended three residues absent in the mammalian species. In order to investigate whether the carboxy-terminal segment of cytochrome b5 is located on the cytosolic or the luminal side of the microsomal membrane, rabbit liver microsomes were treated with trypsin and subjected to gel filtration and high-pressure liquid chromatography. The nonpolar peptide isolated from these microsomes lacked the terminal hexapeptide, indicating that when cytochrome b5 is bound to intact microsomes, the carboxy terminus is located on the cytosolic side of the membrane and does not extend in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.
