Two acid-labile substituted benzylamine type anchoring linkages, 4-benzoxy-2,6-dimethoxybenzylamine and 2-benzoxy-4,6-dimethoxybenzylamine, for solid phase synthesis of peptide amides were prepared. The Na-9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) amino acids could be easily attached to the resins with DCC/HOBt (loading 0.5-0.6 mmol/g resin). After final removal of the Na-protecting groups, treatment with TFA (50-95%) yielded amino acid and peptide amides in high purity. As we could show for the synthesis of thymulin (FTS, pGlu-Ala-Lys-Ser-Gln-Gly-Gly-Ser-Asn), these two resins with anchoring linkages are well suited for the synthesis of C-terminal Asn peptides using protected aspartic acid derivative as starting material.
