We present a map describing the binding of cellular proteins to a 300-base pair (bp) region of the human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) long terminal repeat. The map accounts for nearly all of the DNase I protection reported in a previous study using crude nuclear extracts. Notable features include a complex arrangement of overlapping binding sites encompassing the 21-bp repeat elements (see accompanying paper) as well as binding sites for the transcription factors Sp1 and NF-I that significantly deviate from the previously defined consensus recognition sequences. Based on the binding results, we constructed simple chimeric promoters containing 21-bp repeat elements, Sp1-, and nuclear factor I-binding sites upstream of a TATA box. Transient transfection experiments show that these promoters are expressed in T-cells and are regulated by the viral tax2 gene product. Deletion of the Sp1 and nuclear factor I sites abolishes tax-induction, suggesting that one or both of these proteins play a role in mediating the tax-responsiveness conferred by the 21-bp repeat element.
