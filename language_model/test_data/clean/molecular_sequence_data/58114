Intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) are a phenotypically distinct T cell population of unknown function. The majority of human intestinal IEL express the TCR-alpha beta, the CD8 accessory molecule, and the CD45RO Ag, suggesting that they are MHC class I-restricted memory T cells. Recent analyses of the TCR alpha- and beta-chains expressed by these cells have shown marked skewing toward one or several V region genes in individual donors and revealed the presence of clonally expanded cells. In addition, functional data has suggested that the MHC class I-like CD1 molecules may be the target ligands for some human intestinal IEL clones. This report examines in detail the TCR-beta repertoire of human jejunal IEL to determine what fraction of these cells are clonally expanded and to determine whether a particular subset of V beta genes are utilized by the clonally expanded cells. The results demonstrate that the majority of IEL are derived from the expansion of a relatively few T cell clones and that these clones can utilize a large number of different V beta genes. Oligoclonal expansion is also demonstrated among lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL), with overlapping but distinct clones detected in the LPL vs the IEL populations. These results indicate that most intestinal IEL-alpha beta, and a subpopulation of LPL, are specific for a limited number of Ag and place constraints on the possible roles played by IEL in the defense against diverse environmental pathogens or in the generation of oral tolerance.
