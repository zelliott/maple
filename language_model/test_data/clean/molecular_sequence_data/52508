Structural changes in N-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins during seed development of Ginkgo biloba have been explored to discover possible endogenous substrate(s) for the Ginko endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (endo-GB; Kimura, Y., et al. (1998) Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem., 62, 253-261), which should be involved in the production of high-mannose type free N-glycans. The structural analysis of the pyridylaminated oligosaccharides with a 2D sugar chain map, by ESI-MS/MS spectroscopy, showed that all N-glycans expressed on glycoproteins through the developmental stage of the Ginkgo seeds have the xylose-containing type (GlcNAc2 approximately 0Man3Xyl1Fuc1 approximately 0GlcNAc2) but no high-mannose type structure. Man3Xyl1Fuc1GlcNAc2, a typical plant complex type structure especially found in vacuolar glycoproteins, was a dominant structure through the seed development, while the amount of expression of GlcNAc2Man3Xyl1Fuc1GlcNAc2 and GlcNAc1Man3Xyl1Fuc1GlcNAc2 decreased as the seeds developed. The dominantly occurrence of xylose-containing type structures and the absence of the high-mannose type structures on Ginkgo glycoproteins were also shown by lectin-blotting and immunoblotting of SDS-soluble glycoproteins extracted from the developing seeds at various developmental stages. Concerning the endogenous substrates for plant endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, these results suggested that the endogenous substrates might be the dolicol-oligosaccharide intermediates or some glycopeptides with the high-mannose type N-glycan(s) derived from misfolded glycoproteins in the quality control system for newly synthesized glycoproteins.
