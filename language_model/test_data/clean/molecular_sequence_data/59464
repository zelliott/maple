We obtained two DNA clones, G93 (1.6kb) and G318 (1.7kb) from indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Culture 340. Southern hybridization analysis indicated that both DNA probes hybridized with DNA of indica cultivars but not with japonica cultivars. Some javanica cultivars DNAs did not hybridize with these probes. Nucleotide sequence (400bp) of a part of G93 showed a 65.8% G + C content. These novel DNA probes can be used for the study of evolutional fingerprinting of rice cultivars.
