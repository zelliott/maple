The nucleocapsid protein NCp7 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) contains two highly conserved CCHC zinc fingers and is involved in many crucial steps of the virus life-cycle. A large number of physiological r√¥les of NCp7 involve its binding to single-stranded nucleic acid chains. Several solution structures of NCp7 and its complex with single-stranded RNA or DNA have been reported. We have investigated the changes in the dynamic behaviour experienced by the (12-53)NCp7 peptide upon DNA binding using (15)N heteronuclear relaxation measurements at 293 K and 308 K, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The relaxation data were interpreted using the reduced spectral density approach, which allowed the high-frequency motion, overall tumbling rates and the conformational exchange contributions to be characterized for various states of the peptide without using a specific motional model. Analysis of the temperature-dependent correlation times derived from both NMR and fluorescence data indicated a co-operative change of the molecular shape of apo (12-53)NCp7 around 303 K, leading to an increased hydrodynamic radius at higher temperatures. The binding of (12-53)NCp7 to a single-stranded d(ACGCC) pentanucleotide DNA led to a reduction of the conformational flexibility that characterized the apo peptide. Translational diffusion experiments as well as rotational correlation times indicated that the (12-53)NCp7/d(ACGCC) complex tumbles as a rigid object. The amplitudes of high-frequency motions were restrained in the complex and the occurrence of conformational exchange was displaced from the second zinc finger to the linker residue Ala30.
