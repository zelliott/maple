Mutants of adenovirus type 12 adapted to growth in Vero cells were studied by restriction enzyme and sequence analysis. Plaque-purified mutants were isolated either after long-term passage of the virus in Vero cells (CS-1, CL-1) or from Vero cells transfected with viral DNA (11-g, 12-k). The plaque-forming activity of these mutants was equal or even slightly higher in Vero cells than in HeLa cells, whereas the activity of wild-type virus in HeLa cells exceeded that in Vero cells by about one to two orders of magnitude. All mutants tested had an insertion of variable length consisting of adenoviral sequences at the right end of the viral genome. Sizes of the insertions were determined to be 294 bp (CS-1, 12-k), 560 (11-g), or 180 bp (CL-1). Additional insertions of multiple size and less than equimolar amount were detected and seem to exist in some of the viral particles. Furthermore, all four mutants tested showed an identical 69-bp deletion in the first exon of the E1a gene.
