Ani s 1, the major allergen of Anisakis simplex, is expected to be a useful antigen in allergen-specific immunotherapy of Anisakis allergy. To avoid side-effects such as anaphylactic shock in immunotherapy, it is desirable to use not native allergens but hypoallergenic mutants devoid of IgE-binding epitopes. This study was hence aimed to elucidate IgE-binding epitopes of Ani s 1 toward the development of hypoallergenic Ani s 1 mutants. Mapping experiments using 32 peptides (P1-32) revealed that major IgE-binding epitopes are included in P24 (region 116-130) and P28 (region 136-150). Furthermore, Ala-scanning and truncation experiments established that eight (underlined in the sequence 116-ELFAREYEGVCKSGK-130) and nine amino acid residues (underlined in the sequence 136-RGSGWMMTILGKSCD-150) are crucial for the IgE-binding of P24 and P28, respectively. The determined crucial residues of P24 and P28 were assumed to be involved in electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with IgE, respectively.
