Lrp, a major regulatory protein in Escherichia coli, controls the expression of numerous operons, including ilvIH. Lrp binds to six sites upstream of ilvIH, and Lrp binding is required for ilvIH expression. We show here that an Lrp-like protein is also present in Salmonella typhimurium. This protein can bind both E. coli and S. typhimurium ilvIH DNA, as can E. coli Lrp. Methidiumpropyl-EDTA footprinting studies were performed with purified E. coli Lrp and S. typhimurium ilvIH DNA. Six binding sites were defined, three of them being similar to corresponding sites in E. coli, and three being organized differently. A consensus derived from six S. typhimurium sites is compatible with that derived from a similar analysis of E. coli sequences.
