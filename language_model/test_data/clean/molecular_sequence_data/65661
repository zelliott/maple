Anopheles funestus Giles is one of the major African malaria vectors. It has previously been implicated in a major outbreak of malaria in KwaZulu/Natal, South Africa, during the period 1996 to 2000. The re-emergence of this vector was associated with monooxygenase-based resistance to pyrethroid insecticides. We have identified a gene from the monooxygenase CYP6 family, CYP6P9, which is over expressed in a pyrethroid resistant strain originating from Mozambique. Quantitative Real-Time PCR shows that this gene is highly over expressed in the egg and adult stages of the resistant strain relative to the susceptible strain but the larval stages showed almost no difference in expression between strains. This gene is genetically linked to a major locus associated with pyrethroid resistance in this A. funestus population.
