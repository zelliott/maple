The ARLs are a diverse family of GTPases that are related to ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), but whose function is poorly understood. There are at least ten ARLs in humans, two of which have homologs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ARL1/Arl1p and ARFRP1/Arl3p). The function of ARFRP1 is unknown, but mammalian ARL1 has recently been found to interact with a number of effectors including the GRIP domain that is present in a family of Golgi-localized long coiled-coil proteins. We find that in yeast, the intracellular targeting of Imh1p, the only yeast GRIP domain protein, is dependent on both Arl1p and Arl3p, but not on the ARF proteins. A recombinant form of the Imh1p GRIP domain binds to Arl1p in a GTP-dependent manner, but not to Arl3p. Yeast also contain a relative of SCOCO, a protein proposed to bind human ARL1, but this yeast protein, Slo1p, appears to bind Arl3p rather than Arl1p in vitro. However, Imh1p is not the sole effector of Arl1p since affinity chromatography of cytosol with immobilized Arl1p:GTP revealed an interaction with the GARP/VFT complex that is thought to act in the tethering of vesicles to the Golgi apparatus. Finally, we find that Arl3p is required in vivo for the targeting of Arl1p, explaining its requirement for the normal distribution of Imh1p.
