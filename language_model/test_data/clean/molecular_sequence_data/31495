A novel anaerobic, chemo-organotrophic, sulfate-reducing bacterium, designated strain Olac 40(T), was isolated from a Tunisian wastewater digestor. Cells were curved, motile rods or vibrios (5.0-7.0×0.5 µm). Strain Olac 40(T) grew at temperatures between 15 and 50 °C (optimum 40 °C), and between pH 5.0 and 9.0 (optimum pH 7.1). It did not require NaCl for growth but tolerated it up to 50 g l(-1) (optimum 2 g l(-1)). In the presence of sulfate or thiosulfate, strain Olac 40(T) used lactate, pyruvate and formate as energy sources. Growth was observed on H2 only in the presence of acetate as carbon source. In the presence of sulfate or thiosulfate, the end products of lactate oxidation were acetate, sulfide and CO2. Sulfate, thiosulfate and sulfite were used as terminal electron acceptors, but not elemental sulfur, nitrate or nitrite. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain Olac 40(T) was 70 mol%. The profile of polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, aminophospholipid and four phospholipids. The main fatty acids were C16 : 0, anteiso-C15 : 0 and iso-C15 : 0. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that strain Olac 40(T) was affiliated with the family Desulfovibrionaceae within the class Deltaproteobacteria. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons and physiological characteristics, strain Olac 40(T) is proposed to be assigned to a novel species of the genus Desulfocurvus, for which the name Desulfocurvus thunnarius is proposed. The type strain is Olac 40(T) ( = DSM 26129(T) = JCM 18546(T)).
