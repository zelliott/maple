In somatic cells the expression of replication-dependent histone genes is coupled to the S phase of the cell cycle. However, we have found a number of novel H2a, H2b, and H3 poly(A)+ RNA species in avian haploid round spermatids. The spermatid-specific H2a and H2b 0.8-kilobase RNAs are transcribed from a subset of the replication-dependent H2a and H2b gene families. Two cDNAs derived from the spermatid-specific H2b transcripts were isolated and sequenced. The structures of these cDNAs reveal that the spermatid-specific RNAs are identical to the 0.5-kilobase poly(A)- H2b mRNAs expressed in proliferating somatic cells, except for the addition of poly(A) at the 3' ends. The site of poly(A) addition in the spermatid-specific RNAs is located 26 to 28 nucleotides 3' of the poly(A)- H2b mRNA terminus. Thus, the hairpin structures and purine-rich elements required for the U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-mediated cleavage reaction that generates the 3' ends of poly(A)- H2b mRNAs are not utilized in spermatids and are retained in the poly(A)+ H2b RNAs.
