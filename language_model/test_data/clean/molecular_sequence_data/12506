Polymorphic (CTC)n and (TAAA)n sequences were identified in exons 1 and 8 of the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) gene. The different alleles were detected by a method combining fluorescence labeling of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products and use of an automated DNA sequencer. Although only two alleles differing by the number of leucine residues encoded by the (CTC)n array were detected at the first locus, seven alleles were identified at the second. The high degree of polymorphism (75%) of the tetranucleotide repeat makes this marker informative for association or linkage studies with diseases such as hemochromatosis or multiple sclerosis.
