We have identified and cloned a novel zinc finger gene, Fez (forebrain embryonic zinc-finger), as a potential downstream determinant of anterior neural plate formation in Xenopus. Fez was isolated as one of several neural-specific genes that was induced by the neuralizing factor, noggin (Smith and Harland, 1992. Cell 70, 829-840), in uncommitted ectoderm. Fez has an open reading frame comprising 466 amino acids, and contains six C(2)H(2) type zinc finger domains, which are highly conserved among Drosophila, zebrafish, mouse, and human. In Xenopus, the expression of Fez begins at stage 12 in the rostral end of the neural plate, and by stage 45, it is localized to several telencephalic regions, including the olfactory bulbs, nervus terminalis, and ventricular zone. The mouse homologue of Fez is similarly expressed in the mouse forebrain by embryonic day 11.
