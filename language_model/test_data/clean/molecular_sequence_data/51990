A previous in situ hybridization study with a Pi class glutathione S-transferase cDNA probe revealed the presence of hybridizing sequences on the long arms of chromosomes 11 and 12. Since the GSTP1 gene is known to be on chromosome 11 and since it is thought that chromosomes 11 and 12 arose from an ancient tetraploidization event, it was of interest to determine if the gene on chromosome 12 encoded a closely related Pi class glutathione S-transferase isoenzyme. This gene has now been cloned and sequenced. The results are surprising and indicate that the gene is a partial reverse-transcribed pseudogene that has been inserted into the genome at 12q by chance and has not resulted from the prior tetraploidization of the human genome.
