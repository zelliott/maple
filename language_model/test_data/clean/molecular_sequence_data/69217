A cry-related sequence, designated cryX (EMBL X75019), was localized upstream of cryIG, the delta-endotoxin gene cloned from spp. galleriae of Bacillus thuringiensis and sequenced earlier [(1991) FEBS Lett. 293, 25-28]. Analysis of the cryX complete nucleotide sequence enabled us to explain its virtual crypticity and to reveal the chimeric structure of the genes, cryX and cryIG. The amino acid sequence of 1,151 residues encoded by the continuous reading frame of cryX is similar to the other delta-endotoxins but differs essentially from them.
