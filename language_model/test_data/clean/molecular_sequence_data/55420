Nicotine is a key harmful component of tobacco and cigarettes, and the development of low-nicotine cigarettes is of increasing importance in the market. The objectives of this study are to isolate native nicotine-degrading strains and evaluate their feasibility for nicotine reduction during the aging (or fermentation) of tobacco leaves. A novel nicotine-degrading strain was isolated and identified as Pseudomonas stutzeri ZCJ based on its 16S rDNA sequence and morphological-biochemical characteristics. In submerged cultures, P. stutzeri ZCJ could tolerate 4.5 g/L nicotine and completely degrade 1.5 g/L nicotine within 24 h at 37Â°C and pH 7.4. The addition of glucose (1 g/L) could improve nicotine degradation by P. stutzeri ZCJ in submerged cultures. After submerged culturing, the cell suspension of P. stutzeri ZCJ could be utilized to improve nicotine reduction in tobacco leaves during solid-state fermentation. The nicotine content of tobacco leaves decreased by as much as 32.24% after 7 days of solid-state fermentation by P. stutzeri ZCJ, suggesting the industrial application potential of the native strain to enhance nicotine degradation during the aging of tobacco leaves.
