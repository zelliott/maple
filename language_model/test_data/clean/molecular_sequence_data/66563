Genes homologous to hydrogenase accessory genes are scattered over the whole genome in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Deletion and insertion mutants of hypA1 (slr1675), hypB1 (sll1432), hypC, hypD, hypE and hypF were constructed and showed no hydrogenase activity. Involvement of the respective genes in maturation of the enzyme was confirmed by complementation. Deletion of the additional homologues hypA2 (sll1078) and hypB2 (sll1079) had no effect on hydrogenase activity. Thus, hypA1 and hypB1 are specific for hydrogenase maturation. We suggest that hypA2 and hypB2 are involved in a different metal insertion process. The hydrogenase activity of DeltahypA1 and DeltahypB1 could be increased by the addition of nickel, suggesting that HypA1 and HypB1 are involved in the insertion of nickel into the active site of the enzyme. The urease activity of all the hypA and hypB single- and double-mutants was the same as in wild-type cells. Therefore, there seems to be no common function for these two hyp genes in hydrogenase and urease maturation in Synechocystis. Similarity searches in the whole genome yielded Slr1876 as the best candidate for the hydrogenase-specific protease. The respective deletion mutant had no hydrogenase activity. Deletion of hupE had no effect on hydrogenase activity but resulted in a mutant unable to grow in a medium containing the metal chelator nitrilotriacetate. Growth was resumed upon the addition of cobalt or methionine. Because the latter is synthesized by a cobalt-requiring enzyme in Synechocystis, HupE is a good candidate for a cobalt transporter in cyanobacteria.
