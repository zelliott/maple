From a human fetal-brain cDNA library, we isolated and characterized a novel gene (KPNA3) encoding a protein highly homologous to certain nuclear transport proteins of Xenopus and human. The complete cDNA clone, designated karyopherin alpha 3, contained an open reading frame of 1,563 nucleotides encoding 521 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence showed 48%, 45% and 48% identity with Xenopus importin, yeast SRP1 and human RCH1, respectively. The similarities among these proteins suggest that karyopherin alpha 3 may be involved in the nuclear transport system. Eight repeats of the arm motif were well conserved among these proteins. The N-terminal region of the predicted karyopherin alpha 3 product was highly basic and the C-terminal region was strongly acidic. A 4.3-kb transcript was expressed in all adult human tissues examined by Northern blotting. The cDNA clone was assigned to chromosome band 13q14.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
