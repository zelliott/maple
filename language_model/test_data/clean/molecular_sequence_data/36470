Yersinia pseudotuberculosis which were screened out depending on auto-agglutination and Ca2+ dependency, were examined for their production of hemagglutinin (HA), and its purification and characterization were performed. The HA with a broad reactivity with various mammalian erythrocytes was recovered from the culture supernatant of these strains grown at 37 C but not 25 C. HAs from two strains, R148R and T1040, were purified by salt precipitation, gel filtration and anion-exchange chromatography by HPLC. Both purified HAs were cysteine-deficient acidic protein with an apparent molecular weight in the range of 15,000 to 16,000. N-terminal amino acid sequences of the first 25 residues were found to share 12% identity with that of afimbrial adhesin from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 2230. Immunoelectron microscopy and immunodiffusion test with polyclonal antiserum raised against the purified R148RHA demonstrated that the HA was associated with the amorphous aggregates which were detached from bacteria. These results suggest that the HA of Y. pseudotuberculosis belongs to a third type of HA produced by the yersinial species.
