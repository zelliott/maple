The mitochondrial adaptor, IFN-Î² promoter stimulator-1 (IPS-1), also known as MAVS/VISA/Cardif, plays a key role in the signal transduction of the RIG-1/MDA5 pathway to induce the production of interferons (IFNs) and other cytokines. In the present study, Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) IPS-1 cDNA was cloned from Japanese flounder spleen using PCR-based methods. The full-length cDNA has 2235 nucleotides and encodes a polypeptide of 641 amino acids. The putative Japanese flounder IPS-1 protein contains an N-terminal CARD-like domain, a central proline-rich domain, a C-terminal transmembrane domain, and exhibits similarity to other teleost counterparts ranging from 20% to 34%. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that Japanese flounder IPS-1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues examined. The expression level of flounder IPS-1 gene was unchanged in viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV)-infected kidney as measured by quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR). In addition, Japanese flounder IPS-1-overexpressing cells were protected against hirame rhabdovirus (HIRRV) and VHSV infection as manifested by the delayed appearance of cytopathic effect (CPE) and decreased viral titers. Expression of IFN-inducible genes including Mx, ISG15 and IRF3 were also induced in the IPS-1-overexpressing cells. These results suggest that Japanese flounder IPS-1 is involved in the antiviral immunity as a one of the adaptors in fish IFN-activation pathway.
