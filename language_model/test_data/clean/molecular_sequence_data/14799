Three Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains recovered from ND outbreaks in chickens and duck flocks in north china during 2009 to 2011 were completely sequenced and biologically characterized. All the strains were velogenic and had the velogenic motif 112R-R-Q-K-R-F117 which was consistent with the results of biological tests. Analysis of the variable region (nucleotide 47 to 420) of the F gene indicated that the three isolates belonged to genotype VII d. Cross hemagglutination inhibition test indicated that the antigen homology between three isolates and LaSota were 82.5%-89.4%, the homology between the two isolates from chicken was 90%. A cross-protection experiment in which specific-pathogen-free chickens vaccinated with LaSota were challenged by SDLY01 isolate showed that LaSota vaccine could provide complete protection against SDLY01, however virus discharge could be detected on fifth day. Challenge experiment in which Cherry Valley duck of 30 day old challenged with SD03 strain indicated that cherry valley duck had no disease in experiment period, but virus discharge could be detected from Larynx and cloaca until fifth day. Genome length of three NDV isolates was 15192bp and belonged to genotype VII d. Sequence analysis clarified that the whole genomic sequence of these three isolates shared high homology with NDV virus strains isolated from goose and duck over the same period, which elucidated that NDV isolated from goose, duck or chicken had close genetics and epidemiological relationship.
