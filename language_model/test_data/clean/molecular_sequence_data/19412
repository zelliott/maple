Photoactivable caged analogs of endothelin-1 (ET-1) were obtained after derivatization with the photolabile 4,5-dimethoxynitrobenzyl (DMNB) group. This was achieved by the incorporation of N-alpha-Fmoc caged building blocks of Lys, Asp, Glu and Tyr during the solid phase peptide synthesis step. The C-terminal carboxylic function was also derivatized. However, difficulties were encountered with the introduction of the Asp and Glu photoactivable building blocks. As a matter of fact, formation of an aminosuccinyl derivative, through cyclization of the Asp(ODMNB) residue, and the formation of a pyrrolidone ring from the Glu(ODMNB) residue were highly favored by the electronic properties of the photocleavable function. ET-1 analogs were also tested in the ET(A) and ET(B) paradigms and specific pharmacological profiles were obtained for each peptide.
