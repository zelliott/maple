Differential display was used to identify synapse-enriched mRNAs. Of 15 mRNAs initially identified, all were found in multiple synaptoneurosome preparations; 58% were subsequently shown to be enriched in all the preparations by Northern blotting and semiquantitative RT-PCR. RNAs involved in signal transduction, vesicle trafficking, lipid modification and cell shape and remodeling were among these messages. Tip60a mRNA, recently found to associate with the fragile X mental retardation protein, was also identified. These data demonstrate the diversity of the local message pool at synapses.
