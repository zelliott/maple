A chromosomal fragment of bacteria Photorhabdus luminescence Zm1, which contains the lux operon, was cloned into the vector pUC18. The hybrid clone containing plasmid pXen7 with the EcoRI fragment approximately 7-kb was shown to manifest a high level of bioluminescence. By subcloning and restriction analysis of the EcoRI fragment, the location of luxCDABE genes relative to restriction sites was determined. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA fragment containing the luxA and luxB genes encoding alpha- and beta-subunits of luciferase was determined. A comparison with the nucleotide sequences of luxAB genes in Hm and Hw strains of Ph. luminescence revealed 94.5 and 89.7% homology, respectively. The enterobacterial repetitive intergenic sequence (ERIC) of 126 bp typical for Hw strains was identified in the spacer between the luxD and luxA genes. The lux operon of Zm1 is assumed to emerge through recombination between Hm and Hw strains. Luciferase of Ph. luminescence was shown to possess a high thermal stability: its activity decreased by a factor of 10 at 44 degrees C for 30 min, whereas luciferases of marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri and Vibrio harveyi were inactivated by one order of magnitude at 44 degrees C for 1 and 6 min, respectively. The lux genes of Ph. luminescence are suggested for use in gene engineering and biotechnology.
