To improve the thrombolytic specificity of plasminogen activators, an antibody-targeted plasminogen activator was constructed consisting of a single-chain variable fragment of a monoclonal antibody SZ-51 raised specifically against human P-selectins on activated platelets and a low molecular weight single-chain urokinase. After fusion to the 3' end of the gene coding for decorsin, originally isolated from the leech Macrobdella decora, expression of the antibody-targeted plasminogen activator gene in E. coli strain Rosetta (DE3) pLysS was greatly enhanced.
