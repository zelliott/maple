A bacterial isolate, designated strain TS3(T), was isolated from soil collected from a metal mine in Tieshan District, Daye City, Hubei Province, in central China. Cells of this strain were Gram-negative, motile and rod-shaped. The strain had ubiquinone Q-8 as the predominant respiratory quinone, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol as the major polar lipids and summed feature 3 (C(16:1)ω7c and/or iso-C(15:0) 2-OH), C(16:0) and C(18:1)ω7c as the major fatty acids. The G+C content was 65.9 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain TS3(T) was most closely related to Massilia niastensis 5516S-1(T) (98.5%), Massilia consociata CCUG 58010(T) (97.6%), Massilia aerilata 5516S-11(T) (97.4%) and Massilia varians CCUG 35299(T) (97.2%). DNA-DNA hybridization revealed low relatedness between strain TS3(T) and M. niastensis KACC 12599(T) (36.5%), M. consociata CCUG 58010(T) (27.1%), M. aerilata KACC 12505(T) (22.7%) and M. varians CCUG 35299(T) (46.5%). On the basis of phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, strain TS3(T) belongs to the genus Massilia, but is clearly differentiated from other members of the genus. The strain represents a novel species, for which the name Massilia tieshanensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is TS3(T) ( = CCTCC AB 2010202(T)  = KACC 14940(T)).
