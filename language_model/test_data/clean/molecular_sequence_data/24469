Retrotransposons and other mobile elements are major components of the repeated DNA fraction in higher-plant genomes. They have undoubtedly played an important role in higher plant genome evolution. The present work details the detection and characterisation of a WIS 2-1A related sequence in direct wheat relatives, and discusses the prevalence and evolution of its copy number in their genomes. An increase in copy number is detected when following the natural hybridisation processes that gave rise to bread and durum wheats. However, the opposite is observed in the development of triticale, a synthetic hybrid.
