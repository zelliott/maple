The hrdB homologue was isolated from a streptomycin-producing Streptomyces griseus 2247 strain, which is independent of A-factor. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA fragment revealed the presence of an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,542bp, which predicted a primary product of 514 amino acids and Mr 56,100. The N-terminal sequence of the purified HrdB protein of S. griseus was identical to the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence contains an "rpoD box" conserved in the principal sigma factors of eubacteria, and shows high similarity to the hrdB products of S. coelicolor A3(2)(89.9%) and S. aureofaciens (88.1%). The cloned gene encodes a principal sigma factor of S. griseus. The promoter region was identified by using a promoter-probe vector and by means of primer extensions experiments. The transcription start point is located 158-bp upstream of the initiation codon.
