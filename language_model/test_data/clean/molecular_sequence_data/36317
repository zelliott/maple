Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) is necessary for the activity of several nucleosides used for the chemotherapy of cancer and AIDS. However, the measurement of dCK catalytic activity in crude cell extracts may be imprecise, due to the presence of phosphatases and nucleotidases that degrade the enzyme products. We describe a simple immunoassay for dCK that can measure accurately as little as 5 ng enzyme protein in crude tissue extracts. The assay enabled us to show (i) that mutant cells deficient in dCK activity lack immunoreactive dCK protein, (ii) that dCK catalytic activity and immunoreactivity correlate closely in human tumors, and (iii) that immunoreactive dCK is particularly high in lymphocytes and lymphoid malignancies, although certain solid tumors may also contain the enzyme. The immunoassay of dCK could prove useful in the selection and monitoring of patients who are being treated with nucleosides that are activated by this enzyme.
