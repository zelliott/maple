Eight strains of P1/Sabin-derived polioviruses isolated in Brazil from paralysis cases were analyzed. The serotypes of the viral isolates were identified by neutralization test with hyperimmune equine sera. The relationship of the isolates to the P1/Sabin strain was demonstrated by molecular hybridization and PCR. The isolates were partially sequenced with the objective of finding mutations at nucleotides (nt) 480 and 525 of the 5'-noncoding region (5' NCR) and at nt 6203 of the 3Dpol coding region (3Dpol), which are important for reversion towards neurovirulence. Four isolates from paralysis cases classified as Guillain BarrÃ© Syndrome (GBS; three with sequels) were analyzed; one presented G-->A (480) and C-->U (6203) mutations, one G-->A (480) mutation, one G-->A (480) and U-->C (525) mutations, and one did not mutate at the analyzed positions. Two isolates from transient facial paralysis cases were analyzed; one presented U-->C (525) mutation and the other G-->A (480) mutation. One isolate from a transient paralysis case classified as a neuroviral disease and one isolate from a paralysis case with sequels were analyzed and none mutated at the analyzed positions. Although the isolates may not be the causative agent of the disease, a temporal association between the isolation of the P1/Sabin-derived isolates and the disease was observed. The possibility that GBS and the facial paralysis were caused by these isolates could not be excluded.
