L-2-Halo acid dehalogenase catalyzes the stereospecific hydrolytic dehalogenation of L-2-halo acids, with inversion of the C2-configuration. Seven L-2-halo acid dehalogenases from various bacterial strains are significantly similar to one another in their amino acid sequences (36-70% identity), and they are supposed to catalyze the reaction through the same mechanism. To identify catalytically important residues, we mutated all the 36 highly conserved charged and polar amino acid residues of L-2-halo acid dehalogenase from Pseudomonas sp. YL, which consists of 232 amino acid residues, by replacement of D by N, E by Q, R by K, and vice versa, S and T by A, Y and W by F, M by L, and H by N. We found that the replacement of D10, K151, S175, D180, R41, S118, T14, Y157, and N177 led to a significant loss in the enzyme activity or an increase in the Km value for the substrate, showing their involvement in the catalysis. The roles of these residues are discussed.
