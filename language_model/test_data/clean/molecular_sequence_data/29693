The incidence of fungal infections has increased dramatically, which has necessitated additional and prolonged use of the available antifungal agents. Increased resistance to the commonly used antifungal agents, primarily the azoles, has been reported, thus necessitating the discovery and development of compounds that would be effective against the major human fungal pathogens. The sterol biosynthetic pathway has proved to be a fertile area for antifungal development, and steps which might provide good targets for novel antifungal development remain. The sterol C-14 reductase, encoded by the ERG24 gene, could be an effective target for drug development since the morpholine antifungals, inhibitors of Erg24p, have been successful in agricultural applications. The ERG24 gene of Candida albicans has been isolated by complementation of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae erg24 mutant. Both copies of the C. albicans ERG24 gene have been disrupted by using short homologous regions of the ERG24 gene flanking a selectable marker. Unlike S. cerevisiae, the C. albicans ERG24 gene was not required for growth, but erg24 mutants showed several altered phenotypes. They were demonstrated to be slowly growing, with doubling times at least twice that of the wild type. They were also shown to be significantly more sensitive to an allylamine antifungal and to selected cellular inhibitors including cycloheximide, cerulenin, fluphenazine, and brefeldin A. The erg24 mutants were also slightly resistant to the azoles. Most importantly, erg24 mutants were shown to be significantly less pathogenic in a mouse model system and failed to produce germ tubes upon incubation in human serum. On the basis of these characteristics, inhibitors of Erg24p would be effective against C. albicans.
