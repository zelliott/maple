Guanylate kinase-associated protein (GKAP)/SAP90/PSD-95-associated protein (SAPAP)/DLG-associated protein (DAP) is a protein of the postsynaptic density (PSD), and binds to the guanylate kinase domain of PSD-95/synapse-associated protein (SAP) 90 and synaptic scaffolding molecule. GKAP/SAPAP/DAP recruits PSD-95/SAP90 and its interacting protein, brain-enriched guanylate kinase-interacting protein, into the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction in transfected cells, suggesting that GKAP/SAPAP/DAP may link several PSD components to the Triton X-100-insoluble structures in the PSD. We have identified here a novel neuronal GKAP/SAPAP/DAP-binding protein and named it synamon. Synamon has seven ankyrin repeats at the NH(2) terminus followed by one src homology 3 domain and one PSD-95/Dlg-A/ZO-1 domain, and several proline-rich regions at the carboxyl terminus. Synamon interacts with the COOH-terminal region of GKAP/SAPAP/DAP via the middle region containing a PSD-95/Dlg-A/ZO-1 domain. Synamon was coimmunoprecipitated with SAPAP from rat crude synaptosomes and colocalized with SAPAP in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Because synamon is composed of various protein-interacting modules, it may also interact with proteins other than GKAP/SAPAP/DAP to organize the architecture of the PSD.
