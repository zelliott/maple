Mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal DNAs were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed for Trametes and related genera of Ryvarden's Trametes group. Parsimony and distance analyses indicated that most of trimitic genera with white rotting habit of the Trametes group clustered within a single clade, suggesting that they may have originated from a common ancestor. The phylogenetic position and generic placement of Trametes consors was uncertain as yet. Trametes trogii grouped with Coriolopsis gallica and indicated that color of the basidiocarp is a poor character at generic level. Nucleotide differences between Daedaleopsis confragosa and D. tricolor were quite few and both species closely grouped together in a same clade, thus supporting that D. tricolor might be an ecotype of D. confragosa.
