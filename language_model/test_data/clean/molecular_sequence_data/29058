Structural and functional characteristics were compared for wild-type nuclease from Serratia marcescens, which belongs to the family of DNA/RNA nonspecific endonucleases, its mutational forms, and the nuclease I-PpoI from Physarum polycephalum, which is a representative of the Cys-His box-containing subgroup of the superfamily of extremely specific intron-encoded homing DNases. Despite the lack of sequence homology and the overall different topology of the Serratia marcescens and I-PpoI nucleases, their active sites have a remarkable structural similarity. Both of them have a unique magnesium atom in the active site, which is a part of the coordinatively bonded water-magnesium complex involved in their catalytic acts. In the enzyme-substrate complexes, the Mg2+ ion is chelated by an Asp residue, coordinates two oxygen atoms of DNA, and stabilizes the transition state of the phosphate anion and 3'-OH group of the leaving nucleotide. A new mechanism of the phosphodiester bond cleavage, which is common for the Serratia marcescens and I-PpoI nucleases and differs from the known functioning mechanism of the restriction and homing endonucleases, was proposed. It presumes a His residue as a general base for the activation of a non-cluster water molecule at the nucleophilic in line displacement of the 3'-leaving group. A strained metalloenzyme-substrate complex is formed during hydrolysis and relaxes to the initial state after the reaction. The English version of the paper.
