Mutations of the ZIC2 transcription factor gene are among the most common heterozygous variations detected in holoprosencephaly (HPE) patients, a patient group who lack critical midline forebrain specification due to defective embryonic signaling during development. Recent studies indicate that complete deficiency of the related murine Zic2 transcription factor can also be a contributing factor to variable midline deficiencies, presenting during mid-gastrulation, that could explain similar forebrain anomalies in this model system. Here we collect and summarize all available mutations in the human ZIC2 gene detected in HPE patients (21 published and 62 novel). Our analysis corroborates this mechanism proposed in mice by predicting loss-of-function as the likely pathogenetic mechanism common to most, if not all, of these mutations in HPE.
