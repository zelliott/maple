Cyclins are known to activate cyclin-dependent protein kinases, which are essential for cell cycle progression in eukaryotes. We isolated full-length cDNAs encoding rice mitotic cyclins named CycA1; os; 1 and CycB2;os;1, which are related to A- and B-type cyclins, respectively, from animals. To characterize the function of these mitotic cyclins, as well as that of another B-type cyclin, CycB2;os;2, each cDNA was introduced into yeast cells. When cDNAs encoding CycA1;os;1, CycB2;os; or CycB2;os;2 were overexpressed in the yeast mutant DLI, which is deficient in G1 cyclins, the mutant phenotype was rescued, indicating that these mitotic cyclins are functional in yeast cells. When the cDNA encoding CycB2;os;1 was expressed in the wild-type yeast strain, the cells lost the ability to grow, whereas the expression of either cycA1;os: 1 or cycB2;os;2 did not inhibit growth. In situ hybridization of these mitotic cyclin genes with rice root apices and counterstaining of chromosomes with a DNA-specific dye revealed that cycA1;os;1 is expressed from the G2 phase to the early M phase, while transcripts of cycB2:os;1 and cycB2;os;2 accumulated until the end of mitosis. Our results indicate that these B2-type cyclins may be involved in the control of mitosis, in combination with a G2/M-phase CDK.
