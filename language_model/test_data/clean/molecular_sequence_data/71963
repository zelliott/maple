Utilizing genetic modules of simple retroviruses, we have developed a novel generation of gene transfer vectors with improved therapeutic potential. In the 5' untranslated "leader" sequences, all AUG codons which may aberrantly initiate translation and all viral coding sequences were removed. Thus, the probability of expressing unwanted peptides and the potential for homologous recombination with retroviral genes were largely reduced, and the cloning capacity was increased. The transgene was inserted to replace the viral gag sequences, and a new minimal splice acceptor was introduced, resulting in increased expression with all genes tested (those coding for human multidrug resistance 1 and enhanced green fluorescent protein, as well as the lacZ gene). These vectors may represent attractive tools for human gene therapy, because they increase the efficiency of transgene expression and may also increase safety in medical applications.
