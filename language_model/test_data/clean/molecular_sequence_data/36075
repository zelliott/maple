We have isolated and characterized a gene encoding a novel GTP-binding protein of the GTPase superfamily in the filarial parasites Brugia malayi and Onchocerca volvulus. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned molecule has approximately 30% overall homology to ras proteins and approximately 90% homology to the 'ras-like' nuclear proteins TC4, ran and Spil. Rabbit antisera to bacterially expressed filarial protein detect a 24-22 kDa doublet in extracts of adult B. malayi and mature microfilariae, which is absent from immature microfilariae. Increased expression of the native parasite protein occurs when worms are cultured in the presence of epidermal growth factor.
