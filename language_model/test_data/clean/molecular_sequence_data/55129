The metal ion binding sites of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) have been investigated to explain the biological activity difference in the fibril formation process. The structures of [hIAPP...Cu (or Al)](n+) and [hIAPP17-30...Cu]2+ complex were investigated by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The fragmentation patterns of [hIAPP...Cu [or Al)](n+) and [hIAPP17-30...Cu]2+ complex were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and multi-stage mass spectrometry (MS3) spectra. The [hIAPP+Cu+H]3+, [hIAPP+Al+H]4+ and [hIAPP17-30+Cu]2+ complexes were observed in MS spectra. The Cu binding site of hIAPP is suggested to be the N22-F-G-A-I26 part for the [hIAPP+Cu+H]3+ gas-phase complex. The original hIAPP conformation was supposed to be changed by the interaction between the Cu ion and the N22-F-G-A-I26 part in the [hIAPP+Cu+H]3+ gas-phase complex.
