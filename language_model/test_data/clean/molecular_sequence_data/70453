Retinoids play important roles in the ontogenic development of the olfactory system in mammals, but their function in adult olfactory mucosa has not been explored. In the present study, the olfactory mucosal expression of nuclear retinoid receptors was examined in adult mice. Several retinoic acid receptor isotypes were identified in olfactory mucosa from adult C57BL/6 mice by RNA-PCR and DNA sequence analysis, including RARbeta, RXRalpha, RXRbeta, and RXRgamma. In addition, a previously unidentified mouse RXRbeta isoform containing a 12-nucleotide insertion in exon 7 was detected. Furthermore, in vitro metabolic studies demonstrated that olfactory mucosal cytosolic and microsomal preparations are active in the biosynthesis of retinoic acids from all-trans- and 9-cis-retinal. These results indicate that components of the retinoid signal transduction system are expressed in adult olfactory mucosa and may play important roles in gene regulation in this unique tissue where olfactory neuronal cells are continuously replaced.
