microRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of regulatory RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to specific sequences on target mRNAs. However, functional identification of mRNA targets is usually difficult and time consuming. Here we report hybrid-PCR as a new and rapid approach to screen putative mRNA targets in vitro.

Fifteen putative target mRNAs for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) miR-UL112-1, including previously confirmed HCMV IE72, were identified from mRNA-derived cDNAs using hybrid-PCR. Moreover, we randomly validated six different target candidates by luciferase reporter assays, and confirmed that their luciferase activities were down-regulated with co-transfection of HCMV miR-UL112-1.

Our study demonstrated that hybrid-PCR is an effective and rapid approach for screening putative miRNA targets, with much more advantage of simplicity, low cost, and ease of implementation.
