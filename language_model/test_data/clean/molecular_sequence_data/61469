Extensive endothelial dysfunction has been regarded as the central hallmark in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia, but the mechanisms leading to this dysfunction remain unclear. The levels of many metabolism substances, such as lipid peroxides, are changed in plasma of patients with pre-eclampsia. Some of those might be associated with the occurrence of pre-eclampsia. Our research was trying to reveal the source of metabolism substances which were elevated in plasma of preeclamptic patients. The expression of many metabolism-associated genes in 3 preeclamptic and strictly matched 3 normal placentas were compared by employing DNA chip representing 243 human hormone-associated genes. The results showed that, many redox metabolism-related genes (GenBank: U78168, X16699, D32143, AL035079, AF069668, X53463, J03746, X02317, X91247, etc) were found more highly expressed in preeclamptic placenta than that in normal placenta. Additionally, the mRNA levels of some genes which were related to other metabolism such as hormone (GenBank: NM_001718, Z22535, M38180, M76665, X75252, J03258, U56725), were also higher in placenta of patients with pre-eclampsia. Furthermore, many transcription factor genes were also up-regulated in pre-eclampsia. It suggested that, the change of genes expression in placenta was associated with the change of metabolism in patients with pre-eclampsia.
