Identification and characterization of IgE-inducing antigens are important for elucidating the mechanisms involved in IgE-mediated immune responses in allergic diseases and parasite infections. While many allergens have been characterized, little is known about parasite antigens inducing specific IgE following infection. In order to identify antigens from the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, we generated an IgE-producing B cell hybridoma from N. brasiliensis-infected C57BL/6 mice and constructed a cDNA phage display library from N. brasiliensis. We successfully cloned and expressed an N. brasiliensis antigen (Nb-Ag1) that showed specific binding to anti-N. brasiliensis IgE. Nb-Ag1 localized to the pharynx of adult N. brasiliensis, suggesting that Nb-Ag1 is a potential pharyngeal gland antigen. Nb-Ag1-specific IgE could be detected in the serum of N. brasiliensis-infected mice, but only for a short time and only following a challenge infection. In contrast, local administration of Nb-Ag1 during primary, secondary and tertiary infections induced Nb-Ag1-specific IgE-mediated active cutaneous anaphylaxis. Therefore, amongst the high amounts of polyclonal total IgE, low levels of parasite-specific IgE responses are induced during primary helminth infections. Here, we show that even such low levels of parasite-specific IgE are sufficient to prime mast cells in vivo and mediate degranulation.
