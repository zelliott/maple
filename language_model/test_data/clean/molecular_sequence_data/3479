We examined levels and patterns of the nucleotide polymorphism of the Amylase genes with a head-to-head duplication in Drosophila kikkawai. The levels of variation in D. kikkawai were comparable to those in Drosophila melanogaster. Tajima's test, Fu and Li's test, HKA test, and MK test did not show significant departure from neutrality. We found an excess of replacement changes in the within-locus class, representing polymorphism in one of the duplicated genes, compared with the between-locus class, representing polymorphism shared between the duplicated genes. Most replacement changes in the within-locus class were singletons. These results suggest that most replacement changes are deleterious. A contrasting evolutionary pattern, involving concerted evolution in the coding regions but differential evolution in the 5'-flanking regions, was observed. However, unlike the duplicated Amy genes of D. melanogaster, the coding regions of the duplicated genes in D. kikkawai tended to diverge. Using Ohta's model of the small multigene family, we found that recombination (interchromosomal equal crossing-over) rate was one order higher than gene conversion (unequal crossing-over) rate, resulting in a considerable but incomplete homogenization of the duplicated coding regions. Linkage disequilibria were found in the intron as well as within and around the regulatory cis-element sequences of one of the duplicated genes (Amy1). The possible causes of these linkage disequilibria were discussed.
