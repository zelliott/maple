We report the characterization of two members of a gene family from Arabidopsis that encode, respectively, cytosolic (cPMSR) and plastid-targeted (pPMSR) isoforms of the oxidative-stress-repair enzyme peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase. Overexpression of these proteins in Escherichia coli confirmed that each had PMSR enzyme activity with a synthetic substrate, N-acetyl-[(3)H]-methionine sulfoxide, or a biological substrate, alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor. The pPMSR was imported into intact chloroplasts in vitro with concomitant cleavage of its approximately 5-kD N-terminal signal peptide. The two PMSR isoforms exhibited divergent pH optima, tissue localization, and responses to developmental and environmental effects. Analysis of the Arabidopsis database indicated that there are probably at least two p-pmsr-like genes and three c-pmsr-like genes in the Arabidopsis genome. Expression of the p-pmsr genes and their protein products was restricted to photosynthetic tissues and was strongly induced following illumination of etiolated seedlings. In contrast, the c-pmsr genes were expressed at moderate levels in all tissues and were only weakly affected by light. Exposure to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses showed relatively little effect on pmsr gene expression, with the exception of leaves subjected to a long-term exposure to the cauliflower mosaic virus. These leaves showed a strong induction of the c-pmsr gene after 2 to 3 weeks of chronic pathogen infection. These data suggest novel roles for PMSR in photosynthetic tissues and in pathogen defense responses in plants.
