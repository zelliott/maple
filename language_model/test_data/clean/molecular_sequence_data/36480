Intraspecific selection of Bacillus thuringiensis strains producing extracellular alkaline ribonucleases was carried out. Subtoxicus subspecies with increased expression of the enzyme was detected. A method was developed to isolate preparative amounts of homogeneous extracellular RNase of B. thuringiensis var. subtoxicus. The physico-chemical and catalytic properties of the enzyme was studied and compared with extracellular RNases of others Bacillus species. The conclusion about the structural and evolutional conservation of Bacillus extracellular RNases was drawn.
