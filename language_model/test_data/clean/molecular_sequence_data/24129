Rhodococcus pyridinovorans MW3 was isolated from an arable land of manioc from the Congo for its ability to transform acrylonitrile to acrylamide. This strain contains a cobalt nitrile hydratase (NHase) showing high sequence homology with NHases so far described. The specific NHase activity was 97 U mg(-1) dry wt. NHase production by R. pyridinovorans MW3 was urea and Co-dependent. The NHase was active for acrylamide up to 60% (w/v) indicating its potential for acrylamide production.
