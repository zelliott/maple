Killer immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptors (KIRs) are the major functional natural killer (NK) cell receptors in human. The presence of KIR genes has only recently been demonstrated in other (non-primate) species, and their expression, genomic arrangement, and function in these species have yet to be investigated. In this study, we describe the KIR gene family in cattle. KIR sequences were amplified from cDNA derived from four animals. Seventeen new sequences were identified in total. Some are alleles of two previously described genes, and the remainder are representative of at least four additional genes. These cDNA data, together with analysis of the cattle genome sequence, confirm that, as in humans, cattle have multiple inhibitory and activating KIR genes, with variable haplotype composition, and putative framework genes. In contrast to human, the majority of the cattle KIR genes encode three Ig-domain KIRs; most of the inhibitory genes encode only one immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), and the activating genes encode molecules with arginine rather than the more usual lysine in the transmembrane domain. A divergent gene, 2DL1, encodes a two Ig-domain KIR with an unusual D0-D2 structure, and a distinct signaling domain with two ITIMs. Similarity to pig and human two Ig-domain (D0-D2) KIRs suggest these may be more related to an ancestral gene than the other cattle KIR genes. Cattle have multiple NKG2A-related genes and at least one Ly49 gene; thus, the data presented here suggest that they have the potential to express more major histocompatibility complex-binding NK receptors than other species.
