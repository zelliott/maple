Peptide chips are an emerging technology that could replace many of the bioanalytical methods currently used in drug discovery, diagnostics, and cell biology. Despite the promise of these chips, their development for quantitative assays has been limited by several factors, including a lack of well-defined surface chemistries to immobilize peptides, the heterogeneous presentation of immobilized ligands, and nonspecific adsorption of protein to the substrate. This paper describes a peptide chip that overcomes these limitations, and demonstrates its utility in activity assays of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Src. The chip was prepared by the Diels-Alder-mediated immobilization of the kinase substrate AcIYGEFKKKC-NH(2) on a self-assembled monolayer of alkanethiolates on gold. Phosphorylation of the immobilized peptides was characterized by surface plasmon resonance, fluorescence, and phosphorimaging. Three inhibitors of the enzyme were quantitatively evaluated in an array format on a single, homogeneous substrate.
