Two novel aerobic, dark-orange-pigmented, Gram-negative bacterial strains, designated KMM 3531(T) and KMM 3953, were isolated from the green alga Ulva fenestrata. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the strains represented a novel lineage within the family Flavobacteriaceae. The most closely related genera with validly published names were Costertonia, Flagellimonas, Kriegella, Maribacter, Muricauda and Zobellia, with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 93.3-91.8 %. Cells of strains KMM 3531(T) and KMM 3953 were rod-shaped, motile by gliding and grew at temperatures up to 49 degrees C. They produced acid from carbohydrates and possessed oxidase, catalase, beta-galactosidase and agarase activities. The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0,) iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH, iso-C(15 : 1) G, summed feature 3 (comprising C(16 : 1)omega7c and/or iso-capital ES, Cyrillic(15 : 0) 2-OH), iso-C(17 : 1)omega9c and iso-C(15 : 0) 3-OH. The DNA G+C content was 47-49 mol%. On the basis of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, strains KMM 3531(T) and KMM 3953 represent a novel genus and species, for which the name Pseudozobellia thermophila gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KMM 3531(T) (=DSM 19858(T)=JCM 11733(T)=KCTC 22016(T)).
