The Escherichia coli gluconate permease genes, gntT ant gntU, were cloned and characterized. At least four homologues to GntT were found in E. coli by database searching. These proteins including GntT and GntU appear to have similar topological structures with 14 membrane-spanning segments, suggesting that they constitute a GntP family.
