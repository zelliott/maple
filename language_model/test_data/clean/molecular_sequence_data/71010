A 8022 base pair fragment from the mitochondrial DNA of the prosobranch gastropod Littorina saxatilis has been sequenced and shown to contain the complete genes for 12 transfer RNAs and five protein genes (CoII, ATPase 6, ATPase 8, ND1, ND6), two partial protein genes (CoI and cyt b), and two ribosomal RNAs (small and large subunits). The order of these constituent genes differs from those of other molluscan mitochondrial gene arrangements. Only a single rearrangement involving a block of protein coding genes and three tRNA translocations are necessary to produce identical gene orders between L. saxatilis and K. tunicata. However, only one gene boundary is shared between the L. saxatilis gene order and that of the pulmonate gastropod Cepaea nemoralis. This extends the observation that there is little conservation of mitochrondrial gene order amongst the Mollusca and suggests that radical mitochondrial DNA gene rearrangement has occurred on the branch leading to the pulmonates.
