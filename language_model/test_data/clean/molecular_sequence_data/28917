We have found an integron-like integrase gene and an attI site in Shewanella oneidensis as part of a small chromosomal integron. We have cloned this gene and tested the ability of the integrase to excise cassettes from various integrons. Most cassettes flanked by two attC sites are readily excised, while cassettes in the "first" position, with an attI1 or attI3 site on one end, are not excised. An exception is a cassette with attI2 on one end. The attI2 site, from Tn7, has greater similarity to the attI site adjacent to the integrase of S. oneidensis than do attI1 or attI3. We cloned the attI site of S. oneidensis and observed the integration of two different cassettes. We have, therefore, demonstrated the function of this integron-like integrase.
