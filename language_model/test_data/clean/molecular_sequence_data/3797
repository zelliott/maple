The cdc25C phosphatase participates in regulating transition from the G2 phase of the cell cycle to mitosis by dephosphorylating cyclin-dependent kinase 1. The tumor suppressor p53 down-regulates expression of cdc25C as part of G2/M checkpoint control. Transcription of cdc25C oscillates during the cell cycle with no expression in resting cells and maximum transcription in G2. We had identified earlier a new mechanism of cell cycle-dependent transcription that is regulated by a cell cycle-dependent element (CDE) in conjunction with a cell cycle genes homology region (CHR). The human cdc25C gene was the first example. CDE/CHR tandem elements have since been found in promoters of many cell cycle genes. Here we show that the mouse cdc25C gene is regulated by a CHR but does not hold a CDE. Therefore, it is the first identified gene with CHR-dependent transcriptional regulation during the cell cycle not relying on a CDE located upstream of it. The CHR leads to repression of cdc25C transcription early in the cell cycle and directs a release of this repression in G2. Furthermore, we find that this CHR can cooperate in cell cycle-dependent transcription with elements placed directly upstream of it binding E2F, Sp1 or Sp3 transcription factors.
