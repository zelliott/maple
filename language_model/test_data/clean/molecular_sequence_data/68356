Sequence analysis of the region upstream of the apocytochrome b (cob) gene in the Arabidopsis mitochondrial genome identifies an open reading frame with homology to ribosomal protein L5, (rpl5), and a pseudogene with similarity to ribosomal protein S14 (rps14) genes. Both cob and rpl5 genes have intact reading frames, but the rps14 homology is disrupted by a stop codon and a deleted nucleotide. The rpl5 gene, the rps14 pseudogene, and the cob gene are separated by one nucleotide and a 1604-nucleotide-long spacer respectively. A plastid-like tRNA(Ser) is encoded downstream from the cob gene. The entire region is transcribed into a 5-kb transcript, containing the rps14 pseudogene and the cob gene. Cob and rpl5 mRNAs are edited in several positions with different frequencies. The rps14 pseudogene is transcribed and edited in one position in common with other plants. Since no intact rps14 gene is found in the mitochondrial genome of Arabidopsis, the functional gene is presumably encoded in the nucleus.
