The self-incompatibility (SI) response in Papaver rhoeas depends upon the cognate interaction between a pollen-expressed receptor and a stigmatically expressed ligand. The genes encoding these components are situated within the S-locus. In order for SI to be maintained, the genes encoded by the S-locus must be co-inherited with no recombination between them. Several hypotheses, including sequence heterogeneity and chromosomal position, have been put forward to explain the maintenance of the S-locus in the SI systems of the Brassicaceae and the Solanaceae. A region of the Papaver rhoeas genome encompassing part of the self-incompatibility S(1) locus has been cloned and sequenced. The clone contains the gene encoding the stigmatic component of the response, but does not contain a putative pollen S-gene. The sequence surrounding the S(1) gene contains several diverse repetitive DNA elements. As such, the P. rhoeas S-locus bears similarities to the S-loci of other SI systems. An attempt to localize the P. rhoeas S-locus using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has also been made. The potential relevance of the findings to mechanisms of recombination suppression is discussed.
