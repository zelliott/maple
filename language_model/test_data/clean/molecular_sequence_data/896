Glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) has been proposed to be responsible for cleaving membrane-associated glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) molecules to generate inositol phosphoglycan (IPGs), which have growth factor-mimetic properties. We have cloned the mouse liver GPI-PLD cDNA, which has a sequence that differs from that previously isolated from a mouse glucagonoma cell library. Using a highly specific and very sensitive RNase protection assay, we found that the GPI-PLD expressed in adult/post-natal brain, antrum and insulin-producing cells is identical to that isolated from liver. The expression of mouse GPI-PLD in liver shows a complex genetic regulation with a mouse strain-specific variation. In addition, GPI-PLD mRNA levels were higher in 4-week old animals compared to older animals, and the GPI-PLD mRNA levels increased in mice that developed insulin dependent type 1 diabetes spontaneously. This suggests that the expression of liver GPI-PLD in mice is highly regulated.
