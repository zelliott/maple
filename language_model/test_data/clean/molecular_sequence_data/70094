A DNA fragment from Bordetella pertussis, encoding the fim2 fimbrial subunit gene with adjacent sequences, was used as a probe for the detection of homologous sequences in chromosomal DNA of Bordetella avium. A 1.8 kb Sa1I-PstI fragment from the genome of B. avium, which hybridized with the probe, was isolated and sequenced. No fimbrial subunit gene was located on the B. avium DNA fragment. Two regions could be distinguished in the sequence of the fragment. Region 1, which was 80% identical to the sequence upstream of the fim2 gene of B. pertussis and region 2, which had no identity with any known sequence. A 491 bp EagI DNA fragment (probe A) within region 1 and a 650 bp EagI DNA fragment (probe B) within region 2 were used as DNA probes on restriction endonuclease digests of chromosomal DNA from various bacterial species. This hybridization experiment showed that the region 2 sequence was specific for B. avium. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers within region 2 resulted in the amplification of a 500 bp DNA fragment with B. avium DNA only. This PCR is a useful method for the rapid detection of B. avium and appeared useful to discriminate B. avium from other Bordetella species and also from Alcaligenes faecalis.
