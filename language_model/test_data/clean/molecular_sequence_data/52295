We have cloned and characterized the human gene for the 21-kDa brain form of prostaglandin D2 synthase. The gene was isolated from a human genomic lambda library and spans 3600 base pairs. It consists of seven exons and six introns. Southern blot analysis indicates that there is a single copy of the gene in the haploid genome. The transcriptional start site was mapped to a G residue 74 base pairs 5' of the ATG initiation codon. A TATA box-like element (ATAAATA) is situated 21 base pairs upstream of the mRNA start site. The gene was mapped to chromosome 9 bands q34.2-q34.3. The gene bears close resemblance to the genes for murine major urinary protein and ovine beta-lactoglobulin.
