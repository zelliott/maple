Negative ion electrospray mass spectra of the peptides produced by tryptic and chymotrypsin digests of bovine insulin, and from the tryptic digest of lysozyme identify at least 80% of the sequences of these proteins. In particular, negative ion mass spectrometry identifies and positions disulfide moieties, and is the method of choice for identifying this post-translational modification in these two proteins. Intramolecular disulfide functionality is identified by the fragmentation [(M - H)(-)- H(2)S(2)](-) in a digest peptide, and CID of that fragment anion provides amino acid sequencing information. Digest peptides containing an intermolecular disulfide structure undergo facile and diagnostic cleavages. Each cleavage produces a peptide fragment from which CID MS/MS data provide sequencing information.
