The aim of this study was to investigate the validity of recA gene as a molecular marker for the reliable discrimination and classification of dairy propionibacteria and the closely related species. Regions of the recA gene, varying in size between 613 and 677 nucleotides, were sequenced for Propionibacterium acidipropionici, P. cyclohexanicum, P. freudenreichii, P. jensenii, P. microaerophilum and P. thoenii using degenerate consensus primers constructed by aligning recA sequences of some actinobacteria. The 16S rRNA encoding genes for the type and reference strains of the species P. acidipropionici, P. jensenii and P. thoenii were also sequenced to remove ambiguous positions present in the current database reports, such to improve the classification scheme of reference. As found for other bacterial species, recA sequences permitted a better distinction among the dairy propionibacteria considered than 16S rRNA gene. However, the topology of phylogenetic trees constructed on the recA gene regions sequenced and their putative translations appeared rather different and less statistically valid than the 16S rRNA gene tree. In addition, the possibility of designing PCR-based identification and detection tests on the new recA sequences was demonstrated by assessing specific amplification protocols for P. cyclohexanicum and P. microaerophilum.
