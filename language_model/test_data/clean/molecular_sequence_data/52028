To further develop the linkage map of human chromosome 21 (HC21), we have concentrated on identifying highly polymorphic markers based on dinucleotide repeat sequences such as (GT)n, as these are often highly polymorphic, are widespread throughout the human genome, and can be rapidly analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction. We report here nine (GT)n polymorphic markers from HC21.
