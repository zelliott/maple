Site-directed mutagenesis experiments have been carried out to determine the structure-function relationship of human aromatase. By sequence comparison, the region in aromatase that corresponds to the distal helix of cytochrome P-450cam has been identified to be Gln-298 to Val-313. Eight aromatase mutants with changes in this region, i.e. C299A, E302L, P308F, D309N, D309A, T310S, T310C, and S312C, have been generated using a mammalian cell stable-expression system. The results from site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that the region containing Gln-298 to Val-313 is indeed a very important part of the active site of aromatase. The catalytic properties of P308F, D309N, and D309A have been examined in detail and are discussed. Active site-directed labeling is also an important approach to investigate the structure-function relationship of aromatase. HPLC-linked electrospray mass spectrometry is indicated as a useful technique for the characterization of active site-directed probe-modified enzyme. The mass spectral analysis of aromatase suggests that aromatase is glycosylated.
