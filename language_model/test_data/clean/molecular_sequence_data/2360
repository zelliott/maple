The murine alpha B-crystallin gene was cloned and its expression was examined. In the mouse, significant levels of alpha B-crystallin RNA were detected not only in lens but also in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and lung; low and trace levels were detected in brain and spleen, respectively. The RNA species in lung, brain, and spleen was 400 to 500 bases larger than that in the other tissues. Transcription in lens, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and brain initiated at the same position. A mouse alpha B-crystallin mini-gene was constructed and was introduced into the germ line of mice, and its expression was demonstrated to parallel that of the endogenous gene. Transgene RNA was always detected in lens, heart, and skeletal muscle, while expression in kidney and lung was variable; it remains uncertain whether there is transgene expression in brain and spleen. These results demonstrate that regulatory sequences controlling expression of the alpha B-crystallin gene lie between sequences 666 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site and 2.4 kilobase pairs downstream of the poly(A) addition site and are not located within the introns. Transfection studies with a series of alpha B-crystallin mini-gene deletion mutants revealed that sequences between positions -222 and -167 were required for efficient expression in primary embryonic chick lens cells; sequences downstream of the poly(A) addition signal were dispensable for expression in this in vitro system.
