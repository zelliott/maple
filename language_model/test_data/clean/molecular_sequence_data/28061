In vitro aging at pH 7.4, 37 degrees C causes natural sequence recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH), methionyl rhGH, and human pituitary growth hormone to become substrates for bovine brain protein carboxyl methyltransferase, an enzyme that modifies the "side chain" alpha-carboxyl group present at atypical isoaspartyl linkages. The substrate capacity of rhGH increased at a rate of 1.8 methyl-accepting sites/day/100 molecules of hormone. Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of trypsin digests of aged rhGH revealed two altered peptides not present in digests of control rhGH. These two fragments, which had the amino acid compositions of residues 128-134 (Leu-Glu-Asp-Gly-Ser-Pro-Arg) and 146-158 (Phe-Asp-Thr-Asn-Ser-His-Asn-Asp-Asp-Ala-Leu-Leu-Lys), contained the majority of the induced methylation sites, 22 and 58%, respectively. Isoaspartate can result from deamidation of asparagine or isomerization of aspartate. Isomerization of Asp-130, the only candidate site in 128-134, was corroborated by coelution of the altered fragment with the synthetic isoaspartyl peptide upon reversed-phase HPLC. Evidence is presented that the altered 146-158 fragment is a mixture of two peptides resulting from deamidation of Asn-149 to form 70-80% isoaspartate and 20-30% aspartate at this position. The position of isoaspartate in the altered 146-158 fragment was deduced from mass spectrometry, which indicated a single deamidated asparagine; from methylation stoichiometry, which indicated only one methylation site; and from automated Edman degradation, which showed an absence of asparagine and a low yield of aspartate at position 149. These results show that isoaspartate formation from both aspartate and asparagine is a significant, and possibly the major, source of spontaneous covalent alteration of rhGH and that enzymatic carboxyl methylation provides a powerful tool for assessing this type of modification.
