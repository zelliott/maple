Weidinger et al. recognized a rare deficient PI-variant, named PI Zaugsburg (PI Zaug), by using isoelectric focusing with a narrow pH gradient. The serum alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) level determined quantitatively in an individual carrying the phenotype PI M1Zaug revealed a value of 50%-60% of the normal range. The frequency of the deficient PI*Zaug allele is still unknown. Haplotyping the Zaug-affected chromosome, we found a pattern different from the common PI*Z allele described by Cox et al. Therefore, we directly sequenced the coding exons of both genes (M1 and Zaug) after PCR amplification. Zaug sequence data analysis showed the presence of the common PI*Z allele-specific mutation (M1 Glu342 GAG to Z Lys342 AAG) surprisingly occurring in an M2 ancestral gene. This is not consistent with the heretofore common finding, by Nukiwa et al. and others, that this mutation is derived from an M1 (Ala213) background gene. No further mutations were found in the PI Zaug gene.
