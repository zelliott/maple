To express a human-mouse chimeric antibody against rh-bFGF antigen in eukaryotic cells.

The VL and VH genes were amplified and cloned from the hybridoma 1F11 secreting anti-rh-bFGF mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) and the CL and CH genes were amplified and cloned from the plasmid pMDHC and pMDLC. They were inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors after sequencing. The recombinant plasmids were then transformed into CHO-dhfr- cells for expression. The humanization and antigen specificity of expressed products were identified by indirect ELISA. The relative molecular mass (Mr) of expressed products was determined by SDS-PAGE.

The cloned antibody genes were identified to be functional by sequencing. The chimeric antibody could be detected in the culture supernatant of transformed CHO cells. The humanization and specificity of the chimeric antibody to rh-bFGF were confirmed by ELISA.

The mouse-human chimeric antibody against rh-bFGF has been expressed successfully in eukaryotic cells, which lays the foundation for its further clinical research.
