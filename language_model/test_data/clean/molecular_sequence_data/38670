We have cloned a cDNA from zebrafish (Danio rerio) that contains an open-reading frame of 132 amino acids coding for a fatty acid binding protein (FABP) of approximately 15 kDa. Multiple sequence alignment revealed extensive amino acid identity between this zebrafish FABP and intestinal-like FABPs (I-FABP) from other species. The zebrafish I-FABP cDNA hybridized to single restriction fragments of total zebrafish genomic DNA digested with the restriction endonucleases PstI Bg/II or EcoRI suggesting that a single copy of the I-FABP gene is present in the zebrafish genome. An oligonucleotide probe complementary to the zebrafish I-FABP mRNA hybridized to an mRNA of approximately 800 bases in Northern blot analysis. In situ hybridization revealed that the I-FABP mRNA was expressed exclusively in the intestine of the adult zebrafish.
