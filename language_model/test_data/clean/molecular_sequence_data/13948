A gene fragment encoding the C-terminal 204 amino acids (AA) from the structural envelope glycoprotein (E) and the N-terminal 65 AA from non-structural protein one (NS1) of dengue type 2 virus (DEN-2) was expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) as a fusion protein with staphylococcal protein A. The recombinant fusion protein was purified and analysed for its antigenicity, its immunogenicity and its ability to protect mice against lethal challenge with live DEN-2 virus. The recombinant protein was found to be reactive with anti-DEN-2 polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Mice immunized with the purified fusion protein made anti-DEN-2 antibodies measured by the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) and neutralization (N) tests, and were protected against lethal challenge with DEN-2 virus administered by intracranial inoculation.
