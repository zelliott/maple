The presence of HIV-1 DNA sequence variants of pediatric AIDS patients was investigated in a two-stage polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using nested primers for the first and second (V1-V2) hypervariable regions of the proviral envelope (gp 120) gene (env1). Gel electrophoresis analysis yielded amplified DNA bands which exhibited length variations which were characteristic for each child. The PCR products were cloned and the resulting clones demonstrated inserts of different lengths in a patient and between patients. Analysis of five clones from two different patients at the level of DNA sequencing indicates an extreme heterogeneity in the V1-V2 region. DNA maximum similarity between all of the isolated clones ranged between 69 to 96%. Comparison between DNA sequences of the isolated clones and HIV-1 strains of other parts of the world was also performed. The highest percentage of similarity that was found with known HIV variants included the following strains: HIVADA, HIVJFL, HIVSW42, HIVSWB83, HIVTRA2, HIVWMJ22. The sequences also showed a high degree of similarity to the clade B virus HIVSF162. The analyzed HIV-1 sequences demonstrated the expected high degree of variation in the V1-V2 region of the envelope gene and in some cases that the variation between isolates from the same patient may exceed the variation between the individual clones and the reference HIV-1 strains.
