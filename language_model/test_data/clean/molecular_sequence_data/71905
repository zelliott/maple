Formation of the cytolytic membrane attack complex of complement on host cells is inhibited by the membrane-bound glycoprotein, CD59. The inhibitory activity of CD59 is species restricted, and human CD59 is not effective against rat complement. Previous functional analysis of chimeric human/rat CD59 proteins indicated that the residues responsible for the species selective function of human CD59 map to a region contained between positions 40 and 66 in the primary structure. By comparative analysis of rat and human CD59 models and by mutational analysis of candidate residues, we now identify the individual residues within the 40-66 region that confer species selective function on human CD59. All nonconserved residues within the 40-66 sequence were substituted from human to rat residues in a series of chimeric human/rat CD59 mutant proteins. Functional analysis revealed that the individual human to rat residue substitutions F47A, T51L, R55E, and K65Q each produced a mutant human CD59 protein with enhanced rat complement inhibitory activity with the single F47A substitution having the most significant effect. Interestingly, the side chains of the residues at positions 47, 51, and 55 are all located on the short single helix (residues 47-55) of CD59 and form an exposed continuous strip parallel to the helix axis. A single human CD59 mutant protein containing rat residue substitutions at all three helix residues produced a protein with species selective activity comparable to that of rat CD59. We further found that synthetic peptides spanning the human CD59 helix sequence were able to inhibit the binding of human CD59 to human C8, but had little effect on the binding of rat CD59 to rat C8.
