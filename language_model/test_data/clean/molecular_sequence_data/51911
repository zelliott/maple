A phagemid (pSHT) containing the pUC and M13 ori sequences was constructed to facilitate the expression of partial cDNAs or of sequences encoding mammalian membrane- and secretory-protein domains. It provides a start codon and signal sequence flanked upstream by the simian virus 40 and bacteriophage T7 promoters and downstream by cloning sites, stop codons in all three frames, splicing and polyadenylation signals.
