A mutant (strain B119) of Agrobacterium tumefaciens with a chromosomal mutation was isolated by transposon (Tn5) mutagenesis. The mutant exhibited growth rates on L agar and minimal medium (AB) plates similar to those of the parent strain (strain A208 harboring a nopaline-type Ti plasmid). The mutant was avirulent on all host plants tested: Daucus carota, Cucumis sativus, and Kalanchoe diagremontiana. The mutant was not impaired in attachment ability to carrot cells. The mutant had one insertion of Tn5 in its chromosome. The avirulent phenotype of B119 was shown to be due to the Tn5 insertion in the chromosome by the marker exchange technique. A wild-type target chromosomal segment (3.0 kb) which included the site of mutation was cloned and sequenced. Two open reading frames, ORF-1 (468 bp) and ORF-2 (995 bp), were identified in the 3.0-kb DNA segment. Tn5 was inserted in the middle of ORF-2 (acvB gene). Introduction of the acvB gene into the mutant B119 strain complemented the avirulent phenotype of the strain. Homology search found no genes homologous to acvB, although it had some similarity to the open reading frame downstream of the virA gene on the Ti plasmid. Thus, the acvB gene identified in this study seems to be a new chromosomal virulence gene of A. tumefaciens.
