The individual properties and intermolecular organization of ganglioside GD3 and of two of its lactone forms (GD3Lactone I and GD3Lactone II) were studied in lipid monolayers. The formation of the first lactone ring in GD3Lactone I eliminates one negative charge and leads to a decrease of the molecular area at all surface pressures. The intermolecular dispersion energy and collapse pressure are higher in GD3Lactone I compared to those in the parent GD3. The surface potential per unit of molecular surface density and the resultant molecular dipole moment are increased in GD3Lactone I with respect to those in GD3 at comparable values of molecular area. In GD3Lactone I the molecular parameters suggest an oligosaccharide chain oriented similarly to that of GD3. On the average, this is perpendicular to the surface, and the resultant polar head-group dipole moment points away from the interface. In GD3Lactone II the negative charges are eliminated, resulting in considerably larger molecular areas than for GD3 and GD3Lactone I at all pressures. The intermolecular dispersion energy of GD3Lactone II is also greatly diminished and the collapse pressure is further increased compared to those of GD3Lactone I. However, the surface potential per unit molecular surface density and the resultant molecular dipole moment of GD3Lactone II are higher than in GD3 Lactone I at similar values of molecular areas. This is probably due to a positive polar head-group dipole moment contribution induced by the additional lactone ring in GD3Lactone II. These changes result from a distorted conformation of the oligosaccharide chain owing to the presence of fused carbohydrate rings which require a greater intermolecular spacing compared to GD3 and GD3Lactone I.
