We characterized the GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTP-CH-I) gene in a patient with hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation/dopa-responsive dystonia (HPD/DRD). The sequence analysis revealed a C to A transversion, which predicts a novel missense mutation (Thr186Lys). Unexpectedly, this base change, occurring in the middle of exon 5, resulted in a production of the novel transcript lacking exon 5 and a part of exon 6. Three different transcripts of the GTP-CH-I gene, previously reported in the human liver, were also present in the peripheral lymphocytes from the patient and controls. Quantitative comparison of the truncated-subunit mRNA and the wild-type one implied that differential splicing regulates the GTP-CH-I enzyme activity, leading to the clinical variations in HPD/DRD. The patient showed a unique clinical symptom, suggesting that the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system is more affected than previously thought in HPD/DRD.
