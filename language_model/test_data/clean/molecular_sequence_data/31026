cDNAs coding for the intra-acrosomal protein SP-10 were cloned and characterized as a first step in understanding the expression of this antigen during spermatogenesis. Three overlapping SP-10-specific cDNAs were isolated from a human testes cDNA expression library. These cDNAs hybridized to a 1.35-kb mRNA that was present in human testes but was not found in liver or placenta. Complete sequencing of these cDNAs, designated SP-10-5, SP-10-8, and SP-10-10, produced an 1117-bp sequence containing a 265-amino acid-coding region for the SP-10 protein. Hydrophobicity plots generated from the deduced amino acid sequence showed a very hydrophobic amino terminus characteristic of a signal peptide. Sequence data showed that three different amino acid repeats occurred a total of 16 times in the central third of the SP-10 protein. Interestingly, cDNA SP-10-10 has an internal 57-base pair (19 amino acids) in-frame deletion that is not present in SP-10-5, suggesting that alternative splicing generates more than one SP-10 mRNA. The SP-10 protein appears to be a unique acrosomal protein, based on previous immunohistological data and the observation that SP-10 cDNA sequences did not show any significant homology to other sequences found in the Genbank, National Biomedical Research Foundation, or Swiss sequence banks. A recombinant SP-10 fusion protein was produced in an Escherichia coli expression vector and used to generate a polyclonal antiserum. This antiserum stained the acrosomal cap in situ and reacted with a similar set of peptides on Western blots as did a monoclonal antibody to SP-10.
