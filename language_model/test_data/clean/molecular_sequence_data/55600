Entry of herpes simplex virus (HSV) into cells is believed to be mediated by specific binding of envelope proteins to a cellular receptor. Neomycin specifically blocks this initial step in infection by HSV-1 but not HSV-2. Resistance of HSV-2 to this compound maps to a region of the genome encoding glycoprotein C (gC-2). We have studied the function of gC-2 in the initial interaction of the virus with the host cell, using HSV-2 mutants deleted for gC-2 and gC-2-rescued recombinants. Resistance to neomycin was directly linked to the presence of gC-2 within the viral genome. In addition, deletion of the gC-2 gene caused a marked delay in adsorption to cells relative to the wild-type virus. HSV-1 recombinants containing chimeric gC genes composed of HSV-1 and HSV-2 sequences were used to localize neomycin resistance within the N-terminal 223 amino acids of gC-2. This region of the glycoprotein comprises an important domain responsible for binding of HSV-2 to cell receptors in the presence of neomycin. A gC-2-negative mutant is still infectious, indicating that HSV-2 also has an alternative pathway of adsorption.
