DNA spanning a t(7;19) chromosomal translocation breakpoint was isolated from the human T cell line SUP-T7 established from an acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the point of crossover on chromosome 7 occurred immediately adjacent to joining segment J beta 1.1 within the TCR-beta gene, suggesting that this translocation resulted from an error in TCR gene rearrangement. On chromosome 19, the translocation occurred within a previously uncharacterized transcriptional unit for which we propose the name lyl-1. An approximately 1.5-kb RNA is transcribed from this gene in a wide variety of hematolymphoid cell lines. The t(7;19) results in truncation of the lyl-1 gene and production of abnormal-sized RNAs, suggesting a role for lyl-1 in the pathogenesis of this leukemia.
