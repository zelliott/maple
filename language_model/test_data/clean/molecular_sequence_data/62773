Optimal activation of B-lymphocytes depends both upon expression of various cell surface receptors and adequate integration of signaling pathways. This requires signals generated upon recognition of antigen by the B lymphocyte antigen receptor (BCR) as well as additional signals provided by cognate interaction with T helper cells, including the CD40-CD154 interaction. Engagement of both the BCR and CD40 results in synergistic activation of B cells. Previous studies identified tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-2 and TRAF3 in the CD40-signaling pathway together with BCR-activated protein kinase D (PKD) as important cooperative factors in this synergy. To better understand the role of these factors in bridging the BCR and CD40 signaling pathways, BCR signal regulation of TRAF function was examined. Results show that phosphorylation of TRAF2 is increased upon BCR but not CD40 engagement and that of the potentially phosphorylated residues of TRAF2, tyrosine 484 is crucial for BCR-CD40 synergy. Additionally, wild type or constitutively active Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) enhanced, whereas the xid mutant form of Btk prevented, BCR-CD40 synergy. These effects were dependent upon TRAF2 and PKD activity. These findings suggest a model in which Btk contributes to the enhancement of the CD40 response by TRAF2 in a PKD-dependent manner.
