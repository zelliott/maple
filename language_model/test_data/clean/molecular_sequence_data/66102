Although in the cow the genetic resistance to brucellosis has been previously attributed to the Slc11A1 gene encoding Nramp1 protein, none of the mutations described to date seems to be the cause. To be able to associate another polymorphism of the gene to brucellosis resistance, we characterized the gene and identified in different breeds of Bos taurus and Bos indicus, six new variants among a total of 11 single nucleotide mutations, of which five occurred in the coding sequence (three are missense mutations), one in the promoter region and five in introns. The allelic and genotypic frequencies calculated revealed differences (p < 0.05) among the breeds studied.
