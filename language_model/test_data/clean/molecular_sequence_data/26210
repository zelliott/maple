Transgenic plants have been particularly useful in studying nuclear genes encoding for photosynthetic functions. The expression of these genes and their chimeric constructs in transgenic plants faithfully mimics their natural counterparts. The use of sensitive chimeric reporter genes has enabled localizing the activity of genes encoding photosynthetic proteins to individual cells. Cab and rbcS transgenes have been shown to retain sensitivity to light quality, which is modulated by phytochrome. Conditional light activation under the influence of a circadian rhythm has been shown for Cab transgenes. Transgenic plants containing truncated promoters have helped delineate cis-regulatory positive and negative elements involved in light-mediated transcriptional induction and tissue specificity.
