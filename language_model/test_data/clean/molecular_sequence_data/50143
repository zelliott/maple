Translation of the mitochondrially coded COX2 mRNA within the organelle in yeast produces the precursor of Cox2p (pre-Cox2p), which is processed and assembled into cytochrome c oxidase. The mRNA sequence of the first 14 COX2 codons, specifying the pre-Cox2p leader peptide, was previously shown to contain a positively acting element required for translation of a mitochondrial reporter gene, ARG8(m), fused to the 91st codon of COX2. Here we show that three relatively short sequences within the COX2 mRNA coding sequence, or structures they form in vivo, inhibit translation of the reporter in the absence of the positive element. One negative element was localized within codons 15 to 25 and shown to function at the level of the mRNA sequence, whereas two others are within predicted stem-loop structures formed by codons 22-44 and by codons 46-74. All three of these inhibitory elements are antagonized in a sequence-specific manner by reintroduction of the upstream positive-acting sequence. These interactions appear to be independent of 5'- and 3'-untranslated leader sequences, as they are also observed when the same reporter constructs are expressed from the COX3 locus. Overexpression of MRS2, which encodes a mitochondrial magnesium carrier, partially suppresses translational inhibition by each isolated negatively acting element, but does not suppress them in combination. We hypothesize that interplay among these signals during translation in vivo may ensure proper timing of pre-Cox2p synthesis and assembly into cytochrome c oxidase.
