A phosphorylated polysaccharide was isolated from the aqueous layer of the phenol-water extract of a non-halophilic bacterium Shewanella putrefaciens strain S29. The glycosyl phosphate linkage in the polysaccharide was split under mild acid conditions to give, after borohydride reduction, a phosphorylated oligosaccharide-alditol. On the basis of sugar analysis and 1H, 13C and 31P NMR spectroscopy, including 2D COSY, relayed COSY, rotating-frame NOE spectroscopy (ROESY), heteronuclear 13C,1H COSY, and H-detected heteronuclear 1H,31P multiple-quantum coherence (HMQC), it was concluded that the polysaccharide is built up of tetrasaccharide-phosphate repeating units having the following structure: [sequence: see text] where QuiNAc and Qui4NAc are 2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxyglucose and 4-acetamido-4,6-dideoxyglucose, respectively.
