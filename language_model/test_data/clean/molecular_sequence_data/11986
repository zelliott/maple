The Ca(2+)-binding proteins regulate a number of cellular and extracellular activities and deregulations of S100 gene expression are associated with several human diseases. For example, S100A7 is upregulated in psoriatic skin, implicating a link with psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory dermatosis. We purified human S100A7 and determined its protein sequence by tandem mass spectrometry and Edman microsequence analysis. Interestingly, a sequence comparison of S100A7 with all known human S100 proteins showed that S100A7 is the most divergent of all S100 proteins.
