The gene encoding the oligopeptide transporter PepT1 (HGMW-approved gene symbol SLC15A1) from Tibetan porcine intestine was cloned. The open reading frame of this cDNA encodes 708 deduced amino acid residues that show high sequence similarity with its ovine and bovine counterparts. The putative protein has 12 putative transmembrane domains, including many structural features that are highly conserved among the vertebrate orthologs. PepT1 mRNA expression can be detected in duodenum, jejunum and ileum from Tibetan pigs at 28 days by RT-PCR. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that the jejunum had the highest expression of PepT1 when compared with the duodenum and ileum. PepT1 mRNA expression in the duodenum and proximal jejunum increases continuously from day 1 to day 14: expression was highest at day14 (P < 0.01) and then decreased gradually from day 21 to day 35. Our findings show that PepT1 mRNA expression in the distal jejunum increased gradually with age in suckling Tibetan piglet, and this may have important implications for amino acid and protein nutrition in young animals.
