Fission yeasts form a small but heterogeneous group of ascomycetes and it is still unclear whether they should be subdivided into three genera (Schizosaccharomyces, Octosporomyces, Hasegawaea) or remain a single genus (Schizosaccharomyces). In order to decide whether a new genus Hasegawaea should be established for the species Schizosaccharomyces japonicus and Schizosaccharomyces versatilis, we have characterized the entire rDNA cluster in Schizosaccharomyces japonicus var. versatilis and compared it with the homologous region from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and with complete rRNA gene sequences from other yeast genera. From a phage genomic library a recombinant lambda phage containing the entire rDNA repeat unit was isolated. In this paper we report the primary sequence of the 18s, 5.8s and 25s rRNA coding regions. The S. japonicus var. versatilis rRNA genes are 1823 (18s), 158 (5.8s) and 3422 (25s) nucleotides long. The two sequences of the larger rRNA genes exhibit 95.7% (18s) and 93% (25s) similarity with the homologous genes from S. pombe. The differences between the rRNA genes of S. japonicus and S. pombe, however, are much smaller than the intrageneric differences within the rDNA sequences of other yeast genera. Therefore, subdivision of fission yeasts into the genera Schizosaccharomyces and Hasegawaea does not to seem to be justified.
