A total of 91 isolates of Prevotella intermedia or Prevotella nigrescens from subgingival sites were identified by PCR using primers specific for sequences of 16S rRNA. The hemolytic and hemagglutinating activities of the P. intermedia isolates exhibited significantly higher levels compared to those of the P. nigrescens isolates by quantitative analysis. The hemagglutinin gene (phg) was found in 23 of 26 P. intermedia isolates (88.5%), whereas it was found in only two of 44 isolates (4.5%) of P. nigrescens. The high hemolytic and hemagglutinating activities of P. intermedia may be involved in the pathogenicity of P. intermedia in the progression of periodontal disease.
