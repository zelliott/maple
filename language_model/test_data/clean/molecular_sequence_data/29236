Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is known to be closely associated with the development of anaplastic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in some malignancy endemic regions in South-East Asia. LMP1 gene is one of the EBV latent genes, which encodes a latent membrane protein. LMP1 gene is thought to be a classical oncogene since it morphologically transforms cells in vitro and induces tumors in experimental animals in vivo. LMP1 is one of a few genes which is expressed in NPC tissues. It was first shown that C-terminus of LMP1 gene obtained from NPC patients in South-East Asia contained a deletion of 30 base pairs (bp). However, this deleted LMP1 gene was then found in the EBV isolates persisting among healthy virus carriers and patients with other EBV-associated abnormalities from both NPC endemic and non-endemic regions. The aim of this investigation was to accomplish a molecular biological analysis of EBV LMP1 genes obtained from Russian NPC patients. To this end, the authors isolated and sequenced the LMP1 clones amplified from the tumor tissues from 7 NPC patients at the N. N. Blokhin Russian Cancer Research Center and primary blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 6 healthy donors. As a result, the authors could not find the deletion of the above-mentioned 30 bp in NPC LMP1 clones, but could in one healthy donor (PBL-2). A functional analysis revealed no significant differences between LMP1 variants with or without 30 bp deletion in their capacity to activate NF kappa B and jun/AP-1 transcription factors. Nevertheless, Russian NPC-derived LMP1 variants as compared with those from PBLs featured some specific amino acid exchanges. These data indicate that the 30 bp deletion of LMP1 gene is not a factor that predisposes to NPC in Russia.
