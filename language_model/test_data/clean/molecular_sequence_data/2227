The structure of the insulin receptor was studied with polyclonal antibodies obtained from rabbits which were immunized with synthetic peptides having a sequence identity to three regions of the alpha-subunit and five regions of the beta-subunit. None of the alpha-subunit antibodies including alpha-Pep8 (residues 40-49 (Ullrich, A., Bell, J.R., Chen, E.Y., Herrera, R., Petruzzelli, L.M., Dull, T.J., Gray, A., Coussens, L., Liao, Y.-C., Tsubokawa, M., Mason, A., Seeburg, P.H., Grunfeld, C., Rosen, O.M., and Ramachandran, J. (1985) Nature 313, 756-761), alpha-Pep7 (12 amino acid C-terminal extension (Ebina, Y., Ellis, L., Jarnagin, K., Ederly, M., Graf, L., Clauser, E., Ou, J.-H., Masiar, F., Kan, Y.W., Goldfine, I.D., Roth, R.A., and Rutter, W.J. (1985) Cell 313, 747-758], or alpha-Pep6 (residues 1-7, 9) immunoprecipitated the human insulin receptor solubilized from IM-9 lymphocytes; however, alpha-Pep8 immunoprecipitated the dithiothreitol-reduced receptor. Antibodies prepared against the N terminus of the beta-subunit (alpha-Pep5, residues 780-790) and the ATP binding site (alpha-Pep3, residues 1013-1022) did not react with the intact receptor under any conditions; however, antibodies to the C terminus of the beta-subunit (alpha-Pep1, residues 1314-1324) and to the juxta-membrane region (alpha-Pep3, residues 952-962) immunoprecipitated the solubilized receptor in both its phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms. In contrast, the antibody reactive with the regulatory region of the beta-subunit which contains the major autophosphorylation sites (alpha-Pep2, residues 1143-1154) only precipitated the phosphorylated form. Thus the conformation of the extracellular domain of the receptor is rigid and stabilized by disulfide bonds, whereas several regions of the intracellular domain are accessible to antibodies and undergo conformational changes during autophosphorylation.
