The HIV-1 epidemic in Russia has been insufficiently studied, with only 11 complete genome sequences from this country currently available, only three of which are of the locally predominant genetic form, the former Soviet Union (FSU) subtype A variant (A(FSU)). Here we analyze 10 newly derived A(FSU) near full-length genome sequences from Russia. Samples were selected based on phylogenetic clustering in protease-reverse transcriptase in two of the major A(FSU) clusters, V77I(PR) (n=6), widely circulating in Russia and other FSU countries, and A(SP1) (n=4), predominant in St. Petersburg. The phylogenetic analysis shows that the V77I(PR) genomes group in a monophyletic cluster together with 10 previously obtained A(FSU) genome sequences from Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Cyprus, all bearing the V77I substitution in protease. Similarly, the four A(SP1) genomes group in a monophyletic cluster. These results therefore show that the monophyly of V77I(PR) and A(SP1) A(FSU) clusters is supported in near complete genomes.
