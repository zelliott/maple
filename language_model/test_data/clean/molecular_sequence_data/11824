Activation of the superoxide generating NADPH oxidase of phagocytes involves the assembly of a multimolecular complex and is dependent on the participation of the small molecular weight GTP-binding protein Rac (1 or 2). This model system was used for mapping functional domains in the primary sequence of Rac1, based on assessing the inhibitory effect of 90 individual overlapping pentadecapeptides, spanning the entire length of Rac1, on NADPH oxidase activation in two types of cell-free assay. Five functional domains were identified, each consisting of a cluster of contiguous residues shared by members of five groups of overlapping inhibitory peptides. Four of the five domains are exposed on the molecular surface of Rac1 and were not identified previously by mutational analysis; the fifth corresponds to a polybasic motif near the carboxyl terminus, confirming earlier reports. Screening the entire linear sequence of a protein with a battery of overlapping peptides for interference with its ability to interact with upstream or downstream molecules should be of wide applicability as a reliable, fast, and economical method for mapping of functionally relevant domains.
