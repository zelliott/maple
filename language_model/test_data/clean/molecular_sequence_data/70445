Molecular comparisons were carried out on two iridoviruses isolated from endemic sympatric New Zealand pasture pests. These viruses, Costelytra zealandica iridescent virus (CzIV/IV16) and Wiseana iridescent virus (WIV/IV9), belong to the same virus genus but it is not known how related they are. The major capsid protein (MCP) gene from each virus was located, sequenced, and compared to the homologous gene from other iridoviruses. The MCP genes of WIV and CzIV were similar to each other (87.9% amino acid similarity) and to other iridovirus MCP genes. The MCP genes of both WIV and CzIV were most homologous to the MCP gene from Tipula iridescent virus (TIV/IV1), with amino acid similarities of 92.3 and 88.3% respectively. The genomes of WIV and CzIV were compared to other invertebrate iridoviruses using solution DNA-DNA hybridisations. Even after reducing the annealing stringency conditions hybridisation ratios never exceeded 10% indicating there is little sequence conservation between iridovirus genomes. Estimates of the size of terminal redundancies were also calculated for these viruses using pulsed-field agarose gel electrophoresis. These values ranged from 0 to 8%. These studies indicate that WIV and CzIV have distinct genomes and that the genus Iridovirus is comprised of a group of genetically diverse viruses.
