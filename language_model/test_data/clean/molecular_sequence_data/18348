The nucleotide sequence of an insertion element in R-factor R1767 derivative pBP11 was determined. It is almost overall identical with IS15 delta, IS26 and IS46. Like IS46 it flanks one end of the sul-bla determinant and is involved in amplification of the resistance cassette. The significance for this process of a palindrome comprising part of IS15 delta IV is discussed.
