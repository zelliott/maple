The mechanisms regulating IL-4 mRNA stability in differentiated T cells are not known. We found that early exposure of CD4+ T cells to endogenous IL-4 increased IL-4 mRNA stability. This effect of IL-4 was mediated by the RNA-binding protein HuR. IL-4 mRNA interacted with HuR and the dominant binding site was shown within the coding region of IL-4 mRNA. Exposure of CD4+ T cells to IL-4 had no effects on HuR expression or subcellular localization, but triggered HuR binding to IL-4 mRNA. Thus, IL-4 plays a positive role in maintaining IL-4 mRNA stability in CD4+ T cells via a HuR-mediated mechanism.
