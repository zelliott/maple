We have shown that the insulin-like growth factor type I and II receptors are expressed equally from the maternal and paternal alleles in human tissues. The imprinting status of the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor has not been reported while the type II receptor has previously been shown to be maternally expressed in the mouse. That the imprinting of the insulin-like growth factor type II receptor is not conserved between mouse and humans suggests that the physiological role of the IGF2 receptor may differ between these two species.
