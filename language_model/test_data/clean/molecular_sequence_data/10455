Two nrdF genes, nrdF1 and nrdF2, encoding the small subunit (R2) of ribonucleotide reductase (RR) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis have 71% identity at the amino acid level and are both highly homologous with Salmonella typhimurium R2F. The calculated molecular masses of R2-1 and R2-2 are 36,588 (322 amino acids [aa]) and 36,957 (324 aa) Da, respectively. Western blot analysis of crude M. tuberculosis extracts indicates that both R2s are expressed in vivo. Recombinant R2-2 is enzymatically active when assayed with pure recombinant M. tuberculosis R1 subunit. Both ATP and dATP are activators for CDP reduction up to 2 and 1 mM, respectively. The gene encoding M. tuberculosis R2-1, nrdF1, is not linked to nrdF2, nor is either gene linked to the gene encoding the large subunit, M. tuberculosis nrdE. The gene encoding MTP64 was found downstream from nrdF1, and the gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase was found downstream from nrdF2. A nrdA(Ts) strain of E. coli (E101) could be complemented by simultaneous transformation with M. tuberculosis nrdE and nrdF2. An M. tuberculosis nrdF2 variant in which the codon for the catalytically necessary tyrosine was replaced by the phenylalanine codon did not complement E101 when cotransformed with M. tuberculosis nrdE. Similarly, M. tuberculosis nrdF1 and nrdE did not complement E101. Activity of recombinant M. tuberculosis RR was inhibited by incubating the enzyme with a peptide corresponding to the 7 C-terminal amino acid residues of the R2-2 subunit. M. tuberculosis is a species in which a nrdEF system appears to encode the biologically active species of RR and also the only bacterial species identified so far in which class I RR subunits are not arranged on an operon.
