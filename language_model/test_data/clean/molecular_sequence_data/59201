A cDNA clone encoding the germ cell nuclear factor, GCNF, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily has been isolated from the human embryonal carcinoma cell line NT2/D1. Sequencing of this clone reveals an open reading frame encoding a 476 amino acid protein. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of the human GCNF with its mouse homologue shows only six amino acid exchanges in the whole protein and a deletion in the amino-terminal region. Northern blot analysis demonstrates that the expression in the testis is conserved.
