A series of peptidyl alpha-ketobenzoxazoles were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro and in vivo inhibition of human neutrophil elastase (HNE). These compounds inhibit HNE by forming both a covalent bond between the ketone carbonyl carbon atom and the hydroxyl group of Ser-195 and a hydrogen bond between the benzoxazole nitrogen atom and His-57. Appending to the parent benzoxazole ring a variety of substituents which spanned a range of physicochemical properties had only a modest effect on in vitro potency (Ki = 3-0.4 nM). This apparent lack of a significant effect is believed to result from the fact that any increased ketone carbonyl activation by the ring substituent is counter balanced by a corresponding decrease in the hydrogen-bonding ability of the benzoxazole nitrogen atom. In contrast to the results in vitro, maximizing in vivo activity was critically dependent upon the choice of the benzoxazole ring substituent. Several substituted peptidyl alpha-ketobenzoxazoles effectively inhibited HNE-induced lung injury when administered intratracheally 24 h prior to the enzyme.
