A butane-utilizing bacterial strain CF8 was isolated and identified as a member of the genus Nocardioides from chemotaxonomic and 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Strain CF8 grew on alkanes ranging from C(2) to C(16) in addition to butane and various other substrates including primary alcohols, carboxylic acids, and phenol. Butane degradation by strain CF8 was inactivated by light, a specific inactivator of copper-containing monooxygenases. The unique thermal aggregation phenomenon of acetylene-binding polypeptides was also observed for strain CF8. These results suggest that butane monooxygenase in strain CF8 is a third example of the copper-containing monooxygenases previously described in ammonia oxidizers and methanotrophs.
