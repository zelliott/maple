This study analyzed the genetic characterization on first imported measles virus of genotype D8 in Chinese mainland. Serums were collected from the suspicious MV patients to detect IgM antibody in ELISA. Throat swabs were cultured in Vero/SLAM cell line to get measles virus isolates. Part of the nucleotide sequence of the 3' terminus of nucleoprotein (N) gene of these isolates were amplified by RT-PCR, and the amplicons were directly sequenced. The phylogenetic analysis was based on the nucleotide sequence about 456 base pairs of the 3' terminus of nucleoprotein (N) gene. Results showed that it reported 1 105 suspicious measles cases in shanghai, 2012, including 590 confirmed cases and 2 clinical case. The reported morbidity was 2.52 per one hundred thousand. 247 measles viruses were isolated from 984 throat swabs specimen. Most of them belonged to sub-genotype H1a except Shanghai12-239 was genotype D8. The homology of nucleotide and amino acid sequences were 97.8% and 98.6% respectively between Shanghai12-239 and WHO reference strain (Manchester. UNK30.94(D8)AF280803). Those were 89.6%-94.5% and 88.7%-95.3% between Shanghai12-239 and WHO reference strains of other genotypes.
