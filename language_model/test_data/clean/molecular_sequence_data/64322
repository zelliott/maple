The taxonomic positions of Weissella kimchii and Weissella cibaria were examined using phenotypic tests, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and DNA-DNA hybridization. The two species displayed very similar sugar-fermentation patterns and produced the D-form of lactic acid. Phylogenetic analysis showed that W. cibaria is the closest neighbour of W. kimchii, sharing about 99.7 % similarity in the 16S rRNA gene sequence. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments further reinforced these results, demonstrating a 98.2 % reassociation level between W. cibaria LMG 17699(T) and W. kimchii DSM 14295(T). On the other hand, strain RO5, an isolate from paddy rice silage, exhibited 99.4 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and a DNA reassociation level of more than 97 % with both type strains. Therefore, it is proposed that the species W. kimchii should be reclassified as W. cibaria.
