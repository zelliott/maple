We present the cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding the chicken CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein alpha (cC/EBP alpha). The coding region and 1.5 kb of 5' flanking DNA from a CpG island. Comparison of the chicken C/EBP alpha sequence to the homologous proteins of other species reveals several evolutionary conserved regions. cC/EBP alpha mRNA expression is restricted to a subset of tissues with high expression in liver, lung and small intestine. Recombinant cC/EBP alpha binds to its cognate C/EBP binding site as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with the related cC/EBP beta/NF-M.
