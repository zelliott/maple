A novel approach for the synthesis of double-stranded DNA fragments from only one long oligodeoxynucleotide (oligo) is presented. The basic strategy is to use oligos which possess a short inverted repeat at their 3' end resulting in the formation of a hairpin structure. The 3' end of this hairpin then serves as a primer in the Klenow (large) fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I-mediated synthesis of the second DNA strand. Removal of the loop structure as well as generation of sticky ends for subsequent cloning is achieved by digestion with restriction enzymes. Several oligos ranging in size from 130 to 147 nt were synthesized and successfully used in the cloning of gene fragments of up to 120 bp in length. Furthermore, a strategy for the simultaneous cloning of two synthetic DNA fragments is outlined yielding even larger gene fragments. By sequential cloning of these gene fragments the methodology presented here will allow the synthesis of genes of any size. The proposed methodology should also be useful for site-directed mutagenesis as well as saturation mutagenesis.
