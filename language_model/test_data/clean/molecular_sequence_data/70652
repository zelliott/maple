Human and mouse UCP2 genes were cloned and sequenced. Transcriptional start sites were identified using primer extension analysis. The transcription unit of UCP2 gene is made of 2 untranslated exons followed by 6 exons encoding UCP2. In vitro translation analysis demonstrated that an open-reading-frame for a putative peptide of 36 residues present in exon 2 did not prevent UCP2 translation and confirmed that the initiation site of translation was in exon 3 as predicted from sequencing data. Short (bp -125 to +93) and long (bp -1383 and +93) CAT-constructs containing DNA upstream of the transcriptional start site of the human gene were made and transfected in adipocytes or HeLa cells allowing characterization of a potent promoter. Analysis of several genomic clones encompassing UCP2 and/or UCP3 genes demonstrated that the 2 genes are adjacent, the human UCP2 gene being located 7 kb downstream of the UCP3 gene.
