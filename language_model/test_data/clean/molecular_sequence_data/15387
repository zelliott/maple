Moniliophthora perniciosa (Sthael) (Singer) Phillips-Mora is the causal agent of witches' broom disease, which can infect Theobroma cacao decreasing the production of cocoa about 60%. M. perniciosa has a set of potential enzymes that can be useful targets for design of new inhibitors. After the release of the aminoacid sequence of pyrophosphorylase of M. perniciosa, a comparative modelling approach was carried out to obtain the 3D structure of this target. This model can be useful to develop new inhibitors against witches' broom disease.
