Two groups of strains isolated from sows were shown to belong to new sublines in the genus Streptococcus. Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic analyses, we propose that these bacteria should be classified as two new species, Streptococcus hyovaginalis sp. nov. and Streptococcus thoraltensis sp. nov. These two species are found in the genital tract, but the capnophilic species S. thoraltensis may also occur in the intestinal tract of pigs. The type strain of S. hyovaginalis is SHV515 (= LMG 14710), and S69 (= LMG 13593) is the type strain of S. thoraltensis.
