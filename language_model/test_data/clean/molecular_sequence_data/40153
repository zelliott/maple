The cannabinoid receptor subtype 2 (CB2) is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. As the relationship between structure and function for this receptor remains poorly understood, the present study was undertaken to characterize the structure of a segment including the first and second transmembrane helix (TM1 and TM2) domains of CB2. To accomplish this, a transmembrane double-helix bundle from this region was expressed, purified, and characterized by NMR. Milligrams of this hydrophobic fragment of the receptor were biosynthesized using a fusion protein overexpression strategy and purified by affinity chromatography combined with reverse phase HPLC. Chemical and enzymatic cleavage methods were implemented to remove the fusion tag. The resultant recombinant protein samples were analyzed and confirmed by HPLC, mass spectrometry, and circular dichroism (CD). The CD analyses of HPLC-purified protein in solution and in DPC micelle preparations suggested predominant alpha-helical structures under both conditions. The 13C/15N double-labeled protein CB2(27-101) was further verified and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Sequential assignment was accomplished for more than 80% of residues. The 15N HSQC NMR results show a clear chemical shift dispersion of the amide nitrogen-proton correlation indicative of a pure double-labeled polypeptide molecule. The results suggest that this method is capable of generating transmembrane helical bundles from GPCRs in quantity and purity sufficient for NMR and other biophysical studies. Therefore, the biosynthesis of GPCR transmembrane helix bundles represents a satisfactory alternative strategy to obtain and assemble NMR structures from recombinant "building blocks."
