In silico analysis of the DNA encoding single-chain Fv antibodies (ScFv) specific to the human recombinant interferon beta1b and alpha2b (rhIFN-beta1b, rhIFN-alpha2b) has been carried out. The V-, D- and J-gene segments, the complementarity-determining (CDR) and framework (FR) regions, n-nucleotides as well as mutation rates which take place during the affinity maturation of the examined sequences have been determined. For the panel of ScFv against rhIFN-alpha1b isolated from an immune combinatorial cDNA library uniqueness of the CDRH3 loop by the length and amino acid composition has been shown. Multiple alignments with the nearest homologies from the NCBI databases have revealed that the sequences of ScFv obtained are new.
