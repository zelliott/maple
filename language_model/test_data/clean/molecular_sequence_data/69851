The ability to routinely and specifically amplify and detect PCR products ranging in size from < 1 to > 10 kb, regardless of target template sequence or structure, would facilitate several tasks in human genome research. Generation of a wide size range of PCR products would potentially expedite isolation of uncloned DNA (gaps) represented in physical maps and provide a means for maintaining order and orientation of closely linked loci during analysis. Long-range PCR offers an alternative to isolation of genomic or cDNA clones from tissues or species where appropriate libraries are unavailable. This methodology also provides a powerful strategy to pursue directed transposon-based mapping and sequencing of templates of 100 kb or greater. Further development of basic PCR technology has been necessary in order to make it feasible to use large DNA targets as primary templates for genome analysis. Application of these extended PCR capacities would potentially save time, materials, and cost.
