Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted antigen presentation normally requires a protein antigen to be synthesized in the cytosol of the antigen presenting cell (APC). Exogenous protein antigen could gain access to the class I presentation pathway if the protein is introduced into the cytosolic compartment of the APC. Approaches which release the protein antigen from endocytic vesicles have been employed to deliver protein antigen for the recognition by class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). These include osmotic shock, electroporation, cationic and pH-sensitive liposomes. An alternative approach is to deliver a gene that encodes the protein antigen. In this case, the APC is transfected with a gene which synthesizes the "exogenous protein" in the cytosol. Delivery of protein antigen targeted for CTL induction in vivo follows a different strategy and generally requires an antigen carrier of lipidic/membranous nature, such as liposomes, immunostimulating complexes, and/or lipid conjugates. Macrophages that are responsible for scavenging the antigen play an important role in CTL induction. An optimal CTL inductive vaccine must contain other immuno-modulatory activities in addition to its activity in delivering antigen to the class I pathway. Attempts to attenuate viral infection and to improve anti-tumor immunity have been successful by delivering the exogenous antigen entrapped in liposomes. These animal model studies should be of great value in the development of potential vaccine formulation.
