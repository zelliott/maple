The murine neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is known to exist in three isoforms of different size, NCAM-180, -140 and -120 coded for by four transcripts of 6.9, 6.1, 4.8 and 2.7 kb in length. Since the differences between these isoforms are due to alternative splicing in the coding region for the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, the extracellular, N-terminal portion of NCAM seemed to be shared by all three protein forms. Here we report that the coding region for N-terminal domains of NCAM also contains at least two sites of alternative splicing, termed alpha and pi. Short additional sequences of 3, 18 and 30 nt in length can be introduced at these sites, which are located in the membrane-proximal 'stem' between the Ig-like domains and the membrane attachment site and within the Ig-like domain IV, respectively. Proof for at least eight different mRNAs has been found by sequencing and S1 nuclease protection assays of selected independent cDNA clones, and Northern blot analyses. If most combination of the splice patterns identified so far in mouse brain occurred, 24 different mRNAs could be generated coding for 18 different proteins. The shortest extra-sequence found inserted at splice site alpha consisted only of the trinucleotide AAG, raising questions about the mechanism of this particular insertion.
