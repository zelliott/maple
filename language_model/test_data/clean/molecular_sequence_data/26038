The nucleotide sequence of a small (1613 bp) plasmid, pOX2000, isolated from a methicillin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus has been determined. The sequence contains only one large ORF and the predicted amino acid sequence shows homology to the REP proteins of some other small staphylococcal plasmids. In addition there are two palindromic sequences, palA and palJ, that are similar to but not identical with the palindromes known from other staphylococcal plasmids to be involved in lagging strand initiation and possibly leading strand termination, respectively. Preliminary functional analysis of pOX2000 has been carried out by assessing the effect of interrupting the sequence at three unique restriction endonuclease sites. The plasmid pOX2000, and its relationship to other small staphylococcal plasmids, is discussed.
