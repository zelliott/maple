Study of the antigenic structure of the Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) envelope glycoprotein gp51 with a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) has allowed the identification of biologically important determinants directly involved in the infectivity of BLV. Considering the various facts reported in this paper, it follows that diagnostic and vaccination procedures that make use of gp51 in a native configuration constitute a prerequisite for the design of an efficient BLV eradication program. To improve the efficacy of a serological detection test, MAbs have been selected as reagents of choice to develop a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA). Recombinant vaccinia virus expressing gp51 and gp30 was indicated as a very promising protective vaccine against BLV infection.
