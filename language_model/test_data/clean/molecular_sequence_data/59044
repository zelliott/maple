LIM-kinase 1 (LIMK1) and 2 (LIMK2) are members of a novel class of protein kinases containing two LIM motifs at the N-terminus. The LIM motif is thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions. We report here evidence that LIMK1 self-associates and also associates with LIMK2. In vivo and in vitro binding analyses using variously deleted mutants of LIMKI revealed that the self-association of LIMK1 was caused by interaction between the N-terminal LIM domain and the C-terminal kinase domain. The association of LIMK1 with itself and with LIMK2 is important for understanding how activities and functions of LIMK family kinases are regulated.
