Discoidin I expression was used as a marker to screen for mutants affected in the growth-differentiation transition (GDT) of Dictyostelium. By REMI mutagenesis we have isolated mutant 2-9, an overexpressor of discoidin I. It displays normal morphogenesis but shows premature entry into the developmental cycle. The disrupted gene was denominated gdt1. The mutant phenotype was reconstructed by disruptions in different parts of the gene, suggesting that all had a complete loss of function. gdt1 was expressed in growing cells; the levels of protein and mRNA appear to increase with cell density and rapidly decrease with the onset of development. gdt1 encodes a 175-kDa protein with four putative transmembrane domains. In the C terminus, the derived amino acid sequence displays some similarity to the catalytic domain of protein kinases. Mixing experiments demonstrate that the gdt1(-) phenotype is cell autonomous. Prestarvation factor is secreted at wild-type levels. The response to folate, a negative regulator of discoidin expression, was not impaired in gdt1 mutants. Cells that lack the G protein alpha2 display a loss of discoidin expression and do not aggregate. gdt1(-)/Galpha2(-) double mutants show no aggregation but strong discoidin expression. This suggests that gdt1 is a negative regulator of the GDT downstream of or in a parallel pathway to Galpha2.
