The distribution of Vibrio cholerae O1 pili consisting of 16 kDa subunit protein (16K-pili) was examined by Western blotting, using 211 strains from various origins and specific anti-16K-pili sera. The 16 kDa protein was detected in all 211 strains. The pili were purified from 3 El Tor and 3 classical strains, and characterized by hemagglutination and inhibition tests. All purified pili were hemagglutinative. However, the hemagglutinating activity of classical pili disappeared after exposure to 5 M urea and the agglutination induced by the classical pili was inhibited by D-mannose, alpha-methylmannoside, D-glucose and N-acetylglucosamine. On the contrary, El Tor pili were resistant to these sugars and urea.
