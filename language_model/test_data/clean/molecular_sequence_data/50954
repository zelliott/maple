We report a unique application of the Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique for genetic linkage mapping of a single spruce tree using haploid DNA from megagametophyte tissue of individual seeds. Sixty-one segregating loci were analysed for reproducibility, inheritance and linkage. Forty-seven of the 61 markers were distributed into 12 linkage groups and covered 873.8 cM. The 14 markers not associated with any linkage group should be assigned to linkage groups as more markers are added to the map. This new approach quickly provides molecular genetic markers that are simple to evaluate for constructing genetic linkage maps and for other related genetic studies in forest tree species.
