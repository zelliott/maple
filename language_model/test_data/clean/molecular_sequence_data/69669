Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare X-linked disorder exhibiting renal resistance to the antidiuretic action of arginine vasopressin (AVP). Recent elucidation of the vasopressin V2 (renal type) receptor gene structure has enabled us to test the hypothesis that the genetic defect in the V2 receptor is the likely molecular basis of NDI. By using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-direct sequencing, we identified novel V2 receptor gene mutations in two unrelated Japanese kindreds with NDI. In the male patients of kindred A, a single codon deletion in one of two consecutive GTC triplets (nucleotide 832 to 837) was detected. This base change resulted in the loss of a valine residue in the 6th transmembrane domain. In the affected males of kindred B, a G to C substitution was found at nucleotide 428, altering codon 143 from arginine (CGT) to proline (CCT) in the second cytoplasmic domain. PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of family members demonstrated that the mutations cosegregated with clinically affected individuals and were absent in normal subjects. Our results suggest that different V2 receptor defects could be responsible for AVP resistance in individual NDI kindreds.
