The integrins are a large family of cell adhesion molecules consisting of noncovalently associated alphabeta heterodimers. We have cloned and sequenced the cDNA of a novel human integrin alpha-subunit, designated alpha11. The alpha11 cDNA encodes a mature protein with a large 1120-residue extracellular domain that contains an I-domain of 207 residues and is linked by a transmembrane domain to a short cytoplasmic domain of 24 amino acids. The deduced alpha11 protein shows the typical structural features of integrin alpha-subunits and is similar to a distinct group of alpha-subunits from collagen-binding integrins. However, it differs from most integrin alpha-chains by an incompletely preserved cytoplasmic GFFKR motif. The human ITGA11 gene was localized to bands q22.3-q23 on chromosome 15, and its transcripts were found in a variety of tissues, but predominantly in bone, cartilage, cardiac muscle, and skeletal muscle. Expression of a 5.5-kb alpha11 mRNA was detectable in small intestine.
