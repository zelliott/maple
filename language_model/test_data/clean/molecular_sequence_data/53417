SOX proteins belong to a multigenic family characterized by a unique DNA binding domain, known as the high mobility group box, that is related to that of the testis determining gene SRY. cDNA sequences for more than 30 SOX genes have been identified, and some are known to have diverse roles in vertebrate differentiation and development. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of mouse Sox15 that was uncovered during a screen for high mobility group box containing transcription factors that are expressed at different levels during skeletal muscle differentiation. Sox15 cDNAs were found at a much higher frequency in myoblasts prior to their differentiation into myotubes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that recombinant SOX15 protein was capable of binding to a consensus DNA binding site for SOX proteins. When overexpressed in C2C12 myoblasts, wild type SOX15, but not a C-terminal truncated form or the related protein SOX11, specifically inhibited activation of muscle-specific genes and expression of the basic helix-loop-helix myogenic factors myogenin and MyoD, resulting in a failure of the cells to differentiate into myotubes. These results suggest a specific and repressive role for SOX15, requiring the C-terminal domain, during myogenesis.
