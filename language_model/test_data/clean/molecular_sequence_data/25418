Folding of the yeast mitochondrial group II intron aI5c has been analysed by chemical modification of the in vitro synthesised RNA with dimethylsulfate and diethylpyrocarbonate. Computer calculations of the intron secondary structure through minimization of free energy were also performed in order to study thermodynamic properties of the intron and to relate these to data obtained from chemical modification. Comparison of the two sets of data with the current phylogenetic model structure of the intron aI5 reveals close agreement, thus lending strong support for the existence of a typical group II intron core structure comprising six neighbouring stem-loop domains. Local discrepancies between the experimental data and the model structures have been analyzed by reference to thermodynamic properties of the structure. This shows that use of the latest refined set of free energy values improves the structure calculation significantly.
