Forty-three bisammonium ganglionic blockers were synthesized to study the structure of the ion channel of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The conformational parameters of these blockers were studied, and their effects toward the ganglionic transmission in situ on the sympathetic feline upper cervical ganglions and in vitro on the parasympathetic guinea-pig small intestine ganglions were determined. A model of the binding site for the bisammonium ganglionic blockers in the neuronal ion channel was proposed.
