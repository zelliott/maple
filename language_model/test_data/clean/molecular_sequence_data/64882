4'-O-Glycosylation of 2-azidoethyl 2,3,6-tri-O-benzyl-4-O-(2,3-di-O- benzyl-6-O-benzoyl-beta-D-galactopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside with a disaccharide donor, 4-trichloroacetamidophenyl 4,6-di-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-3-O-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D- galactopyranosyl)-1-thio-2-trichloroacetamido-beta-D-galactopyranoside, in dichloromethane in the presence of N-iodosuccinimide and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid resulted in a tetrasaccharide, 2-azidoethyl (2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-galactopyranosyl)-(1-->3)- (4,6-di-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-2-trichloroacetamido-beta-D-galactopyranosyl)- (1-->4)-(2,3-di-O-benzyl-6-O-benzoyl-beta-D-galactopyranosyl)- (1-->4)-2,3,6-tri-O-benzyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside, in 69% yield. The complete removal of O-protecting groups in the tetrasaccharide, the replacement of N-trichloroacetyl by N-acetyl group, and the reduction of the aglycone azide group to amine led to the target aminoethyl glycoside of beta-D-Gal- (1-->3)-beta-D-GalNAc-(1-->4)-beta-D-Gal-(1-->4)-beta-D-Glc-OCH2CH2NH2 containing the oligosaccharide chain of asialo-GM1 ganglioside in 72% overall yield. Selective 3'-O-glycosylation of 2-azidoethyl 2,3,6-tri-O- benzyl-4-O-(2,6-di-O-benzyl-beta-D-galactopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside with thioglycoside methyl (ethyl 5-acetamido-4,7,8,9-tetra-O- acetyl-3,5-dideoxy-2-thio-D-glycero-alpha-D-galacto-2-nonulopyranosyl)oate in acetonitrile in the presence of N-iodosuccinimide and trifluoroacetic acid afforded 2-azidoethyl [methyl (5-acetamido-4,7,8,9-tetra-O-acetyl- 3,5-dideoxy-D-glycero-alpha-D-galacto-2-nonulopyranosyl)oate in acetonitrile in the presence of N-iodosuccinimide and tri-fluoracetic acid afforded 2-azidoethyl[methyl (5-acetamido-4,7,8,9-tetra-O-acetyl- 3,5-dideoxy-D-glycero-alpha-D-galacto-2-nonulopyranosyl) (2,6-di-O-benzyl-beta-D-galactopyranosyl)-(1-->4)-2,3,6-tri-O-benzyl-beta-D- glucopyranoside, the selectively protected derivative of the oligosaccharide chain of GM3 ganglioside, in 79% yield. Its 4'-O-glycosylation with a disaccharide glycosyl donor, (4-trichloroacetophenyl-4,6-di-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-3-O-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O- acetyl-beta-D-galactopyranosyl) 1-thio-2-trichloroacetamido-beta-D-galactopyranoside in dichloromethane in the presence of N-iodosuccinimide and trifluoroacetic acid gave 2-azidoethyl (2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-galactopyranosyl)- (1-->3)-(4,6-di-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-2-trichloroacetamido-beta-D- galactopyranosyl)-(1-->4)-[[methyl (5-acetamido-4,7,8,9-tetra-O-acetyl-3,5-dideoxy-D-glycero-alpha-D- galacto-2-nonulopyranosyl)onate]-(2-->3)]-(2,6-di-O-benzyl-beta-D- galactopyranosyl)-(1-->4)-2,3,6-tri-O-benzyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside in 85% yield. The resulting pentasaccharide was O-deprotected, its N-trichloroacetyl group was replaced by N-acetyl group, and the aglycone azide group was reduced to afford in 85% overall yield aminoethyl glycoside of beta-D-Gal-(1-->3)-beta-D-GalNAc-(1-->4)-[alpha-D-Neu5Ac-(2-->3)]- beta-D-Gal-(1-->4)-beta-D-Glc-OCH2CH2NH2 containing the oligosaccharide chain of GM1 ganglioside.
