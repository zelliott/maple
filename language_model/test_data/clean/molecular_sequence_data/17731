Antihypertensive compounds were purified from an extract of autologous Lactobacillus casei cell lysates. The most effective compounds were polysaccharide-glycopeptide complexes, found in the cell wall. The average molecular weight was estimated as 180,000 from gel filtration using Sephacryl S-300. The polysaccharide moiety of the complexes consisted of glucose, rhamnose, and galactose, whereas the glycopeptide moiety consisted of N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylmuramic acid, asparagine, glutamine, alanine, and lysine. The varieties of the components of these moieties were constant and independent of complex molecular size. When these complexes were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and renal hypertensive rats (RHR) at doses of 1 mg/kg-body weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased by 10-20 mmHg 6 to 12 hr after administration without any change in heart rate. Appreciable hypotensive activity was lost by treating the complexes with hydrofluoric acid, which hydrolytically cleaves the phosphodiester bond between the polysaccharide and glycopeptide moiety.
