We determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial (mt) genome for the longtooth grouper, Epinephelus bruneus (Perciformes, Serranidae). This mt genome, consisting of 16,686 base pairs (bp), encoded genes for 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNAs, 22 transfer RNAs, and a noncoding control region as those found in other vertebrates, with the gene order identical to that of typical vertebrates. A major noncoding region between the trnP and trnF genes (991 bp) was considered to be the control region (D-loop). Within this sequence, 22 copies of a 17-bp tandem repeat element, 5'-TGATATTACATATATGC-3', were identified in the control region unlike previous reported Epinephelus species.
