Surface expression of the CD45 tyrosine phosphatase is essential for the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) to couple optimally with its second messenger pathways. CD45 may be required to dephosphorylate a TCR-activated protein tyrosine kinase, which then transduces an activation signal from the TCR. A chimeric molecule that contained extracellular and transmembrane sequences from an allele of a major histocompatibility class I molecule and cytoplasmic sequences of CD45 restored TCR signaling in a CD45-deficient mutant T cell line. Thus, expression of the complex extracellular domain of CD45 is not required for the TCR to couple to its signaling machinery.
