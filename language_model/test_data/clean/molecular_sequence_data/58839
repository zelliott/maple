To elucidate the funciton of the mouse TL antigen in the thymus, we have derived two TL transgenic mouse strains by introducing Tl alpha 2-3 of A strain origin with its own promoter onto a C3H background with no expression of TL in the thymus. These transgenic mouse strains, both of which express high levels of Tla2-3-TL antigen in their thymus, were analyzed for their T cell function with emphasis on cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) generation. A T cell response against TL was induced in Tg. Tla2-3-1, Tg. Tla2-3-2, and control C3H mice by skin grafts from H-2Kb/T3b transgenic mice, Tg.Con.3-1, expressing T3b-TL ubiquitously. Spleen cells from mice that had rejected the T3b-TL positive skin grafts were restimulated in vitro with Tg. Con.3-1 irradiated spleen cells. In mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC), approximately 20% and 15% of Thy-1+ T cells derived from Tg.Tla2-3-1 and Tg.Tla2-3-2, respectively, expressed TCR gamma delta, whereas almost all those from C3H expressed TCR alpha beta. The MLC from Tg. Tla2-3-2 and C3H demonstrated high CTL activity against TL, while those from Tg. Tla2-3-1 had little or none. The generation of gamma delta CTL recognizing TL in Tg. Tla2-3-2, but not C3H mice, was confirmed by the establishment of CTL clones. A total of 14 gamma delta CTL clones were established from Tg. Tla2-3-2, whereas none were obtained from C3H. Of the 14 gamma delta CTL clones, 8 were CD8+ and 6 were CD4-CD8- double negative. The CTL activity of all these clones was TL specific and inhibited by anti-TL, but not by anti-H-2 antibodies, demonstrating that they recognize TL directly without antigen presentation by H-2. The CTL activity was blocked by antibodies to TCR gamma delta and CD3, and also by antibodies to CD 8 alpha and CD8 beta in CD8+ clones, showing that the activity was mediated by TCR gamma delta and coreceptors. The thymic origin of these gamma delta CTL clones was indicated by the expression of Thy-1 and Ly-1 (CD5), and also CD8 alpha beta heterodimers in CD8+ clones on their surfaces and by the usage of TCR V gamma 4 chains in 12 of the 14 clones. Taken together, these results suggest that Tla2-3-TL antigen expressed in the thymus engages in positive selection of a sizable population of gamma delta T cells.
