We have isolated the gene encoding a glutaredoxin in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and determined the nucleotide (nt) sequence of about a 4.2 kb long. The cloned gene (gRASC8) was found to contain four exons interrupted by three introns. The first exon begins the ATG translation start codon and the four exons code for a protein composed of 112 amino acids. The tetrapeptide -Cys-Pro-Phe-Cys- [-Cys-Pro-Phe(Tyr)-Cys-] which constitutes an active site of Escherichia coli and mammalian glutaredoxins, was conserved. The nt sequence contained consensus TATA and CAAT boxes, and two polyadenylation signals. Southern blot analysis of rice genomic DNA suggests that there are two copies of the glutaredoxin genes in rice.
