It is widely assumed that the functional activity of signal sequences has been conserved throughout evolution, at least between Gram-negative bacteria and eukaryotes. The ovalbumin family of serine protease inhibitors (serpins) provides a unique tool to test this assumption, since individual members can be secreted (ovalbumin), cytosolic (leukocyte elastase inhibitor, LEI), or targeted to both compartments (plasminogen activator inhibitor 2, PAI-2). The facultative secretion of PAI-2 is mediated by a signal sequence proposed to be inefficient by design. We show here that the same internal domain that promotes an inefficient translocation of murine PAI-2 in mammalian cells is a weak signal sequence in Escherichia coli. In contrast, the ovalbumin signal sequence is much more efficient, whereas the corresponding sequence elements from LEI, maspin and PI-10 are entirely devoid of signal sequence activity in E.coli. Mutations that improve the activity of the PAI-2 signal sequence and that convert the N-terminal regions of maspin and PI-10 into efficient signal sequences have been characterized. Taken together, these results indicate that several structural features contribute to the weak activity of the PAI-2 signal sequence and provide new insights into the plasticity of the "hydrophobic core" of signal sequences. High-level expression of two chimeric proteins containing the PAI-2 signal sequence is toxic, and the reduced viability is accompanied by a rapid decrease in the membrane proton motive force, in ATP levels and in translation. In unc- cells, which lack the F0F1 ATP-synthase, the chimeric proteins retain their toxicity and their expression only affected the proton motive force. Thus, the properties of these toxic signal sequences offer a new tool to dissect the interactions of signal sequences with the protein export machinery.
