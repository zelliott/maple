Between 2003 and 2005, four strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were isolated from the vaccinated chicken flocks in China. The results from chicken embryo cross-neutralization assays showed that all the four isolates were relative to strain A2 of IBV, which was isolated in 1996 in Beijing and related to strain 4/91. The S1 gene of the spike protein was amplified and sequenced. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the S1 gene had a similar degree of identity (88.98-99.28%) among the four Chinese IBV isolates. The identity of the S1 protein gene between the four Chinese IBV isolates and 14 strains of other IBVs varied from 70.06 to 81.59%. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that there are at least four groups of IBVs circulating in China and the disease outbreaks might have been caused by infection of multiple strains of IBV.
