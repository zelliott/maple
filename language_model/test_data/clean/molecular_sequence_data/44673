The gene encoding the high potential iron-sulfur protein (HiPIP) of Chromatium vinosum strain D (DSM 180T) was cloned from an EcoRI-HindIII digest of genomic DNA. A nucleotide sequence of 648 bp length was determined which contained the coding region and putative promoter and termination sites. The gene codes for a 122 residue 12761 Da protein. The C-terminal 85 residues are those of the previously biochemically determined sequence, whereas the N-terminal 37 residues constitute a leader peptide which shows characteristics of the double arginine signal sequences of complex cofactor containing periplasmic proteins.
