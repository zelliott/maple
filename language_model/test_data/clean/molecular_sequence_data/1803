The O-polysaccharide was isolated from the lipopolysaccharide of the plant-growth-promoting bacterium Azospirillum irakense KBC1 and studied by sugar and methylation analyses, Smith degradation and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, including 1H, 13C HSQC and NOESY experiments for linkage and sequence analysis. The following structure of the branched hexasaccharide repeating unit of the O-polysaccharide with an unusually long side chain was established: [carbohydrate structure: see text].
