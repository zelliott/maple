Three cDNAs coding for monkey cytochrome P-450 (P450) 2C, 2E and 3A (MKmp13, MKj1 and MKnf2, respectively) were isolated from a lambda gt11 cDNA library of a liver from a 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC)-treated crab-eating monkey, using cDNA fragments for human P450 2C, 2E and 3A as respective probes. MKmp13 and MKnf2 were 1901 and 2032 bp long, containing entire coding regions for polypeptides of 490 and 503 residues, respectively. The deduced N-terminal amino acid sequences of MKmp13 and MKnf2 were identical with those of P450-MK1 and P450-MK2, which had been purified from liver microsomes of untreated and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-treated crab-eating monkeys, respectively. MKj1 was 1508 bp long, encoding a polypeptide of 449 residues, which is presumed to lack N-terminal 45 residues as compared with the sequence for human P450 2E1. Northern blot analysis indicated that monkey P450 2C, 2E and 3A mRNAs were expressed constitutively in monkey livers. P450 2E and 3A mRNAs were induced by both 3MC and PCB, while P450 2C mRNA was induced only by PCB. The deduced amino acid sequences of four monkey cytochrome P-450 cDNAs, including P450 1A1 (MKah1) which we isolated previously, were more than 92% identical with those of corresponding human cytochrome P-450 cDNAs.
