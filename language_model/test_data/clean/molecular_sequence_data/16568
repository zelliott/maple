A gene that confers resistance to the systemic fungicide flutolanil was isolated from a mutant strain of the basidiomycete Coprinus cinereus. The flutolanil resistance gene was mapped to a chromosome of approximately 3.2 Mb, and a chromosome-specific cosmid library was constructed. Two cosmid clones that were able to transform a wild-type, flutolanil-sensitive, strain of C. cinereus to resistance were isolated from the library. Analysis of a subclone containing the resistance gene revealed the presence of the sdhC gene, which encodes the cytochrome b560 subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex (Complex II) in the mitochondrial membrane. Comparison between the sdhC gene of a wild-type strain and that of a mutant strain revealed a single point mutation, which results in the replacement of Asn by Lys at position 80. Measurements of succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity in the transformants with mutant sdhC gene(s) suggest that flutolanil resistance of the fungus is caused by a decrease in the affinity of the SDH complex for flutolanil. This sdhC mutation also conferred cross-resistance against another systemic fungicide, carboxin, an anilide that is structurally related to flutolanil. In other organisms carboxin resistance mutations have been found in the genes sdhB and sdhD, but this is the first demonstration that a mutation in sdhC can also confer resistance. The mutant gene cloned in this work can be utilized as a dominant selectable marker in gene manipulation experiments in C. cinereus.
