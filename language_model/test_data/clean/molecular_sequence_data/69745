Thymine hydroxylase from Rhodotorula glutinis catalyzes the oxidation of thymine to its alcohol, aldehyde, and carboxylic acid in three successive reactions. Each step involves stoichiometric consumption of O2 and alpha-ketoglutarate and formation of CO2 and succinate. Given the promiscuity of this enzyme, it was hoped that it would serve as a prototype for understanding the mechanism of this class of enzymes, the non-heme Fe2+ dioxygenases. Kinetic parameters for thymine, O2, Fe2+, and alpha-ketoglutarate have been determined, and isotope effect analysis of (trideuteriomethyl)thymine with enzyme reveals D(V) = 2.08 and D(V/K) = 1.11 at saturating O2. The kinetic parameters for (hydroxymethyl)uracil oxidation have been determined, and incubation of (5'-R)- and (5'-S)-[5'-2H]-5-(hydroxymethyl)uracil with enzyme reveals stereospecific removal of the pro-S hydrogen. No apparent isotope effect is observed in this reaction. The substrate specificity of this enzyme has been examined in detail. The enzyme can catalyze epoxidation, oxidation of a thioether to a sulfoxide and a sulfone, hydroxylation of an unactivated carbon-hydrogen bond, and oxidation of a methylamine to formaldehyde, as revealed through studies with 5-vinyluracil, 5-(methylthio)uracil, 5,6-dihydrothymine, and 1-methylthymine, respectively. In each case, the products were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and 18O2-labeling studies revealed that one atom from O2 is incorporated into each product. The enzyme has also been shown to catalyze an uncoupling of hydroxylation and decarboxylation in the presence of a substrate analog incapable of undergoing hydroxylation or a substrate that is difficult to oxidize.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
