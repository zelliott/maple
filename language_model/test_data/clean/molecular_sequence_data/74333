Enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 and enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 in long-chain fatty acid oxidation were comparatively investigated through mechanistic studies for inactivation of the enzymes with methylenecyclopropylformyl-CoA and 3-octynoyl-CoA. Methylenecyclopropylformyl-CoA can inactivate both enzymes, while 3-octynoyl-CoA inactivates enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 only. The study increased our understanding of these two enzymes in fatty acid oxidation.
