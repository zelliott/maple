The retro-enantio analogue of peptide 66-77 of the chemokine MCP-1 and two hexapeptide fragments 66-71 and 72-77 of the C-terminal sequence of this protein were synthesized using the Fmoc strategy of solid phase peptide synthesis. The effect of the synthetic peptides upon the MCP-1-stimulated migration of THP-1 mononuclear cells was studied in vitro. The activity of the retro-enantio analogue was found to be comparable with that of the initial peptide 66-77: both peptides inhibit the migration of monocytes and granulocytes into inflammation zones of experimental animals.
