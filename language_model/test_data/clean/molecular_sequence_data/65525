The type IV pili of plasmid R64 belonging to the type IVB group are required only for liquid mating. They consist of the major and minor components PilS pilin and PilV adhesin, respectively. PilS pilin is first synthesized as a 22-kDa prepilin from the pilS gene and is then processed to a 19-kDa mature pilin by PilU prepilin peptidase. In a previous genetic analysis, we identified four classes of the pilS mutants (T. Horiuchi and T. Komano, J. Bacteriol. 180:4613-4620, 1998). The products of the class I pilS mutants were not processed by prepilin peptidase; the products of the class II mutants were not secreted; in the class III mutants type IV pili with reduced activities in liquid mating were produced; and in the class IV mutants type IV pili with normal activities were produced. Here, we describe a novel class, class V, of pilS mutants. Mutations in the pilS gene at Gly-56 or Tyr-57 produced type IV pili lacking PilV adhesin, which were inactive in liquid mating. Residues 56 and 57 of PilS pilin are suggested to function as an interface of PilS-PilV interactions.
