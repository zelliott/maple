Diapause hormone (DH) and pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) are encoded by a single mRNA in the suboesophegeal ganglion (SG) and are responsible for induction of embryonic diapause in Bombyx mori and sex pheromone biosynthesis in lepidopteran insects. PBAN cDNA analyses revealed that the DH-like peptide is present in several species that have a pupal diapause. However, the function of the DH-like peptide remains unknown. In the present study, we cloned the cDNA encoding DH-PBAN in Helicoverpa armigera utilizing the rapid amplification of the cDNA ends method. The nucleotide se quence analysis revealed that the longest open reading frame of this cDNA encodes a 194-amino acid precursor protein that con tains a 33-aa PBAN, a 24-aa DH-like peptide, and three other neuropeptides, all of which have a common C-terminal pentapeptide motif FXPR/KL ( X=G, T, S). A homology search showed that H. armigera DH-like and PBAN are highly homologous to those from other insects. Northern blot analysis demonstrated a single message RNA corresponding to the size of Har-DH-PBAN cDNA from pupal SG with significantly higher expression in the SG of nondiapause pupae than diapausing pupae. Western blot analysis showed DH-like peptide expression from SG of both males and females. When DH-like peptide was injected into nondiapause larvae and pupae, it did not induce diapause, but rather efficiently broke pupal diapause in H. armigera. The ED(50) of DH to terminate pupal diapause is 20 pmol/pupae. The other four FXPRLamide neuropeptides from the DH-PBAN polyprotein precursor have cross activity for diapause termination. These observations therefore suggest a potential role for these FXPRL family peptides in promoting continuous development in several noctuid species. The high expression of this gene in pharate adults and adults indicates that the FXPRL family peptides may have multiple physiological functions.
