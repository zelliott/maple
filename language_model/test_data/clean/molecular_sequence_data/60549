A processed oligosaccharide mixture of buffalo milk induced significant stimulation of antibody, delayed-type hypersensitivity response to sheep red blood cells in BALB/c mice. This also stimulated non-specific immune response of the animals measured in terms of macrophage migration index. A novel pentasaccharide has been isolated from the oligosaccharide containing fraction having immunostimulant activity of buffalo milk. This compound was isolated by a combination of gel filtration chromatography, silica gel column chromatography of derivatised oligosaccharides while the homogeneity was confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography. The results of structural analyses, i.e. proton nuclear magnetic resonance, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, chemical transformations and degradations are consistent with the following structure: GlcNAcbeta(1-->3)Galbeta(1-->4)GlcNAcbeta(1-->3)Gal beta(1-->4)Glc
