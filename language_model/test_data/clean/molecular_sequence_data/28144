The DNA sequence of a 3.6kb region downstream of the nagB gene (encoding glucosamine-6-PO4-deaminase) in Escherichia coli has been determined. Three open reading frames, which are subsequently referred to as nagA, nagC and nagD, were detected in this sequence. Genetic complementation and enzyme assays have shown that the first of these, nagA, encodes N-acetyl glucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase. Growth on N-acetyl glucosamine induces the synthesis of a 1900 nucleotide long transcript which covers just nagE, encoding EIINag which is transcribed divergently from nagB, and of a 4200 nucleotide long transcript which covers all four ORFs of the nagB,A,C, D operon. More mRNA corresponding to nagB and nagA is detected than that corresponding to the distal genes, nagC and nagD. Considerable amounts of the induced mRNA are truncated molecules having their 3' ends after nagB and after nagA. Multiple 3' RNA ends have been mapped after nagD and seem to correspond to the ends of transcripts stabilized by mRNA secondary structure (REP sequences) rather than transcription termination sites. A second promoter producing nagD-specific transcripts has been mapped just in front of the nagD gene.
