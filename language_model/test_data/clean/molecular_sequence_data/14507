Phage display is a powerful technique for the discovery of peptide ligands that bind to various targets; however, ambiguous results often appear. Peptide HWGMWSY has been isolated repeatedly in our laboratory and by other research groups dealing with different protein and nonprotein targets, which led to a hypothesis that it may be a target-unrelated peptide interacting with polystyrene plastic surfaces. We compared binding properties and amplification rate of phage clone displaying the peptide HWGMWSY, a previously confirmed plastic binding clone WHWRLPS, and a control phage clone ASVQERK. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a phage elution assay confirmed that phage clone HWGMWSY binds to polystyrene. Surface plasmon resonance measurements on the other hand excluded the possibility of binding to bovine serum albumin, a common blocking agent in phage display experiments. Amplification rates of the above-noted phage clones were not statistically different. We therefore conclude that phage clone HWGMWSY was isolated in different selection procedures as a result of its affinity to polystyrene.
