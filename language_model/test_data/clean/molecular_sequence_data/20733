A novel human leukocyte antigen DRB1 allele, DRB1*1219, has been identified in a Chinese leukaemia patient and his family by polymerase chain reaction sequence-based typing, which has one nucleotide change at position 341 (C-->T) in exon 2 from the closest matching allele DRB1*120201, resulting in an amino acid substitution from Ala-->Val at codon 85.
