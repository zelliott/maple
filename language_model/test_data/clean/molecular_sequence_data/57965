Chemical reactivity and other characteristics of alpha-D-glucopyranose and beta-maltose were evaluated within a semiempirical molecular orbital (AM1) framework. Theoretically generated structures compared well to those determined by X-ray crystallographic techniques. Calculations suggested that the secondary hydroxy functions (OH-2 and OH-3) of the mono- and di-saccharides were more acidic than the primary alcohol (OH-6), which is consistent with experimental findings. In addition, the enhanced reactivity of the OH-3 locus, which is observed upon OH-2 alkylation of the object sugars, was rationalized in terms of increased OH-3 acidity. The chemical behavior of the monomers examined may be insightful in explaining the reactivity of glucopyranose polymers.
