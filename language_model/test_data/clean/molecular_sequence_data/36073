Clones which were selected from a Toxoplasma gondii expression library with the immune serum from a T. gondii-infected rabbit, were further screened using milk and intestinal secretions from mice which had been orally infected with T. gondii cysts. The gene products of several clones reacted strongly with milk IgA and weakly with intestinal IgA. Three of these clones (5.1, 36.1, 37.4) were shown to encode a dense granule protein of 40 kDa (GRA4). The GRA4 protein co-migrates with one of the T. gondii antigens recognized by mucosal IgA. The complete nucleotide sequence of GRA4 has been obtained by cloning genomic T. gondii BamHI fragments containing the 37.4 DNA insert. The coding sequence contains no intron. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates a proline rich (12%) product with an internal hydrophobic region of 19 amino acids and a potential site of N-glycosylation. The primary translation product with a theoretical size of 36,260 Da contains a putative N-terminal signal sequence of 20 amino acids but no apparent glycolipid anchor sequence. Quantitation of the GRA4 gene and Southern blot analysis suggested that the GRA4 gene is single copy. GRA4 gene is translated in tachyzoites to yield a single mRNA species of about 1900 bases.
