A part of the tRNA(Leu)(UAA) gene containing a 240-nucleotide group I intron was amplified by PCR from cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC 6301 genomic DNA. The pre-tRNA synthesized from the cloned PCR product was efficiently self-spliced in vitro under physiological conditions. The gene encoding the tRNA(Leu)(UAA), trnL-UAA, was isolated from a Synechococcus PCC 6301 genomic library and the nucleotide sequence of a 2,167-bp portion was determined. The trnL-UAA consists of a 34-bp 5' exon, a 240-bp group I intron and a 50-bp 3' exon. In addition, three open reading frames (ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3) were found in the 5' and 3' flanking regions of trnL-UAA. The predicted protein sequence of ORF3, which is located 74-bp upstream from trnL-UAA on the opposite strand, shows 66.2% amino acid identity to that of the Synechocystis PCC 6803 gene encoding subunit L of NADH dehydrogenase (ndhL).
