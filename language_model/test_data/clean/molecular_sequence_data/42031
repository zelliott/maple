In a previous cytogenetic analysis, we showed the recurrence of translocations involving band 3q27 and immunoglobulin gene regions in 20 out of 319 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). We report here the molecular cloning of the translocation breakpoint from tumor cells of a patient (LAR) with t(3;14)(q27;q32) and the isolation of DNA probes which identify a major translocation cluster region (MTC) at band 3q27. A DNA library from LAR tumor cells was screened with a JH probe and several clones were identified corresponding either to a somatic rearrangement of JGH genes (V4-D2-J6-C mu clonal rearrangement) or to the t(3;14). Analysis of the t(3;14) breakpoint showed that chromosome 3 material was translocated to an inverted 14q32 VH-containing fragment which was itself translocated to the J3 gene. Chromosome 3-assigned probes were used to investigate local DNA rearrangements in a series of NHL with 3q27 translocations. Rearrangements were detected in 13 of 17 patients including 9 of 11 with t(3;14)(q27;q32), 1 of 2 with t(2;3)(p12;q27), 1 of 2 with t(3;22)(q27;q11), and 2 of 2 NHL with translocations not involving an IG gene, namely, t(3;4)(q27;p11) and t(3;7)(q27;p12). The finding of this MTC should be useful for diagnostic and prognostic studies and for the identification of a novel oncogene at band 3q27 involved in the development of B cell NHL.
