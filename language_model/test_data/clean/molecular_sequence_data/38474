Lipid A, the conserved portion of endotoxin, is the major mediator of septic shock; therefore, endotoxin-neutralizing molecules could have important clinical applications. Here we show that peptides derived from Limulus anti-LPS factor (LALF), bactericidal/permeability increasing protein (BPI) and endotoxin-binding protein, bind to lipid A and block the recombinant LALF/lipid A interaction in vitro. Because their neutralizing capacity in vitro as well as in vivo has been limited, we created hybrid peptides comprising two endotoxin-binding domains. The hybrid molecule LL-10-H-14, containing endotoxin-binding domains from LALF and endotoxin-binding protein, turned out to be the most active peptide within the series of peptides tested here to inhibit the CD14/lipid A interaction and is able in vitro to block the endotoxin-induced TNF-alpha release of murine macrophages up to 90%. Furthermore, LL-10-H-14 not only reduced peak serum levels of TNF-alpha of mice when preinjected but also reduced TNF-alpha levels when given 15 min after the endotoxin challenge. As compared with other peptides, only LL-10-H-14 is able to strongly decrease endotoxin-stimulated TNF-alpha release by human macrophage cell lines as well as by PBMC. Furthermore, the hybrid peptide is protective against endotoxin-provoked lethal shock. As such, LL-10-H-14 could have prophylactic and/or therapeutic properties in humans for the management of septic shock.
