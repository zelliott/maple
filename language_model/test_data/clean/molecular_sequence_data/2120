Transcription from one of the two initiation sites, P1 and P2, of the dual human MYC promoter seems to be essential in all proliferating cells. To identify proteins and target structures for MYC regulation, a DNA region was analyzed that is critical for P2 promoter activity. Here, we show that a nuclear factor binds to a DNA element within P2, which is conserved perfectly between mouse and man and displays a striking homology to the E1a-inducible E2 promoter of adenovirus type 5 (Ad5). We demonstrate that the same transcription factor, defined recently as E2F, which plays an essential role in the activation of adenovirus early promoters and enhancers, also interacts as a dominant nuclear factor with the MYC promoter. The presence of an intact E2F binding site is required for basic expression and for trans-activation of the P2 promoter by E1a proteins. The human MYC promoter is the first cellular target described for E2F. The results suggest that expression of MYC might be regulated via modulation of E2F by cellular 'E1a-like' factors.
