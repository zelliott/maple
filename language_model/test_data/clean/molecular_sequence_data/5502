Single-chain Fv antibody fragments binding different flavin forms [10-(5'-carboxybutyl-)flavin (Fl[ox]) and 10-(5'-carboxybutyl)-1,5-dihydroflavin (Fl[red])] have been generated from an antibody phage-display library to study how a protein environment regulates the redox potential, starting from a protein other than a natural flavoprotein. These 'flavobodies' are characterized by time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, by competitive ELISA methods (mapping of the antigen-binding site), and by molecular modelling. The three-dimensional models of the antigen-binding sites are consistent with the experimental results. Binding of anti-Fl(red) 5 to flavin increases the redox potential, mainly due to an Arg residue interacting with the flavin N1. Thus anti-Fl(red) 5 shows an 'oxidase-like' redox-potential behaviour, confirming the idea that positively charged residues in the vicinity of N1 increase the redox potential. The results obtained with anti-Fl(ox), which do not resemble a natural flavoprotein, show that when the pyrimidine-like nucleus of the flavin is not involved in binding, the redox potential is not significantly affected. These results are in contrast to those obtained with chicken riboflavin-binding protein.
