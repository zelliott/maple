We isolated a novel RNA species from the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC6301 and determined its gene sequence. This novel RNA was termed 6Sa RNA from its length (185 nt). Cross-hybridization of 6Sa RNA to other related microorganisms suggests that its existence is restricted to the Synechococcus genus or related organisms. A high level of accumulation of this RNA was observed by Northern analysis, indicating that 6Sa RNA is stable in cells. Computer-aided prediction of the 6Sa RNA secondary structure also supports its stability.
