A Tirant element, inserted at the 5' end of the mitochondrial glutamine synthetase (mt-gs) gene in a mutant allele giving rise to a recessive female sterility phenotype, was cloned and utilized to characterize this novel retrotransposable element of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The 5.3 kb element present in the fs(2) PM11-19 mt-gs allele possesses a 417 bp long terminal repeat (LTR) at both ends. There is a serine tRNA binding site downstream of the 5' LTR sequence and a polypurine tract upstream of the 3' LTR end. The insertion leads to the duplication of a host-site CGCG sequence. In situ hybridization to salivary glands chromosomes showed evidence of the mobile nature of the element. The DNA sequencing of the cloned 5.3 kb element revealed that Tirant possesses an open reading frame (ORF) that shows similarity with the envelope protein encoded by the gypsy and 297 retrotransposons. In addition, the cloned element appears to be a subgenomic fragment of a not yet identified complete element, because only the integrase domain of the reverse transcriptase gene is found.
