A polyphasic taxonomic study was performed on isolates classified as Centers for Disease Control Group Eugonic Fermenter (EF)-4a and EF-4b. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis confirmed that group EF-4a and EF-4b belong to the genus Neisseria with Neisseria canis and Neisseria dentiae as the nearest phylogenetic neighbours. DNA-DNA hybridizations and biochemical analyses demonstrated that isolates of group EF-4a and EF-4b represent two novel species within this sublineage of the genus Neisseria. Based on the results of the present study, isolates of group EF-4a and EF-4b are classified as Neisseria animaloris sp. nov. (type strain LMG 23011(T)=NCTC 12228(T)) and Neisseria zoodegmatis sp. nov. (type strain LMG 23012(T)=NCTC 12230(T)), respectively.
