A myosin surface loop (amino acids 391-404) is postulated to be an important actin binding site. In human beta-cardiac myosin, mutation of arginine-403 to a glutamine or a tryptophan causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. There is a phosphorylatable serine or threonine residue present on this loop in some lower eukaryotic myosin class I and myosin class VI molecules. Phosphorylation of the myosin I molecules at this site regulates their enzymatic activity. In almost all other myosins, the homologous residue is either a glutamine or an aspartate, suggesting that a negative charge at this location is important for activity. To study the function of this loop, we have used site-directed mutagenesis and baculovirus expression of a heavy meromyosin- (HMM-) like fragment of human nonmuscle myosin IIA. An R393Q mutation (equivalent to the R403Q mutation in human beta-cardiac muscle myosin) has essentially no effect on the actin-activated MgATPase or in vitro motility of the expressed HMM-like fragment. Three mutations, D399K, D399A, and a deletion mutation that removes residues 393-402, all decrease both the V(max) of the actin-activated MgATPase by 8-10-fold and the rate of in vitro motility by a factor of 2-3. The K(ATPase) of the actin-activated MgATPase activity and the affinity constant for binding of HMM to actin in the presence of ADP are affected by less than a factor of 2. These data support an important role for the negative charge at this location but show that it is not critical to enzymatic activity.
