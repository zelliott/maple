In order to detect and identify ubiquitous lipid raft marker proteins, we isolated lipid rafts from different mouse organs, including the liver, lung, large brain, and kidney, and analyzed their proteins via 2-DE. Many protein spots were determined to be ubiquitous in all of the lipid rafts, and were annotated via LC and MS/MS. Twelve proteins were identified as ubiquitous raft proteins, and most of these were determined to be mitochondrial proteins, including mortalin, prohibitin, voltage-dependent anion channel, ATP synthase, NADH dehydrogenase, and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase. Via immunoblotting, these proteins were shown to exist in detergent-resistant lipid rafts prepared using different organ tissues. Since these oxidation-reduction respiratory chains and ATP synthase complex were detected in detergent-resistant lipid raft fractions which had been isolated from the plasma membrane but not from the mitochondria, and found in the cell surface when determined by immunofluoresence and immunohistochemistry, we conclude that plasma membrane lipid rafts might contain oxidation-reduction respiratory chains and ATP synthase complex.
