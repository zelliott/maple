DNA isolated from gonadal tissue of five intersex pigs was analyzed for the presence of the Y chromosomal markers ZFY and DYZ1. Four cases showed no detectable male-specific DNA-sequences. The fifth case exhibited a weak male-specific band at Southern blot analysis with the human ZFY probe and showed a male-specific PCR-product with DYZ1 primers, indicating an XX/XY gonadal chimera.
