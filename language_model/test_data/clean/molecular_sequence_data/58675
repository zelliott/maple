GATA proteins comprise a family of transcription factors that are required for appropriate development of hematopoietic lineages. In order to understand the transcriptional regulation of GATA genes, we have cloned the human GATA-2 gene and identified and characterized its promoter. Comparison with the Xenopus GATA-2 promoter demonstrates highly conserved CCAAT box elements, which are essential for appropriate Xenopus expression. Unlike the Xenopus gene, the human GATA-2 gene lacks GATA binding motifs within the first 800 bp of 5' flanking sequence. In addition, the human GATA-2 promoter has two highly conserved ets sites that resemble the binding site for a recently described ets repressor factor, ERF. These conserved DNA sequence motifs provide strong candidate regions for the regulation of GATA-2.
