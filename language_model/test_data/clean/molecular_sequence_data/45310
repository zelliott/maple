Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were investigated in the unigene sequences from expressed sequence tags (EST) of sweet orange (Citrus sinensis osbeck), trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata Raf.) and other citrus species and cultivars. A total of 37 802 citrus unigene sequences corresponding to 23.29 Mb were searched, resulting in the identification of 8,218 SSRs. Among them there were 4,913 (59.8%) mono-, 1,419 (17.3%) di-, 1,709 (20.8%) tri-, 114 (1.39%) tetra-, 23 (0.28%) penta- and 40 (0.49%) hexa-nucleotide SSRs. The estimated frequency of SSRs was approximately 1/2.8 kb, which could be extrapolated to 1 SSR-containing unigene in 4.6 unigenes. The maximum length of the SSR ranged from 40 to 105 bp depending on the repeating numbers of the motif in the SSR. The overall average length of SSRs was 20.9 bp. The frequencies of different SSR types (di-, tri-, tetra-, and penta-nucleotide repeats) were very similar between sweet orange and trifoliate orange. The mononucelotide repeats appeared to be the most abundant SSRs within sweet orange and trifoliate orange, followed by trimeric repeats. The adenine rich repeats such as A/T, AG, AT, AAG AAAT, AAAG, AAAT, AAAAG, AAAAT etc. were predominant in each type of SSRs (mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, and penta-), whereas the C/G, CG, CCG repeats were less abundant. Twenty-five primer pairs flanking EST-SSR loci were designed to detect the possible polymorphism of six citrus cultivars including sweet orange and trifoliate orange. The PCR result with all these 25 primer pairs revealed the existence of polymorphism within six citrus cultivars confirming that citrus EST database could be efficiently exploited for the development of gene-derived SSR markers.
