Toxin production has always been considered a constitutive characteristic of dinoflagellates in the genus Alexandrium. Here we demonstrate that saxitoxin production can be lost by an Alexandrium species during routine culture maintenance. This is the first report of any marine saxitoxin-producing alga ever to have completely lost the ability to produce toxins. A clonal toxic isolate of Alexandrium lusitanicum from Portugal has been maintained in culture since 1962. In 1992, a subculture was established and sent to a different laboratory. Recent comparisons of the parental strain and the subculture revealed that the former had lost its toxicity, whereas the latter still produces saxitoxins. This loss of toxicity was confirmed by three independent toxin detection methods: mouse bioassay, mouse neuroblastoma assay and HPLC. Sequence analyses of different rRNA domains demonstrated that the toxic and non-toxic cultures are genetically identical for those markers. Morphological analysis showed that both cultures have the same plate tabulation and are A. lusitanicum. These results strongly argue that the loss of toxicity is not a result of a culturing artifact or mistake, such as mislabeling or contamination. The clonal cultures also show a significant difference in growth. Possible explanations for the change include genetic mutations or the effects of prolonged treatment of the non-toxic culture with antibiotics.
