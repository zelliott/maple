A problem of conformations of carbohydrate chains of glycoconjugates-glycoproteins and glycolipids--is reviewed. Experimental data (NMR, X-Ray) and theoretical conformational analysis data are discussed. Spatial structures of O-linked oligosaccharides from blood-group glycoproteins, N-linked oligosaccharides of different types (oligomannosidic, complex, hybrid, bisect) and carbohydrate chains of glycosphingolipids are considered.
