Xanthobacter polyaromaticivorans sp. nov. 127W is a bacterial strain that is capable of degrading a wide range of cyclic aromatic compounds such as dibenzothiophene, biphenyl, naphthalene, anthracene, and phenanthrene even under extremely low oxygen [dissolved oxygen (DO)< or = 0.2 ppm] conditions (Hirano et al., Biosci Biotechnol Biochem 68:557-564, 2004). A major protein fraction carrying dibenzothiophene degradation activity was purified. Based on its partial amino acid sequences, dbdCa gene encoding alpha subunit terminal oxygenase (DbdCa) and its flanking region were cloned and sequenced. A phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequence demonstrates that DbdCa is a member of a terminal oxygenase component of group IV ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases for biphenyls and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, rather than group III dioxygenases for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Gene disruption in dbdCa abolished almost of the degradation activity against biphenyl, dibenzothiophene, and anthracene. The gene disruption also impaired degradation activity of the strain under extremely low oxygen conditions (DO< or = 0.2 ppm). These results indicate that Dbd from 127W represents a group IV dioxygenase that is functional even under extremely low oxygen conditions.
