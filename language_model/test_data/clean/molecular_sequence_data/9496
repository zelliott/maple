Based on oligopeptide, a novel strategy to fabricate electrochemical biosensor is proposed in this work by fine-tuning the scan pulse frequency of square wave voltammetry (SWV) to synchronize with the surface electron transfer (ET) of the oligopeptide modified on an electrode surface. By using this strategy, the surface ET dynamics of our peptide-based biosensor can show significant difference in the presence and absence of a detection target, thus the proposed strategy has been employed for the assay of amyloid β 1-42 (Aβ 1-42) soluble oligomer, which is among the most neurotoxic species of Aβ peptide. Experimental results reveal that our sensor might be an appropriate candidate for quantitative assay of Aβ 1-42 soluble oligomer. Moreover, the strategy proposed in this work may be extended for the fabrication of more peptide-based biosensors in the future.
