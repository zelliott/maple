Two binding sites are associated with neurokinin-1 substance P receptors in both transfected cells and mammalian tissues. To further delineate the interactions between the crucial C-terminal methionine of substance P and these two binding sites, we have incorporated newly designed constrained methionines, i.e. (2S, 3S)- and (2S,3R)-prolinomethionines. The potencies of these C terminus-modified SP analogues to bind both sites and to activate phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and cAMP formation have been measured, together with those of their corresponding sulfoxides and sulfones. The molecular nature of these two binding sites and their selective coupling to effector signaling pathways are discussed in the light of current models of receptor activation. The less abundant binding site is coupled to G(q/11) proteins, whereas the most abundant one interacts with G(s) proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with human neurokinin-1 receptors. The specific orientation of the C-terminal methionine side chain imposed by these constraints shows that macroscopically chi(1) and chi(2) angles of this crucial C-terminal residue are similar in both binding sites. However, slight but significant variations in the rotation around the Cgamma-S bond yield different either stabilizing or destabilizing interactions in the two binding sites. These results highlight the need of such constrained amino acids to probe subtle interactions in ligand-receptor complexes.
