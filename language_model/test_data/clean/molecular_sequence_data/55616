The study of human papillomavirus replication has been hampered by the lack of an in vitro system which reliably supports virus replication. Recent results from the bovine papillomavirus (BPV) system indicate that the E1 and E2 proteins are the only viral gene products required for replication. By analogy with simian virus 40 large T antigen, E1 is thought to possess ATPase and helicase activity, which may play a direct role in viral DNA replication. The precise role of E2 is unclear, but it may function in part to help localize E1 to the replication origin. We have initiated a study of replication in the human papillomavirus type 11 system which, by analogy to BPV, has focused on the E1 and E2 proteins of this virus. We have expressed the full-length E1 and E2 proteins in Sf9 insect cells by using a baculovirus expression vector. Both the 80-kDa E1 protein and the 42.5-kDa E2 protein are nuclear phosphoproteins. The E1 and E2 proteins form a heteromeric complex within the insect cells, and both proteins localize to a DNA fragment which contains the viral origin of replication. In addition, we have detected an E1-associated ATPase and GTPase activity, which is likely part of an energy-generating system for the helicase activity which is predicted for this protein. The human papillomavirus type 11 E1 and E2 proteins possess the same replication-associated activities exhibited by the corresponding BPV proteins, suggesting that the replication activities of these viruses are tightly conserved.
