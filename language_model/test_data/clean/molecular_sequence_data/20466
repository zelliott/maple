The diversity of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in the aquifer underlying the Laogang Landfill along the shore of the East China Sea was investigated. The DNA extracted from 15 groundwater samples was subjected to PCR amplification of the dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dsr) gene. Full-length dsrAB amplicons (approximately 1.9 kb) were then used to construct 4 clone libraries, while the dsrB amplicons (approximately 350 bp) were used for denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. The clones in the 4 libraries covered all cultured SRB lineages, as well as a deeply branching clade not affiliated with any cultured SRB. In addition, nearly 80% of the 388 clones in the 4 libraries were similar to sequences of the Deltaproteobacteria, Desulfobacteriaceae, Desulfovibrionales, Syntrophaceae, and Desulfobulbaceae. Furthermore, a wide variety of marine SRB was detected, which indicated that seawater has infiltrated the aquifer. Indeed, the DGGE profiles revealed obvious variations in SRB diversity among the 15 samples, which clustered in accordance with the sulfate concentration of the samples ([SO4(2-)]). Moreover, the sulfate concentrations and SRB diversity along the leachate plume did not show regular variation, which suggests the impact of both groundwater flow and seawater intrusion.
