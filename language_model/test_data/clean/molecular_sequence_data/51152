In the present study, the expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) isozymes was compared in human male and female colon tissues. GST isozymes were purified and quantified in five male and five female colon tissue samples. Noticeable differences were observed in the isoelectric focusing profiles (IEF) of the GSTs, from male and female colon tissues. Both male and female colon tissues had three common GST peaks with pI values of 9.2, 6.7 and 4.8. An additional GST peak with a pI value of 6.2 found in all females was not found in males. Based on kinetic, immunological and structural properties, these isozymes were classified into alpha (pI 9.2), mu (pI 6.7 and 6.2) and pi (pI 4.8) classes. Activity of the alpha-class GST in male colon was approx. 2-fold higher than the corresponding isozyme in female colon. The pi-class GST 4.8 was the most predominant GST in both the sexes and its activity with CDNB as substrate was more abundant (about 1.6-fold) in female colon as compared to that in male colon. Significant differences were seen in substrate specificities between male and female colon GST 4.8. Sex related differences were also observed in the inhibition kinetics of GST pi from male and female colon in the presence of hematin. In addition, GST pi isolated from female colon was more thermostable as compared to the corresponding male isozyme. The thermostability of purified GST pi isozyme from males or females was not affected by incubation of the enzyme with either estrogen, testosterone or progesterone.
