Perineoscrotal hypospadia is a major sign of sexual ambiguity due to inadequate androgen action in genetic and gonadal males. In patients showing these symptoms we have detected two androgen receptor gene mutations. In consequence we characterized the properties of the mutant receptors with respect to hormone-binding, transactivation and DNA-binding. An amino acid substitution alanine-596-->threonine in the D-box of the androgen receptor was detected in 3 and 2 brothers, respectively. This mutant receptor, AR-thr596, bound ligand in a normal fashion. It showed a promoter-dependent defect of transactivation and was unable to induce transcription of a promoter containing one androgen responsive element but showed almost wild-type transactivation of a promoter containing two closely spaced androgen-responsive elements. The complex promoter of the human prostate-specific antigen gene was induced with intermediate efficiency. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays AR-thr596 was unable to form a complex with oligonucleotides containing 1 or 2 androgen responsive elements, however its DNA-binding activity was restored by an anti-androgen receptor antibody in the presence of ligand. A point mutation which caused substitution of serine-703 in the hormone-binding domain with glycine was detected in a new-born male with ambiguous genitalia. This mutant receptor, AR-gly703, showed a reduced ligand affinity. The total amount of specific androgen binding sites in genital fibroblasts of the patient was reduced. Transactivation activity of AR-gly703 was dependent on hormone concentration. It was inactive at low levels of androgens but was fully activated in the presence of high androgen concentrations. The nature of the promoter had no effect on transactivation properties of this mutant androgen receptor. Its DNA-binding activity in gel shift experiments was normal.
