Three different LNA-nucleoside triphosphates, LNA-TTP, LNA-ATP and LNA-5-methyl-CTP, were investigated as substrates for KOD DNA polymerase. The results reveal that KOD DNA polymerase is an efficient catalyst for template directed synthesis of DNA oligonucleotide duplexes containing a large number of LNA nucleotides by primer extension reactions. Furthermore, KOD DNA polymerase is shown to be suitable for the PCR amplification of an LNA-modified DNA duplex.
