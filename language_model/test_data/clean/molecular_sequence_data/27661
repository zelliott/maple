We have characterized a transcription unit at chromosome band 19p13 that lies at the site of a chromosomal translocation breakpoint in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The lyl-1 gene is structurally altered following a t(7;19) translocation, resulting in its head-to-head juxtaposition with the T cell receptor C beta gene and truncation of lyl-1 RNA. The predicted protein product of the lyl-1 gene contains a potential helix-loop-helix DNA binding motif also found in several proteins involved in the control of cellular proliferation and differentiation: all members of the Myc family, MyoD1, myogenin, the Drosophila achaete-scute, twist, and daughterless proteins, and two recently described immunoglobulin enhancer binding proteins. The implication of lyl-1 in cellular transformation suggests that other proteins containing similar DNA binding motifs may also be involved with neoplastic transformation in various cellular lineages.
