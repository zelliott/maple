We have cloned the promoter regions of the genes for the mouse and human gamma2 subunits of the type A receptors for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). For the mouse, the two major transcription start sites were at +1 (by definition) and +43, as established by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and primer extension. This numbering places the start methionine at +297. There was no TATA or CCAAT box. Both mouse and human sequences have a candidate neuron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE) site in the first intron (+956 in mouse). We made assorted mouse-based promoter/reporter (luciferase) constructs starting from a core extending from -331 to +136, varying sizes at both ends, and including and excluding the putative NRSE and more proximal sequences. These were tested by transient transfection in several neuron-like and non-neuronal cell lines. Both proximal and distal downstream elements appeared to help direct expression to neuron-like cells, the NRSE in the intron, by repression in non-neurons, and a 24-bp portion of the 5' untranslated region starting at +113 (named GPE1) by preferentially promoting expression in neuron-like cells. Cotransfected human NRSF (transcription factor for NRSE) reduced reporter expression in neuron-like cells for constructs containing the NRSE in two locations. In gel mobility shift assays, the mouse gamma2 NRSE and a consensus NRSE both bound in vitro translated NRSF very similarly, and the NRSF gave the same major shifted band with the mouse gamma2 NRSE as was observed with nuclear extracts.
