We have determined the complete genome sequence of keunjorong mosaic virus (KjMV). The KjMV genome is composed of 9,611 nucleotides, excluding the 3'-terminal poly(A) tail. It contains two open reading frames (ORFs), with the large one encoding a polyprotein of 3,070 amino acids and the small overlapping ORF encoding a PIPO protein of 81 amino acids. The KjMV genome shared the highest nucleotide sequence identity (57.5 Â %) with pepper mottle virus and freesia mosaic virus, two members of the genus Potyvirus. Based on the phylogenetic relatedness to known potyviruses, KjMV appears to be a member of a new species in the genus Potyvirus.
