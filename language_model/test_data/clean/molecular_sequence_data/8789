Members of the Ig superfamily are predominantly receptors that mediate interactions between cells or provide signals to cells when binding specific ligands. Here we describe an Ig-related receptor that requires zinc for its function. Killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIR) belonging to the Ig superfamily mediate inhibition of NK cells upon recognition of HLA-C molecules on target cells. An abundance of histidine residues in the first extracellular domain of KIR, including the signature zinc binding motif HEXXH, suggested that this receptor may bind zinc. Two distinct KIR molecules that mediate recognition of HLA-Cw4 and -Cw8, respectively, bound specifically to zinc affinity columns. Furthermore, addition of the zinc chelator 1,10-phenanthroline during chromium release assays reversed the inhibition of killing by NK clones specific for HLA-Cw4 or HLA-Cw8, demonstrating that zinc is necessary for the inhibitory function of KIR. Such functionally relevant zinc binding has not been described for other members of the Ig superfamily and may represent a novel regulatory mechanism for Ag receptor-ligand interactions.
