The pericentric inversion of chromosome 16 and the t(16;16) are two recurrent aberrations in bone marrow of patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia subtype M4 Eo, characterized by abnormal eosinophilic granulation. We describe here the precise localization of the breakpoints using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with cosmids spread over the short arm of chromosome 16 and the detection, isolation and characterization of a 14Kb EcoRI fragment containing a cluster of breakpoints. First, cosmids were mapped to intervals defined by constitutional 16p rearrangements, second, the inv(16) and t(16;16) breakpoints were mapped to one of the intervals using FISH with the mapped cosmids and third, cosmids within this interval were ordered using two color interphase FISH. An STS of the cosmid closest to the breakpoints was then used to isolate five YACs, which did span all of the 16 inv(16) breakpoints and one t(16;16) breakpoint analysed. In the DNA of one inv(16) patient we detected an additional submicroscopic deletion immediately proximal to the 16p breakpoint. Since this patient has the same phenotype, the 16p sequences proximal to the breakpoint seem non-essential to M4 Eo. This implies that the pathologic event is the juxtaposition of sequences distal to the 16p breakpoint with sequences proximal to the 16q breakpoint. While four of the five YACs showed instability of the region around the inv(16) breakpoint, DNA halo analysis allowed us to identify one YAC which was co-linear with normal genomic DNA and has yielded the actual breakpoint sequences which could be subcloned into cosmids and fosmids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
