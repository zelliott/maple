A full-length cDNA clone coding for porcine pancreatic preprocarboxypeptidase A1 (prePCPA1) was isolated from a cDNA library. The open reading frame (ORF) of the nucleotide sequence was 1260 nt in length and encoded a protein of 419 amino acids (aa). The cDNA included a short signal peptide of 16 aa and a 94 aa-long activation segment. The calculated molecular mass of the mature proenzyme was 45561 Da, in accordance with that of the purified porcine pancreatic PCPA1. The deduced aa sequence of the corresponding enzyme differed from that predicted by the three-dimensional structure by 40 aa, and showed 85% identity and 55% identity to that of procarboxypeptidases A1 and A2, respectively. Moreover the sequence was identical to that of several independent cDNA clones, suggesting that it is the major transcribed gene. No evidence for a second variant was observed in the cDNA library and PCPA2 is apparently absent from the porcine pancreas. The cDNA was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of the yeast triose phosphate isomerase promoter. The signal peptide of the PCPA protein efficiently directed its secretion into the culture medium (1.5 mg.L-1) as a protein of the predicted size. The recombinant proenzyme was analyzed by immunological and enzymological methods. Its activation behavior was comparable with that of the native form and led to a 35-kDa active enzyme.
