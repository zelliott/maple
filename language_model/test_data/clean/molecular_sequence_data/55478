The behavior at air-liquid interfaces of two recombinant versions of human surfactant protein SP-C has been characterized in comparison with that of native palmitoylated SP-C purified from porcine lungs. Both native and recombinant proteins promoted interfacial adsorption of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers to a limited extent, but catalyzed very rapid formation of films from different lipid mixtures containing both zwitterionic and anionic phospholipids. Once at the interface, the recombinant variants exhibited compression-driven structural transitions, consistent with changes in the orientation of the deacylated N-terminal segment, which were not observed in the native protein. Compression isotherms of lipid/protein films suggest that the recombinant SP-C forms promote expulsion at high pressures of a higher number of lipid molecules per mole of protein than does native SP-C. A more dynamic conformation of the N-terminal segment in recombinant SP-C forms is likely also responsible for facilitating compression-driven condensation of domains in anionic phospholipid films as observed by epifluorescence microscopy. Finally, both native palmitoylated SP-C and the phenylalanine-containing recombinant versions facilitate similarly the repetitive compression-expansion dynamics of lipid/protein films, which were able to reach maximal surface pressures with practically no hysteresis along multiple quasi-static or dynamic cycles.
