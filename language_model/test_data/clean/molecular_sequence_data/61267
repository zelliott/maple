Reverse transcription of HIV-1 vRNA into the double-stranded DNA provirus involves initiation of plus-strand DNA synthesis at the polypurine tract (PPT) by reverse transcriptase (RT). The PPT is highly conserved among the known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) strains and is a possible target for triplex formation. We show the effects of triple-helix formation by assays of primer extension inhibition in vitro, using a two-strand system (foldback triplex-forming oligonucleotides (FTFOs)) targeted to the PPT of HIV-1. The two-stranded composition of a triple-helix is thermodynamically and kinetically superior to the three-strand system. The FTFOs inhibited the RT activity in a sequence-specific manner, i.e. the triplex actually formed at the PPT and blocked the RT. The FTFOs containing the phosphorothioate groups at the antisense sequences showed greater 3'-exonuclease resistance. In HIV-1-infected MOLT-4 cells, the FTFOs containing the phosphorothioate groups at the antisense sequence sites and guanosine rich parts within the third Hoogsteen base-pairing sequence inhibit the replication of HIV-1 more effectively than the antisense oligonucleotides, indicating sequence-specific inhibition of HIV-1 replication.
