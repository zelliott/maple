We have recently observed that protein kinase C (PKC) was involved in the regulation of the accumulation of mRNAs of the AP-1 components in cultured Abelson-transformed murine fetal-liver-derived mast cells stimulated by exocytotic stimuli. Here we analyzed the probable regulatory effect of PKC on the synthesis and DNA-binding activity of AP-1 complexes in immunologic stimulated mast cells. In this study we used the interleukin-3--dependent murine fetal-liver--derived mast cells that were not transformed by the Abelson oncogene. Study of PKC-depleted cells showed PKC dependency of c-fos mRNA accumulation and protein expression in IgE-Ag stimulated cells. In contrast, the c-jun mRNA accumulation was unaffected by PKC depletion, whereas its protein expression was dependent on this enzymatic activity. This suggests the involvement of PKC in the regulation of translation of c-Jun, a level of c-Jun regulation that was not previously described. The amount of AP-1 DNA-bound complex was also lowered in PKC-depleted cells. Therefore, PKC plays an important regulatory role in different stages of the signal transduction pathway because of IgE-Ag stimulation. Surprisingly, we have observed that although the amount of total synthesized c-Fos began to increase 15 minutes after immunologic stimulation, the amount of c-Fos associated with Juns did not increase, even after 45 minutes. This association was not affected by PKC. Using a Fos-interacting protein (FIP)-cDNA probe, an expression of 2.9 kb mRNA was detected in these cells. Furthermore, immunologic stimulation caused an increase in the amount of a Fos-containing protein complex that bound to an FIP-binding DNA oligonucleotide. Therefore, we propose that this protein complex that contains most of the immunologically induced c-Fos has an important role in IgE-Ag-stimulated signal transduction.
