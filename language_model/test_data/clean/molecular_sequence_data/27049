Because of its high discriminatory potential, fragment analysis of microsatellites has been frequently used for genotyping of Candida albicans at the strain level. In order to evaluate a genotyping system based on the fragment analysis of microsatellites combined with PCRs targeting 25S rDNA and RPS, 456 independent strains of C. albicans were subjected to genotype analysis using 4 microsatellite markers (CDC3, HIS3, CA I and CA III), followed by 25S rDNA and RPS-based genotyping. The fragment analysis using CA I showed the highest discriminatory potential (DP=0.9782), followed by HIS3 (DP=0.8780). Using combined microsatellite markers, 456 C. albicans strains were divided into 384 genotypes (DP=0.9984). PCRs targeting 25S rDNA and RPS were performed to differentiate the strains that showed identical genotypes in the fragment analysis, resulting in 434 genotypes (DP=0.9996). The combined genotyping system showed high discriminatory power at the strain level, and therefore is useful for rapid genotyping in molecular epidemiological studies of candidiasis.
