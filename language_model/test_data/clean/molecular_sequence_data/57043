The utilization of the beta 2-microglobulin (B2m) exchange assay allowed for the association of H-2Ld with human B2m. Upon association with H-2Ld, human B2m induces structural alterations in H-2Ld that appear dependent upon xenogeneic B2m amino acid sequence variability. In this regard, xenogeneic B2m exchange is used as a tool to induce structural alterations in class I as a means of analysing the structural-functional relationship of B2m/class I association. Incorporating H-2Ld site-directed mutants into the experimental approach provided strong evidence that B2m makes indirect contact with discrete class I specific amino acid positions located in the helical region of the alpha 1 domain.
