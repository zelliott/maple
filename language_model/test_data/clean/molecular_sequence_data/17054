RNA is structurally very flexible, which provides the basis for its functional diversity. An RNA molecule can often adopt different conformations, which enables the regulation of its function through folding. Proteins help RNAs reach their functionally active conformation by increasing their structural stability or by chaperoning the folding process. Large, dynamic RNA-protein complexes, such as the ribosome or the spliceosome, require numerous proteins that coordinate conformational switches of the RNA components during assembly and during their respective activities.
