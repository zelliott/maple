Congenitally abnormal plasminogen is characterized by markedly decreased fibrinolytic activity and has been reported mainly in association with venous occlusive disease.

We found three young adult patients (34, 45, and 27 years old at onset) with ischemic cerebrovascular disease, all of whom had congenital plasminogen abnormalities but no other known risk factors. Hemostatic tests of all three patients revealed plasma plasminogen activities at almost one half of the normal level despite normal plasma plasminogen antigen levels. They were found to be heterozygotes with abnormal plasminogen (normal Ala-601[GCT] to abnormal Thr-601[ACT]) by DNA sequence analysis after polymerase chain reaction.

Congenital plasminogen abnormalities could be one of the risk factors of juvenile ischemic cerebrovascular disease of the arterial as well as venous type.
