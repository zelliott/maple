In this study, we compare the efficiency of Asn tRNA from mammalian sources with and without the highly modified queuosine (Q) base in the wobble position of its anticodon and Asn tRNA from yeast, which naturally lacks Q base, to promote frameshifting. Interestingly, no differences in the ability of the two mammalian Asn tRNAs to promote frameshifting were observed, while yeast tRNA(ASn)(-Q) promoted frameshifting more efficiently than its mammalian counterparts in both rabbit reticulocyte lysates and wheat germ extracts. The shiftability of yeast Asn tRNA is therefore not due, or at least not completely, to the lack of Q base and most likely the shiftiness resides in structural differences elsewhere in the molecule. However, we cannot absolutely rule out a role of Q base in frameshifting as wheat germ extracts and a lysate depleted of most of its tRNA and supplemented with calf liver tRNA contain both Asn tRNA with or without Q base.
