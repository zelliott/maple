We have developed a computer-based screening strategy to search the dbEST database to find differentiation antigens that are expressed by cancers arising in nonessential normal tissues such as prostate, breast, and ovary (G. Vasmatzis et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 95: 300-304, 1998). Here, we report the identification of three new members of the GAGE/ PAGE family, termed XAGEs. XAGE-1 and XAGE-2 are expressed in Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, a breast cancer, and a germ cell tumor. We also describe the relationship of the XAGEs to the GAGE/ PAGE family. XAGE-1 and XAGE-2 should be evaluated as possible targets for vaccine-based therapies of cancer.
