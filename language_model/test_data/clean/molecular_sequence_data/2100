In culture supernatants of both Listeria ivanovii and Listeria monocytogenes Sv4b, for the first time a hemolysin of molecular weight 58 kDa was identified, which had all the characteristics of an SH-activated cytolysin, and which was therefore identified as listeriolysin O (LLO). In the case of L. ivanovii a second major supernatant protein of molecular weight 24 kDa co-purified with LLO. However, the function of this protein has to be determined. In culture supernatants of L. ivanovii a sphingomyelinase and a lecithinase activity could be detected, both enzymatic activities together contributing to the pronounced hemolysis caused by L. ivanovii. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of LLO and the 24 kDa from L. ivanovii are shown.
