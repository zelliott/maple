We have recently established a computerized database containing information on mutants at the human hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) locus. The database contains sequence information on over 1000 mutants. We now present an analysis of the information in the database. 542 single base substitution mutants in the hprt coding region exist, and we have examined (1) the number of mutations and the number of mutable sites in each exon, (2) transcribed versus non-transcribed strand bias for mutations, (3) the frequency of the 5' and 3' nearest neighbors to a mutated base, and (4) the distribution of amino acid substitutions. The distribution of both DNA mutations and amino acid mutations was not uniform, several clusterings of mutations were observed and we propose several possible mechanisms to account for the hotspots. We also examined mRNA splicing mutants, mutants with small deletions, and frameshift mutants.
