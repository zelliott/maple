We recently identified human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) as a functional enterovirus 71 (EV71) receptor and demonstrated PSGL-1-dependent replication for some EV71 strains in human leukocytes. Here, we report that four out of five PSGL-1-binding strains of EV71 replicated poorly in mouse L929 cells stably expressing human PSGL-1 (L-PSGL-1 cells). Therefore, we compared the replication kinetics and entire genomic sequence of five original EV71 strains and the corresponding EV71 variants (EV71-LPS), which were propagated once in L-PSGL-1 cells. Direct sequence comparison of the entire genome of the original EV71 strains and EV71-LPS variants identified several possible adaptive mutations during the course of replication in L-PSGL-1 cells, including a putative determinant of the adaptive phenotype in L-PSGL-1 cells at VP2-149. The results suggest that an adaptive mutation, along with a PSGL-1-binding phenotype, may facilitate efficient PSGL-1-dependent replication of the EV71 strains in L-PSGL-1 cells.
