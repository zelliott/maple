The latent membrane protein 2 (LMP2) of Epstein-Barr virus interferes with B-lymphocyte signal transduction through the immunoglobulin (Ig) receptor. Two isoforms of LMP2 exist and differ only in that one isoform (LMP2a) contains an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain that the other isoform does not. LMP2a is a phosphoprotein that is phosphorylated on tyrosines and serines in the cytoplasmic domain. GST1-119, a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the 119 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain, affinity precipitated serine kinase activity from BJAB cell extracts. The affinity-precipitated kinase phosphorylated LMP2a sequences, and kinase activity was increased following induction. Probing of Western immunoblots of affinity-precipitated proteins showed that the Erk1 form of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was present. Purified MAPK phosphorylated GST fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic domain of LMP2a and mutational analyses were used to identify S15 and S102 as the sites of in vitro phosphorylation. A polyclonal rabbit antiserum was prepared against a maltose binding protein-LMP2a cytoplasmic domain fusion protein (MBP1-119) and used to immunoprecipitate LMP2a from the in vitro-immortalized lymphoblastoid B-cell line B95-8CR. LMP2a immunoprecipitates from B95-8CR contained MAPK as a coprecipitated protein. Cross-linking surface Ig on B95-8CR cells failed to induce MAPK activity within the cells. Treatment of B95-8CR with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was able to bypass the Ig receptor block and activate MAPK activity. Phosphorylation of LMP2a on serine residues increased after PMA induction. The possible role for LMP2a serine phosphorylation by MAPK in the control of latency is discussed.
