Thermophilic Bacillus circulans IIIB153 isolated from hot springs of North West Himalayas, India, produced an extracellular lipase, which exhibited significant biofilm disruption property on the static biofilm disruption model with a single species of Actinomyces                         viscosous. The gene encoding the lipase was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant Bacillus circulans lipase (BCL), a monomer with molecular mass of 43 kDa also exhibited significant biofilm disruption activity. The enzyme was optimally active at 60°C, pH 8.5 and retained >70% of its original activity after 1 h incubation at 60°C. 3D structure of BCL developed by homology modeling showed a typical α/β hydrolase fold, a characteristic feature of lipolytic enzymes. Comparison of thermostable BCL with mesostable lipase from Chromobacterium viscosum at the sequence and structure level showed distinct variations in the structural features, with the presence of a high content of proline residues, aromatic amino acids and salt bridges. These features along with the presence of zinc-binding site observed in BCL structure could have a potential role in thermal stability of the enzyme.
