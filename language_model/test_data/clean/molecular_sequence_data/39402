Ferritin, the iron storage protein, plays a key role in iron metabolism. A cDNA encoding ferritin (FcFer) was cloned from hepatopancreas of Chinese shrimp, Fenneropenaeus chinensis. The predicted protein contains 170 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight (MW) about 19, 422.89 Da and theoretical isoelectric point (PI) of 4.73. Amino acid alignment of FcFer revealed 97% homology with Litopenaeus vannamei ferritin. Results of the RT-PCR showed that the expression of FcFer mRNA was up-regulated after shrimp was challenged with either white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) or heavy metal ions (Zn2+ and Cu2+) in the laboratory. A fusion protein containing FcFer was produced and the purified recombinant protein exhibited similar function of iron uptake in vitro. The result of in-gel digestion and identification using LC-ESI-MS showed that two peptide fragments (-DDVALPGFAK- and -LLEDEYLEEQVDSIKK-) of the recombinant protein were identical to the corresponding sequence of L. vannamei ferritin. The recombinant FcFer protein will be proved useful for study on the structure and function of ferritin in F. chinensis.
