1. Schistocerca gregaria ion-transport peptide (Scg-ITP) was isolated from aqueous extracts of the corpus cardiacum by a four-step procedure, utilizing reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography for separation and stimulation of a Cl(-)-dependent short-circuit current (Isc) across locust ilea as the bioassay. 2. Scg-ITP has an unblocked N terminus and an apparent relative molecular mass of 7700. Thirty-one residues (of an estimated 65) were identified by sequence analysis. 3. Scg-ITP is structurally related to a crustacean family of neuropeptides which includes the crustacean hyperglycaemic hormones from the shore crab Carcinus maenas and the crayfish Orconectes limosus and moult-inhibiting hormone and vitellogenesis-inhibiting hormone from the lobster Homarus americanus. 4. Scg-ITP has no sequence homology with neuroparsins (Nps). Nps are the only other neuropeptides isolated to date that might regulate reabsorption in an insect hindgut (rectum).
