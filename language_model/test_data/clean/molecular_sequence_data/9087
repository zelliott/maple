This review covers data on the structural organization of functional sites in the human ribosome, namely, the messenger RNA binding center, the binding site of the hepatitis C virus RNA internal ribosome entry site, and the peptidyl transferase center. The data summarized here have been obtained primarily by means of a site-directed cross-linking approach with application of the analogs of the respective ribosomal ligands bearing cross-linkers at the designed positions. These data are discussed taking into consideration available structural data on ribosomes from various kingdoms obtained with the use of cryo-electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, and other approaches.
