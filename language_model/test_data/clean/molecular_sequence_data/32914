A method for the rapid identification of proteins and their N-glycans was developed through the use of two parallel columns directly connected to a mass spectrometer. Both porous graphitic carbon (PGC) and C18 capillary columns were connected in parallel with two switching valves for the simultaneous analysis of glycans and peptides, respectively. To verify the efficiency of the analytical system, profiling of N-glycans and proteins from human serum was demonstrated. This method is suitable for high-throughput analysis and automation, is contamination-free for the identification of N-glycans and proteins in a complex biological sample, and can be applied to glycomics and proteomics.
