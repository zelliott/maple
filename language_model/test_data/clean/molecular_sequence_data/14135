1. We have characterized pharmacologically the receptor subtype(s) responsible for the neuropeptide Y (NPY)-induced vasoconstriction in human cerebral arteries. NPY, PYY and several of their derivatives with well defined affinities at the known Y1 and Y2 receptor subtypes were used. Moreover, we tested the ability of the new Y1 receptor antagonist, BIBP 3226, to antagonize the NPY-induced cerebral vasoconstriction. 2. NPY, PYY and their agonists with high affinities at the Y1 receptor subtype ([Leu31-Pro34]-NPY and [Leu31-Pro34]-PYY) elicited strong, long lasting and concentration-dependent contractions of human cerebral arteries. Compounds with Y2 affinity such as PYY3-36 or NPY13-36 either elicited a submaximal contraction at high concentrations or failed to induce any significant vasomotor response. Also, the application of NPY or the specific Y1 agonist, [Leu31-Pro34]-NPY, to human cerebral vessels pretreated with the Y1 agonist, NPY13-36, resulted in contractile responses identical to those obtained when these compounds were tested without prior application of NPY13-36. 3. The order of agonist potency at the human cerebrovascular receptor was: [Leu31-Pro34]-NPY = [Leu31-Pro34]-PYY > or = NPY > PYY > PYY3-36 > > > NPY13-36, which corresponded to that reported previously at the neuronal and vascular Y1 receptors. 4. Increasing concentrations (10(-9)-10(-6) M) of the Y1 receptor antagonist, BIBP 3226, to human cerebral vessels caused a parallel and rightward shift in the NPY dose-response curves without any significant change in the maximal contractile response. The calculated pA2 was 8.52 +/- 0.13, a value compatible with the reported affinity at the rodent and human Y1 receptor. 5. We conclude that Y1 receptors exclusively, mediate the NPY-induced contraction in human cerebral arteries and we show that BIBP 3226 is a potent and competitive antagonist of this YI-mediated vasoconstriction.
