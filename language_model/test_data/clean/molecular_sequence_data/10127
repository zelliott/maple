The localization of T and B cell epitopes on a well characterized 33-kDa protein of the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus (Ov33) was studied using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and sera from a total of 52 onchocerciasis patients with the generalized form of infection. A proportion of the PBMC samples proliferated in response to recombinant Ov33-GST fusion protein and to fusion free Ov33-6xHis. Proliferative responses of patient PBMC to seven truncated Ov33-6xHis polypeptides and to three synthetic peptides revealed at least one major and two minor T cell epitopes in the protein. The dominant T cell stimulating domain was localized between amino acids 113 and 143. ELISA studies with the Ov33-GST fusion protein revealed that patient sera contained Ov33-specific IgG1, IgG4, IgE, and IgM antibodies. Analysis of the IgG4 response with 10 truncated Ov33 polypeptides identified four B cell stimulating domains in the N-terminal, central, and C-terminal region of the molecule. The B cell domain recognized by the majority of sera was localized between amino acids 113 and 143. The data indicate that this region of the protein is the major T and B cell stimulating domain of Ov33 and might be relevant for vaccine development and for improved immunodiagnosis of onchocerciasis.
