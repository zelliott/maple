The bovine C alpha type catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase was cloned. A partial cDNA was isolated from a bovine heart cDNA library. This clone contained 120 bp of the coding sequence and the entire 3' untranslated region of 1431 bp. The complete coding region was cloned by PCR amplification from total bovine heart and skeletal muscle RNA. The sequence of the 3' oligonucleotide was taken from the partial cDNA clone whereas the 5' oligonucleotide was chosen by comparison of sequences of published C alpha subunits from other species. In the deduced amino acid sequence there is one deviation from the published bovine C alpha protein sequence, aspartic acid 286 is exchanged by an asparagine. The C alpha mRNA was found to be expressed differentially in various bovine tissues.
