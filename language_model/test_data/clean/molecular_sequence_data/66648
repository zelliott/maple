We have studied the dynamics of de novo CpG methylation in the regulatory region of one of the homeobox gene HoxB5 during mouse development by sodium bisulfite sequencing. Methylation pattern was examined at embryonic day 18.5 and adult in kidney and spleen while in the liver the same exercise has been done in 11.5 dpc, 18.5 dpc, 5 dpp and in adult. In the liver at 11.5 dpc, all the 47 contiguous sites (including a CpG island from 2035 to 2330 bp) at 5' regulatory region of HoxB5 were unmethylated. Random methylation commences from 18.5 dpc and continues in 5 dpp and in the adult. In the kidney at 18.5 dpc, 26 CpGs were examined (excluding the CpG island region) and all of them were unmethylated but the fetal spleen had at least a few sites considerably methylated. In the adult there was a low level methylation in the kidney, on the other hand, in the spleen, all the CpGs were methylated except a few sites and certain sites were totally methylated. Thus in the adult, the level of methylation was much higher than in the fetal stage. On the other hand semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the extent of expression of HoxB5 was higher in embryonic stages than in the adult. Thus HoxB5 is a good paradigm to support that the developmental methylation of HoxB5 and its expression pattern show an inverse correlation.
