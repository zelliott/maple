A slightly yellowish, Gram-positive, filamentous with 'cross-like' branching, aerobic, spore-forming bacterium was isolated from enrichment culture during degradation of the thallus of the brown alga Fucus evanescens. The bacterium studied was chemoorganotrophic, tolerant to 3% NaCl, alkalitolerant, and alginolytic. The predominant cellular fatty acid was ai15:0 which accounted more than 65% of total fatty acids, while i14:0, il5:0 i16:0, and ai17:0 made up 25%. DNA base composition was 37 mol% GC. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA gene revealed that this isolate was a member of the genus Bacillus, with no close relatives at the species level (16S rRNA gene sequence similarity less 97%). On the basis of the significant differences demonstrated in the phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, it is suggested that the bacterium be classified as a novel species; the name Bacillus algicola sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KMM 3737T (= CIP 107850T).
