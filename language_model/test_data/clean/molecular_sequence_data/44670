The complete amino acid sequence of human placental oxytocinase (placental leucine aminopeptidase) has been determined by cDNA cloning and sequencing. Oxytocinase is a type II integral membrane protein of 1025 amino acid residues, consisting of an acidic intracellular region of 110 amino acids followed by a hydrophobic transmembrane segment of 22 residues and 893 extracellular residues containing the characteristic Zn2+ coordination sequence element His-Glu-Xaa-Xaa-His-(18 residues)-Glu found in gluzincins. Two sets of cDNA clones with different 5'-ends were isolated and suggested to represent different spliced products of 3.6 kb (mature mRNA) and 12 kb, respectively. Oxytocinase mRNA is present in large amounts in placenta, heart and skeletal muscle and in small amounts in brain, kidney, liver and pancreas. A conserved sequence element, the GAMEN motif, which distinguishes the aminopeptidase family among gluzincins from other gluzincins, has been identified.
