DNA damage-dependent signaling by the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system is thought to mediate cytotoxicity of the anti-tumor drug cisplatin through molecular mechanisms that could differ from those required for normal mismatch repair. The present study investigated whether ATP-dependent biochemical properties of Escherichia coli MutS protein differ when the protein interacts with a DNA oligonucleotide containing a GT mismatch versus a unique site specifically placed cisplatin compound lesion, a cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG) intrastrand cross-link with a mispaired thymine opposite the 3' platinated guanine. MutS exhibited substantial affinity for this compound lesion in hydrolytic and in non-hydrolytic conditions of ATP, contrasting with the normal nucleotide inhibition effect of mispair binding. The cisplatin compound lesion was also shown to stimulate poorly MutS ATPase activity to approach the hydrolysis rate induced by nonspecific DNA. Moreover, MutS undergoes distinct conformation changes in the presence of the compound lesion and ATP under hydrolytic conditions as shown by limited proteolysis. In the absence of MutS, the cisplatin compound lesion was shown to induce a 39 degrees rigid bending of the DNA double helix contrasting with an unbent state for DNA containing a GT mispair. Furthermore, an unbent DNA substrate containing a monofunctional adduct mimicking a cisplatin residue failed to form a persistent nucleoprotein complex with MutS in the presence of adenine nucleotide. We propose that DNA bending could play a role in MutS biochemical modulations induced by a compound lesion and that cisplatin DNA damage signaling by the MMR system could be modulated in a direct mode.
