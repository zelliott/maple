cDNA clones of the myb-related genes A-myb and B-myb were obtained by screening human cDNA libraries. The predicted open reading frame of B-myb could encode a protein of 700 amino acid residues. Although the C-terminal end has not been cloned yet, an almost entire coding region of A-myb, which is 745 amino acid long, was determined. The A-myb and B-myb proteins are highly homologous with the myb protein in three regions. Domain I, which is 161 amino acid long, is well conserved in the myb gene family. The homology between human-myb and A-myb in domain I is 90% at the amino acid level. Domain II, which is about 85 amino acid long, is less well conserved. Although it is a short stretch, domain III is found in the C-terminal region. The mRNAs of A-myb and B-myb were 5.0 and 2.6 kb, respectively. The mRNA expression pattern of the myb gene family in various tumors is presented.
