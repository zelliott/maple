Molecular and biochemical studies of somatic embryogenesis may help to shed light on the mechanisms governing this phenomenon. In this article, a differential display analysis approach was employed to investigate the changes taking place during the induction of somatic embryogenesis in leaf explants and suspension cultures of coffee. Cloned fragments show homologies to several proteins reported in databases, but only one has previously been described as regulated during somatic embryogenesis. By a reverse dot blot modification, the expression pattern of such fragments was evaluated.
