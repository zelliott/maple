The dominant immune response to rat myelin basic protein in H-2u mice is directed against the acetylated, N-terminal peptide Ac1-11 (AcASQKR-PSQRHG). This peptide causes encephalomyelitis on injection into mice of the H-2u haplotype. Only two residues of the peptide are required for ligation of the TCR from an Ac1-11-specific T cell hybridoma. Proline at position 6 could not be substituted by any other L-amino acid, whereas glutamine at position 3 could be replaced by phenylalanine, histidine, methionine, or tyrosine. Cross-reactive recognition of these residues appears to be specific, because increasing the affinity of each analogue for its MHC restriction element, by replacing lysine with tyrosine at position 4, did not alter the pattern of cross-reactivity. For the majority of substitutions at this position, a lack of stimulation could not be explained by failure to bind to I-Au. However, competition binding studies showed that introduction of proline at position 3 reduced the efficacy of binding to I-Au. Cross-reactive analogues of Ac1-11 were injected into H-2u mice to test the extent to which cross-reactive T cell activation might lead to autoimmune disease in this model. An analogue containing methionine at position 3 caused clinical experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in a small percentage of H-2u mice.
