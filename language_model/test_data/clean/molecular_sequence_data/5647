The general transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) plays an essential role in transcription of protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase II. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to assess the role of conserved amino acids in several important regions of yeast TFIIB. These include residues in the highly conserved amino-terminal region and basic residues in the D1 and E1 core domain alpha-helices. Acidic substitutions of residues K190 (D1) and K201 (E1) resulted in growth impairments in vivo, reduced basal transcriptional activity in vitro, and an inability to form stable TFIIB-TATA-binding protein-DNA (DB) complexes. Significantly, these mutants retained the ability to respond to acidic activators in vivo and to the Gal4-VP16 activator in vitro, supporting the view that these basic residues play a role in basal transcription. In addition, 14 single-amino-acid substitutions were introduced in the conserved amino-terminal region. Three of these mutants, the L50D, R64E, and R78L mutants, displayed altered growth properties in vivo and were compromised for supporting transcription in vitro. The L50D mutant was impaired for RNA polymerase II interaction, while the R64E mutant exhibited altered transcription start site selection both in vitro and in vivo and, surprisingly, was more active than the wild type in the formation of stable DB complexes. These results support the view that the amino-terminal domain is involved in the direct interaction between yeast TFIIB and RNA polymerase II and suggest that this domain may interact with DNA and/or modulate the formation of a DB complex.
