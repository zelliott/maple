Nuclear hormone receptors activate gene transcription through ligand-dependent association with coactivators. Specific LXXLL sequence motifs present in these cofactors are sufficient to mediate these ligand-induced interactions. A thyroid hormone receptor (TR)-binding protein (TRBP) was cloned by a Sos-Ras yeast two-hybrid system using TRbeta1-ligand binding domain as bait. TRBP contains 2063 amino acid residues, associates with TR through a LXXLL motif, and is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of tissues and cells. TRBP strongly transactivates through TRbeta1 and estrogen receptor in a dose-related and ligand-dependent manner, and also exhibits coactivation through AP-1, CRE, and NFkappaB-response elements, similar to the general coactivator CBP/p300. The C terminus of TRBP binds to CBP/p300 and DRIP130, a component of the DRIP/TRAP/ARC complex, which suggests that TRBP may activate transcription by means of such interactions. Further, the association of TRBP with the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex and DNA-independent phosphorylation of TRBP C terminus by DNA-PK point to a potential connection between transcriptional control and chromatin architecture regulation.
