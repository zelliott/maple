Constitution of the photosystem I complex isolated from the cyanobacterium Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421 was investigated by tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE, followed by peptide mass fingerprinting or N-terminal sequencing. Eight subunits (PsaA, PsaB, PsaC, PsaD, PsaE, PsaF, PsaL and PsaM) were identified as predicted from the genome sequence. A novel subunit (PsaZ) was discovered, but PsaI, PsaJ, PsaK and PsaX were absent. PsaB has a C-terminal extension with 155 amino acids in addition to the conserved region and this domain is similar to the peptidoglycan-binding domain. These results suggest that PS I complexes of G. violaceus have unique structural properties.
