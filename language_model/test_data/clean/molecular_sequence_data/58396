The Anopheles gambiae gene encoding tryptophan oxygenase, a homolog of the Drosophila melanogaster vermilion gene, has been molecularly cloned and characterized. Unlike Drosophila, where it is X-linked, the A. gambiae gene maps to chromosome 2R, subdivision 12E, by in situ hybridization to the polytene chromosomes. Of the six introns present, four are positioned identically to those of the Drosophila homolog, one is similarly positioned, and one is novel. A 1 955 nt cDNA potentially encodes a 392 amino acid protein of an estimated 45 kDa. Amino acid comparisons between the deduced protein and previously known tryptophan oxygenases revealed 74% identity between Anopheles and Drosophila, and 53% identity between Anopheles and nematode or mammalian proteins. Northern analysis detected a developmentally regulated transcript about 2 kb in length. Since this gene is known to control adult eye color in other flies, its cloning from A. gambiae provides the basis for a dominant phenotypic marker for germline transformation, one whose expression, unlike that of white, is not cell autonomous.
