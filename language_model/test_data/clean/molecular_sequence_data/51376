We have previously isolated mannoside and xylomannoside oligosaccharides with one or two terminal reducing N-acetylglucosamine residues from the extracellular medium of white campion (Silene alba) suspension culture. We have now demonstrated the presence of peptide-N4-(N-acetylglucosaminyl)asparagine amidase (PNGase) activity in cell extracts as well in the culture medium that could explain the production of those compounds. An additional xylomannoside, (GlcNAc)Man3(Xyl)GlcNAc(Fuc)GlcNAc, was characterized, and 1H- and 13C-NMR assignments for the oligosaccharide Man3(Xyl)GlcNAc(Fuc)GlcNAc were obtained using homonuclear and heteronuclear spectroscopy (COSY).
