The adenylate cyclase (AC) toxin (CyaA) of Bordetella pertussis has an invasive catalytic domain (AC domain) which penetrates the cytoplasmic membrane of a variety of eukaryotic cells and intoxicates them by unregulated synthesis of cyclic AMP. Previous work led to identification of five permissive sites in the AC domain at which heterologous peptides are accommodated without affecting its enzymatic properties. We have constructed a set of CyaA toxins tagged at these permissive sites by insertion of a CD8+ T-cell epitope, RPQASGVYMGNLTAQ, from the nucleoprotein of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Introduction of the epitope at any of the five sites did not affect the capacity of the toxin to deliver its AC domain into target cells. Moreover, the toxin with the inserted epitope was shown to sensitize target cells for lysis by epitope-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro, showing that the tagged AC was processed for presentation of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus epitope in association with the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. This finding indicates that by virtue of delivery of foreign epitopes into the antigen-presenting cells, purpose-designed recombinant CyaAs may be useful for induction of specific major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted cell-mediated immunity also in vivo.
