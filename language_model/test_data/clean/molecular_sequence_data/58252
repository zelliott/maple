The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor involved in the regulation of sodium homeostasis. Two distinct mRNA isoforms of the human MR (hMR) differing in their untranslated 5'-ends have recently been identified, suggesting the existence of alternative promoters. To eludicate the regulatory mechanisms controlling hMR gene expression, we have isolated and characterized approximately 15 kb of hMR 5'-flanking region. Various deletion mutants of regions located immediately upstream of the untranslated exons 1 alpha and 1 beta (P1: 1 kb and P2: 1.7 kb, respectively) were inserted into a luciferase reporter gene and used in transient transfection experiments in CV-1 and human differentiated renal H5 cells. Both regions were shown to possess significant functional promoter activity, more pronounced in renal cells, although P1 directed higher levels of basal transcription. Cotransfection experiments with hMR or human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) revealed that, while both promoters were glucocorticoid inducible, only the distal P2 promoter was stimulated by aldosterone in a dose- and hMR-dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that hMR and hGR are able to synergistically activate the P2 promoter, consistent with cooperativity between the two transduction pathways. Mineralocorticoid induction was localized to a region between -318 and +123 bp of P2. This region does not contain any consensus hormone responsive element, and direct binding of hMR to this DNA sequence was not observed, indicating that mineralocorticoid-induced transcriptional enhancement is mediated by nonclassical mechanisms. On the other hand, Sp1 and AP-2 bind to definite sequences on both promoters, suggesting that they represent important regulators of hMR promoter activity. Our results indicate that hMR gene expression is under the control of complex regulatory mechanisms involving alternative promoters and differential hormonal control, which might allow tissue-specific modulation of aldosterone action.
