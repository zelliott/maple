The expression of acid phosphatase (APase) from PHO5 and MF alpha-PHO5 hybrid genes is regulated by inorganic phosphate and mating type locus respectively, as well as the PHO4 and MAT alpha 1 gene products respectively. When PHO5 and MF alpha-PHO5 hybrid genes were cloned in the BamHI site of the pBR322 sequence of the yeast shuttle vectors (YRp7 or YEp9T), in one orientation they were regulated normally but in the other orientation their expression was not regulated but expressed constitutively. The pBR322 sequences present upstream of the inserted genes are responsible for the constitutive expression. By replacing the PHO5 upstream activating sequences (UAS) element with pBR322 fragments, we have identified three pBR322 sequences, from nucleotides 376 to 650, 2068 to 2116 and 2136 to 2247, which were able to promote expression of APase. A comparison of these three pBR322 fragments revealed 5' ATCGCGCGAG 3' and 5' CGGTGATGNCGG 3' to be the common sequences likely to act as UASs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By using synthetic oligonucleotides, it was found that both sequences are required for maximum expression of APase activity.
