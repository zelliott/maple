Three new triterpenoidal saponins (1-3), together with the known compound 4, were isolated from a MeOH extract of the aerial parts of Gynostemma pentaphyllum. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of chemical and spectral methods, such as 1H-1H DQFCOSY, HMQC, HMBC, and TOCSY NMR spectra. The aglycon moiety of 1 and 2 is a new dammarane-type triterpene 12-oxo-2 alpha, 3 beta, 20 (S)-trihydroxydammar- 24-ene.
