The avian packaging cell line SE21Q1b produces particles which encapsidate cellular RNAs. Such RNAs can be reverse transcribed by endogenous polymerase and integrated into the genomes of newly infected cells (M. Linial, Cell 49:93-102, 1987). Genomic RNA is not packaged because the packaging (psi) region of the provirus is deleted. The provirus also lacks the negative-strand primer binding site, which prevents efficient reverse transcription of randomly packaged genomic RNA. Previous work from our laboratory suggested that the trans-acting defect which allows packaging of cellular mRNA mapped to the provirus but did not map to the nucleocapsid region of the gag gene (D.J. Anderson, P. Lee, K. L. Levine, J. Sang, S. A. Shah, O. O. Yang, P. R. Shank, and M. L. Linial, J. Virol. 66:204-216, 1992). We have found, using proviral recombinants between SE21Q1b and wild-type Rous sarcoma virus, that packaging of cellular RNAs does not map to the gag gene. Rather, the propensity of SE21Q1b particles to package cellular mRNA is a function of the high level of particle production in these cells and not of any specific viral structural proteins.
