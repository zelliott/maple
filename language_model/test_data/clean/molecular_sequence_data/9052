Lactobacillus fructivorans is important in the generation of particular flavors and in other ripening processes associated with fermented food. Here, we present the draft genome sequence of the type strain Lactobacillus fructivorans KCTC 3543 (1,373,326 bp, with a G+C content of 38.9%), which consists of 5 scaffolds. The genome sequence was obtained by using a whole-genome shotgun strategy with Roche 454 GS (FLX Titanium) pyrosequencing, and all of the reads were assembled using Newbler Assembler 2.3.
