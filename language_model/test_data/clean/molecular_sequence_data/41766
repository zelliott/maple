Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I) induces adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and a chronic neurological disease named either tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) or HTLV-I associated myelopathy (HAM). We report here the establishment and characterization of eight HTLV-I-infected lymphoid cell lines derived either from patients with TSP (5) or from asymptomatic carriers (1). Southern blot analysis of T cell beta chain gene rearrangements indicates that all cell lines are composed of clonal populations. The same type of analysis performed with HTLV-I-specific probes showed that they harbor 1 to 5 copies of full length proviruses often associated with deleted proviruses with a restriction map for BamHI, HindIII, PstI and SacI restriction enzymes resembling those of HTLV-I previously isolated from Japan and Caribbean area. One of the cell lines, 2060, derived from a TSP patient was shown to express a relative large amount of virus easily transmissible to fresh peripheral and cord blood lymphocytes. The full length proviral genome contained in this cell line was cloned and used in transient expression experiments. We showed that the cloned provirus was able to direct the synthesis of the major structural viral proteins, the protease and the tax and rex regulatory proteins. The structural viral proteins could be assembled into free particles detected in the culture medium of transfected cells. Although the infectivity of these viral particles remains to be determined, this new clone can be employed to examine the cell types in which this TSP-derived provirus directs viral protein synthesis and eventually replicates. It should also prove of value in studies on the early cellular events induced by viral products.
