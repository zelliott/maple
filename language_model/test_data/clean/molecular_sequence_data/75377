The mouse T-cell lymphoma cell line EL4.E1 constitutively synthesizes mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) transcripts encoding either the entire proviral genome or segments of it. In addition to these conventional mRNAs, however, an mRNA of about 1 kilobase accumulates after induction of these cells with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The accumulation of this transcript is strongly inhibited by the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A. Its pattern of induction by PMA and suppression by cyclosporin A is thus the same as seen for several lymphokine mRNAs in these cells, including interleukin-2 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The short MMTV transcript is the most abundant PMA-induced transcript in EL4.E1 cells, but was not found in a series of other leukocyte tumor cell lines. It is initiated from a novel promoter within the env gene, and a segment of 1,161 nucleotides is then spliced out. The major part of the transcript is a copy of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of MMTV. The MMTV proviral genomes in these cells, and the short transcript, contain a 491-nucleotide deletion in the LTR compared with the normal MMTV provirus. The resulting open reading frame could encode a protein of molecular weight 22,800, which is a likely candidate for an LTR-related protein with a similar molecular weight recently described in this system (J. Racevskis, J. Virol. 58:441-449, 1986).
