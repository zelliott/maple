The nuclear genes (acp-1, ACP1) encoding the mitochondrial acyl carrier protein were disrupted in Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In n. crassa acp-1 is a peripheral subunit of the respiratory NADH : ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I). S. cerevisiae lacks complex I and its ACP1 appears to be located in the mitochondrial matrix. The loss of acp-1 in N. crassa causes two biochemical lesions. Firstly, the peripheral part of complex I is not assembled, and the membrane part is not properly assembled. The respiratory ubiquinol : cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex III) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) are made in normal amounts. Secondly, the lysophospholipid content of mitochondrial membranes is increased four-fold. In S. cerevisiae, the loss of ACP1 leads to a pleiotropic respiratory deficient phenotype.
