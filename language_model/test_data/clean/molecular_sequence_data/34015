The development of methodology that is designed to allow a significant increase in the patterning and in the functionalization of the dendrimer is the ultimate goal of the research described here. Glycoside clusters based on TRIS were formed using click chemistry and were attached to PAMAM dendrimers. A series of dendrimers bearing tris-mannoside and an ethoxyethanol group was synthesized, and the binding interactions of these dendrimers with Concanavalin A were evaluated using inhibition ELISAs. The results of the inhibition ELISAs suggest that tris-mannoside clusters can replace individual sugars on the dendrimer without loss of function. Since tris-mannoside clustering allows for a redistribution of the dendrimers' surface functionalities, from this chemistry one can envision patterned dendrimers that incorporate multiple groups to increase the function and utility of the dendrimer.
