To examine the relationships of two polymorphisms of platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib alpha and coronary artery diseases (CAD) in Japanese patients, we conducted a case-control study with 158 Japanese patients and 169 control subjects. The frequencies of HPA-2 polymorphism and the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms in the macroglycopeptide region did not significantly differ between CAD patients and control subjects. The polymorphisms of GPIb alpha were not associated with the number of affected vessels in CAD patients. When patients with acute coronary syndrome only were analyzed, the frequencies of the two polymorphisms of GPIb alpha showed no significant difference. Although plasma von Willebrand antigen (vWF:Ag) levels in patients were significantly higher than in controls, no association between vWF concentration and GPIb genotypes was observed. In patient groups with higher or lower vWF:Ag concentrations, no increase in the frequencies of Met145 or larger VNTR polymorphisms was seen in either group. Our findings indicate that no association exists between the frequencies of the two polymorphisms of GPIb alpha and CAD.
