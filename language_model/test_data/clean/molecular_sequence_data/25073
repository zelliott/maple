The Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. minD gene (AtMinD1) was isolated and constitutively expressed in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) plants using the CaMV 35S promoter. Confocal and electron-microscopic analysis of the AtMinD1 transgenic tobacco lines revealed that the chloroplasts were abnormally large and fewer in number compared with wild-type tobacco plants. The abnormal chloroplasts were less prevalent in guard cells than in mesophyll cells. Chloroplast and nuclear gene expression was not significantly different in AtMinD1-overexpressing plants relative to wild-type tobacco plants. Chloroplast DNA copy number was not affected, based on the relative level of the rbcL gene in transgenic plants. Transgenic tobacco plants constitutively overexpressing AtMinD1 were completely normal phenotypically with respect to growth and development, and also displayed normal photosynthetic electron transport rates. These results show that the Arabidopsis MinD1 gene also functions in a heterologous system and confirm the role of the MinD protein in regulation of chloroplast division.
