We have designed two software systems allowing the study of proteins through a comparison to those stored in data banks. The first one, "Automat", locates in a systematic manner all identities shared by a given protein and the proteins in a data bank. The second, "Critic" enables the selection of specific segments in a given molecule by comparing them with those gathered in a data bank. These sites were termed "critical" since they mostly correspond to functional sites (active sites) of the well-known proteins which were studied with the aid of this program (somatostatin, insulin, IL2, etc). Automat allowed us to reveal homologies between HIV-1 and the CD4, which have remained unsolved until now. These similitudes proved to be critical sites (according to Critic). The putative involvement of these sites in the physiopathological processes as induced by HIV-1 are worth considering since the results of our experiments are consistent with this assumption.
