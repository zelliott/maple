Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a murine coronavirus known to cause encephalitis and demyelination, uses murine homologues of carcinoembryonic antigens as receptors. However, the expression of these receptors is extremely low in the brain. By low-stringency screening of a mouse brain cDNA library, we have identified a member of the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) subgroup of the carcinoembryonic antigen gene family. Unlike other PSG that are expressed in the placenta, it is expressed predominantly in the brain. Transfection of the cDNA into COS-7 cells, which lack a functional MHV receptor, conferred susceptibility to infection by some MHV strains, including A59, MHV-2, and MHV-3, but not JHM. Thus, this is a virus strain-specific receptor. The detection of multiple receptors for MHV suggests the flexibility of this virus in receptor utilization. The identification of this virus in receptor utilization. The identification of a PSG predominantly expressed in the brain also expands the potential functions of these molecules.
