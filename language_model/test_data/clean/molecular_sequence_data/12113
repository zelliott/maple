A 2.8-kb HindIII fragment, containing three open reading frames, has been cloned and sequenced from Clostridium litorale. The first gene grdA encoded the selenocysteine-containing protein PA of the glycine reductase complex, a protein of 159 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 16.7 kDa. The second gene (grdB) encoded the 47-kDa subunit of the substrate-specific selenoprotein PB glycine that is composed of 437 amino acids. The third gene contained the 5'-region of the gene for thioredoxin reductase, trxB. All gene products shared high similarity with the corresponding proteins from Eubacterium acidaminophilum. In both genes grdA and grdB, the opal termination codon (TGA) was found inframe, indicating the presence of selenocysteine in both polypeptides. Northern-blot analysis showed that grdA and grdB are organized as one operon. Unlike Escherichia coli, no stable secondary structures of the corresponding mRNA were found immediately downstream of the UGA codons to direct an insertion of selenocysteine into the grdA and grdB transcripts of C. litorale. Instead, a secondary structure was identified in the 3'-untranslated region of grdB.
