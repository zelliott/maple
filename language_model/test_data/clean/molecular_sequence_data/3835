The structural genes for the two-peptide bacteriocin enterocin 1071 (Ent1071) in Enterococcus faecalis FAIR-E 309 were cloned. DNA sequence analysis showed that the enterocin 1071A (Ent1071A) peptide of strain FAIR-E 309 differed by two amino acids from the Ent1071A reported for E. faecalis BFE 1071 (E. Balla, L. M. T. Dicks, M. Du Toit, M. J. van der Merwe, and W. H. Holzapfel, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 66:1298-1304, 2000), while the Ent1071B gene encoded identical peptides in these strains. However, resequencing of ent1071A from E. faecalis BFE 1071 showed that the Ent1071A peptide sequence reported previously was incorrect in two amino acids. Also, ent1071B in E. faecalis FAIR-E 309 encoded a prepeptide that was three amino acids shorter than that previously reported for E. faecalis BFE 1071 Ent1071B. A presumptive immunity gene (eni1071) was located downstream of the bacteriocin structural genes. This gene was cloned into the heterologous host E. faecalis ATCC 19433 and was shown to confer immunity. A truncated ABC transporter gene was located upstream of the Ent1071 structural genes.
