Our laboratory has identified at least two types of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) that exist in canine arteries and veins: type 1 cells, located in the media express muscle specific proteins but do not proliferate in culture; and type 2 cells, located in both media and adventitia, do not express muscle specific protein but proliferate in culture. Plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPases (PMCAs) have been implicated in proliferation control. The present study examines the expression of PMCA isoforms and calmodulin-binding domain splice variants in these two types of canine VSMCs. PMCA protein was found in both type 1 and type 2 cells. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays were developed for canine PMCA calmodulin-binding domain splice variants. We cloned and sequenced isolates corresponding to PMCA1b, 4a and 4b from canine VSMCs. PMCA 2 and 3 were not detected. Freshly isolated type 1 cells expressed PMCA 1b, 4a and 4b, while freshly isolated type 2 cells expressed PMCA1b and 4b. Upon placement in culture, type 2 cells originating from either carotid artery or saphenous vein demonstrated a time-dependent upregulation of PMCA4a mRNA. Treatment with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin produced concentration-dependent inhibition of both PMCA4a upregulation and [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. These findings suggest a role for phosphoinositide 3-kinase in regulating PMCA expression, which may be important in the control of Ca(2+)-sensitive VSMC functions.
