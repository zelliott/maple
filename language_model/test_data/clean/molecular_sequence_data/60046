The cDNA and inferred amino acid sequences were determined for beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) erythroid (E) and housekeeping (H) forms of 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALS), and they were compared with known sequences for five other vertebrates with particular attention to regulatory features. The cDNAs for whale ALS-E and -H encode, respectively, proteins of 582 and 640 amino acids. Sequence alignments suggest that the whale ALS-H, like those for rat and chicken, has an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence of 56 amino acids. There is a high degree of amino acid conservation between the beluga whale proteins and those of other vertebrates, including regulatory elements and functional residues that have been defined in other ALSs. Both whale proteins contain three heme regulatory motifs suggesting that mitochondrial uptake may be regulated by heme. The ALS-E mRNA contains an iron responsive element in its 5'-untranslated region indicating that its expression may be post-transcriptionally regulated by cellular iron. This extensive structural similarity and the presence of the same regulatory elements found in other ALSs indicate that regulation of ALS in beluga whale is similar to that in other vertebrates.
