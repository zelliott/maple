Antimicrobial peptides represent the most characterized and diverse class of peptides within the defensive skin secretions of anuran amphibians. With an ever expanding database of primary structures, the current accepted rules for nomenclature have become increasingly difficult to apply to peptides whose primary structural attributes are either unique or that fall between those that define existing groups. An additional factor that adds to the confusion is the regular re-classification or revision of existing taxa. In the present study, we have identified five new antimicrobial peptide homologs in the defensive skin secretion of the Chinese piebald odorous frog, Huia schmackeri (formerly Rana (Odorrana) schmackeri), by cloning of their respective biosynthetic precursors. As these peptides are obvious homologs of the brevinin-1 and brevinin-2 families we have named these in accordance: (1) brevinin-1HS1, (2) brevinin-2HS1, (3) brevinin-2HS2, (4) brevinin-2HS3 and (5) brevinin-1HS2. The reasons for adopting these names are discussed. It is clear that with an ever-increasing number of amphibian skin antimicrobial peptides appearing in the literature that a consistent nomenclature scheme needs to be established.
