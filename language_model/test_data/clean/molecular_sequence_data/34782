A recent study revealed a subfamily of N6-adenine (m6A) methyltransferases that comprises a few functionally studied eukaryotic members acting on mRNA and prokaryotic members acting on DNA as well as numerous uncharacterized open reading frames. Here, we report cloning and functional characterization of a prokaryotic member of this family encoded by transposon Tn1549 from Enterococcus spp.
