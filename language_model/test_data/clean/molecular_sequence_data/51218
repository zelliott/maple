In Lymnaea stagnalis, three members of the FMRFamide peptide family have been chemically identified in the central nervous system, and other members of the family are predicted by cDNA studies. The present study demonstrates the occurrence of even more FMRFamide-related peptides in this species by identifying a novel member of this family. The peptide was purified from brain extracts by three different HPLC steps. Its amino acid sequence has been determined as Ser-Lys-Pro-Tyr-Met-Arg-Phe-amide (SKPYMRFamide).
