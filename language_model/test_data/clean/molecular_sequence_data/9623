Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is an inducible cytokine that is essential for the normal growth and development of various tissues, such as the liver. To decipher the molecular mechanisms that regulate HGF gene induction at the transcriptional level, we carried out in vitro and in vivo studies on the mouse HGF gene promoter. We have identified a novel regulatory element, located between -6 and +7 bp (from the transcription start site) in the HGF basal promoter region, which binds to inducible transcription factors and dictates responsiveness to extracellular stimuli that activate this gene. The core binding sequence for the inducible cis-acting factors was determined to be TTTGCAA (-4 to +3 bp) within the HGF promoter. Competition and gel mobility supershift assays showed that these binding complexes are composed of C/EBPbeta (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta) and C/EBPdelta. DNA binding analysis also revealed that the binding site for the C/EBP family of transcription factors in the HGF promoter region overlaps that of another binding protein (complex C1), which binds specifically to a novel sequence with a core binding site of ACCGGT located adjacent to the C/EBP site (-9 to -4 bp). C1 binds to this region of the promoter and represses the inducible upregulation by C/EBP through direct competition for their individual binding sites. Partial hepatectomy, which is known to activate HGF gene expression in the liver, increased C/EBP (especially C/EBPbeta) binding activity to this region of the HGF promoter. Thus, our present results provide a mechanistic explanation for the transcriptional induction of the HGF gene by extracellular signals (i.e., cytokines) that induce tissue growth and regeneration.
