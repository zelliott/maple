The production of substance P (SP) and the mRNA encoding its precursor preprotachykinin (PPT) is regulated by nerve growth factor (NGF) in dorsal root ganglion neurons. We have shown previously that two regions of the bovine PPT promoter are capable of mediating the induction by NGF of the downstream structural gene in transfected PC12 cells. Both regions contained a sequence element, similar to a known transcription factor binding site, which is present in several other NGF-regulated genes. We show here that PC12 cells contain a single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSBP-PC12) which can interact specifically with this site. Binding activity was increased by NGF treatment of PC12 cells.
