Persistent right aortic arch (PRAA) is a congenital vascular ring anomaly common in several dog breeds. In German Pinscher, the disorder is characterized by a left retroesophageal subclavian artery in combination with a ligamentum arteriosum originating at the aberrant left subclavian artery (PRAA-SA-LA). In this study, we genotyped 38 microsatellite markers on canine chromosome 26 (CFA26) in German Pinschers and tested them for linkage and association. We found a chromosome-wide significantly linked genomic region on CFA26, which corresponds to the human DiGeorge syndrome critical region (DGCR). Therefore, we analyzed sequences from 13 genes of DGCR and the canine t-box gene TBX1. We identified a total of 26 polymorphisms in German Pinschers. Three of these SNPs located within TBX1 and one in the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L40 gene (MRPL40) were associated with the PRAA-SA-LA phenotype in German Pinscher. Despite linkage and association between PRAA-SA-LA and the canine DGCR, none of these mutations appeared responsible for PRAA-SA-LA. As the orthologue human region on HSA22q11.2 is known for high susceptibility to genomic rearrangements, we suspect that in German Pinschers, chromosomal aberrations might cause PRAA-SA-LA.
