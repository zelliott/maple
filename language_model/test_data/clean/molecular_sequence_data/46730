We have cloned and characterized a novel zinc finger protein, termed JAZ. JAZ contains four C(2)H(2)-type zinc finger motifs that are connected by long (28-38) amino acid linker sequences. JAZ is expressed in all tissues tested and localizes in the nucleus, primarily the nucleolus. JAZ preferentially binds to double-stranded (ds) RNA or RNA/DNA hybrids rather than DNA. Mutation of individual zinc finger motifs reveals that the zinc finger domains are not only essential for dsRNA binding but are also required for its nucleolar localization, which demonstrates a complex trafficking mechanism dependent on the nucleic acid-binding capability of the protein. Furthermore, forced expression of JAZ potently induces apoptosis in murine fibroblast cells. Thus, JAZ may belong to a class of zinc finger proteins that features dsRNA binding and may regulate cell growth via the unique dsRNA binding properties.
