To evaluate the polymorphism and conservation of the major histocompatibility complex class Ib molecule Qa1 in wild mouse populations, we determined the nucleotide sequence of exons 1-3 of Qa1 of eight mouse haplotypes derived from wild mice, including Mus musculus domesticus, M. m. castaneus, M. m. bactrianus, and M. spretus, as well as two t haplotypes. Our data identify eight new alleles of Qa1. Taken together with previously published data on Qa1 among the common laboratory inbred strains, and in agreement with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte, serological, and biochemical data, these results further confirm the existence of two families of Qa1 molecules, Qa1(a)-like and Qa1(b)-like, and illuminate the extreme conservation of the peptide-binding region of these molecules, even across species.
