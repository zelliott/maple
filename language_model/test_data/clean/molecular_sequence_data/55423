In this study, the traditional culture-based technique and the 16S rDNA sequencing method were used to investigate the characterization of bacterial community in the stomach contents and mucus of yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco). The culture-based technique disclosed that the average bacterial numbers in the gastric contents and mucus were 5.79 × 10(7) cfu/g (cfu: colony forming unit) and 1.89 × 10(5) cfu/g, respectively. Several different bacteria were obtained from gastric contents, including species from genera Bradyrhizobium, Phyllobacterium, Plesiomonas, Hafnia, Edwardsiella, Pseudomonas, and Bacillus. However, only two species were isolated from the gastric mucus, including species from genera Plesiomonas and Aeromonas. Forty-five phylotypes were observed from the 65 positive clones from the stomach contents (library SC); nineteen phylotypes were detected from the 45 clones from the stomach mucus (library SM). Further analyses revealed that the fish stomach harbored characteristic microbiota, where Firmicutes was dominant, followed by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria. This characterization of bacterial community is markedly different from that of the fish intestine, where Proteobacteria is predominant, followed by Fusobacteria and Firmicutes. Chloroflexi (1.5%) was only found in the library SC, while Actinobacteria (4.4%) was only found in the library SM, suggesting that microbiota of GI contents was quite different from that of GI mucus. In addition, several species of bacteria found in the stomach may be potentially opportunistic pathogens, indicating that fish digestive tract is a reservoir for many nosocomial pathogens.
