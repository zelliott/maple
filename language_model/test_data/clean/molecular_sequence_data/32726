The gene encoding for B. intermedius glutamyl endopeptidase (gseBi) has previously been cloned and its nucleotide sequence analyzed. In this study, the expression of this gene was explored in protease-deficient strain B. subtilis AJ73 during stationary phase of bacterial growth. We found that catabolite repression usually involved in control of endopeptidase expression during vegetative growth was not efficient at the late stationary phase. Testing of B. intermedius glutamyl endopeptidase gene expression with B. subtilis spo0-mutants revealed slight effect of these mutations on endopeptidase expression. Activity of glutamyl endopeptidase was partly left in B. subtilis ger-mutants. Probably, gseBi expression was not connected with sporulation. This enzyme might be involved in outgrowth of the spore, when germinating endospore converts into the vegetative cell. These data suggest complex regulation of B. intermedius glutamyl endopeptidase gene expression with contribution of several regulatory systems and demonstrate changes in control of enzyme biosynthesis at different stages of growth.
