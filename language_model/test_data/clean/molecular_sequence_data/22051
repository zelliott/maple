Among basidiomycetous yeast strains isolated from wilting leaves of various plants in China, two groups of Pseudozyma strains were distinguished from the others by morphological and physiological characterization. Molecular taxonomic analysis based on sequencing of the large subunit (26S) rRNA gene D1/D2 domain and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region confirmed that the two groups represent two novel species. They are proposed as Pseudozyma hubeiensis sp. nov. (type strain WS 6.4T = AS 2.2493T = CBS 10077T) and Pseudozyma shanxiensis sp. nov. (type strain SH 64T = AS 2.2523T = CBS 10075T). The phylogenetic relationships of the novel species with described Pseudozyma species and related ustilagomycetous teleomorphs were analysed based on the combined sequences of ITS and D1/D2. The phenotypic diagnosis of Pseudozyma was emended because of the negative inositol assimilation reaction of P. hubeiensis sp. nov., which was closely related to the type species of the genus, Pseudozyma prolifica.
