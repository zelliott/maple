A blood group B-specific lectin from the mushroom Marasmius oreades (MOA) was investigated with respect to its molecular structure and carbohydrate binding properties. SDS-PAGE mass spectrometric analysis showed it to consist of an intact (H; 33 kDa) and truncated (L; 23 kDa) subunit in addition to a small polypeptide (P; 10 kDa). Isolation in the presence of EDTA produced only the H subunits, indicating that the latter two are formed by metalloprotease cleavage of the intact H subunit. Tryptic digestion of the H, L, and P polypeptide chains followed by mass spectral analysis supports this view. The lectin strongly precipitated blood group type B substance, was nonreactive with type A substance, and reacted weakly with type H substance. Carbohydrate binding studies reveal a high affinity for Galalpha1,3Gal (but not for the isomeric alpha1,2-, alpha1,4-, and alpha1,6-disaccharides); Galalpha1,3Galbeta1,4GlcNAc; and the type B branched trisaccharide. MOA also reacts strongly with murine laminin from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma and bovine thyroglobulin, both of which contain multiple Galalpha1,3Galbeta1,4GlcNAc end groups. This linear B trisaccharide is a component of porcine tissues and organs, preventing their transplantation into humans. MOA also shares carbohydrate recognition of this trisaccharide with toxin A elaborated by Clostridium difficile.
