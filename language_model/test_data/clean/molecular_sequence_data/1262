A basic understanding of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, which, together with T-cell receptors, is a key player in antigen recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, is necessary to study the cellular immune response to intracellular pathogens. The MHC has hardly been reported in cynomolgus monkeys ( Macaca facicularis), although cynomolgus monkeys have been frequently used as the surrogate animal model. We attempted to determine the nucleotide sequences of the MHC class I A locus of cynomolgus monkeys ( Mafa-A) and eventually 34 independent sequences of Mafa-A were obtained from 29 cynomolgus monkeys. These 34 sequences were classified into 14 Mafa-A alleles according to the results of phylogenetic analyses using the neighbor-joining method. One to three Mafa-A alleles were obtained from a single animal. We also tried to establish a multiplex PCR-SSP method for convenient typing of Mafa-A alleles. cDNA from a family of cynomolgus monkeys, which is composed of four sirs and four dams, were examined by multiplex PCR-SSP. The result of multiplex PCR-SSP showed that an individual cynomolgus monkey had two or three Mafa-A alleles, suggesting that the A locus of cynomolgus monkeys might be duplicated.
