In an attempt to identify invertebrate homologs of Thy-1 antigen, the optic and central nervous tissue of squid was solubilized in deoxycholate and fractionated by lentil lectin affinity chromatography and gel filtration to yield small abundant glycoproteins. Material with biochemical similarities to Thy-1 was found and shown to consist of two glycoproteins that were ultimately purified using monoclonal antibody affinity columns. Both glycoproteins were sequenced to yield sequences of 84 residues for Sgp-1 and 92 residues for Sgp-2. The sequences were analyzed for similarities to Thy-1 and other Ig-related sequences, and Sgp-1 showed some similarities that were greater than 3 standard deviation units away from mean random scores when tested with the ALIGN program. However, the sequence patterns were not typical of Ig-related domains and the relationship of Sgp-1 to the Ig superfamily remains problematical. Sgp-2 showed no relationship to the Ig superfamily, but similarities to Ly-6 antigen sequences were noted that are in accord with an evolutionary relationship. The similarities included ten Cys residues in each sequence of which eight were matched in the best alignment given by the ALIGN program. Chemical evidence was obtained for glycophospholipid tails at the COOH-termini of Sgp-1 and Sgp-2 as is the case for Thy-1 and Ly-6 antigens.
