We characterized MLL3, a new human member of the TRX/MLL gene family. MLL3 is expressed in peripheral blood, placenta, pancreas, testes, and foetal thymus and is weakly expressed in heart, brain, lung, liver, and kidney. It encodes a predicted protein of 4911 amino acids containing two plant homeo domains (PHD), an ATPase alpha_beta signature, a high mobility group, a SET (Suppressor of variegation, Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax) and two FY (phenylalanine tyrosine)-rich domains. The amino acid sequence of the SET domain was used to obtain a phylogenetic tree of human MLL genes and their homologues in different species. MLL3 is closely related to human MLL2, Fugu mll2, a Caenorhabditis elegans predicted protein, and Drosophila trithorax-related protein. Interestingly, PHD and SET domains are frequently found in proteins encoded by genes that are rearranged in different haematological malignancies and MLL3 maps to 7q36, a chromosome region that is frequently deleted in myeloid disorders. Partial duplications of the MLL3 gene are found in the juxtacentromeric region of chromosomes 1, 2, 13, and 21.
