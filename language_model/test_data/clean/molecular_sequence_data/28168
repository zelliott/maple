We have identified the domain of the human c-myc protein (c-Myc) produced in Escherichia coli that is responsible for the ability of the protein to bind sequence-nonspecific DNA. Using analysis of binding of DNA by proteins transferred to nitrocellulose, DNA-cellulose chromatography, and a nitrocellulose filter binding assay, we examined the binding properties of c-Myc peptides generated by cyanogen bromide cleavage, of mutant c-Myc, and of proteins that fuse portions of c-Myc to staphylococcal protein A. The results of these analyses indicated that c-Myc amino acids 265 to 318 were responsible for DNA binding and that other regions of the protein (including a highly conserved basic region and a region containing the leucine zipper motif) were not required. Some mutant c-Mycs that did not bind DNA maintained rat embryo cell-cotransforming activity, which indicated that the c-Myc property of in vitro DNA binding was not essential for this activity. These mutants, however, were unable to transform established rat fibroblasts (Rat-1a cells) that were susceptible to transformation by wild-type c-Myc, although this lack of activity may not have been due to their inability to bind DNA.
