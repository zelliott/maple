Two genes encoding acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (thiolase I; EC 2.3.1.9), whose localization in peroxisomes was first found with an n-alkane-utilizing yeast, Candida tropicalis, were isolated from the lambda EMBL3 genomic DNA library prepared from the yeast genomic DNA. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that both genes contained open reading frames of 1209 bp corresponding to 403 amino acid residues with methionine at the N-terminus, which were named as thiolase IA and thiolase IB. The calculated molecular masses were 41,898 Da for thiolase IA and 41,930 Da for thiolase IB. These values were in good agreement with the subunit mass of the enzyme purified from yeast peroxisomes (41 kDa). There was an extremely high similarity between these two genes (96% of nucleotides in the coding regions and 98% of amino acids deduced). From the amino acid sequence analysis of the purified peroxisomal enzyme, it was shown that thiolase IA and thiolase IB were expressed in peroxisomes at an almost equal level. Both showed similarity to other thiolases, especially to Saccharomyces uvarum cytosolic acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (65% amino acids of thiolase IA and 64% of thiolase IB were identical with this thiolase). Considering the evolution of thiolases, the C. tropicalis thiolases and S. uvarum cytosolic acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase are supposed to have a common origin. It was noticeable that the carboxyl-terminal regions of thiolases IA and IB contained a putative peroxisomal targeting signal, -Ala-Lys-Leu-COOH, unlike those of other thiolases reported hitherto.
