Endonuclease NaeI cleaves DNA using a two-site mechanism. The DNA-binding sites are nonidentical: they recognize different families of flanking sequences. A unique NaeI site that is resistant to cleavage resides in M13 double-stranded DNA. NaeI can be activated to cleave this site by small DNA fragments containing one or more NaeI sites. These activators are not practical for genetic engineering because unphosphorylated activators that are consumed during the cleavage of substrate give ends that may interfere with subsequent ligations. We show that a DNA fragment containing phosphorothioate linkages at the NaeI scissile bonds (S-activator) is not cleaved by NaeI, even though this S-activator binds to the substrate site. The S-activator activates NaeI to cleave M13 DNA under conditions that completely exhaust unsubstituted activator. These results demonstrate that activation is not coupled to cleavage of activator, that NaeI reverts to its inactive state soon after dissociation of the EA complex, and that S-activator makes for a nondepletable activator during prolonged incubations.
