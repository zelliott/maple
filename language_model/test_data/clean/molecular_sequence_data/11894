Transgenic mice overexpressing the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in the thymus and central nervous system have a higher number of mononuclear cells in those tissues than do control littermates. In the thymus, there is a modest increase in the number of Mac-1 and F4/80 positive cells, but no apparent change in the number of lymphoid cells. A more pronounced mononuclear infiltrate is detected in transgenic mice expressing MCP-1 in the brain. The vast majority of the recruited cells in the brain are monocytes and macrophages, as defined by light microscopy, and ultrastructural and immunohistochemical criteria. Such cells are found in a perivascular orientation with minimal parenchymal infiltration, possibly as a consequence of the accumulation of MCP-1 in the vessels, as shown by immunohistochemistry. The mononuclear cell infiltrate in the brain can be significantly amplified by LPS treatment, suggesting that the recruitment properties of MCP-1 can be potentiated by additional factors.
