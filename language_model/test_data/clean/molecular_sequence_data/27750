The third cellulase gene (celC) of Bacillus sp. strain N-4 was cloned in plasmid pBR322 and was located within a 5.5-kb HindIII fragment. The cellulase encoded by this fragment had an Mr of about 100,000 and showed optimum activity around pH 9. These properties were different from those of the enzymes encoded by the celA and celB genes of the same organism. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence was found to be highly homologous to the CEL-F enzyme from Bacillus sp. strain No. 1139 [Fukumori et al., J. Gen. Microbiol. 132 (1986) 2329-2335]. An evolutionary relationship observed among the four cellulases of alkalophilic Bacillus strains and that of Bacillus subtilis endoglucanase suggested that ancestral genes for alkaline and neutral cellulases diverged early in the evolution of these enzymes.
