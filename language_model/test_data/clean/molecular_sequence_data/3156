Cell extracts from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis induced multinucleation in HEp-2 cells in a manner similar to the effect caused by Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF). The activity was not dependent on the Yersinia 70-kb virulence plasmid, and the activity was not inhibited by antibodies capable of neutralizing E. coli CNF type 1. The nucleotide sequence of the Yersinia cnf gene was 65.1% identical to the E. coli cnf gene.
