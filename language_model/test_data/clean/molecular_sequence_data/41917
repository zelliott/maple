Actin mRNA was characterised in hair-cell enriched fractions of the chick basilar papilla, by means of the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction technique. Primers were directed against the 3' untranslated portions of the actin mRNAs. Evidence for beta-cytoplasmic and gamma-cytoplasmic actin mRNA was found; no evidence was found for alpha-skeletal, alpha-cardiac or type 5 cytoplasmic actin mRNAs. Since beta-actin is known to form bundles of filaments whereas gamma-actin does not, this suggests that the hair-cell stereocilia are composed of beta-actin.
