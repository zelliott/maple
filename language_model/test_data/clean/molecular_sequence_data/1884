In the latent infection of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), its 160-kb circularized episomal DNA is replicated and maintained in the host nucleus. KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is a key factor for maintaining viral latency. LANA binds to the terminal repeat (TR) DNA of the viral genome, leading to its localization to specific dot structures in the nucleus. In such an infected cell, the expression of the viral genes is restricted by a mechanism that is still unclear. Here, we found that LANA interacts with SUV39H1 histone methyltransferase, a key component of heterochromatin formation, as determined by use of a DNA pull-down assay with a biotinylated DNA fragment that contained a LANA-specific binding sequence and a maltose-binding protein pull-down assay. The diffuse localization of LANA on the chromosomes of uninfected cells changed to a punctate one with the introduction of a bacterial artificial chromosome containing most of the TR region, and SUV39H1 clearly colocalized with the LANA-associated dots. Thus, the LANA foci in KSHV-infected cells seemed to include SUV39H1 as well as heterochromatin protein 1. Furthermore, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that the TR and the open reading frame (ORF) K1 and ORF50/RTA genes, but not the ORF73/LANA gene, lay within the heterochromatin during KSHV latency. Taken together, these observations indicate that LANA recruits heterochromatin components to the viral genome, which may lead to the establishment of viral latency and govern the transcription program.
