The hemagglutinin(HA) of influenza virus is a major glycoprotein and plays a crucial role in the early stage of virus infection: HA is responsible for binding of the virus to cell surface receptors, and it mediates liberation of the viral genome into the cytoplasm through membrane fusion. The essential component of the receptor for influenza viruses has been considered to be the sialic acid. Influenza A and B viruses recognize N-acetylneuraminic acid, whereas influenza C virus specifically recognizes N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid as the receptor. Influenza A viruses are subdivided into 15 subtypes by their antigenic differences, but several amino acid residues composing functional domains (receptor binding site and fusion peptide) are shown to be conserved among HAs.
