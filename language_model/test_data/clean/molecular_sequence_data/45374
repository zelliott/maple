The novel species Metschnikowia aberdeeniae is described to accommodate five isolates recovered from insects of morning glory flowers in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. On the basis of rDNA ITS and D1/D2 large-subunit sequences, these yeasts form, together with six other isolates, a novel subclade of large-spored Metschnikowia species. The exact position of the subclade within the Metschnikowiaceae cannot be determined with any confidence from these sequences or from small-subunit rDNA sequences, as the variable sites of the sequences are excessively divergent. However, in morphological and physiological terms, the novel isolates are typical of the genus Metschnikowia in general and of the large-spored group in particular. The type strain of Metschnikowia aberdeeniae sp. nov. is strain SUB 05-213.1T (=CBS 10289T=NRRL Y-27921T) (h-) and the allotype is strain SUB 05-213.2 (=CBS 10290=NRRL Y-27922) (h+).
