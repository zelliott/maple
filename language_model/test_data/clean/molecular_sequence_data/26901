A ciprofloxacin-resistant mutant of Clostridium perfringens, strain VPI-C, which had stable mutations in the topoisomerase genes, accumulated less norfloxacin and ethidium bromide than the wild type, strain VPI. Efflux pump inhibitors both increased the accumulation of ethidium bromide by cells of the mutant and enhanced their sensitivity to this toxic dye. Cloning a gene, which codes for a putative ABC transporter protein (NP_562422) of 527 amino acids, from the mutant strain VPI-C into the wild-type strain VPI not only reduced the accumulation of ethidium bromide by the recombinant strain but also reduced its sensitivity to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Efflux pump inhibitors decreased the rate at which ethidium bromide was removed from the cells of the recombinant strain. It appears that the putative ABC transporter protein (NP_562422) may contribute to extrusion of drugs from C. perfringens.
