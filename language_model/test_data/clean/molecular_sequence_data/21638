Two strains of oval-rod shaped, Gram-negative, phototrophic, purple non-sulfur bacteria designated JA580(T) and JA595 were isolated from a sediment sample collected from a brown pond. Strain JA580(T) was designated as the type strain, while strain JA595 as an additional strain has similar characteristics to the type strain. Strain JA580(T) was non-motile and grew photoheterotrophically with a number of organic compounds serving as carbon source/electron donor. Intracellular photosynthetic membranes were of the vesicular type. Bacteriochlorophyll a and carotenoids of the spheroidene series were present as the major photosynthetic pigments. Strain JA580(T) requires yeast extract for growth. Strain JA580(T) has an obligate requirement for sulfide or thiosulfate for growth. C(18:1)ω7c, C(18:0), C(18:1)ω9c were the predominant components of cellular fatty acids. Phylogenetic analysis on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain JA580(T) clustered with species of the genus Rhodovulum of the family Rhodobacteraceae and is most closely related to the type strains of Rhodovulum adriaticum, Rhodovulum iodosum (96.5%), Rhodovulum robiginosum (96%), Rhodovulum imhoffii (95.6%) and other members of the genus Rhodovulum (<95%). On the basis of phenotypic and molecular genetic evidence, it is proposed that strain JA580(T) should be classified as a novel species of the genus Rhodovulum of the family Rhodobacteraceae, with the species name Rhodovulum phaeolacus sp. nov. The type strain of the species is JA580(T) (=NBRC 107612(T) =KCTC 5963(T)).
