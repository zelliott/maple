We describe an analysis of the CpG islands (CGIs) of the pig. We have used both database survey and a porcine genomic library that is enriched for CGIs. Approximately half of 41 pig genomic database sequences had CGIs with an average G + C content of 65.3%, an average CpG observed/expected frequency of 0.85, and an average size of 978 bp. Of 27 CGI library clones, 16 were nonrepetitive, nonribosomal DNA and CGI-like. CGI library clones had similar average values for G + C and CpG frequency to CGIs of database genes, and an average size of 670 bp, as MseI cuts within some islands. Library clones were also shown to be low copy number and unmethylated in genomic DNA. The presence in the library of seven previously known CGI sequences was confirmed as was the absence of one nonisland sequence. The CGI library exhibits an R-band pattern for many chromosomes in FISH analysis. The pig chromosome arms that show the most dense CGI population are homologous to segments of human chromosomes that are known to be gene rich.
