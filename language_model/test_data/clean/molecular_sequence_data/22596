Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is an important cause of infantile diarrhea, especially in developing countries. EspB, a key virulence factor of EPEC, is required for the attaching and effacing effect characteristic of EPEC and enterohemorrhagic E. coli and has been posited to play several functions in the process of infection. Attaching and effacing activity is associated with the accumulation of filamentous actin beneath adherent bacteria as measured in the fluorescence actin staining (FAS) test. To determine whether different domains of EspB are responsible for different functions, 42 plasmids carrying mutated espB were introduced into an espB deletion mutant. Two major groups of espB mutants were identified. One group of 17 mutants exhibited positive FAS results and normal levels of hemolytic activity. Another group of 22 mutants exhibited negative FAS results and low levels of hemolytic activity. Three mutants were exceptional. One mutant was FAS positive but had significantly reduced hemolytic activity. Conversely, a second mutant was FAS negative but had full hemolytic activity. A third mutant had a significantly reduced FAS level compared to the wild type but full hemolytic activity. The results of EspF and Tir translocation assays confirmed that FAS-negative insertions disrupt effector translocation and mutants with FAS-positive insertions retain protein translocation activity. These results suggest that EspB has distinct domain functions involved in effector translocation that can be distinguished from its role as a component of the translocation pore.
