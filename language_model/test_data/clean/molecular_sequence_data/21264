Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans SS3 is a psychrotolerant acidophile capable of growth in the range of 5° to 30°C (optimum, ≈25°C). It gains energy from the oxidation of ferrous iron and inorganic sulfur compounds and obtains organic carbon from carbon dioxide. Here, we present the draft genome sequence of A. ferrivorans SS3 that will permit investigation of genes involved in growth in acidic environments at low temperatures.
