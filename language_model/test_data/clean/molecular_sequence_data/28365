The nucleotide sequence of a 2558-bp region of bacteriophage P22 at the right end of the genetic map between genes 19 and 3 was determined. A new gene that is partially required for lytic growth, named gene 15, was noted. P22 mutants were constructed which lack gene 15 function, and the gene 15 product was found to be required for lysis in the presence of some divalent cations. It has extensive amino acid sequence similarity with the phage lambda Rz gene, which has a similar function, and weak similarity to the phage T7 18.5 gene which previously had no known function. A hybrid P22 phage, in which the T7 18.5 gene replaces the P22 gene 15, exhibits the plating properties of wild-type P22, strongly suggesting that the two genes have similar functions. In addition, deletions were constructed which show that phage P22 has no additional genes required for lytic growth of lysogeny between genes 19 and 3.
