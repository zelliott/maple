Dictyostelium discoideum uses G protein-mediated signal transduction for many vegetative and developmental functions, suggesting the existence of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) other than the four known cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) receptors (cAR1-4). Sequences of the cAMP receptors were used to identify Dictyostelium genes encoding cAMP receptor-like proteins, CrlA-C. Limited sequence identity between these putative GPCRs and the cAMP receptors suggests the Crl receptors are unlikely to be receptors for cAMP. The crl genes are expressed at various times during growth and the developmental life cycle. Disruption of individual crl genes did not impair chemotactic responses to folic acid or cAMP or alter cAMP-dependent aggregation. However, crlA(-) mutants grew to a higher cell density than did wild-type cells and high-copy-number crlA expression vectors were detrimental to cell viability, suggesting that CrlA is a negative regulator of cell growth. In addition, crlA(-) mutants produce large aggregates with delayed anterior tip formation indicating a role for the CrlA receptor in the development of the anterior prestalk cell region. The scarcity of GFP-expressing crlA(-) mutants in the anterior prestalk cell region of chimeric organisms supports a cell-autonomous role for the CrlA receptor in prestalk cell differentiation.
