Here, we report three complete genome sequences of porcine torque teno virus type I (TTV1) which were obtained from swine tissues and sera from southern China through routine and nested PCR amplification and characterized together with other genome sequences already deposited in GenBank. The results showed that the TTV1 sequences were highly divergent and could be divided into 1a and 1b subtypes.
