The complete nucleotide sequence has been established for two genes (maeA and maeB) coding for different subunits of the hydrogenosomal malic enzyme [malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) EC 1.1.1.39] of Trichomonas vaginalis. Two further genes (maeC and maeD) of this enzyme have been partially sequenced. The complete open reading frames code for polypeptides of 567 amino acids in length. These two open reading frames are similar with less than 12 percent pairwise nucleotide differences and less than 9 percent pairwise amino acid differences. The open reading frames of the two partially sequenced genes correspond to the amino-terminal part of the polypeptides coded and are similar to the corresponding parts of the completely sequenced ones. The deduced translation products of the two complete genes differ in their calculated pI values by 1.5 pH unit. The genes code for polypeptides which contain 12 or 11 amino-terminal amino-acyl residues not present in the proteins isolated from the cell. Other hydrogenosomal enzymes also have similar amino-terminal extensions which probably play a role in organellar targeting and translocation of the newly synthesized polypeptides. A comparison of 19 related enzymes from bacteria and eukaryotes with the maeA product revealed 34-45 percent amino acid identity. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on nonconservative amino acid differences with maximum parsimony (phylogenetic analysis using parsimony, PAUP) and distance based (neighbor-joining, NJ) methods showed that the T. vaginalis enzyme is the most divergent of all eukaryotic malic enzymes, indicating its long independent evolutionary history.
