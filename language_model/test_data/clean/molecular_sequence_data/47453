We previously reported the inhibition of cell-growth in Neuro-2A cells, mouse neuroblastoma, by Zn2+ chelation with EDTA. This paper describes the purification of a factor that prevents EDTA-induced cell-growth inhibition from chick embryo brain. The purified factor has a molecular mass of 16 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. This factor prevents the cell-growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner and also binds thyroxine. Analysis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence revealed that 40 residues coincide with the sequence of chicken liver transthyretin.
