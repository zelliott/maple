A comprehensive phylogenetic study based on the hemagglutinin (H) protein of all known African measles virus (MV) isolates is presented. The study includes 64 new H gene sequences from Ghana. Nigeria and South Africa as well as viruses from Zambia and The Gambia for which only incomplete sequencing data were available and that have previously not been genotyped. The results provide further support to the tentative assignment of the Nigerian and Ghanaian viruses to a new genotype B3 within clade B. A distinct geographic distribution pattern emerged with clade B viruses circulating exclusively in African countries north of the equator. All MV strains from southern Africa grouped in clades A and D with the majority of viruses belonging to genotype D4. The viruses considerably differed by their sensitivity to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies (mAb), but three selected antibodies were sufficient to distinguish between African MVs representing four different genotypes.
