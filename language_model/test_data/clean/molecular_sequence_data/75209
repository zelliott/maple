The 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate (2,4-D) catabolic plasmid pJP4 of Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP134 contains two sets of nonidentical chlorocatechol oxidation gene sequences physically separated by a 7 kb DNA region. We determined the nucleotide sequence of the 1.6 kb HindIII fragment containing the known genes tfdC and tfdD (Don et al. 1985) which encode pyrocatechase and cycloisomerase, respectively. The 1.3 kb BglII-HindIII segment of recombinant plasmid pDC25 containing at least three chlorocatechol (clc) oxidation genes of the pAC27 plasmid in Pseudomonas putida AC867 (Ghosal et al. 1985a; Frantz and Chakrabarty 1986), was also sequenced. When the tfdC gene of the pJP4 plasmid was compared with gene clcA of plasmid pAC27, which encodes the chlorocatechol specific pyrocatechase (pyrocatechase II), the two genes showed 63% nucleotide sequence homology with 60% homology in their amino acid sequences. In both plasmid pJP4 and pAC27, the two genes encoding the pyrocatechase and the cycloisomerase showed a 4 bp overlap spanning the initiation codon of the cycloisomerase gene and the termination codon of the pyrocatechase gene. The sizes of the polypeptides encoded by the isofunctional genes tfdC and clcA are very similar and thus reflect their functional homology.
