The inner core domain (residues approximately 221-454) of the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase component (E2P) of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain JM105 via the expression vector pKK233-2. The truncated E2p was purified to apparent homogeneity. It exhibited catalytic activity (acetyl transfer from [1-14C]acetyl-CoA to dihydrolipoamide) very similar to that of wild-type E2p. The appearance of the truncated and wild-type E2p was also very similar, as observed by negative-stain electron microscopy, namely, a pentagonal dodecahedron. These findings demonstrate that the active site of E2p from S. cerevisiae resides in the inner core domain, i.e., catalytic domain, and that this domain alone can undergo self-assembly. The purified truncated E2p showed a tendency to aggregate. Aggregation was prevented by genetically engineered attachment of the interdomain linker segment (residues approximately 181-220) to the catalytic domain. All dihydrolipoamide acyltransferases contain the sequence His-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Asp-Gly near their carboxyl termini. By analogy with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, the highly conserved His and Asp residues were postulated to be involved in the catalytic mechanism [Guest, J. R. (1987) FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 44, 417-422]. Substitution of the sole His residue in the S. cerevisiae truncated E2p, His-427, by Asn or Ala by site-directed mutagenesis did not have a significant effect on the kcat or Km values of the truncated E2p. However, the Asp-431----Asn, Ala, or Glu substitutions resulted in a 16-, 24-, and 3.7-fold reduction, respectively, in kcat, with little change in Km values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
