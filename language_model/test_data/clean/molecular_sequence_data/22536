Using MIN6 beta-cells and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, the chronological sequence of binding of MafA, E47/beta2 and PDX-1 to the insulin promoter in living beta-cells were investigated. All four factors were shown to bind to the mouse insulin 2 promoter in a cyclical manner with a periodicity of approximately 10-15 min. The cyclical binding of MafA, E47 and beta2 was largely unaffected by the glucose or insulin concentration in the media. However, the binding and cycling of PDX-1 was markedly abolished in low glucose (1 mM), and this was reversed in the presence of low concentrations of insulin.
