Most small lesions in the factor VIII (FVIII) gene that cause haemophilia A (HA) are single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino acid replacing (missense) mutations and leading to various phenotypes, ranging from mild to severe. We took a combined approach of homology modelling and quantitative evaluation of evolutionary significance of amino acid replacing alterations using the Grantham Matrix Score (GMS) to assess their structural effects and significance of pathological expression. Comparative homology models of all amino acid substitutions summarized in the FVIII mutations database plus these identified and reported lately by us or by our collaborators were evaluated. Altogether 640 amino acid replacing mutations were scored for potential distant or local conformation changes, influence on the molecular stability and predicted contact residues, using available FVIII domain models. The average propensity to substitute amino acid residues by mutation was found comparable to the overall probability of de novo mutations. Missense changes reported with various HA phenotypes were all confirmed significant using GMS. The fraction of these, comprising residues apparently involved in intermolecular interactions, exceeds the average proportion of such residues for FVIII. Predicted contact residues changed through mutation were visualized on the surface of FVIII domains and their possible functional implications were verified from the literature and are discussed considering available structural information. Our predictive modelling adds on the current view of domain interface molecular contacts. This structural insight could aid in part to the design of engineered FVIII constructs for therapy, to possibly enhance their stability and prolong circulating lifetime.
