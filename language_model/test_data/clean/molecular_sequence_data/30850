The complete nucleotide sequence of lysU, the gene for the heat-inducible lysyl-tRNA synthetase of Escherichia coli, was determined and compared with the published sequence of lysS (herC), the gene for the constitutive lysyl-tRNA synthetase. These unlinked genes were found to be identical over 72% of their lengths. The deduced amino acid sequences of the respective gene products, LysU and LysS, were identical over 85% and similar over 92% of their lengths. Accumulation of high levels of LysU during growth of strains carrying the wild-type allele of lysU on multicopy plasmids had no observable effect on growth or on the synthesis of LysS. A lysU deletion strain was constructed and was shown to grow normally at low temperature (28 degrees C) but poorly at 44 degrees C; the slow growth (45% of normal) at elevated temperature was fully reversed by plasmids bearing wild-type lysU. The implications of these findings for the existence of two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for lysine are discussed.
