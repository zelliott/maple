Two genomic DNAs with the size of 2.3 kb and 2.4 kb, which were isolated from the liver of Naja naja atra (Taiwan cobra), encoded the precursors of cardiotoxin 4 and cobrotoxin, respectively. Both genes shared virtually identical overall organization with three exons separated by two introns, which were inserted in the similar positions of the gene's coding regions. Moreover, their nucleotide sequences shared approximately 84.2% identity. This result reveals the evolutionary relationship between cardiotoxin and cobrotoxin. The exon/intron structures of cardiotoxin 4 and cobrotoxin genes were similar to that reported for erabutoxin c gene, a neurotoxin genomic DNA from a sea snake (Laticauda semifasciata). However, in contrast to the finding that the intron 2 of these genes had a similar size, a notable variation with the size of intron 1 was observed (1233 bp, 1269 bp and 197 bp for cardiotoxin 4, cobrotoxin and erabutoxin c genes, respectively). The different size with intron 1 is due to the middle region at the first intron of cardiotoxin 4 and cobrotoxin genes, which encoded small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), being absent in that of erabutoxin c gene. These results, together with the finding of the potential mobility of snoRNA genes during evolution, suggest that intron insertions or deletions of snoRNA genes occur with the evolutionary divergence of snake neurotoxins and cardiotoxins.
