The phoR gene is a bifunctional regulatory gene for the phosphate regulon of Escherichia coli. It acts as a negative regulator in the presence of excess phosphate and as a positive regulator with limited phosphate, through modification of PhoB protein. We constructed several phoR genes, with various deletions in the 5' regions, which were regulated by the trp-lac hybrid promoter. The PhoR1084 and PhoR1159 proteins that lack the 83 and 158 N-terminal amino acids, respectively, retained the positive function for the expression of phoA that codes for alkaline phosphatase, but lacked the negative function. The PhoR1263 protein that lacks the 262 N-terminal amino acids was deficient in both functions. An antiserum against PhoR1084 protein was prepared. Western blot analysis of the subcellular fractions obtained by differential centrifugation indicated that the intact PhoR and PhoR1084 proteins are located in the inner membrane and cytoplasmic fractions, respectively. The results suggest that PhoR protein is anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane by the amino-terminal region.
