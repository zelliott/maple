In the process of analyzing the contribution of nonproductive alpha- and beta-chain gene rearrangements to the allelic exclusion of TCR gene expression, we have found a novel type of aberrant alpha-gene rearrangement. In one alpha-allele of the mouse KB5-C20 T cell clone, a J alpha gene segment has been abutted precisely to a sequence that does not display any homology to known V and D gene segment. The appended sequence originates from within the V alpha locus and is located, in the germ-line, 1 kb upstream of a member of the V alpha 2-gene segment subfamily. No recombination signal sequences have been found contiguous to the recombination point. These observations indicate that in normal T lymphocytes, TCR alpha-genes may be affected by aberrant rearrangements similar to those that predominate in human T cell tumors containing chromosome 14 inversion or translocation. Furthermore, compilation of published data and cloning and sequencing of three additional alpha-alleles has allowed us to examine the status of alpha-loci in nine mouse T cell clones expressing functional alpha beta-heterodimers. Interestingly, in contrast to the situation observed at the beta-locus, only 1 of 18 analyzed alpha-alleles has retained a germ-line unrearranged configuration. In addition, in each T cell clone, alpha-rearrangements on homologous chromosomes were unevenly distributed over the J alpha region and shown to generally involve neighboring J alpha gene segments.
