Two pigmented, Gram-negative, non-motile, pleomorphic rod-shaped bacteria (strains SPM-9(T) and SPM-10(T)) were isolated from a permafrost soil collected from the Adventdalen valley, Spitsbergen, northern Norway. A third isolate (strain M5-H2) was recovered from the same soil sample after the sample had been exposed to simulated Martian environmental conditions. The three strains were characterized taxonomically by using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic, physiological and morphological analyses demonstrated that the three isolates were most closely related to members of the genus Spirosoma. 16S rRNA gene sequence data indicated that the three isolates could be divided into two clusters: (i) strain SPM-9(T) and (ii) strains SPM-10(T) and M5-H2. This grouping was confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridization experiments. Strains SPM-9(T) and SPM-10(T) exhibited 92 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to both Spirosoma linguale LMG 10896(T) and Spirosoma rigui WPCB 118(T). The major fatty acids present in all three isolates were summed feature 3 (comprising iso-C(15:0) 2-OH and/or C(16 : 1)omega7c; 43.0-48.2 % of the total), C(16 : 1)omega5c (19.1-21.3 %), C(16 : 0) (6.7-7.3 %), iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH (4.7-6.0 %) and iso-C(15 : 0) (2.6-5.7 %). On the basis of their phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, the new strains are assigned to two novel species of the genus Spirosoma, for which the names Spirosoma spitsbergense sp. nov. and Spirosoma luteum sp. nov. are proposed. The type strain of Spirosoma spitsbergense is SPM-9(T) (=NCIMB 14407(T)=DSM 19989(T)) and the type strain of Spirosoma luteum is SPM-10(T) (=NCIMB 14406(T)=DSM 19990(T)). An emended description of the genus Spirosoma is also proposed.
