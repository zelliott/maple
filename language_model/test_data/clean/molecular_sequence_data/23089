This report describes two novel HLA class II alleles, HLA-DRB1*0826 and HLA-DQB1*0627, that have been identified in two unrelated voluntary blood stem cell donors of Caucasian origin. HLA-DRB1*0826 is characterized by a nucleotide substitution (G to T) in exon 2 at position 163, leading to an amino acid exchange from argenine to leucine. The donor phenotype is HLA-A*0301,*2902; B*3501,*4403; Cw*0401,*1601; DRB1*0101,*0826; DQB1*0402, *0501. The HLA-DQB1*0627 alleles contain a nucleotide substitution at position 184 (T to C) resulting in an amino acid exchange from tyrosine to histidine. Family segregation analysis revealed that the HLA-DQB1*0627 allele belongs to the haplotype A*0101, B*1517, Cw*0701, DRB1*1302, DQB1*0627. The donor phenotype is HLA-A*0101; B*0801,*1517; Cw*0701; DRB1*1302,*1501; DQB1*0602,*0627.
