Poly (Val-Gly-Gly-Leu-Gly), a polypeptide mimicking the physico-chemical properties of the glycine-rich regions of elastin, has been synthesized and studied both in solution and in the aggregated state. By comparison, also the conformation of different "monomeric" units has been investigated. The polymer showed increased disorder with respect to the "monomers", the molecular conformation being accounted for by a more or less random collection of isolated beta-turns. Nevertheless, in the solid state the polymer is able to adopt supramolecular structures reminiscent of those found for elastin.
