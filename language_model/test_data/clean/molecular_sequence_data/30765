An effective synthesis of oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing a substituted pyrophosphate bond in the definite position of the sugar-phosphate backbone has been developed by template-directed condensation of two heptanucleotides. One of them containing 5'-phosphate group to be activated and 3'-phosphate group of the other being substituted with ethoxy-, buthylamino-, morpholino- or ethyl glycinate residues. Water-soluble carbodiimide (EDAC) proved to be more efficient in the phosphate group activation than N-hydroxybenzotriazole ester (yields of substituted pyrophosphates 35-80 and 10-15% respectively). The substituted pyrophosphate bong is quite stable in neutral aqueous solution. Mild conditions of selective cleavage of this bond yielding the initial oligonucleotides were found.
