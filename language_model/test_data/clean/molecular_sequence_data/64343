An unknown Gram-positive, catalase-positive, facultatively anaerobic, non-spore-forming, coccus-shaped bacterium originating from sediment was characterized using phenotypic, molecular chemical and molecular phylogenetic methods. Chemical studies revealed the presence of a cell-wall murein based on LL-diaminopimelic acid (type LL-Dpm-glycine(1)), a complex mixture of saturated, monounsaturated and iso- and anteiso-methyl-branched, non-hydroxylated, long-chain cellular fatty acids and tetrahydrogenated menaquinones with eight isoprene units [MK-8(H(4))] as the major respiratory lipoquinone. This combination of characteristics somewhat resembled members of the suborder Micrococcineae, but did not correspond to any currently described species. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed that the unidentified coccus-shaped organism is a member of the Actinobacteria and represents a hitherto-unknown subline related to, albeit different from, a number of taxa including Intrasporangium, Janibacter, Terrabacter, Terracoccus and Ornithinicoccus. Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic considerations, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium originating from lake sediment be classified as a new genus and species, Arsenicicoccus bolidensis gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain CCUG 47306(T)=DSM 15745(T)).
