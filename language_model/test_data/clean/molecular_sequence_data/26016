1. The 100 kDa protein was purified from bovine brains. 2. The antibody against the 100 kDa brain protein was prepared and was monospecific to the antigen. 3. The antibody cross-reacted with HeLa cell HSP100 (100 kDa heat shock protein). 4. The physicochemical, immunochemical properties and a partially amino acid sequence indicated that the 100 kDa protein was HSP100. 5. Peptide mapping using Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease showed a core peptide with 10 kDa molecular mass common to both HSP100 and HSP90. 6. The amino acid sequence of the 10 kDa fragment of the 100 kDa protein showed a high homology with that of human HSP90 (38-60); the difference was only two of 23 amino acid residues determined.
