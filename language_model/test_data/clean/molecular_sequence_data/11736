General equations are derived for the limit yield [PZ] infinity of the intraduplex reaction between reactive oligonucleotide derivative X bearing p-(N-2-chloroethyl-N-methyl-amino)phenyl residue and oligonucleotide target P encompassing the sequence complementary to X in the presence of one or two oligonucleotide effectors E1 and E2. The latters form the complementary tandem sequence E1-X-E2 at the target. It is shown that association constants characterizing the affinity of the reagent X to the effector containing complexes PE1, PE2 and PE1E2 may be calculated from the dependencies of [PZ] infinity on the initial concentration chi 0 of X providing the sufficient excess of effectors is present. The approach was applied to reaction of C1RCH2NHpd(TTCCCA) with 26-mer dTTGCCTTGAATGGGAAGAGGGTCATT and effectors Phn-L-pd(TTCAAGG-C)p-L-Phn(E1) and Phn-L-pd(TGACCCTC)p-L-Phn(E2) where Phn- is N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-phenazinium residue and L is -NHCH2CH2NH- spacer. The association constants were found to be Kxe1 = 6.75 x 10(5)M-1, Kxe2 = 4.15 x 10(4)M-1 and Kxe12 = 5.87 x 10(6)M-1 as compared with the affinity of X to P Kx = 2.16 x 10(4)M-1 in the absence of effectors. The experiments on self-alkylation of target reactive derivative C1RCH2NHpd(TTGCCTTGAATGGGAAGAGGGTCATT) both in the presence and in the absence of effector E2 as well as the Molecular Mechanics calculations of its prereactive states showed target to form the hairpin secondary structure. Under reasonable suggestions taking into account the internal structure of the target co-operativity parameters describing the contribution of interactions of the terminal nucleotides of X with adjacent residues of effector were calculated and found to be alpha 1 = 16, alpha 2 = 10 and alpha 12 = 139 for the duplexes PXE1, PXE2 and PXE1E2, respectively.
