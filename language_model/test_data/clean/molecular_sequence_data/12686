We have measured the amount of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1) mRNA and protein in primary breast cancers and non-malignant breast tissue and have found greatly reduced levels in breast cancer compared with non-malignant tissue. A total of 116 breast cancers and 37 biopsies taken from non-malignant breast were compared for FGF-1 mRNA expression using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and significantly lower levels were found in the cancer tissues (P < 0.001). These findings were confirmed at the protein level where four out of five breast cancers contained no detectable FGF-1 and a fifth cancer had a low level of FGF-1 compared with three samples from reduction mammoplasties. Similar results were obtained from breast cell lines in which 80% of cancer cell lines had very low levels of FGF-1, whereas all non-malignant breast cell lines contained higher levels of FGF-1. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that FGF-1 was present in the luminal epithelial cells of the non-malignant breast but was absent from cancer cells. The decreased levels of FGF-1 in breast cancer may indicate that stimulation of cancer cells is resulting in down-regulation of FGF-1 expression or may implicate FGF-1 as a differentiation factor rather than a growth factor at its physiological concentration in the breast.
