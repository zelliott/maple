Five new analogues of the trypsin inhibitor CMTI-III were synthesized by the solid-phase method. All analogues containing a valine residue in position 27 and glycine residues in some or all of the positions 9, 11, 14, 17, 19, 29 as well as in two cases a norleucine residue in position 8 displayed association equilibrium constants by 6-7 orders of magnitude lower than the native CMTI-III inhibitor.
