Previous studies suggest that neuropeptide FF (NPFF) plays a role in opiate dependence and subsequent abstinence syndrome. Endogenous NPFF also appears to play a role in opiate tolerance since third ventricle injection of IgG from NPFF antiserum selectively restores morphine sensitivity in morphine-tolerant rats. The NPFF analog, desamino YFLFQPQRamide (daY8Ra) has previously antagonized behavioral effects of NPFF and has attenuated morphine dependence. The present study assessed whether daY8Ra could similarly attenuate morphine tolerance. Third ventricle (i.c.v.) injection of daY8Ra restored the analgesic response to i.c.v. morphine in morphine-tolerant rats (radiant heat tail flick test). Saline injection failed to produce this effect. In opiate-naive rats, however, the same treatment with daY8Ra did not affect the analgesic response to i.c.v. morphine. Thus, daY8Ra appears to selectively restore morphine sensitivity in opiate-tolerant animals. These results further support the hypothesis that endogenous NPFF contributes to opiate tolerance.
