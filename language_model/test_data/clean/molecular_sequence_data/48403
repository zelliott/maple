Three human rotavirus G9P[8] strains, RVA/Human-tc/KOR/CAU05-202/2005/G9P[8], RVA/Human-tc/KOR/CAU09-371/2009/G9P[8], and RVA/Human-tc/KOR/CAU09-376/2009/G9P[8], were isolated from female pediatric patients with diarrhea from 2005 to 2009 using a cell culture system, and their complete genomic sequences were analyzed. The 11 gene segments of the three Korean strains possessed the G9-P[8]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1 genotype, which is closely related to the Wa-like genotype 1 constellation. Interestingly, the NSP2 and the NSP3 genes of strain RVA/Human-tc/KOR/CAU09-376/2009/G9P[8] were related to the G9 porcine or human-porcine reassortant strains, providing evidence for porcine-to-human interspecies transmission.
