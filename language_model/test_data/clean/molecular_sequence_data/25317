The paper deals with the recent achievements in the study of the various interactions between proteins, peptides and amino acids. The interactions are classified according to the hydrophilic, hydrophobic or mixed character of the interactive forces. The effect of the interaction on protein (peptide) association, structure and biological activity as well as the role of individual amino acid residues in the hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions are discussed.
