Full-length cDNA of genomic RNA of potato virus Y (PVY) was cloned in one piece into a lambda vector. The order of the EcoRI and SalI fragments of the inserted cDNA was determined. This is the first report of the cloning of a long, expressible, potyvirus genome. The availability of such a clone is a prerequisite for any further study of the molecular biology of this group of viruses, as they are expressed into a self-processed primary polyprotein.
