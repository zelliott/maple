Identification of species constituting Rana esculenta complex represents a certain problem as two parental species Rana ridibunda and Rana lessonae form their hybrid R. esculenta, while external signs and sizes of the members of this complex are intersected. However the composition of skin secretion consisting mainly of peptides is different for the species of the complex. LC-MS/MS is an ideal analytical tool for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of these peptides. The results covering elemental composition of these peptides, their levels in the secretion, as well as their belonging to a certain family of peptides may be visualized by means of 2D mass maps. The proposed approach proved itself to be a perspective tool for the reliable identification of all 3 species constituting R. esculenta complex. Easy distinguishing between the species may be achieved using 2D maps as fingerprints. Besides this approach may be used to study hybridogenesis and mechanisms of hemiclonal transfer of genetic information, when rapid and reliable identification of species involved in the process is required.
