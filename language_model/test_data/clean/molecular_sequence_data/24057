The predicted amino acid sequence of Bacillus subtilis ybaN (renamed pdaB) exhibits high similarity to those of several polysaccharide deacetylases. Northern hybridization analysis with sporulation sigma mutants indicated that the pdaB gene is transcribed by EsigmaE RNA polymerase and negatively regulated by SpoIIID. The pdaB mutant was deficient in spore formation. Phase- and electron microscopic observation showed morphological changes of spores in late sporulation periods. The pdaB spores that had lost their viability were empty. Moreover, GFP driven by the promoter of the sspE gene was localized in the forespore compartment for the wild type, but was localized in both the mother cell and forespore compartments for phase-gray/dark forespores of the pdaB mutant. This indicates that GFP expressed in the forespores of the mutant leaks into the mother cells. Therefore, PdaB is necessary to maintain spores after the late stage of sporulation.
