16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences were determined for the five species of the genus Deinococcus (Deinococcus erythromyxa, Deinococcus proteolyticus, Deinococcus radiodurans, Deinococcus radiophilus, and Deinococcus radiopugnans) and the single species of the genus. Deinobacter (Deinobacter grandis). With the exception of Deinococcus erythromyxa, the deinococci form a coherent phylogenetic cluster which is related to the Thermus-Meiothermus lineage. An analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence of Deinococcus erythromyxa revealed that this organism is an actinomycete and a member of the genus Kocuria. Deinobacter grandis falls within the radiation of the genus Deinococcus and phylogenetically can be considered a member of this genus. The results of the phylogenetic analyses are consistent with chemotaxonomic data. On the basis of our data, Deinobacter grandis is transferred to the genus Deinococcus as Deinococcus grandis comb. nov., the description of the genus Deinococcus is emended accordingly, and Deinococcus erythromyxa is transferred to the genus Kocuria as Kocuria erythromyxa comb. nov. The description of the family Deinococcaceae is emended to include organisms with rod-shaped cells, and a set of 16S rDNA signature nucleotides is designated for this group. On the basis of the distinct phylogenetic position of the Deinococcus lineage and a set of 16S rDNA signature nucleotides, the order Deinococcales ord. nov. is described.
