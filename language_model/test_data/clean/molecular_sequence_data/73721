Genes from Bacillus subtilis predicted to encode a phosphate-specific transport (Pst) system were shown by mutation to affect high-affinity Pi uptake but not arsenate resistance or phosphate (Pho) regulation. The transcription start of the promoter upstream of the pstS gene was defined by primer extension. The promoter contains structural features analogous to the Escherichia coli pst promoter but not sequence similarity. Expression from this promoter was induced >5,000-fold upon phosphate starvation and regulated by the PhoP-PhoR two-component regulatory system. These data indicate that the pst operon is involved in phosphate transport and is a member of the Pho regulon but is not involved in Pi regulation.
