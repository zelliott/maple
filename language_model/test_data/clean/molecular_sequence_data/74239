The use of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) is a cost-effective route to treat sulfate- contaminated waters and precipitate metals. The isolation and characterization of a SRB strain from an AMD in a Brazilian tropical region site was carried out. With a moderately acidic pH (5.5), the C.1 strain began its growth and with continued growth, modified the pH accordingly. The strain under these conditions reduced sulfate at the same rate as an experiment performed using an initial pH of 7.0. The dsrB gene-based molecular approach was used for the characterization of this strain and its phylogenetic affiliation was similar to genus Desulfovibrio sp. The results show an SRB isolate with unexpected sulfate reducing capacity in moderately acidic conditions, bringing new possibilities for the treatment of AMD, as acid water would be neutralized to a mildly acidic condition.
