Mouse cells expressing the human poliovirus receptor (PVR-mouse cells) as well as human HeLa cells are susceptible to poliovirus type 1 Mahoney strains and produce a large amount of progeny virus at 37 degrees C. However, the virus yield is markedly reduced at 40 degrees C in PVR-mouse cells but not in HeLa cells. The reduction in virus yield at 40 degrees C appears to be due to a defective initiation process in positive-strand RNA synthesis (K. Shiroki, H. Kato, S. Koike, T. Odaka, and A. Nomoto, J. Virol. 67:3989-3996, 1993). To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in this detective process, naturally occurring heat-resistant (Hr)-mutants which show normal growth ability in PVR-mouse cells even at 40 degrees C were isolated from a virus stock of the Mahoney strain and their mutation sites that affect the phenotype were identified. The key mutation was a change from adenine (A) to guanine (G) at nucleotide position (nt) 133 within the 5' noncoding region of the RNA. This mutation also gave an Hr phenotype to the viral plus-strand RNA synthesis in PVR-mouse cells. Mutant Mahoney strains with a single point mutation at nt 133 (A to G, C, or T or deletion) were investigated for their ability to grow in PVR-mouse cells at 40 degrees C. Only the mutant carrying G at nt 133 showed an Hr growth phenotype in PVR-mouse cells. These results suggest that a host cellular factor(s) interacts with an RNA segment around nt 133 of the plus-strand RNA or the corresponding region of the minus-strand RNA, contributing to efficiency of plus-strand RNA synthesis.
