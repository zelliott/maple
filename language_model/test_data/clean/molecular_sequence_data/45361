Bacterial strains UST030701-097T and UST030701-084T were isolated from a marine sponge in the Bahamas. Both strains were pink-pigmented, Gram-negative, strictly aerobic and chemo-organotrophic. Cells of strain UST030701-097T were short, curved rods with fast-gliding motility, whereas those of strain UST030701-084T were straight rods with a less rapid gliding motion. The two strains had MK-7 as the major respiratory quinone and did not produce flexirubin-type pigments. The DNA G+C contents of strains UST030701-097T and UST030701-084T were 42.5 and 43.7 mol%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the two strains belonged to the family 'Flexibacteraceae' of the phylum Bacteroidetes. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strains UST030701-097T and UST030701-084T was 95.0 %; their closest relative was [Marinicola] seohaensis, with 93.3 % and 96.0 % sequence similarity, respectively. Phylogenetic tree topology indicated that the two strains belonged to the same lineage, but were on separate branches. Whilst strain UST030701-084T and [Marinicola] seohaensis were found on one branch, strain UST030701-097T was in another branch that had no species with validly published names. Based on the polyphasic taxonomic data obtained in the present study, we propose that strain UST030701-097T represents a novel genus and that strain UST030701-084T represents a novel species in the phylum Bacteroidetes. The genus Fabibacter gen. nov. is proposed, with strain UST030701-097T (=NRRL B-41220T=JCM 13334T) as the type strain of the type species, Fabibacter halotolerans sp. nov. Strain UST030701-084T (=NRRL B-41219T=JCM 13337T) is proposed as the type strain of Roseivirga spongicola sp. nov. In an earlier study, it was suggested that the genus Marinicola is a later heterotypic synonym of the genus Roseivirga. However, a formal proposal to reclassify [Marinicola] seohaensis, the only member of the genus Marinicola, has not yet been made. The results of phylogenetic analyses in this study support the reclassification of [Marinicola] seohaensis as Roseivirga seohaensis comb. nov.
