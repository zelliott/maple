6-O-alpha-D-Galactopyranosyl-D-glucopyranose (melibiose) derivatives with alkyl groups at the terminal 1-O and 6'-O positions have been synthesized. They show thermotropic and lyotropic liquid-crystal properties. The d-spacings of the strong inner X-ray diffraction rings correspond to approximately 0.9 times the extended length of the molecule. The molecules are therefore either extended in monomolecular layers or U-shaped in bimolecular layers.
