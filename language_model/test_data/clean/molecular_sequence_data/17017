Coagulation factor VIIa (FVIIa) belongs to the chymotrypsin family of S1 peptidases, whose members require the cleavage of at least one internal peptide bond to attain an active conformation. FVIIa also requires association with tissue factor (TF) to attain full catalytic competency. Without this, FVIIa has very low activity toward peptide and physiologic substrates. Reregistration of beta strands has been suggested to play a part in the activation of FVII, and their positioning is possibly important for the active conformation of FVIIa. To scrutinize this hypothesis, we have designed FVIIa variants which prevent beta strand movement and lock FVIIa in the alleged active conformation. The V299M mutation, alone or combined with the L280I mutation, was introduced to alter the first of two Leu-X-Val motifs in beta strand B2 and thereby prevent reregistration. Along the same line, C164V/V299C-FVIIa has a new disulfide which would keep beta strand B2 in the registration of active FVIIa. The amidolytic and proteolytic activities of V299M-, L280I/V299M-, and C164V/V299C-FVIIa were indistinguishable from or lower than those of wild-type FVIIa, and none of the mutants displayed an altered exposure of the N-terminal amino group of the protease domain. Moreover, the affinities of mutant and native FVIIa for TF increased to a similar extent upon incorporation of an active site inhibitor, and the enzymatic activities were equally stimulated by TF. In conclusion, we found no evidence that the mutants were in a more active state than native FVIIa. Thus, the proposed beta strand reregistration, if part of the regulatory mechanism governing FVIIa activity, apparently does not suffice for the transformation of FVIIa into an enzymatically active conformation. Our data raise the possibility that the structural differences between enzymatically latent (zymogen-like) and active FVIIa resemble those between trypsinogen and trypsin.
