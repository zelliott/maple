There is scientific concern regarding the role of dietary nucleotides in the maintenance and repair of the gastrointestinal tract. This concern is based on a growing body of research that demonstrates potential mechanisms for dietary nucleotides to affect intestinal development and turnover. It seems clear that intestinal gene transcription as well as the activity of transcription factors is at least sometimes directly related to nutrition. Implications of this work include the potential role of dietary nucleotides in infant nutrition and in intestinal repair. The techniques of molecular biology will now allow us to explore and explain how dietary factors such as nucleotides affect intestinal mucosal development, function, adaptation, and repair.
