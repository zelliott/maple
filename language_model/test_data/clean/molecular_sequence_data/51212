The structures of the helices II-III region and the helix IV region of B. megaterium 5S rRNA have been examined by means of energy minimization and molecular dynamics calculations. Calculated distances between neighboring hydrogen-bonded imino protons in helices II, III, and IV were between 3.5 and 4.5 A. The overall axis for the helices II-III region is warped rather than straight. Formation of additional Watson-Crick base pairs in loop B and loop C was not evident from the atomic positions calculated by molecular dynamics. Bases in loop C are well stacked, showing no significant change during dynamics. Bulge migration in helix III does not seem to be possible; the helices II-III region prefers one conformation. Helix II is more stable than helix III. Five base pairs in helix IV were sufficiently stable to establish that helix IV is terminated by a hairpin loop of three nucleotides. U87 protrudes from loop D. Structures of the helices II-III segment and the helix IV segment of B. megaterium 5S rRNA obtained by molecular dynamics were generally consistent with the solution structure inferred from high-field proton nmr spectroscopy.
