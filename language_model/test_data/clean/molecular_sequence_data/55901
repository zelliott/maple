Placental aromatase deficiency, which was characterized by maternal and fetal virilization and by a low level of estrogen excretion into urine during pregnancy, was studied by biochemical and molecular genetical techniques. Among enzymes participating in the electron transport system of the patient's placental microsomes, only aromatase activity was observed to be reduced (< 3% of normal levels). Northern and Western blotting analyses showed that the transcription of the aromatase gene and the translation of its mRNA seemed to proceed normally in the patient's tissue. However, the aromatase cDNA isolated from the patient was found to contain an extra DNA fragment of 87 base pairs (bp) which encoded 29 amino acids in frame but no termination codon. The insertion was located at the splicing point between exon 6 and intron 6 of the normal aromatase gene. The extra DNA fragment represented the first part of intron 6 except that its initial GT was altered to GC. These findings indicated that, in the patient's aromatase gene, the splicing between exon 6 and intron 6 did not occur at the normal position. This reflected the presence of one point mutation in its consensus sequence which caused the next cryptic consensus sequence 87 bp downstream, to be used according to the canonical GT/AG rule. The protein molecule thus translated contained an extra 29 amino acids. Furthermore, the patient's aromatase cDNA was observed to produce a protein molecule with a trace of activity in the transient expression system of COS-7 cells and in the high level expression system of baculovirus-insect cells. Direct DNA sequencing of aromatase genes from the patient and parents confirmed that this deficiency is a hereditary disease with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. The patient and parents are homozygote and heterozygotes, respectively, for this mutation.
