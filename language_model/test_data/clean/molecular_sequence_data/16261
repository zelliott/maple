Human platelet proteoglycan (P.PG) was prepared from a 4 M-guanidinium chloride platelet extract in the presence of proteinase inhibitors. The purification procedure included CsCl-density-gradient centrifugation, DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B ion-exchange chromatography and f.p.l.c. on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column. P.PG was recovered as a polydisperse molecule, but the protein core appeared to be at least 90% homogeneous. This observation could be due to partial proteolysis of the core protein during extraction. The N-terminal sequence of the human P.PG core protein was determined up to residue 66 and was shown to be highly homologous to the propeptide of an embryonic rat yolk-sac tumour proteoglycan (PG19); the significance of this homology is discussed.
