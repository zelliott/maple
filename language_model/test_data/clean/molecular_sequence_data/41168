A Gram-negative, non-spore-forming rod (CC-LN1-12(T)) was isolated from coastal soil samples of Lutao Island (Green Island), Taiwan, and its taxonomic position was studied. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that isolate CC-LN1-12(T) was grouped into the Microbulbifer cluster, with the highest similarities to Microbulbifer okinawensis ABABA23(T) (97.9 %), Microbulbifer maritimus TF-17(T) (97.7 %) and Microbulbifer donghaiensis CN85(T) (97.7 %), similarities to all other species of the genus Microbulbifer were lower than 96.8 %. The polyamine pattern contained the major compounds spermidine and cadaverine. The fatty acid profile, comprising the major fatty acids iso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(17 : 1)ω9c, C(18 : 1)ω7c and iso-C(11 : 0) 3-OH as the major hydroxylated fatty acid, supported the affiliation of strain CC-LN1-12(T) to the genus Microbulbifer. DNA-DNA hybridizations between strain CC-LN1-12(T) and Microbulbifer okinawensis ABABA23(T), M. donghaiensis CN85(T) and M. maritimus JCM 12187(T) resulted in relatedness values of 21.5 % (14.3 %, reciprocal analysis), 35.9 % (48.5 %, reciprocal analysis) and 48.1 % (52.1 %, reciprocal analysis), respectively. From these data, as well as from physiological and biochemical tests, strain CC-LN1-12(T) could be clearly differentiated from the most closely related species of the genus Microbulbifer. It is concluded that strain CC-LN1-12(T) represents a novel species, for which the name Microbulbifer taiwanensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CC-LN1-12(T) ( = LMG 26125(T) = CCM 7856(T)).
