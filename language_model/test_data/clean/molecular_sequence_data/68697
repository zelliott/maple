Darwinian evolution, that is the outgrowth of the fittest variants in a population, usually applies to living organisms over long periods of time. Recently, in vitro selection/amplification techniques have been developed that allow for the rapid evolution of functionally active nucleic acids from a pool of randomized sequences. We now describe a modification of the nucleic acid-evolution protocol in which selection and amplification take place inside living cells by means of a retroviral-based replication system. We have generated a library of HIV-1 DNA genomes with random sequences in particular domains of the TAR element, which is the binding site for the Tat trans-activator protein. This mixture of HIV genomes was transfected into T cells and outgrowth of the fittest viruses was observed within two weeks of viral replication. The results of this in vivo selection analysis are consistent with the notion that primary sequence elements in both TAR bulge and loop domains are critical for Tat-mediated trans-activation and viral replication.
