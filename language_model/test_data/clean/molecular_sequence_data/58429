We have cloned the rpoN region of the pepper and tomato pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria to analyze its role in pathogenicity and hrp gene activation. Open reading frame 3 (ORF3) from this region is predicted to encode a protein that is up to 45% identical and 65% similar to previously described RpoN proteins and was shown to be essential for the utilization of nitrate as sole nitrogen source. The X. campestris pv. vesicatoria rpoN gene is, however, not required for pathogenicity and hrp gene expression.
