Molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MOCOD) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder resulting in the combined deficiency of aldehyde oxidase (AO, EC 1.2.3.1), xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH, EC 1.1.1.204), and sulfite oxidase (SUOX, EC 1.8.3.1). The majority of patients typically present soon after birth with intractable seizures, developmental delay and lens dislocation and do not survive early childhood. Milder cases have been reported. We report an unusual mutation in the MOCS1 gene associated with a relatively mild clinical phenotype, in a patient who presented with normal uric acid (UA) levels in plasma. We also report a new MOCS1 mRNA splice variant in the 5' region of the gene. MOCS1 genomic DNA and cDNA from peripheral blood leukocytes were sequenced. MOCS1 mRNA splice variants were amplified with fluorescently labelled primers and quantitated. A novel homozygous mutation MOCS1c.1165+6T > C in intron 9 resulting in miss-splicing of exon 9 was found. Multiple alternatively spliced MOCS1 transcripts have been previously reported. A new MOCS1 transcript in the 5' - exon 1 region was identified in both patient and controls. This new transcript derived from the Larin variant and lacked exon 1 d.
