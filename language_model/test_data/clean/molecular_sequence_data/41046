We investigated the phylogeny of tintinnids (Ciliophora, Tintinnida) with 62 new SSU-rDNA sequences from single cells of 32 marine and freshwater species in 20 genera, including the first SSU-rDNA sequences for Amphorides, Climacocylis, Codonaria, Cyttarocylis, Parundella, Petalotricha, Undella and Xystonella, and 23 ITS sequences of 17 species in 15 genera. SSU-rDNA phylogenies suggested a basal position for Eutintinnus, distant to other Tintinnidae. We propose Eutintinnidae fam. nov. for this divergent genus, keeping the family Tintinnidae for Amphorellopsis, Amphorides and Steenstrupiella. Tintinnopsis species branched in at least two separate groups and, unexpectedly, Climacocylis branched among Tintinnopsis sensu stricto species. Tintinnopsis does not belong to the family Codonellidae, which is restricted to Codonella, Codonaria, and also Dictyocysta (formerly in the family Dictyocystidae). The oceanic genus Undella branched close to an undescribed freshwater species. Metacylis, Rhabdonella and Cyttarocylis formed a well supported clade with several Tintinnopsis species at a basal position. Petalotricha ampulla and Cyttarocylis cassis SSU-rDNA and ITS sequences were identical or almost identical. Therefore, we propose Cyttarocylis ampulla comb. nov. for them. Intensive use of single-cell isolation and sequencing revealed unexpected complexity in the evolutionary history of these relatively well-studied ciliates. Notably, the diversity of freshwater forms suggests multiple marine-freshwater invasions.
