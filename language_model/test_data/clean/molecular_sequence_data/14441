A non-sporulating, non-motile, catalase- and oxidase-positive, Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated BA-3T, was isolated from activated sludge of a wastewater treatment facility. The strain was able to degrade about 95 % of 100 mg 3-phenoxybenzoic acid l(-1) within 2 days of incubation. Growth occurred in the presence of 0-2 % (w/v) NaCl [optimum, 0.5 % (w/v) NaCl], at pH 5.5-9.0 (optimum, pH 7.0) and at 10-37 °C (optimum, 28 °C). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons revealed that strain BA-3T was a member of the genus Sphingobium; it showed highest gene sequence similarity to Sphingobium qiguonii X23T (98.2 %), and similarities of <97.0 % with strains of other Sphingobium species. The polar lipid pattern, the presence of spermidine and ubiquinone Q-10, the predominance of summed feature 8 (C18:1ω6c and/or C18:1ω7c) in the cellular fatty acid profile and the DNA G+C content also supported affiliation of the isolate to the genus Sphingobium. Strain BA-3T showed low DNA-DNA relatedness values (21.3±0.8 %) with Sphingobium qiguonii X23(T). Based on phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic data, strain BA-3T represents a novel species of the genus Sphingobium, for which the name Sphingobium jiangsuense sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is BA-3T (=CCTCC AB 2010217T= KCTC 23196T=KACC 16433T).
