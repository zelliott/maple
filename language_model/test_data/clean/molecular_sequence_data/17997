Most of the iminoproton resonances in the 1H-NMR spectrum of Bombyx mori tRNA(UCCGly) have been assigned by the sequential NOEs. Any peak which indicates the presence of the tertiary GC base pair between the D and T loops could not be detected. The effects of temperature and the addition of magnesium ions and spermine on the 1H-NMR spectrum of this tRNA were examined. From the temperature change, it was found that the acceptor stem and the D stem in Bombyx mori tRNA(UCCGly) are equally stable even in the absence of magnesium, which is different from tRNA(GCCGly) where the D stem is not so stable.
