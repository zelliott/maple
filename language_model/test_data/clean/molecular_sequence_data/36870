Double glycosylation of methyl 2,4-di-O-benzyl-beta-D-mannopyranoside with ethyl 2-O-benzoyl-3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-1-thio-alpha-D-mannopyranoside using as promoter tris(4-bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate, a stable, commercial, and crystalline radical cation, afforded after debenzoylation methyl 2,4-di-O-benzyl-3,6-di-O-(3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside in excellent yield. Other mannosyl donors were also investigated.
