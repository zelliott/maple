The modulatory action of corticotropin (ACTH) on the specific proteolysis of B-50 to B-60 [B-50(41-226)] was investigated using a previously characterized synaptosomal membrane extract [ASP(57-82)] that was highly enriched in B-50, B-50 kinase activity and a B-50 protease. In common with the previously described inhibitory action on B-50 phosphorylation at Ser41, ACTH(1-24) inhibited B-50 proteolysis in a concentration and structurally dependent manner, while ACTH(1-10) and ACTH(11-24) or a combination of both peptides were ineffective. Structural similarities between segments of ACTH(1-24) and B-50(40-55) may explain the inhibitory action of the peptide on B-50 phosphorylation and proteolysis. In addition, calmodulin, which binds to the N-terminus of the dephosphorylated form of the protein, also protected B-50 from degradation.
