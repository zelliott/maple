Calbindin D28k is a protein abundant in the mammalian central nervous system and in epithelial tissue involved in Ca2+ transport. Human calbindin D28k was cloned into a Pet3a vector and expressed in Escherichia coli. The protein was purified in three steps: (i) heat precipitation of bacterial proteins, (ii) ion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose column in the presence of calcium, and (iii) ion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sephacel column in the presence of EDTA. The protein was then supplemented with calcium and dialyzed against neutral water. The final yield was 20-50 mg of pure, homogeneous calcium-loaded calbindin D28k per liter of bacterial culture. The identity and purity of the protein were confirmed by immunoblotting, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and agarose gel electrophoresis in the absence and presence of calcium and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The entire expression and purification protocol takes only 3 days and is easy to scale up and down. It was designed to minimize degradation and deamidation.
