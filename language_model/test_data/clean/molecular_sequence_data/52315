Under substrate adherent conditions, integrin gene expression can be regulated by transforming growth factor-beta, interleukin-1 beta, and prostaglandins. This report demonstrates a new mechanism that can differentially control the expression of several integrins. When MG-63 osteosarcoma cells are maintained in suspension, up-regulation of several integrin alpha-subunits takes place. Within as little as 4 h, the mRNA levels for both the alpha 2- and alpha 4-subunits are increased 4- and 6-fold, respectively. It was found that mRNA levels for the alpha 2-, alpha 4-, and alpha v-subunits were markedly increased in several differentiated cell lines under nonadherent conditions; however, cells that did not express a given integrin under substrate adherent conditions also did not express this integrin when maintained in suspension. The alpha 5-subunit did not upregulate during suspension growth. By immunocytochemistry, changes in integrin mRNA levels were confirmed at the protein level. Both cytochalasin B and a phorbol ester were found to induce the expression of the alpha 2-subunit, but not the alpha 4- and alpha 5-subunits, in a dose-dependent fashion. Many investigators have documented changes in gene expression that result from changes in "cell shape." These phenomena may result from up-regulation of integrin gene expression induced by the lack of substrate adherence.
