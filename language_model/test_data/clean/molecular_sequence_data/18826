L-Histidinol dehydrogenase from Brucella suis (BsHDH) is an enzyme involved in the histidine biosynthesis pathway which is absent in mammals, thus representing a very interesting target for the development of anti-Brucella agents. In this paper we report the crystallographic structure of a mutated form of BsHDH both in its unbound form and in complex with a nanomolar inhibitor. These studies provide the first structural background for the rational design of potent HDH inhibitors, thus offering new hints for clinical applications.
