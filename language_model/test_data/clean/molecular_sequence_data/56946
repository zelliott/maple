The prevalence of HCV antibodies was determined by a second-generation ELISA and a four-antigen recombinant immunoblot assay in nine intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) preparations commercially available in Italy. In addition, the clinical safety of six of them was ascertained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of HCV RNA and a prospective study in 14 patients with immunodeficiency disorders. Results indicated that all IVIG preparations were anti-HCV-positive. However, there were substantial variations in their anti-HCV antibody titres. The preparations retained IgG subclass reactivities to HCV-associated structural (C22-3) and non-structural (C33c, C100-3) proteins. Our sensitive and specific PCR assay was unable to detect HCV RNA in the six preparations tested. Clinical surveillance of IVIG-treated patients prospectively evaluated over a mean period of 8.3 months failed to detect clinical and/or biochemical evidence of hepatitis.
