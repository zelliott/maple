Two classes of tilapia c-ski cDNA (accession nos. AJ012011, AJ012012), designated as tski1 and tski2, respectively encoded a 687 and a 714 AA protein and shared a 57% AA identity. Comparison with the Ski proteins of chickens, humans and Xenopus, tilapia TSki polypeptides shared a 60, 57, and 57% (TSki1) and 67, 63, and 61% (TSki2) AA identity, respectively. The most and the least abundant c-ski mRNAs are located in the brain and the skeletal muscle, respectively. Both tski1 and tski2 were widely expressed in the adult tissues examined, but tski2 transcripts were at higher levels except in the ovary and oocytes: tski1 transcripts were predominant in the ovary, whereas tski2 transcripts were predominant in the testes. In the oocytes, the tski1 mRNA was a maternally-inherited stockpile that subsequently was degraded, so that the expression ratio of tski1 to tski2 transcripts declined gradually as the fish developed from oocyte to 4-cm fry.
