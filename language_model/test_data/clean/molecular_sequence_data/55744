The cytoskeletal patterns of human platelets spread on a glass surface are analyzed. F-actin is arranged in patterns of parallel microfilaments, microfilaments forming triangles, or microfilaments radiating tangentially from a central ellipse or circle. Vinculin, a cytoskeletal protein, is located at both ends of the filaments. In platelets with tangentially radiating microfilaments, vinculin patches are aligned on the branches of a two-armed spiral. The spirals are always left-handed. Talin and two integrins (gpIIb-IIIa, vitronectin receptor), proteins usually associated with focal contacts in tissue culture cells, are not concentrated at the ends of microfilaments in human platelets. It is suggested that the distribution of vinculin is due to competitive aggregation of vinculin close to the inner leaflet of the ventral plasma membrane and that sites of cytoskeleton-membrane linkage are important for generating supramolecular asymmetries of biological systems.
