Replication of adenovirus (Ad) DNA depends on interactions between three viral and three cellular proteins. Human transcription factors NFI and Oct-1 recruit the Ad DNA polymerase to the origin of DNA replication as a complex with the Ad protein primer pTP. High affinity and specificity DNA binding to recognition sites in this origin by the transcription factors stimulate and stabilize pre-initiation complex formation to compensate for the low binding specificity of the pTP/pol complex. In this review, we discuss the properties of NFI and Oct-1 and the mechanism by which they enhance initiation of DNA replication. We propose a model that describes the dynamics of initiation and elongation as well as the assembly and disassembly of the pre-initiation complex.
