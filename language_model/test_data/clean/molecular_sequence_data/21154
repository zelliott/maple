The genomic DNA of Clostridium botulinum F str. 230613 includes a chromosome (3 993 083 bp, 3502 coding sequences (CDs)) and a plasmid (17 531 bp, 25 CDs). The arrangement of the botulinum neurotoxin serotype F (BoNT/F) gene cluster, a 15-kb (or longer) fragment including the bont gene and other relevant genes, and its different insertion sites in C. botulinum A2 and C. botulinum F were formulated. Mobile elements and virulence factors were analysed. We also found a cell adhesion and pectin lyase domain-containing protein, which may function in attaching to the host and as a pectin lyase. The nine BoNT gene clusters of group I C. botulinum strains were located at three sites in the chromosome of C. botulinum F str. 230613. This study showed the inserting inclination of BoNT/A1 tend to have gene clusters inserted at site 3, BoNT/F at site 2, and BoNT/A2 at site 1. Additionally, we found the recombination event between the BoNT gene clusters of sites 2 and 3, a mechanism that contributed to the diversity of the BoNT gene cluster arrangement.
