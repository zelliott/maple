Microcystis viridis lectin (MVL), a sugar-binding protein originally isolated from freshwater blue-green algae Microcystis viridis, has been reported to have potent anti-HIV activity. In this paper, we described the expression and purification of recombinant-MVL (R-MVL) gene in E. coli. The results demonstrated that the R-MVL in shake flask cultures was primarily expressed either in the form of inclusion bodies at 37°C or in the soluble fraction at 23 °C. Secondly, a one-step purification based on nickel-affinity chromatography was employed and 15 mg of highly purified (>95%) R-MVL from 1 l of cell cultures was yielded. The purified R-MVL was then subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS analysis for protein identification. In conclusion, for the first time, the R-MVL was successfully cloned and expressed in E. coli, which is useful for further study and large-scale cost-effective production of MVL protein.
