Selective lineage differentiation depends upon the combined action of several colony-stimulating factors. Here we describe 3 human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-erythropoietin (GM-CSF-EPO) hybrid proteins generated by recombination of the relevant cDNAs. The expression vector containing the murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV) promoter and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene was used for the expression of the hybrid genes in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Purified hybrid proteins from CHO transfectant cultures induced proliferation of both EPO and GM-CSF dependent cell lines. The clonogenic test, performed on purified human hematopoietic precursor cells, indicates that the hybrid proteins are more efficient at inducing erythroid differentiation compared with the equimolar mixture of GM-CSF and EPO.
