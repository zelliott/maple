A group of 4-methoxyphenylacetic acid esters were designed, synthesized and evaluated as potential inhibitors of soybean 15-lipoxygenase (SLO) on the basis of eugenol and esteragol structures. Compounds 7d-e showed the best IC(50) in SLO inhibition (IC(50)=3.8 and 1.9 microM, respectively). All compounds were docked in SLO active site and showed that carbonyl group of compounds is oriented toward the Fe(III)-OH moiety in the active site of enzyme and fixed by hydrogen bonding with hydroxyl group. It is assumed that lipophilic interaction of ligand-enzyme would be in charge of inhibiting the enzyme activity. The selectivity of the synthetic esters in inhibiting of 15-HLOb was also compared with 15-HLOa by molecular modeling and multiple alignment techniques.
