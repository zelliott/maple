We describe the purification and cloning of human DNA replicated at the onset of S phase in HL60 cells synchronized with aphidicolin. A survey of the overall structural properties of these sequences did not show any distinctive features except for an enrichment in Cot0 DNA. The two longer fragments were completely sequenced and studied in more detail. Both were shown to contain transcriptional signals associated with promoters and/or enhancers, such as the binding sites of Sp1, T antigen and nuclear factor III. In one instance, a binding site for a known cellular transcription factor (USF/MLTF) was located inside the sequence by footprinting. Accordingly, by CAT assay and Northern blot, the same sequence was shown to contain an active promoter. The significance of these findings with respect to the role of transcription in initiation of DNA replication at the origin is discussed. None of the tested fragments exhibited autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) activity in transfected cells. The problems connected with the detection of ARS activity in human cells are critically examined.
