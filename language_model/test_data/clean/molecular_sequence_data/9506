A parallel association study was performed in two independent cattle populations based on 41 validated, targeted single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and four microsatellite markers to re-evaluate the multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) architecture for milk performance on bovine chromosome 6 (BTA6). Two distinct QTL located in the vicinity of the middle region of BTA6, but differing unambiguously regarding their effects on milk composition and yield traits were validated in the German Holstein population. A highly significant association of the protein variant ABCG2 p.Tyr581Ser with milk composition traits reconfirmed the causative molecular relevance of the ABCG2 gene in QTL region 1, whereas in QTL region 2, significant and tentative associations between gene variants RW070 and RW023 (located in the promoter region and exon 9 of the PPARGC1A gene for milk yield traits) were detected. For the German Fleckvieh population, only RW023 showed a tentative association with milk yield traits, whereas those loci with significant effects in German Holsteins (ABCG2 p.Tyr581Ser, RW070) showed fixed alleles. Even though our new data highlight two variants in the PPARGC1A gene (RW023, RW070) in QTL region 2, based on the results of our study, currently no unequivocal conclusion about the causal background of this QTL affecting milk yield traits can be drawn. Notably, the German Holstein and Fleckvieh populations, known for their divergent degree of dairy type, differ substantially in their allele frequencies for the growth-associated NCAPG p.Ile442Met locus.
