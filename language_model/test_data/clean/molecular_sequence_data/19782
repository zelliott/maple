The Pacific nodule province covered about 4.5 million km(2) in the east tropical Pacific with an abundance of polymetallic nodules at the seafloor. In view of the environmental protection and resource preservation, the survey of biodiversity was important during the reconnaissance and exploitation in this area. As one of the important component of the deep sea ecosystem, the microbial community in the Pacific nodule province was still largely unknown. The chitinolytic bacteria diversity in deep-sea sediment of a station within the Pacific nodule province was examined by molecular technology. A total of 18 chitinase genes were detected by a set of degenerate PCR primer specific for chiA gene fragment of family 18 chitinase. Most of them belonged to the Serratia-like chitinase. Eight genes had different amino acid sequences in the conserved motif, encompassing the catalytic site among the ChiA protein of family 18 glycosyl hydrolases, and clustered in an independent clade on the phylygenetic tree.
