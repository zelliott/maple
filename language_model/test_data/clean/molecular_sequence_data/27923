The structure of the mRNA of chicken cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase has been determined by analysis of cDNA and genomic clones. Two transcripts of different length were found that appear to arise from the alternate use of 2 polyadenylation signals in the 3' untranslated region. The expression product of the full-length construct in E. coli proved to be catalytically active and possessed the expected molecular weight.
