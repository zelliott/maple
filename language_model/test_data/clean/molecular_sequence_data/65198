DNA family shuffling was used to create chimeric lipase B proteins with improved activity toward the hydrolysis of diethyl 3-(3',4'-dichlorophenyl)glutarate (DDG). Three homologous lipases from Candida antarctica ATCC 32657, Hyphozyma sp. CBS 648.91 and Crytococcus tsukubaensis ATCC 24555 were cloned and shuffled to generate a diverse gene library. A high-throughput screening assay was developed and used successfully to identify chimeric lipase B proteins having a 20-fold higher activity toward DDG than lipase B from C.antarctica ATCC 32657 and a 13-fold higher activity than the most active parent derived from C.tsukubaensis ATCC 24555. In addition, the stability characteristics of several highly active chimeric proteins were also improved as a result of family shuffling. For example, the half-life at 45 degrees C and melting point (T(m)) of one chimera exceeded those of lipase B from C.antarctica ATCC 32657 by 11-fold and 6.4 degrees C, respectively, which closely approached the stability characteristics of the most thermostable parent derived from Hyphozyma sp. CBS 648.91.
