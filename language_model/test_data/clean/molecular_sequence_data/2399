Within the human T-cell leukemia virus type I promoter, there are three copies of a 21-base-pair repeat (hereafter called the tax-responsive element [TRE]) that both contributes to basal promoter activity and mediates induction by the viral activator TAX. We have identified and separated three nuclear proteins that interact with the TRE. The TRE-binding protein designated TREB-3 bound more avidly to a multimerized TRE than to a single-copy TRE, while the other two TRE-binding proteins, TREB-1 and TREB-2, bound equally well to either TRE. TREB-1 has been purified to near homogeneity, and binding activity was localized to a protein of 35 to 43 kilodaltons. The affinity-purified TREB-1 activated transcription from the human T-cell leukemia virus type I promoter in vitro. The purified TREB-1 fraction contained activating transcription factor binding activity and showed a cooperative interaction with the TATA-binding factor (TFIID) on the adenovirus E4 promoter.
