The nucleotide sequence of the Streptococcus mutans GS-5 gtfD gene coding for the glucosyltransferase which synthesizes water-soluble glucan (GTF-S) has been determined. The complete gene contains 4293 base pairs and the unprocessed protein is composed of 1430 amino acids with a molecular mass of 159814 Da. The amino terminus of the unprocessed protein resembles the signal sequences of other extracellular proteins secreted by S. mutans and that of the GTF-I secreted by Streptococcus downei. In addition, the GTF-S protein exhibits high amino acid similarity with the strain GS-5 enzymes responsible for insoluble glucan synthesis (GTF-I, GTF-SI) previously isolated and sequenced in this laboratory. These results indicate that all three gtf genes evolved from a common ancestral gene.
