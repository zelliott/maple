We previously reported that the fibroin of the silkworm Bombyx mori enhanced the proliferation of cultured human skin fibroblasts. In this work, the fibroin was digested by chymotrypsin, and the resulting peptide fragments were fractionated and assayed for their biological activity. Two peptides that promoted fibroblast growth were isolated and identified to be VITTDSDGNE and NINDFDED. Both sequences are found in the N-terminal region of the fibroin polypeptide and are thought to be the active principle of fibroblast growth-promoting activity.
