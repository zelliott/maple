A polysaccharide containing rhamnose (Rha) and Gal was isolated by acetic acid hydrolysis, followed by gel-permeation chromatography, from the water-soluble lipopolysaccharide (phenol/water extracted) from Acinetobacter junii strain 65. The polysaccharide was characterised by means of monosaccharide analyses, Smith degradation, and NMR studies, and was shown to have a linear pentasaccharide repeating unit, as depicted below. This structure was specifically recognised in western blots and enzyme immunoassays by polyclonal rabbit antisera. [structure in text]
