Alpha-aminoadipate reductase (AAR), the signature enzyme for lysine biosynthesis in fungi, catalyses the conversion of alpha-aminoadipate to alpha-aminoadipate-semiadehyde in the presence of ATP and NADPH. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, the LYS2-encoded AAR is posttranslationally activated by CoA and the LYS5-encoded PPTase. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is evolutionarily highly diverged from S. cerevisiae and C. albicans. We report here several unusual activation characteristics of Sz. pombe Lys1p and Lys7p, isofunctional to Lys2p (AAR) and Lys5p (PPTase), respectively. Unlike the Lys2p from S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, the Sz. pombe Lys1p was active when expressed in E. coli and exhibited significant AAR activity without the addition of CoA or the Sz. pombe Lys7p intron free PPTase. Somewhat higher AAR activity was obtained with the addition of CoA and the Sz. pombe Lys7p PPTase. Substitution of G910A, S913T or S913A in the Sz. pombe Lys1p activation domain (IGGHSI) resulted in no AAR activity. Similarly, substitutions of several amino acid residues in the Sz. pombe Lys7p PPTase domain (G79A, R80K and P81A in Core 1; F93W, D94E, F95W and N96D in Core 1a; G124A, V125I and D126E in Core 2; K172R, E173D and K177R in Core 3) also resulted in no activation of Lys1p and no AAR activity. The Sz. pombe Lys1p amino acid sequence showed a high degree of similarity to other fungal Lys2p proteins; however, the Lys7p amino acid sequence showed much less similarity to other bacterial, fungal and animal PPTases representing several phylogenetic groups.
