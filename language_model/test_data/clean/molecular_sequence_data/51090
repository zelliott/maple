Active gamma subunit of skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase has been obtained by expression of the rat soleus cDNA in a baculovirus system. The protein exhibited the expected pH 6.8/8.2 activity ratio of 0.6, and its activity was insensitive to Ca2+ addition, indicating that it was free gamma subunit and not a gamma subunit-calmodulin complex. It was stimulated approximately 2-fold by Ca(2+)-calmodulin addition, demonstrating that it had retained high-affinity calmodulin binding. By site-directed mutagenesis, we have examined the role of six of the amino acids that constitute the consensus ATP binding site of the protein kinase, which in the gamma subunit is represented by the sequence 26Gly.Arg.Gly.Val.Ser.Ser.Val.Val33. Changes were evaluated by the kinetic determination of the dissociation constants of gamma-ATP, gamma-ADP, gamma-AMP.PCP, and gamma-phosphorylase and the maximum catalytic activity. The mutants Ser26-gamma, Ser29-gamma, Phe30-gamma, and Gly31-gamma each exhibited an essentially identical dissociation constant for gamma subunit phosphorylase, indicating that these mutations had not caused a global alteration in the protein structure but were limited to changes in the nucleotide binding site domain. Substitution of either Val33 (by Gly) or Gly28 (by Ser), two of the most conserved residues in all protein kinases, resulted in enzyme with marginally detectable activity. In noted contrast, the Ser26 mutant, which substituted the first glycine of the consensus glycine trio motif, and which is also very highly conserved, retained at least 25% of the enzymatic activity. The Gly31 substitution, which restored a glycine to a position characteristic for most protein kinases, had little overall effect upon the maximum rate of catalysis. Restoration of Ser30 to the more typical phenylalanine, which is present in most protein kinases, had minimal effect on catalysis. These data provide the first direct evaluation of the roles that different residues play within this consensus glycine trio/valine motif of the protein kinases, which up to now have only been surmised to be of importance because of their conservation. Two unexpected findings are that for one residue that is very conserved (Gly26) there is some flexibility of substitution not apparent from the evolutionary conservation and that a second quite conserved residue in protein kinases (equivalent to Gly at position 31) does not produce a protein optimized for nucleotide binding.
