The steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence properties of two zinc-saturated 18-residue synthetic peptides with the amino acid sequence of the NH2-terminal (NCp7 13-30 F16W, where the naturally occurring Phe was replaced by a Trp residue) and the COOH-terminal (NCp7 34-51) zinc finger domains of human immunodeficiency virus type I nucleocapsid protein were investigated. Fluorescence intensity decay of both Trp 16 and Trp 37 residues suggested the existence of two fully solvent-exposed ground-state classes governed by a C = 2.2 equilibrium constant. The lifetimes of Trp 16 classes differed from those of Trp 37 essentially because of differences in nonradiative rate constants. Arrhenius plots of the temperature-dependent nonradiative rate constants suggested that the fluorescence quenchers involved in both classes and in both peptides were different and the collisional rate of these quenchers with the indole ring was very low, probably because of the highly constrained peptide chain conformation. The nature of the ground-state classes was discussed in relation to 1H nuclear magnetic resonance data. Using Trp fluorescence to monitor the interaction of both peptides with tRNA(Phe) we found that a stacking between the indole ring of both Trp residues and the bases of tRNA(Phe) occurred. This stacking constituted the main driving force of the interaction and modified the tRNA(Phe) conformation. Moreover, the binding of both fingers to tRNA(Phe) was noncooperative with similar site size (3 nucleotide residues/peptide), but the affinity of the NH2-terminal finger domain (K = 1.3 (+/- 0.2) 10(5) M-1) in low ionic strength buffer was one order of magnitude larger than the COOH-terminal one due to additional electrostatic interactions involving Lys 14 and/or Arg 29 residues.
