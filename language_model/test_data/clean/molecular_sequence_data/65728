Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) expressed by Vibrio tubiashii under different environmental growth conditions were characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, N-terminal amino acid sequencing, and PCR analyses. Results showed the presence of a 38- to 40-kDa OmpU-like protein and ompU gene, a maltoporin-like protein, several novel OMPs, and a regulatory toxR homolog.
