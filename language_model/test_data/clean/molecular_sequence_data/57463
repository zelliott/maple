A cDNA clone was isolated for a fourth pma gene encoding a putative plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia. The sequence of the predicted 952 residue PMA4 polypeptide was compared with those of other known plant PMAs, revealing a higher identity with the Arabidopsis thaliana proteins (86-89%) than with the other three N. plumbaginifolia PMA proteins (80-82%). This supports the view that there are two pma subfamilies which probably arose from a gene duplication predating the separation of the Dilleniidae and Asteridae plant subclasses. Measured pma4 transcript levels indicate that pma4 is similarly expressed in root, stem, leaf, and flower tissues, contrary to the pmal-3 subfamily whose members displayed differential expression according to the organ.
