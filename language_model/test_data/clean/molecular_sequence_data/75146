In order to examine the frequency of nonreciprocal recombination (gene conversion) within the centromere of the yeast chromosome, we constructed strains that contained heterozygous restriction sites in the conserved centromere sequences of chromosome III in addition to heterozygous markers flanking the centromere. One of these markers was the selectable URA3 gene, which was inserted less than one kb from the centromere. We found that meiotic conversion of the URA3 gene occurred at normal frequency (about 2% of unselected tetrads) and that more than one-third of these convertants coconverted the markers within the centromere. In addition, we observed tetrads in which conversion events extended through the centromere to include a marker on the opposite side from URA3. We conclude that meiotic conversion events occur within the centromere at rates similar to other genomic sequences.
