The fixation of neutral compensatory mutations in a population depends on the effective population size of the species, which can fluctuate dramatically within a few generations, the mutation rate, and the selection intensity associated with the individual mutations. We observe compensatory mutations and intermediate states in populations of the malaria parasite Plasmodium ovale. The appearance of compensatory mutations and intermediate states in P. ovale raises interesting questions about population structure that could have considerable impact on the control of the associated disease.
