Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic fungus which causes pulmonary complications in humans and animals. The clinical spectrum observed with A. fumigatus is attributed to the multifunctional nature of its antigens. Lack of understanding on the molecular processes and complexity of the fungus have spurred interest in the identification and characterization of its antigens/allergens with biological activities and virulence functions. For identification of some of these antigens/allergens, a cDNA library of A. fumigatus was screened with antibodies of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) patients. One of the reactive clones was sequenced and observed to have an open reading frame of 1095 nucleotides corresponding to a polypeptide of 364 amino acids. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence showed significant homology with the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) superfamily. The expressed recombinant fusion protein exhibited specific IgG and IgE binding with antibodies present in ABPA patients' sera. The recombinant protein in vitro catalyzed folding of scrambled RNase. The probable epitopic regions of the deduced amino acid sequence were mapped by algorithmic analysis. This is the first report of isolation of a gene encoding a member of the PDI family from A. fumigatus. The PDI superfamily of proteins may play an important role in the protein folding mechanisms of A. fumigatus antigens/allergens for their interaction with the host.
