The insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding proteins (IGFBPs) are a family of six homologous proteins with high binding affinity for IGF-I and IGF-II. Information from NMR and mutagenesis studies is advancing knowledge of the key residues involved in these interactions. IGF binding may be modulated by IGFBP modifications, such as phosphorylation and proteolysis, and by cell or matrix association of the IGFBPs. All six IGFBPs have been shown to inhibit IGF action, but stimulatory effects have also been established for IGFBP-1, -3, and -5. These generally involve a decrease in IGFBP affinity and may require cell association of the IGFBP, but precise mechanisms are unknown. The same three IGFBPs have well established effects that are independent of type I IGF receptor signaling. IGFBP-1 exerts these effects by signaling through alpha(5)beta(1)-integrin, whereas IGFBP-3 and -5 may have specific cell-surface receptors with serine kinase activity. The regulation of cell sensitivity to inhibitory IGFBP signaling may play a role in the growth control of malignant cells.
