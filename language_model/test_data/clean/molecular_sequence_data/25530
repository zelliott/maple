Maturation of eukaryotic tRNA molecules requires nuclear processing as well as nuclear and cytoplasmic modification of specific nucleotides. Nucleotide modifications within the anticodon are found in the majority of all tRNAs and are among the last maturation events to occur in vivo. We show that 5' and 3' processing of SP6 polymerase-generated transcripts are not necessary for the in vitro modification of A----I in the anticodon of tRNA(Ala).
