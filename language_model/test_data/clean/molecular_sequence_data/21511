The neuron-specific isoform of the TAF1 gene (N-TAF1) is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of DYT3 dystonia, which leads to progressive neurodegeneration in the striatum. To determine the expression pattern of N-TAF1 transcripts, we developed a specific monoclonal antibody against the N-TAF1 protein. Here we show that in the rat brain, N-TAF1 protein appears as a nuclear protein within subsets of neurons in multiple brain regions. Of particular interest is that in the striatum, the nuclei possessing N-TAF1 protein are largely within medium spiny neurons, and they are distributed preferentially, though not exclusively, in the striosome compartment. The compartmental preference and cell type-selective distribution of N-TAF1 protein in the striatum are strikingly similar to the patterns of neuronal loss in the striatum of DYT3 patients. Our findings suggest that the distribution of N-TAF1 protein could represent a key molecular characteristic contributing to the pattern of striatal degeneration in DYT3 dystonia.
