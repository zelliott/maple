As part of the European Union program of European Scientist Sequencing Arabidopsis (ESSA), the DNA sequence of a 24.053-bp insert of cosmid clone CC17J13 was determined. The cosmid is located on chromosome 1 at the PFL locus (position 30 cM). Analysis of the sequence and comparison to public databases predicts seven genes in this area, thus approximately one gene every 3.3 kb. Three cDNAs corresponding to genes in this region were also sequenced. The homologies and/or possible functions of the (putative) genes are discussed. Proteins encoded by genes in this region include a polyadenylate-binding protein (PAB-3) and a GTP-binding protein (Rab7) as well as a novel protein, possibly involved in double-stranded RNA unwinding and apoptosis. Intriguingly, the gene encoding the PAB-3 protein, which is very specifically expressed, is flanked by putative matrix attachment regions.
