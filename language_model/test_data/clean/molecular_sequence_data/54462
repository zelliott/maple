Using peptides to achieve the functional and structural mimicry of small-molecules, especially those with biological activity or clear biotechnological applications, has great potential in overcoming difficulties associated with synthesis, or unfavorable physical properties. Combinatorial techniques like phage display can aid in the discovery of these peptides even if their mechanism of mimicry is not rationally obvious.The major focus of this field has been limited to developing biotin and sugar mimetics. However, the full "mimicry" of these peptides has not yet been fully established as some bind to the target with a different mechanism than that of the natural ligand and some do not share all of the natural ligand's binding partners. In this article, mimicry of small-molecules by phage display-discovered peptides is reviewed and their potential in biochemical and medical applications is analyzed.
