A cDNA encoding a novel galactosyltransferase was identified based on BLAST analysis of expressed sequence tags, and the cDNA clones were isolated from a human melanoma line library. The new cDNA sequence encoded a type II membrane protein with 327 amino acid sequence and showed 38% homology to the Caenorhabditis elegans sqv-3 gene involved in the vulval invagination and oocyte development. Extracts from L cells transfected with the galactosyltransferase cDNA in an expression vector and a fusion protein with protein A exhibited marked galactosyltransferase activity specific for p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside. Moreover, transfection with the cloned cDNA restored glycosaminoglycan synthesis of galactosyltransferase I-deficient Chinese hamster ovary mutant pgsB-761 cells. Analysis of the enzyme product by beta-galactosidase digestion, mass spectroscopy, and NMR spectroscopy revealed that the reaction product was formed via beta-1,4 linkage, indicating that the enzyme is galactosyltransferase I (UDP-galactose:O-beta-D-xylosylprotein 4-beta-D-galactosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.133) involved in the synthesis of the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region of proteoglycans.
