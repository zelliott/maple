The minimal fragment of mitochondrial DNA from Papaver somniferum L. (poppy) able to promote autonomous plasmid replication in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was sequenced. Sequence analysis of the 917-bp MK4/8 DNA fragment revealed a high AT content, and the presence of two 12-bp sequences differing from the ARS core consensus of S. cerevisiae only by a T and C insertion, respectively. The mitochondrial insert contains a further six 11-bp sequences with one mismatch to the S. cerevisiae core consensus, more then 20 related sequences with two base pair exchanges, numerous direct and inverted repeats, and many copies of a sequence motif called the ARS box. The original 4.2-kb mitochondrial DNA fragment, as well as the minimal 917-bp subfragment in vector pFL1-E (a variant of YIP5, lacking an origin of replication in yeast), were then tested for their ability to replicate autonomously in another fungus, Kluyveromyces lactis.
