The Spanish Canary Islands face the northwest coast of Africa, being one gate of entrance of African immigrants into Europe and of HIV-1 non-B strains, prevalent in most African regions. The presence and nature of HIV-1 non-B subtypes were examined in Spanish natives newly diagnosed with HIV-1 infection from 1998 to 2004 in a reference hospital located in one of the largest islands of the archipelago. Subtyping of HIV-1 pol genes was performed in 139 out of 429 individuals found to be HIV-1 positive during that period. Non-B strains infected 40 (28.8%) subjects, 12 (13.7%) out of 87 native Spaniards and 28 (53.8%) out of 52 immigrants (75% Africans) (p < 0.01). HIV-1 non-B subtypes, mostly recombinant forms, were present in Spaniards at least since 1998. HIV-1 non-B subtypes are frequently recognized in HIV+ Africans arriving in the Canary islands and continuously introduced into the newly diagnosed HIV-1+ native population living in the archipelago.
