A Chinese patient with sporadic, severe hemophilia B was found to have a low level of total factor IX antigen (3.5 U/dl), but less apparent antigen in an assay using a calcium-dependent antibody fraction (1.1 U/dl). This suggested a defect in the factor IX Gla domain coded mainly by exon 2 of the factor IX gene. Exon 2 was therefore amplified and sequenced. An A to T substitution was found at nucleotide 6455 of the patient's factor IX gene. This transversion changes the codon for Glu 27 in normal factor IX to a codon for Val. Since Glu 27 becomes an essential Gla residue, the defect should result in altered calcium-binding or calcium-dependent conformation of the patient's factor IX. The introduction of a hydrophobic side chain also appears to affect the hemophilic protein's stability. In leukocyte DNA from the patient's mother, the nucleotide sequence of exon 2 was entirely normal. Thus, barring somatic mosaicism within her germ cells, the new mutation occurred in oogenesis of her ovary.
