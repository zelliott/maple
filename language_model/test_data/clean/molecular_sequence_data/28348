The structures of four novel joints present in the amplified DNA of a Syrian hamster cell line highly resistant to N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate were analyzed. Novel joints J1, J2, and J4 were formed by recombination between two regions of wild-type DNA, whereas joint J3 is the end point of an inverted duplication. A fraction of the J3 copies displays a cruciform structure in the purified genomic DNA. The formation of J1 and J2 apparently involved a simple breakage and joining of the two wild-type sequences, whereas extra nucleotides are present at the junction point of J3 and J4. The two regions of the wild-type DNA which have recombined to form J1, J2, and J4 show few sequence similarities, indicating that these joints probably resulted from nonhomologous recombination. AT-rich regions are present in the vicinity of the breakpoint for the four joints and eight of 10 crossover points could be associated with putative topoisomerase I cleavage sites. Our results indicate that different types of novel joints are present in the amplified DNA of this cell line, which was isolated after several steps of selection.
