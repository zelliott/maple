Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major health problem worldwide, infecting an estimated 170 million people. The high genetic variability of HCV contributes to the chronicity of hepatitis C. Here, we report results from a large-scale sequence analysis of 67 patients infected with HCV genotype 1, 23 with subtype 1a and 44 with subtype 1b. Two regions of the HCV genome were analysed in samples prior to combined therapy with alpha interferon plus ribavirin, one compressing the hypervariable regions (HVR1, HVR2 and HVR3) of the E2 glycoprotein and another one including the interferon-sensitive determining region (ISDR) and the V3 domain of the NS5A protein. Genetic diversity measures showed a clear tendency to higher genetic variability levels in nonresponder patients to antiviral treatment than in responder patients, although highly disperse values were present within each response group for both subtypes. A more detailed analysis of amino acid composition revealed the presence of several subtype-specific variants in a few positions, but no discriminating positions between responder and nonresponder patients were detected. Our results also revealed that most amino acid positions were highly conserved, especially for subtype 1a. We conclude that the outcome of the antiviral treatment might depend not only on the nature of one or a few independent positions, but more likely on the combination of several positions along the HCV genome. Moreover, the own host's ability to generate an appropriate systemic response, in combination with the action of antivirals, is also likely to be essential for treatment outcome.
