Triple-reassortant (TR) H3N2 swine influenza viruses (SIV) are a major cause of respiratory disease in swine worldwide, causing considerable morbidity and mortality. Continuous surveillance of circulating SIV strains is imperative for effective control and prediction of new emerging strains with interspecies transmission potential. The current study characterized SIV isolates from commercial swine population in USA (2006-2007). Nine isolates were completely sequenced, and the molecular evolution of all gene segments was analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis of the nine H3N2 viruses indicated that these strains belonged to cluster-IV of the human/swine/avian TR genotype, grouping with H3N2 viruses of turkey origin, while forming a separate sub-lineage from those of human and avian origin strains. Ten amino acid changes were observed at the major antigenic sites of HA1 region compared to the cluster-III reference strain, with differences in glycosylation sites. All the nine strains were antigenically related to the cluster-IV turkey strain than the cluster-III reference strain. The results of this study suggest that contemporary TR H3N2 strains circulating in North America share the same genetic constellation, thus maintaining the gene pool without any further event of genetic reassortment unlike swine-origin pandemic strain A/California/04/2009/H1N1. These findings strongly support the need for continuous surveillance and monitoring of genetic changes in SIV, to identify evolving strains that might pose a threat to human or animal health.
