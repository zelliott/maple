High molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) are of a particular interest because of their biomechanical properties, which are important in many food systems such as breadmaking. Using fold-recognition techniques, we identified a fold compatible with the N-terminal domain of HMW-GS Dy10. This fold corresponds to the one adopted by proteins belonging to the cereal inhibitor family. Starting from three known protein structures of this family as templates, we built three models for the N-terminal domain of HMW-GS Dy10. We analyzed these models, and we propose a number of hypotheses regarding the N-terminal domain properties that can be tested experimentally. In particular, we discuss two possible ways of interaction between the N-terminal domains of the y-type HMW glutenin subunits. The first way consists in the creation of interchain disulfide bridges. According to our models, we propose two plausible scenarios: (1) the existence of an intrachain disulfide bridge between cysteines 22 and 44, leaving the three other cysteines free of engaging in intermolecular bonds; and (2) the creation of two intrachain disulfide bridges (involving cysteines 22-44 and cysteines 10-55), leaving a single cysteine (45) for creating an intermolecular disulfide bridge. We discuss these scenarios in relation to contradictory experimental results. The second way, although less likely, is nevertheless worth considering. There might exist a possibility for the N-terminal domain of Dy10, Nt-Dy10, to create oligomers, because homologous cereal inhibitor proteins are known to exist as monomers, homodimers, and heterooligomers. We also discuss, in relation to the function of the cereal inhibitor proteins, the possibility that this N-terminal domain has retained similar inhibitory functions.
