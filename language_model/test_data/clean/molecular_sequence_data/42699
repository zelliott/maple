A number of protected active peptide analogues of Cholecystokinin were prepared in solution by N-end stretching method with active esters. In the synthesis t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc-) and benzyloxycarbonyl (Z-) were applied as protecting groups. Six oligopeptides which contained protecting groups have not yet been reported in literature. Their structures were identified by amino acid analysis, opticity, IR and FAB-MS. The results of preliminary pharmacological tests show all the samples have biological activities in various degrees.
