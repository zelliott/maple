A procedure based on polymerase chain reaction use for the detection of rotavirus has been developed. Full length cDNA copy of the VP7 gene coding for the major neutralization glycoprotein of the human rotavirus RK9 with an unusual "wide" electrophoretype is cloned and sequenced. Glycoprotein VP7 of RK9 has a unique amino acid composition in A and C antigenic regions. It shows that strain RK9 represents a new (12) rotavirus serotype.
