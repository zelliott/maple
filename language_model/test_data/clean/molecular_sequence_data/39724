ARM genes, whose polypeptide consist of Armadillo/beta-catenin-like repeats (ARM) domain(s), exist ubiquitously from fly to vertebrates. These genes have multiple functions in signal transduction, development, cell adhesion and mobility, tumor initiation and metastasis. In this study, we have isolated a novel splicing variant of ARMC3 from human fetal brain, which is 2439 bp, encoding a 688-amino acid polypeptide that contains three typical ARM domains. The cDNA called ARMC3_v2 and the original called ARMC3_v1 (GeneBank: BC039312) are both located on the human chromosome 10p12.23. RT-PCR analysis in our work showed that ARMC3_v2 was detected in human skeletal muscle, liver, spleen and thymus; in contrast, ARMC3_v1 in skeletal muscle, lung, prostate and testis.
