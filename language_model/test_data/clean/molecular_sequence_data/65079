A presumptive chromosomal cephalosporinase (pI, 9.0) from a clinical strain of Acinetobacter genomic species 3 (AG3) is reported. The nucleotide sequence of this beta-lactamase shows for the first time the gene encoding an AmpC enzyme in AG3. In addition, the biochemical properties of the novel AG3 AmpC beta-lactamase are reported
