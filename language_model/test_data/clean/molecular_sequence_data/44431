The amino acid sequence of the light chain of Acanthamoeba myosin IC deduced from the cDNA sequence comprises 149 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 16,739. All but the 3 N-terminal residues were also determined by amino acid sequencing of the purified protein, which also showed the N-terminus to be blocked. Phylogenetic analysis shows Acanthamoeba myosin IC light chain to be more similar to the calmodulin subfamily of EF-hand calcium-modulated proteins than to the myosin II essential light chain or regulatory light chain subfamilies. In pairwise comparisons, the myosin IC light chain sequence is most similar to sequences of calmodulins (approximately 50% identical) and a squid calcium-binding protein (approximately 43% identical); the sequence is approximately 37% identical to the calcium-binding essential light chain of Physarum myosin II and approximately 30% identical to the essential light chain of Acanthamoeba myosin II, and the essential light chain and regulatory light chain of Dictyostelium myosin II. The sequence predicts four helix-loop-helix domains with possible calcium-binding sites in domains I and III, suggesting that calcium may affect the activity of this unconventional myosin. This is the first report of the sequence of an unconventional myosin light chain other than calmodulin.
