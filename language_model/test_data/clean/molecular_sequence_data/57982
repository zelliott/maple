Antibodies raised against a purified fraction from microsomal membranes of leek epidermal cells were used to screen a lambda zap expression library from epidermal cells of leak plants. A near full-length clone was isolated. This cDNA contains an open reading-frame of 1,191 bp coding for a DnaJ protein (leek DNAJ 1 or LDJ1). Leek DnaJ1 represents the second protein of this type described in a pluricellular organism, the first being that sequenced from human cells.
