Two products of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL111a gene have been previously identified to resemble human IL-10 (hIL-10). These viral IL-10s (vIL-10s) are able to induce signal transduction events and biological activities in a variety of cells. In this study, five novel vIL-10 transcripts were identified from HCMV AD169 infected MRC-5 cells. Some vIL-10 isoforms were post-translationally glycosylated, depending on the existence of a predicted N-linked glycosylation site. Similar to hIL-10, four of the vIL-10 isoforms apparently formed putative dimers. Among the different vIL-10 isoforms, vIL-10A significantly induced the phosphorylation of transcription factor STAT3 in THP-1 cells. All identified vIL-10 isoforms were able to form complexes with hIL-10, and enhanced hIL-10-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in different degrees. Identification of diverse forms of vIL-10 suggests that HCMV has developed a sophisticated mechanism to interfere with hIL-10 signaling pathway.
