Glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, the key regulatory enzyme for de novo purine nucleotide synthesis, is subject to feedback regulation by adenine and guanine nucleotides. Affinity labeling with 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA) and 8-azidoadenosine 5'-monophosphate (N3-AMP) was used to identify purine nucleotide sites for feedback control of the Escherichia coli amidotransferase. FSBA inactivated the amidotransferase with saturation kinetics. Specificity for inactivation was shown by the covalent attachment of 2.0-2.4 eq of [3H] sulfobenzoyladenosine (SBA) per subunit and protection by GMP and AMP against inactivation and incorporation of [3H]SBA. Six chymotryptic peptides modified with [3H]SBA were isolated and identified by differential labeling followed by high performance liquid chromatography and radioactivity. Mass spectrometry and Edman degradation analysis were used to identify 5 residues that were covalently modified by [3H]SBA: Tyr74, Tyr258, Lys326, Tyr329, and Tyr465. Tyr258 was also modified by N3-AMP. Mutant enzymes K326Q and Y329A had activity similar to that of the wild type enzyme. However, both mutants exhibited decreased sensitivity to inhibition by GMP and decreased binding of GMP but were inhibited by AMP. Mutant enzymes Y74A and Y258F were normally feedback-inhibited but were defective in glutamine amide transfer and synthase functions, respectively. Therefore Tyr74 and Tyr258 are important for activity and modification by FSBA and N3-AMP accounts for enzyme inactivation. These results localize residues important for catalysis in close proximity to a site for nucleotide binding. Two additional mutant enzymes, G331I and N351A, were constructed which were refractory to inhibition by GMP with little change in inhibition by AMP. A replacement of Tyr465 indicates that this residue is not essential for catalysis or feedback inhibition. Overall, these results are interpreted in terms of a two-nucleotide site model with Lys326, Tyr329, Gly331, and Asn351 defining a site required for inhibition by GMP. A second nucleotide site not affinity labeled by analogs is very close to or overlaps with the catalytic site.
