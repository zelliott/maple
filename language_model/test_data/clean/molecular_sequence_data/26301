Recombinant hirudin variant rHV2-Lys47 was radioiodinated using the chloramine-T method. Depending on the reaction pH, the two tyrosine residues, Tyr3 and Tyr63, responded differently to iodination but without change in total iodination yield. Of the incorporated -125 iodine 80% was located on Tyr3 at pH 7.4, but 65% was found on Tyr63 at pH 4. These distinct iodination patterns suggest the existence of a pH-dependent multimerization and/or important conformational changes in the tertiary structure with pH. Each radiotracer was purified to high specific activity by simple low-pressure chromatography including gel filtration and reverse-phase separation, both on short cartridges. The method was validated by reverse-phase and anion-exchange HPLC with on-line radioactivity detection. The iodination sites were characterized following carboxypeptidase Y cleavage coupled with radio-HPLC.
