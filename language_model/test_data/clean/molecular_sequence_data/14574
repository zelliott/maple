Deep sequencing detected a potential bioterrorism agent, Francisella tularensis, in a human abscess sample (Iwaki-08) of unknown etiology. Identified single-nucleotide variations suggest that the Iwaki-08 case was associated with Francisella tularensis subsp. holarctica (biovar japonica) but not the highly virulent type A (Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis).
