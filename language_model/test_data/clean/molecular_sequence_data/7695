Progress recently made in the synthesis of biologically relevant N- and O-glycopeptides is illustrated by examples. In this context, developments in the preparation of complex saccharide side chains and in the subsequent coupling to peptide portions is described. Special emphasis is given to the synthesis of Lewis antigen-type structures. Furthermore, modern methods in solid phase peptide syntheses utilizing glycosylated building blocks are presented. Recent advances in glycopeptide syntheses employing enzymatic methods in deprotection steps as well as in peptide/saccharide chain elongation are reported.
