A gel-free, shotgun proteomics approach was used to characterize pomegranate aril proteome by nanoliquid chromatography-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. To identify both high-abundance and low-abundance proteins, we applied two distinct sample preparation protocols, i.e., a classical one widely applied in literature and a second one able to reduce the dynamic range of protein concentration of the sample, based on combinatorial hexapeptide ligand library technology. However, the proteins identified with the latter protocol were only a small minority. Because pomegranate is a non-model plant species, i.e., information of its genome sequence are lacking, only a few protein sequences are included in the most widely known protein sequence databases. To improve both the number of identified proteins and data reliability, identification was performed integrating the results obtained with three distinct plant protein databases, since the majority of proteins could only be attributed by homology with other plant species. Nevertheless, many proteins had assigned only one unique peptide, because of the phylogenetic distance of pomegranate from the main model plants. After manual revision of the identified proteins to eliminate the redundant or ambiguous identifications, a list of 1,488 proteins was obtained, only six of which belonging to pomegranate species. To the author's best knowledge, this is the first work aimed at the proteomic characterization of Punica granatum.
