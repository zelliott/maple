Sequence diversity was assessed of the complete VP1 gene directly amplified from 49 clinical specimens during an explosive foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in Taiwan. Type O Taiwan FMD viruses are genetically highly homogenous, as seen by the minute divergence of 0.2-0.9% revealed in 20 variants. The O/HCP-0314/TW/97 and O/TCP-022/TW/97 viral variants dominated FMD outbreaks and were prevalent in most affected pig-raising areas. Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences around the main neutralizable antigenic sites on the VP1 polypeptide showed no significant antigenic variation. However, the O/CHP-158/TW/97 variant had an alternative critical residue at position 43 in antigenic site 3, which may be due to selective pressure in the field. Two vaccine production strains (O1/Manisa/Turkey/69 and O1/Campos/Brazil/71) probably provide partial heterologous protection of swine against O Taiwan viruses. The type O Taiwan variants clustered in sublineage A1 of four main lineages in the phylogenetic tree. The O/Hong Kong/9/94 and O/1685/Moscow/Russia/95 viruses in sublineage A2 are closely related to the O Taiwan variants. The causative agent for the 1997 epidemic presumably originated from a single common source of type O FMD viruses prevalent in neighboring areas.
