Circular dichroism, and steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy were used to compare the native recombinant human DNA repair protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) with AGT bound to ds-DNA. Contrary to fluorescence, analysis of the far-UV CD spectra indicated a conformational change of AGT upon binding to DNA: its alpha-helical content is increased by approximately 12%. Analysis of near-UV CD spectra revealed that DNA was also affected, probably being separated into single strands locally.
