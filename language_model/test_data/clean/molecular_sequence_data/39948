CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7), which regulates the trafficking of leucocytes to the secondary lymphoid organs, has two endogenous chemokine ligands: CCL19 and CCL21. Although both ligands possess similar affinities for the receptor and similar abilities to promote G protein activation and chemotaxis, they share only 25% sequence identity. Here, we show that substituting N-terminal six amino acids of CCL21 (SDGGAQ) for the corresponding N-terminal domain of CCL19 (GTNDAE) results in a chimeric chemokine that exhibits high affinity binding and G protein activation of CCR7. These data demonstrate that despite dissimilar sequences, the amino terminal hexapeptide of these two chemokines is capable of performing similar roles resulting in receptor activation.
