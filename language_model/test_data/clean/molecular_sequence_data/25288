DNA sequences from the long terminal repeat of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV-LTR) position nucleosomes both in vivo and in vitro. Here, were present chromatin reconstitution experiments showing that MMTV-LTR sequences from -236 to +204 accommodate two histone octamers in positions compatible with the in vivo data. This positioning is not influenced by the length of the DNA fragment and occurs in linear as well as in closed circular DNA molecules. MMTV-LTR DNA sequences show an intrinsic bendability that closely resembles its wrapping around the histone octamer. We propose that bendability is responsible for the observed rotational nucleosome positioning. Translational nucleosome positioning seems also to be determined by the DNA sequence. These data, along with the results from reconstitution experiments with insertion mutants, support a modular model of nucleosome phasing on MMTV-LTR, where the actual positioning of the histone octamer results from the additive effect of multiple features of the DNA sequence.
