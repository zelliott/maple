Through a variety of techniques, several investigators have demonstrated the presence of an H-K-adenosinetriphosphatase (H-K-ATPase) enzyme in the renal collecting duct, suggesting that this enzyme serves an important physiological role in the regulation of acid-base balance and potassium excretion by the kidney. The present study was designed to localize cells expressing H-K-ATPase beta-subunit mRNA in rat and rabbit kidney by nonradioactive in situ hybridization. A 570-bp DNA fragment of rabbit renal H-K-ATPase beta-subunit was used to produce digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes by in vitro transcription. Northern blot hybridization demonstrated transcripts in rat gastric oxyntic mucosa and kidney. In situ hybridization on kidney tissue sections demonstrated H-K-ATPase beta-subunit mRNA localization in epithelial cells, including intercalated cells in the connecting segment and cortical and medullary collecting duct, principal cells in the inner stripe of the outer medullary collecting duct, and inner medullary collecting duct cells in both the rat and the rabbit. These observations provide evidence that H-K-ATPase beta-subunit mRNA is present throughout the collecting duct of the kidney. The distribution of this message is consistent with a role for H-K-ATPase in bicarbonate absorption in both the outer and inner medullary collecting duct.
