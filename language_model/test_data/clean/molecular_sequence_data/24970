In frog skin, tachykinins stimulate ion transport by interaction with NK1-like receptors. The structural requirements of the peptide are the presence of the C-terminal sequence Phe-X-Gly-Leu-Met-NH(2) and at least one Pro residue in the N-terminal sequence. In this paper, we demonstrate that the C-terminal amino acid must be amidated but it can be different from Met, and that the sequence cannot be longer or shorter than 11-12 amino acids. Unexpectedly, Ranamargarin (14 amino acids, no Pro residue) increased the short circuit current value by 48 +/- 0.3%. On the basis of considerable experimental evidence, we suggest that Ranamargarin interacts with a receptor different from those of other tachykinins.
