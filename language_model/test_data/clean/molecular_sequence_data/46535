A human cDNA library was constructed using M13 derivative vectors. The simple and rapid procedures for sequencing single-stranded DNA by the dideoxy chain termination method allowed a screening of individual clones directly by DNA sequence analysis. Some of these clones were identified as coding for: serum albumin, alpha1-antitrypsin, retinol-binding protein, prothrombin, haptoglobin, and metallothionein. Furthermore, a clone coding for aldolase B was tentatively identified on the basis of high sequence homology with rabbit muscle aldolase.
