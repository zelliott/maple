(-)mRNA complementary to human angiotensin II (+)mRNA encodes the 'antipeptide' Glu-Gly-Val-Tyr-Val-His-Pro-Val which is structurally related to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II 'antipeptide' (antiANG II) and the desglutamyl heptapeptide (antiANG III) are Type I antagonists which inhibit the contractile action of angiotensin at smooth muscle receptors by binding to a negative modulatory site on the angiotensin receptor which is distinct from the angiotensin binding site. These findings may illustrate that the inhibitory binding site on the angiotensin receptor exists to accomodate a naturally occurring inhibitor(s), which is encoded by the DNA strand complementary to that encoding angiotensin II.
