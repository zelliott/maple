In this study, we report the cloning of a StAR cDNA from a hamster adrenal cDNA library. The library was screened using a PCR fragment specific for the hamster adrenal StAR cDNA. Several clones of different lengths were obtained and one of these was sequenced. Northern blotting analysis revealed the presence of the StAR mRNA in male and female adrenals, in tests and ovaries, but not in the liver or kidneys of either sex. Whole hamster adrenals revealed the presence of four mRNAs of 0.65, 1.7, 3.1 and 5.25 kb, respectively. In addition, ACTH regulates the expression of StAR mRNA in hamster adrenals. Indeed, when groups of hamsters were injected with ACTH and sacrificed at different times after treatment, only the 0.65 kb form of the StAR mRNA did not increase, whereas the other forms increased at varying levels. These results might suggest that the expression of the StAR protein in hamster adrenals depends upon different genes, different promoters, or different polyadenylation signal sites. In conclusion, these results indicate that in vivo, StAR is regulated by ACTH, suggesting the participation of this protein in controlling the transformation of cholesterol to pregnenolone, a key regulatory step in corticosteroidogenesis.
