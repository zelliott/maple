Annexins have been suggested to play pivotal roles in stress resistance and plant development. However, related studies on fruit-bearing plants, especially on fruit development, are very limited. In the present study, we provide a comprehensive overview of the annexin family in tomato, describing the gene structure, promoter cis-regulatory elements, organ expression profile, and gene expression patterns under hormone and stress treatments. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the nine tomato annexins were structurally different from their animal counterparts, but highly conserved annexin domains were still found in most of them. Cis-regulatory element prediction showed that there were important elements in the 2kb upstream promoter regions, including stress- and hormone-responsive-related elements. The expression patterns of these genes were investigated, and the results revealed that they were regulated under developmental processes and environmental stimuli. Among them, AnnSl1.1 and AnnSl2 were highly expressed in most of the tested organs. Genes preferentially or specifically expressed in organs, such as stigma or ovary (AnnSl6), stamen (AnnSl8), and fruit pericarp (AnnSl1.2 and AnnSl9), were identified. Some annexin genes were induced by plant hormones including abscisic acid (AnnSl3, AnnSl6, AnnSl8, and AnnSl9) and gibberellic acid (AnnSl1.1, AnnSl1.2, AnnSl4, and AnnSl7). Most of these annexin genes were induced by salt, drought, wounding, and heat or cold stresses. The present study provides significant information for understanding the diverse roles of annexins in tomato growth and development.
