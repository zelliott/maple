Amplification of human DNA sequences in 16 monochromosomal somatic cell hybrids containing different human chromosomes were performed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primer directed at human-specific regions of Alu or L1, the two major classes of interspersed repetitive sequences (IRS-PCR). A chromosome-specific pattern of amplification products was observed on agarose gels run with ethidium bromide, producing a "PCR-karyotype." This simple gel analysis provides a rapid method for identifying and monitoring the human chromosomal content of monochromosomal somatic cell hybrids without conventional cytogenetic analysis. Hybrids containing multiple human chromosome produce complex gel patterns, but identification of chromosome content can be achieved by hybridization of PCR products against a reference panel of monochromosomal or highly reduced hybrids representing each human chromosome. This dot-blot method also enables identification of human marker chromosomes or translocated pieces in hybrids that are not identifiable by cytogenetic methods. These IRS-PCR methods should greatly reduce the need for more laborious cytogenetic, isozyme, and Southern blot characterizations of human-rodent cell hybrids.
