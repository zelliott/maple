cDNA encoding the alpha-subunit of the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase was cloned from a chicken kidney cDNA library and the nucleotide sequence determined. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 92% sequence homology with the alpha-subunit of the sheep kidney (Na+ + K+)-ATPase, and high cross-species homologies were found among nucleotide sequences both in the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions of the "kidney-type" alpha-subunit mRNAs. The cDNA was subcloned into a shuttle vector derived from pSV2CAT and was stably incorporated into mouse Ltk- cells. Expression of the avian alpha-sub-unit could be activated by culture of the cells in 10 mM butyrate. Cells expressing avian alpha-subunits displayed high-affinity ouabain binding (KD = 2.6 +/- 0.7 x 10(-7) M) and ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake, characteristic of avian cells.
