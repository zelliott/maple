A new integron, located on the R plasmid of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was isolated in Japan. This integron was made up of two conserved segments (5'-and 3'-conserved segments) and a single streptomycin resistance gene as a gene cassette. The structure of this integron resembles that of integron InC, the existence of which was postulated by Bissonnette and Roy (J. Bacteriol. 174, 1248-1257, 1992).
