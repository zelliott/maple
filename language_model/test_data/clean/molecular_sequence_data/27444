To investigate epidemiologic feature and genetic variance of Sapovirus among children in China, fecal specimens were collected from children under 5 years old with acute diarrhea from Feb 2006 to Jan 2007 in nine provinces including Anhui, Fujian et al. A total of 1,110 fecal samples were detected for Sapovirus by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). Ten samples (0.9%) were positive for Sapovirus. The PCR products were then sequenced and analysed by phylogenetic tree. The results indicated that the detected Sapovirus strains were classified into two genogroups and three genotypes, including G I/1, G I/3, G II/3.
