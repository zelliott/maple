Deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) is responsible for mucopolysaccharidosis type II (OMIM 309900). The IDS gene (Xq28) has been completely sequenced (accession number L35485). Northern blot analysis of poly(A(+)) RNA from different tissues, hybridized with the total IDS cDNA, has revealed three major species of 2.1, 5.4 and 5.7 kb and one minor of 1.4 kb. The 1.4-kb mRNA has been previously described and we show that the three major IDS mRNA are the result of alternative polyadenylation site selection: a non-canonical ATTAAA signal at genomic position 23631 for the 2.1-kb mRNA, a AATAAA signal at position 27156 for the 5.4-kb mRNA and a AATAAA signal at position 27399 for the 5.7-kb mRNA. The different IDS mRNA encode for the same polypeptide and the most abundant transcripts have a long 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). The absence of obvious correlation between transcripts content and size, IDS protein amount and IDS activity in the four human fetal tissues tested suggests that it is IDS protein processing that may be regulated rather than IDS gene transcription.
