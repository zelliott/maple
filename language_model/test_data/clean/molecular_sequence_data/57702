The optomotor-blind gene of Drosophila melanogaster is large and genetically complex. Five partly independent complementation groups are uncovered by several viable and lethal mutations at the locus. At least 15 RNA signals have been detected by Northern blot analysis. One of them, T3, derived from a 75 kb primary transcript, has been proposed as the carrier of optomotor-blind function, based on the large size of its precursor and its tissue distribution. We here provide direct evidence that T3 is the optomotor-blind transcript. A facile and generally applicable selection scheme for the isolation of intragenic meiotic recombinants was applied to map two lethal optomotor-blind point mutations to exons of the T3 transcript. Amplification of mutant DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the amplified exons revealed the presence of mutations that lead to truncation of the T3 open reading frame. The recombination rate observed in the optomoter-blind locus is within the range of rates that have been determined in a few other Drosophila loci.
