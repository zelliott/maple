Nuclear Factor I (NF1) is a DNA binding protein that is known to function in the replication of Adeno virus and also binds to many promoters recognized by RNA polymerase II. We have found that there is also an NF1 binding site within the ribosomal gene promoter from Xenopus laevis as well as in several other promoters recognized by RNA polymerase I. The function of a binding site for a polymerase II transcription factor within a promoter recognized by polymerase I is not known. However, its presence suggests interesting regulatory possibilities.
