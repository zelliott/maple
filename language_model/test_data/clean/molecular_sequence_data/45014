Under salt stress conditions, the level of CpNpG-methylation (N is any nucleoside) of the nuclear genome of the facultative halophyte Mesembryanthemum crystallinum in the CCWGG sequences (W = A or T) increases two-fold and is coupled with hypermethylation of satellite DNA on switching-over of C3-photosynthesis to the crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) pathway of carbon dioxide assimilation. The methylation pattern of the CCWGG sequences is not changed in both the 5'-promoter region of the gene of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, the key enzyme of C4-photosynthesis and CAM, and in the nuclear ribosomal DNA. Thus, a specific CpNpG-hypermethylation of satellite DNA has been found under conditions of expression of a new metabolic program. The functional role of the CpNpG-hypermethylation of satellite DNA is probably associated with formation of a specialized chromatin structure simultaneously regulating expression of a large number of genes in the cells of M. crystallinum plants on their adaptation to salt stress and switching-over to CAM metabolism.
