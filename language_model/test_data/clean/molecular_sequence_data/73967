The taxonomic characteristics of five bacterial strains which were isolated from Antarctic coastal marine environments were studied. These bacteria were psychrotrophic, aerobic, and gram negative with polar flagella. The G + C contents of the DNAs of these strains were 41 to 42 mol%. The Antarctic strains were phenotypically distinct from the previously described Pseudoalteromonas type species. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed that the new strains were closely related to each other but clearly different from Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis and Pseudoalteromonas atlantica, which were the most phenotypically similar organisms. None of the bacterial isolates was capable of using DL-malate, D-sorbitol, or m-hydroxybenzoate, and all were capable of gelatin hydrolysis. Strains NF2, NF3T (T = type strain), NF13, NF14, and EN10 had an Na+ requirement but required only 17 mM Na+. Phenotypic, DNA G + C content, DNA-DNA hybridization, 16S rRNA analysis, fatty acid composition, and protein profile data confirmed the identification of the Antarctic strains as members of a Pseudoalteromonas sp. The name Pseudoalteromonas antarctica sp. nov. is proposed for these organisms.
