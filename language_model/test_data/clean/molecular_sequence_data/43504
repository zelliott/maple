The complete sequence of a 36 196 bp DNA segment located on the right arm of chromosome XV of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been determined and analysed. The sequence includes the 5' coding region of the SNF2 gene, the CPA1 leader peptide sequence and 17 open reading frames (ORFs) of at least 100 amino acids. Two of these correspond to previously known genes (CPA1, SLY41), whereas 15 correspond to new genes. The putative translation products of three ORFs show significant similarity with known proteins: one is a putative transport ATPase, another appears to be a ribosomal protein, and the third is an Snf2p homologue.
