Amplification of RNA probes by Q beta replicase can be used to detect a wide range of analytes with a potential sensitivity of a single molecule. A system has been developed in which Q beta amplification of midivariant-(MDV)-based RNA is measured in real time by fluorescence. This was accomplished by including a fluorescent intercalating dye, propidium iodide, in the reactions and monitoring the fluorescence change using a custom fluorometer. The time at which fluorescence is detectable above background is referred to as the "response time" and is calculated using curve-fitting algorithms. A response time is inversely and linearly proportional to the logarithm of the number of template RNA molecules which initiated the reaction. Therefore, this system permits an unknown amount of input RNA probe to be quantified through 11 orders of magnitude when compared to a standard curve. Under the described conditions with MDV RNA, the response time occurs when about 3 x 10(11) RNA molecules are synthesized and occurs within the exponential phase of the reaction, before the number of active enzyme molecules are saturated with RNA templates. This system has been used to determine the replication properties of MDV RNA reporter molecules bearing specific probe sequences and to develop hybridization assays for the clinical diagnostic field.
