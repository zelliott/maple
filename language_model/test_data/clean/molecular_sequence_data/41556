Pollen dispersal is a key biological process enabling plant populations to maintain genetic connectivity. Direct estimates of pollen dispersal using paternity assignment or correlated paternity estimates require highly variable genetic markers, of which microsatellites are the markers of choice. •

Eight species-specific microsatellites have been developed for Ranunculus bulbosus, combining classical enrichment methods with 454 sequencing. These markers have been used in paternity analysis as well as in pollen-pool analyses and proven to be highly polymorphic (seven to 63 alleles in the largest population studied). An excess of homozygotes in six loci indicate the presence of null alleles. •

These markers are the first microsatellites isolated and tested on R. bulbosus and provide a useful tool for population genetic studies in this common grassland herb.
