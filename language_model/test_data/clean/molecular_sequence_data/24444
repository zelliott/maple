Early endosome autoantigen localization to early endosomes is mediated by a C-terminal region, which includes a calmodulin binding motif, a Rab5 interaction site, and a FYVE domain that selectively binds phosphatidyl inositol 3-phosphate. The crystal structure of the C-terminal region bound to inositol 1,3-bisphosphate reveals an organized, quaternary assembly consisting of a parallel coiled coil and a dyad-symmetric FYVE domain homodimer. Structural and biochemical observations support a multivalent mechanism for endosomal localization in which domain organization, dimerization, and quaternary structure amplify the weak affinity and modest specificity of head group interactions with conserved residues. A unique mode of membrane engagement deduced from the quaternary structure of the C-terminal region provides insight into the structural basis of endosome tethering.
