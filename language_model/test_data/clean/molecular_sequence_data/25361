The "bg" series of MHC mutations is the most prevalent type of mutations of Kb in C57BL/6 mice screened by reciprocal tail skin grafting. The basis for identification of this series of mutations is the incompatibility of grafts between the parental B6 and the mutant. This series takes the longest to reciprocally reject the skin grafts. The series can be subdivided into "bg 1" and "bg 2" groups based on Kb-restricted recognition of virus-infected mutant target cells. The biochemical basis for these mutations are amino acid substitutions at residues 116 and 121 of the Kb transplantation antigen. These substitutions do not alter monoclonal antibody binding sites. The structural basis of MAb binding and the genetic basis of the mutation are discussed.
