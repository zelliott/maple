Currently available techniques used to recognize point mutations in genetic disease are time consuming and are capable of screening only small pieces of DNA. Moreover, they detect all sequence differences including phenotypically silent changes. Consequently, they are not convenient to analyse mutations in large, multi-exonic genes, where a large fraction of pathological point mutations arises from early termination, as is the case for the one third non-deletion/duplication cases of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. We have developed a rapid and sensitive method, the Protein Truncation Test (PTT). PTT is based on a combination of RT-PCR, transcription and translation and selectively detects translation-terminating mutations. We demonstrate its effectiveness to detect point mutations in DMD-patients and carrier females. PTT should be widely applicable diagnostically in any disease where early terminations contribute substantially to the disease cause.
