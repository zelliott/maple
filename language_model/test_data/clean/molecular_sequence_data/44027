Fourteen analogue DNA sequences containing the trp operator sequence and a single diastereomeric methylphosphonate linkage are each prepared from the stereochemically pure nucleoside methylphosphonate dimer building block, prepared as a phosphoramidite. The analogue sequences are shown to be single diastereomers on the basis of HPLC analysis of the digestion mixture; in each case, only a single diastereomeric dimer is present. These analogue sequences can be used effectively to probe for interactions to either of the prochiral phosphate oxygens as illustrated by their use to identify critical interactions in the trp repressor-operator complex. In a number of cases, the pairs of diastereomeric analogue sequences exhibit variable binding affinities that can be used to identify one of the prochiral phosphate oxygens as a critical site for complex-stabilizing interactions. Upon the basis of dissociation constants, apparent incremental binding energies are assigned to specific interactions. In all but one example, these identified sites for interactions to the phosphate backbone can be correlated with contacts implicated by the crystal structure analysis of the trp repressor-operator complex.
