Tetranectin is a plasminogen-binding tetrameric protein originally isolated from plasma. Expression of tetranectin appears ubiquitous, although particularly high expression is noted in the stroma of malignant tumors and during mineralization. To dissect the molecular basis of tetranectin gene regulation, mouse tetranectin cDNA was cloned from a 16-day-old mouse embryo library. Sequence analysis revealed a 992-bp cDNA with an open reading frame of 606 bp, which is identical in length to the human tetranectin cDNA. The deduced amino acid sequence showed high homology to the human cDNA with 76% identity and 87% similarity at the amino acid level. Sequence comparisons between mouse and human tetranectin and some C-type lectins confirmed a complete conservation in the position of six cysteines as well as numerous other amino acid residues, indicating an essential structure for potential function(s) of tetranectin. The sequence analysis revealed a difference in both sequence and size of the noncoding regions between mouse and human cDNAs. Northern analysis of the various tissues from mouse, rat, and cow showed the major transcript(s) to be approximately 1 kb, which is similar in size to that observed in human. Although additional minor bands of 1.5 and 3.3 kb were found in Northern blots, RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) analysis failed to provide evidence that these minor bands are products of the tetranectin gene. Finally, the genetic map location for this gene, Tna, was determined to be on distal mouse Chromosome (Chr) 9 by analysis of two sets of multilocus crosses.
