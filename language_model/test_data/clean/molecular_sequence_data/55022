The strain Achromobacter sp. JA81, which produced enoate reductase, was applied in the asymmetric reduction of activated alkenes. The strain could catalyze the bioreduction of alkenes to form enantiopure (R)-β-aryl-β-cyano-propanoic acids, a precursor of (R)-γ-amino butyric acids, including the pharmaceutically active enantiomer of the chiral drug (R)-baclofen with excellent enantioselectivity. It could catalyze as well the stereoselective bioreduction of other activated alkenes such as cyclic imides, β-nitro acrylates, and nitro-alkenes with up to >99 % ee and >99 % conversion. The draft genome sequencing of JA81 revealed six putative old yellow enzyme homologies, and the transcription of one of them, Achr-OYE3, was detected using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The recombinant Escherichia coli expressing Achr-OYE3 displayed enoate reductase activity toward (Z)-3-cyano-3-phenyl-propenoic acid (2a).
