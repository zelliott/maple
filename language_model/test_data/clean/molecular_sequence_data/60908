Fruit fly species of the genus Drosophila show a remarkable variation in sperm length. Some of them produce gigantic sperm several times the total male body length. Sperm of Drosophila hydei, for example, are more than 20 mm long. Little is known about the advantage of such elongated sperm or about the proteins that stabilize their thin flagellar tails. Recently, two members of a novel gene family Dhmst101(1) and Dhmst101(2), whose gene products are associated with the sperm tail, were isolated and characterized. Here a third member of this gene family, Dhmst101(3), is described. It was previously demonstrated that all three genes are located in a single small cluster on chromosome 5 of D. hydei. They are located within 15 kb of genomic DNA, oriented in the same direction and transcribed testis-specifically. The encoded sperm tail-specific proteins are mainly composed of tandemly arranged repeats of a highly charged, cysteine-containing motif of 16 amino acids with the consensus sequence KKKCA/EEAAKKEKEAAE. Experiments with synthetic repeat monomers and dimers have demonstrated a tendency for alpha-helical rod formation, which increased strongly with an increase in repeat number. Therefore, Dhmst101 proteins with 7-60 repeats with regularly spaced cystein-residues are thus expected to form long alpha-helical rods cross-linked by numerous Cys-Cys bridges. Here we apply immunoelectron microscopy and monospecific antibodies, alpha-mst101, raised against the KKKCAEAAKKEKEAAE-motif to investigate the distribution of Dhmst101 proteins within the sperm tail of D. hydei. We show that Dhmst101 proteins are part of the outer sheath of the sperm tail where they presumably help to provide a tight but elastic envelope for the extremely extended spermatozoa of D. hydei.
