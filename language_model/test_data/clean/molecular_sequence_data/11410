T cell subsets that produce minor lymphocyte stimulatory (Mls) antigens were analyzed using mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) in vitro or clonal elimination assay in vivo. When lymph node T cells from B10.BR(Mls-1b) mice were stimulated with various T cell subsets from AKR (Mls-1a) mice in the presence of B10.BR antigen presenting cells (APC), proportions of Mls-1a reactive T cell blasts (V beta 6+, V beta 8.1+) increased. The stimulatory potency of CD8+ T cells was higher than that of CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, among either CD8+ or CD4+ T cell subset, CD44+ T cells appeared to produce larger amounts of Mls-1a antigens than CD44- T cells. More marked difference was demonstrated, when stimulator AKR T cells were being activated by immobilized anti-T cell antigen receptor (TCR) antibody during MLR. Thus, AKR T cells appeared to produce large amounts of Mls-1a antigens on appropriate stimulations. These findings were confirmed by the semiquantitative analysis of mRNA levels of MTV-7 in the AKR T cell subsets. When CD8+CD44+ T cells from (AKR x B10.BR)F1 mice were injected intravenously into [B10.BR-->B10.BR] syngeneic bone marrow (BM) chimeras 1 week after BM reconstitution and proportions of V beta 6+ T cells were quantitated 7 weeks later, significant clonal elimination of V beta 6+ T cells was induced among both thymocyte population and lymph node T cell population in a dose-dependent manner of the inoculated F1 T cells. Inoculation of CD8+CD44-F1 T cells eliminated V beta 6+ T cells less efficiently from lymph node T cells and inoculation of CD4+F1 T cells induced no significant clonal elimination of the V beta 6+ T cells. The present findings demonstrate clearly that CD8+CD44+ T cells represent the cells producing large amounts of Mls-1a antigens and inducing clonal elimination of V beta 6+ T cells in vivo.
