We describe herein the identification of HLA-F*010102 by cloning the full-length coding sequence with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This new allele was found in two Han Chinese individuals in the course of cloning major histocompatibility complex class Ib (MHC Ib) cDNA. It was identical to HLA-F*010101 except for a single-nucleotide substitution in codon -1 (GCG --> GCA). This nucleotide change represents a synonymous mutation, as both triplets code for an alanine. The cDNA of this allele was 48 bp shorter than HLA-F*010101 due to splicing out exon 7. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that the product of this new allele had the identical extracellular domain and transmembrane region but had a shorter cytoplasmic tail.
