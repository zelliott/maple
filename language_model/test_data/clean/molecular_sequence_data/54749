We cloned the genes encoding the two distinct extracellular halotolerant proteases of Bacillus subtilis FP-133 Expro-I and Expro-II, which were classified as alkaline serine and neutral proteases respectively. Three-dimensional modeling suggested that acidic and polar amino acid residues located on the surface stabilize protein structure in the presence of relatively high NaCl concentrations.
