Structures of the N-linked oligosaccharide attached to the heavy chain of a heterologous murine IgG2a produced from Trichoplusia ni (TN-5B1-4, High Five) insect cells were characterized. Coexpression of the chaperone immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP) in the baculovirus-infected insect cells increased the soluble intracellular and secreted IgG level. This facilitated the detailed analysis of N-glycans from both intracellular and secreted IgG. Following purification of the immunoglobulins using Protein A-Sepharose, glycopeptides, prepared by trypsin-chymotrypsin digestion, were further digested with glycoamidase from sweet almond emulsin to obtain the oligosaccharide moieties. The resulting oligosaccharides were then reductively aminated with 2-aminopyridine and the structures identified by two-dimensional high performance liquid chromatography mapping (Tomiya, N., Awaya, J., Kurono, M., Endo, S., Arata, Y., and Takahashi, N. (1988) Anal. Biochem. 171, 73-90). The N-glycans obtained from the secreted IgG contain 35% complex type, some with terminal galactose residues at either alpha1, 3-Man or alpha1,6-Man branches of the Man3GlcNAc2 core. The remaining oligosaccharides detected in the secreted IgG were principally hybrid (30%) and paucimannosidic (35%) type N-glycans. Most (84%) of these secreted glycoforms contained fucose alpha1, 6-linked to the innermost GlcNAc residue and the presence of a potentially allergenic fucose alpha1,3-linked to the innermost GlcNAc residue was also detected. In contrast, the intracellular immunoglobulins included 50% high mannose-type N-glycans with lower levels of complex, hybrid, and paucimannosidic-type structures. Reverse phase one-dimensional high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the IgG N-glycans in the absence of heterologous BiP exhibited a similar distribution of intracellular and secreted glycoforms. These studies indicate that Trichoplusia ni TN-5B1-4 cells are capable of terminal galactosylation. However, the processing pathways in these cell lines appear to diverge from mammalian cells in the formation of paucimannosidic structures, in the presence of alpha1,3-fucose linkages, and in the absence of sialylation.
