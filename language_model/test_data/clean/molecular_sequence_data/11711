Determination of the primary structures of six kinds of vertebrate visual pigments enabled us to classify them into four groups of cone-type pigments. The phylogenetic tree demonstrated that an ancestor of vertebrate visual pigments evolved into four kinds of cone-type pigments, from one of which rhodopsins diverged. Tetrachromatic color vision of chicken is discussed on the basis of both the absorption spectra of purified cone pigments and the filtering effect of colored oil-droplets.
