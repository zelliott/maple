We have reported that a novel c-Myc binding protein, AMY-1, stimulated the transcription activity of c-Myc and was translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in a c-Myc-dependent manner. AMY-1 works as an inducer of human K562 cell differentiation upon induction of AraC. To characterize the expression or functional importance of AMY-1, the genomic DNA of mouse AMY-1 was cloned and characterized. Both mouse and human genomic DNAs, the latter of which was retrieved from a human DNA database, comprise five exons spanning about 11 kb. To characterize the promoter of the mouse AMY-1 gene, a series of deletion constructs of the region upstream of the first ATG was linked to the luciferase gene, and their luciferase activities were measured in human HeLa and K562 cells. The results showed that Sp1 was essential for AMY-1 expression in both cell lines and that GATA-1 is also necessary in K562 cells. Sp1 in both cell lines and GATA-1 only in K562 cells were identified as proteins binding to these sites by a mobility shift assay. Furthermore, it was found that GATA-1 stimulated AMY-1 expression synergistically with Sp1 in ectopically expressed insect cells and that both proteins were associated in K562 cells.
