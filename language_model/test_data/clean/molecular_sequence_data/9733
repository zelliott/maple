von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a multimeric plasma protein that mediates platelet adhesion to exposed subendothelium at sites of vascular injury. The A3 domain of vWF (vWF-A3) forms the principal binding site for collagens type I and III. We report here the crystal structure of the vWF-A3 domain at 2.2-A resolution. As expected, the structure is similar to the integrin I domain but with several novel features. Sequence alignments had suggested that the domain contained an integrin metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif, but the crystal structure shows that the motif is modified and that no metal ion is bound. We have introduced mutations into the vestigial MIDAS motif and report that, unlike the I domain of integrin alpha2beta1, vWF-A3 continues to bind collagen after disruption of the motif. We conclude that collagen recognition by vWF-A3 occurs by a mechanism different from that of the integrin alpha2beta1.
