A novel fluorescent probe, 3-(acetylamino)-6-aminoacridine (AA-Ac), has been synthesized and its applicability to the analysis of picomole levels of N-linked glycans investigated. AA-Ac was found to be an excellent derivatization reagent for N-linked glycans, giving at least twice the intensity of fluorescence as its predecessor 2-aminoacridone. AA-Ac-labeled glycans were analyzed by both normal and reversed-phase HPLC. They were also amenable to enzymatic sequencing and analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, free zone capillary electrophoresis, and capillary electrophoresis/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.
