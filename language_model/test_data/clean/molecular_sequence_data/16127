We have identified two distinctive regions of the repetitive unit nucleotide sequence of fibroin mRNA of Bombyx mori. The codon usage for the major amino acids, glycine, alanine and serine is distinctly different in these two regions, indicating that it is determined by the fibroin mRNA or gene structure but not by the tRNA population. Comparative computer analyses of nucleotide substitutions in the unit sequence suggest that selection has operated on the codon usage to optimize the secondary structure characteristic of the fibroin mRNA.
