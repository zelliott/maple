RecJ, a 5' to 3' exonuclease specific for single-stranded DNA, functions in DNA repair and recombination systems. We determined the crystal structure of RecJ bound to Mn(2+) ion essential for its activity. RecJ has a novel fold in which two domains are interconnected by a long helix, forming a central groove. Mn(2+) is located on the wall of the groove and is coordinated by conserved residues characteristic of a family of phosphoesterases that includes RecJ proteins. The groove is composed of residues conserved among RecJ proteins and is positively charged. These findings and the narrow width of the groove indicate that the groove binds single- instead of double-stranded DNA.
