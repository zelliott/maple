Pneumococcal surface adhesin A (PsaA), a common protein expressed on all 90 pneumococcal serotypes, is a vaccine candidate. Three anti-PsaA monoclonal antibody phage display-expressed monopeptides (15 mers), in various formulations as lipidated or nonlipidated multiantigenic peptides or as bi- or tripeptide constructs, were studied in a mouse nasopharyngeal carriage model to determine the inhibitory effect of induced antibodies on carriage of pneumococcal serotypes 2, 4, and 6B. Antibodies to each of the various peptides tested reduced carriage of the 3 serotypes. Reduction in carriage by nonlipidated multiantigenic peptide antibodies was highly variable (39%-94%; mean, 59%; standard deviation [SD], 20.2%); however, more-consistent results were observed in mice immunized with lipidated (56%-98%; mean, 69%; SD, 13.6%) and combination or bipeptide (55%-91%; mean, 76%; SD, 13.1%) formulations. These peptides are immunogenic, and their induced antibodies reduce carriage in mice. PsaA peptides demonstrate potential for being important new vaccines against pneumococcal carriage, otitis media, and invasive pneumococcal disease.
