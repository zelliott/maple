Clones of the beta 1-subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) from human skeletal muscle and hippocampus cDNA libraries, and from human genomic libraries, were isolated using a human skeletal muscle beta 1 cDNA probe generated by polymerase chain reaction. The skeletal muscle beta 1 cDNA (beta 1M) encodes a protein of 523 amino acids that is 97% identical to the rabbit skeletal muscle beta-subunit. Two different cDNAs, beta 1B1 and beta 1B2, were obtained from the human hippocampus library. The beta 1B1 transcript encodes a protein of 478 amino acids that is identical to the skeletal muscle beta-subunit (beta 1M), except for an internal region of 52 amino acids. The beta 1B2 transcript encodes a protein of 596 amino acids. The beta 1B2 polypeptide is identical to the beta 1B1 polypeptide at amino acids 1-444; however, it has a unique 152 amino acid carboxyl terminus. Like beta 1B1, it differs from beta 1M at the internal 52 amino acids. Analysis of the beta 1 gene structure demonstrates that these three cDNAs represent transcripts encoded by a single beta 1 gene. Transcripts from the beta 1 gene were detected in RNA from skeletal muscle, heart, spleen, and brain, but not in RNA from liver, stomach, or kidney.
