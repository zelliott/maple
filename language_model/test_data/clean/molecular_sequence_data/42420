Oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to the alpha-sarcin domain of rat 28S rRNA inhibit cell-free protein synthesis. The poly(U) translation system containing Artemia salina ribosomes was more sensitive to inhibition than the system containing rat liver ribosomes. The 21-mer, which was the most effective of the 7 oligonucleotides tested, hybridized with naked 28S rRNA. Hybridization with whole ribosomes, assayed by S1 nuclease protection, occurred only at high ionic strength or with ribosomes actively engaged in protein synthesis.
