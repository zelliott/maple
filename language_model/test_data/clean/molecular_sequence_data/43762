Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is a rare bleeding disorder resulting from mutations in either glycoprotein (GP) IIb or GPIIIa genes. The disease is relatively frequent in highly inbred populations such as Iraqi Jews. The molecular basis of GT in 6 unrelated Iraqi-Jewish patients was previously identified as an 11-bp deletion in exon 12 of the GPIIIa gene. We now describe a second mutation found in 3 unrelated Iraqi-Jewish families that consists of an 11.2-kb deletion between an Alu repeat in intron 9 and exon 13 of the GPIIIa gene. The mutant DNA is transcribed into mRNA in which exons 10 through 13 are absent. Splicing of exon 9 directly to exon 14 leads to a shift in the reading frame resulting in a stop codon. The predicted protein is truncated in the middle of the third cysteine-rich domain before the transmembrane domain. Simple DNA-based methods were devised for identification of both mutations in Iraqi Jews for the purpose of carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis enabling prevention of GT. A survey of the general Iraqi-Jewish population for the first 11-bp deletion and the second 11.2-kb deletion disclosed that the allele frequency of the first mutation was 0.0043, whereas none of 700 individuals examined bore the second mutation (allele frequency <0.0007). Among 40 GT patients of Iraqi-Jewish origin 31 were homozygous for the first mutation, 4 were compound heterozygotes for the first and second mutations, and 2 were homozygous for the second mutation. Haplotype analyses using 4 polymorphic markers in the GPIIIa gene showed that each mutation originated in a distinct founder.
