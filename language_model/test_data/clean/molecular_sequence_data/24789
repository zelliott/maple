Inulin, the polydisperse reserve polysaccharide from chicory, has been modified by carbamoylation in organic solvents. The reaction of inulin with a range of alkyl isocyanates resulted, after crystalization, in a variety of carbamoylated inulins from which the interfacial properties were determined. The medium and long chain carbamoylated inulins showed a good to very good reduction of the interfacial tension which makes these biopolymers interesting in the field of biodegradable surface active agents.
