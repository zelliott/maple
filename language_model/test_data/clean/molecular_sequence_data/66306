As part of continuing studies of the venom components present in Conus austini (syn.: Conus cancellatus), a vermivorous cone snail collected in the western Gulf of Mexico, Mexico, two major peptides, as14a and as14b, were purified and characterized. Their amino acid sequences were determined by automatic Edman sequencing after reduction and alkylation. Their molecular masses, established by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, confirmed the chemical analyses and indicated that as14a and as14b have free C-termini. Each peptide contains 4-Cys residues arranged in a pattern (C-C-C-C, framework 14). The primary structure of as14a is GGVGRCIYNCMNSGGGLNFIQCKTMCY (experimental monoisotopic mass 2883.92Da; calculated monoisotopic mass 2884.20Da), whereas that of as14b is RWDVDQCIYYCLNGVVGYSYTECQTMCT (experimental monoisotopic mass 3308.63Da; calculated monoisotopic mass 3308.34Da). Both purified peptides elicited scratching and grooming activity in mice, and as14b also caused body and rear limb extension and tail curling immediately upon injection. The high sequence similarity of peptide as14a with peptide vil14a from the vermivorous C. villepinii suggests that the former might block K+ channels.
