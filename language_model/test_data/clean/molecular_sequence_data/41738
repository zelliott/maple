The uridine diphosphate-glucose (UDP-Glc) binding domain of sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS) was identified by overexpressing part of the gene from spinach (Spinacia oleracea). Degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to two tryptic peptides common to both the full-length 120-kD SPS subunit and an 82-kD form that photoaffinity labeled with 5-azidouridine diphosphate-glucose (5-N3UDP-Glc) were used in a polymerase chain reaction to isolate a partial cDNA clone. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of spinach SPS with the sequences of potato sucrose synthase showed that the partial cDNA included one region that was highly conserved between the proteins. Expression of the partial cDNA clone of SPS in Escherichia coli produced a 26-kD fusion protein that photoaffinity labeled with 5-N3UDP-Glc. Photoaffinity labeling of the 26-kD fusion protein was specific, indicating that this portion of the SPS protein harbors the UDP-Glc-binding domain. Isolation of a modified peptide from the photolabeled protein provided tentative identification of amino acid residues that make up the uridine-binding domain of SPS.
