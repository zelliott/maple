SnR, twist and Fgf10 are expressed in presumptive limb territories of early chick embryos. When FGF-2/FGF-8 beads are implanted in chick flank, an ectopic limb develops and SnR is irreversibly activated as early as 1 h. Ectopic Fgf10 and twist expression are activated much later at 17 and 20 h, respectively. FGF-10 can also induce SnR, but much later, and in this case activation occurs simultaneously with that of twist and Fgf10 via the Fgf8- expressing ridge. Tbx-4 and Tbx-5 are expressed in leg and wing forming regions, respectively, in a similar pattern to SnR and twist. FGF-2 leads to ectopic expression of Tbx-4 and Tbx-5 as rapidly as ectopic expression of SnR, but the patterns of ectopic transcripts suggest that induction of SnR and Tbx gene expression occur via different pathways.
