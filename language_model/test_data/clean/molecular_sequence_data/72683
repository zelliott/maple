The junctions of the Streptomyces lividans chromosomal terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) were isolated from cosmid clones as 6.2 kb PstI and 2.9 kb BamHI fragments, respectively. The fragments were completely sequenced. In each of the fragments just one open reading frame could be identified. One putative gene product showed significant similarities to a sensor and the other to a transcriptional regulator protein of prokaryotic two-component signalling systems. Next to one TIR numerous long direct repeats were found within a region of about 400 bp.
