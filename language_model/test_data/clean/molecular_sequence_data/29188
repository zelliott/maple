We have isolated a tiger frog virus (TFV) from diseased tiger frogs, Rana tigrina rugulosa. The genome was a linear double-stranded DNA of 105,057 basepairs in length with a base composition of 55.01% G+C. About 105 open reading frames were identified with coding capacities for polypeptides ranging from 40 to 1294 amino acids. Computer-assisted analyses of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that 39 of 105 putative gene products showed significant homology to functionally characterized proteins of other species in the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ databases. These proteins included enzymes and structural proteins involved in virus replication, transcription, modification, and virus--host interaction. The deduced amino acid sequences of TFV gene products showed more than 90% identity to FV3, but a low degree of similarity among TFV, ISKNV, and LCDV-1. The results from this study indicated that TFV may belong to the genus Ranavirus of the family Iridoviridae.
