We identified two different groups of piggyBac-like elements (PLE) in the tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens, and named them HvPLE1 and HvPLE2. An intact copy of HvPLE1 revealed the characteristics of PLE: inverted terminal repeats, inverted subterminal repeats, and an open reading frame encoding transposase, whereas other HvPLE1 copies and all the HvPLE2 copies carried disruptive mutations in the region encoding transposase. We also identified none to two bands per genome hybridized to a probe of Trichoplusia ni piggyBac in genomic Southern blotting, which are different from HvPLE1 or HvPLE2. Analysis of the sequences of multiple copies of HvPLE1 and HvPLE2 suggests that the PLEs are closely related to the T. ni piggyBac, of relatively young age, and independently entered the H. virescens genome.
