The commercially important Sardinella species (family Clupeidae or herrings) usually thrive in marine environments. An exception is Sardinella tawilis of Taal Lake, Batangas, Philippines, the only known freshwater sardine. This species is believed to have immigrated from Balayan Bay to the lake when it was formed in the course of volcanic eruptions some 240 years ago. To determine the relationship of S. tawilis to the marine species S. albella, S. fimbriata, and S. longiceps from the Balayan Bay we sequenced 358 bp of the cytochrome b gene and the mitochondrial control region. The cytochrome b gene was highly conserved and contained little phylogenetic information. The control region sequences, however, demonstrated two highly diversified main haplotypes grouping S. tawilis with S. albella, as shown by maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining analysis. The haplotypes are characterized by the presence of an 81 bp indel and up to eight 35 bp tandem repeat elements. The repeat copy number varied within individuals of S. tawilis and S. albella, thus showing heteroplasmy in these two species only. The analysis of two subpopulations of S. tawilis revealed restricted substitutions that may indicate the beginning of genetic differentiation of the two subpopulations.
