Angiotensin II (Ang II) is an octapeptide generated by the sequential proteolytic action of renin and angiotensin converting enzyme on the glycoprotein angiotensinogen. While numerous mammalian tissues have been shown to express some or all of the components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), the function of most of these tissue RAS remains a matter of conjecture. To test for tissue-specific functions of Ang II and as an alternative to co-expressing all the components of RAS, we have engineered a fusion protein that leads to direct Ang II release within specific tissues. The angiotensin peptide is cleaved from the fusion protein within the secretory pathway by the ubiquitous endoprotease furin and is released from the cell by constitutive secretion. Direct injection of an expression vector encoding such a fusion protein into rat cardiac ventricles results in a highly localized expression of atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA (an angiotensin responsive marker of cardiac hypertrophy), demonstrating the utility of this approach for local targeting of mature peptides to tissues in animal models.
