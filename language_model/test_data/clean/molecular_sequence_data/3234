A barrier to heterologous production of complex polyketides in Escherichia coli is the lack of (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA, a common extender substrate for the biosynthesis of complex polyketides by modular polyketide synthases. One biosynthetic route to (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA involves the sequential actions of two enzymes, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase, which convert succinyl-CoA to (2R)- and then to (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA. As reported [McKie, N., et al. (1990) Biochem. J. 269, 293-298; Haller, T., et al. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 4622-4629], when genes encoding coenzyme B(12)-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutases were expressed in E. coli, the inactive apo-enzyme was produced. However, when cells harboring the mutase genes from Propionibacterium shermanii or E. coli were treated with the B12 precursor hydroxocobalamin, active holo-enzyme was isolated, and (2R)-methylmalonyl-CoA represented approximately 10% of the intracellular CoA pool. When the E. coli BAP1 cell line [Pfeifer, B. A., et al. (2001) Science 291, 1790-1792] harboring plasmids that expressed P. shermanii methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, Streptomyces coelicolor methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase, and the polyketide synthase DEBS (6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase) was fed propionate and hydroxocobalamin, the polyketide 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6-dEB) was produced. Isotopic labeling studies using [(13)C]propionate showed that the starter unit for polyketide synthesis was derived exclusively from exogenous propionate, while the extender units stemmed from methylmalonyl-CoA via the mutase-epimerase pathway. Thus, the introduction of an engineered mutase-epimerase pathway in E. coli enabled the uncoupling of carbon sources used to produce starter and extender units of polyketides.
