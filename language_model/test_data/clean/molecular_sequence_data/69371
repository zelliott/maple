The antigenic relationships of the VP4 serotype of porcine rotavirus Gottfried strain with other rotaviruses were determined by using antiserum to Gottfried VP4-baculovirus recombinant. This antiserum failed to react significantly with virus of serotypes P1A, P1B, P3, and OSU; however, it reacted with P2 strains. In the reciprocal assay, antiserum to VP4 of an asymptomatic strain (P2) failed to neutralize the Gottfried strain virus to a significant level. It thus appears that the Gottfried strain should be considered a subtype of P2.
