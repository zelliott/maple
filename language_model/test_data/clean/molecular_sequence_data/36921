The published DNA sequence that includes the gene for the envelope glycoprotein gp67 of the baculovirus Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus also contains a segment that shows 32% amino acid identity to papain, a cysteine endopeptidase from the papaya plant (Carica papaya). The viral papain-like sequence is apparently affected by a frame-shift mutation, but otherwise appears capable of encoding a functional enzyme. Catalytically essential amino acids appear to be conserved, as do disulphide bridges. The overall structure of the putative protein is similar to that of papain, as judged by hydropathy profile. Secondary structure prediction using a consensus of seven methods indicates that the putative viral enzyme retains the alpha/beta domain structure of papain, including the long helix beginning with cysteine-25. Infecting SF9 cells with the virus did not lead to a detected increase in cysteine endopeptidase activity, and a cysteine endopeptidase inactivator appeared to have no effect on infectivity. Irrespective of whether the sequence encodes a functionally active cysteine endopeptidase, this is the first example of a papain-related sequence in a viral genome.
