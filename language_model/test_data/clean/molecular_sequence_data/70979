The complement protein C4, encoded by two genes (C4A and C4B) on chromosome 6p, is the most polymorphic among the MHC III gene products. We investigated the molecular basis of C4 deficiency in a Finnish woman with systemic lupus erythematosus. C4-specific mRNA was present at low concentrations in C4-deficient (C4D) patient fibroblasts, but no pro-C4 protein was detected. This defect in C4 expression was specific in that synthesis of two other complement proteins was normal. Analysis of genomic DNA showed that the proposita had both deleted and nonexpressed C4 genes. Each of her nonexpressed genes, a C4A null gene inherited from the mother, a C4A null gene, and a C4B null gene inherited from the father, all contained an identical 2-bp insertion (TC) after nucleotide 5880 in exon 29, providing the first confirmatory proof of the C4B pseudogene. This mutation has been previously found only in C4A null genes. Although the exon 29/30 junction is spliced accurately, this frameshift mutation generates a premature stop at codon 3 in exon 30. These truncated C4A and C4B gene products were confirmed through RT-PCR and sequence analysis. Among the possible genetic mechanisms that produce identical mutations is both genes, the most likely is a mutation in C4A followed by a gene conversion to generate the mutated C4B allele.
