Most members of the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) superfamily hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP) quite slowly unless stimulated by a GTPase activating protein or GAP. The alpha subunits (G alpha) of the heterotrimeric G proteins hydrolyze GTP much more rapidly and contain an approximately 120-residue insert not found in other GTPases. Interactions between a G alpha insert domain and a G alpha GTP-binding core domain, both expressed as recombinant proteins, show that the insert acts biochemically as a GAP. The results suggest a general mechanism for GAP-dependent hydrolysis of GTP by other GTPases.
