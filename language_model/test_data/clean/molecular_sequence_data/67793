Sequence-independent amplification of clinical specimens can lead to the identification of novel pathogens.

To identify novel viruses in human stool specimens from patients with diarrhea and to investigate the ecology and clinical significance of such viruses.

Nucleic acid extracted from stool specimens from patients with diarrhea with no known etiology were subjected to random PCR amplification and Roche/454 pyrosequencing. Novel viruses identified were genetically and epidemiologically characterized.

Four gyroviruses, chicken anemia virus (CAV), human gyrovirus (HGV)/avian gyrovirus 2 (AGV2), gyrovirus 3 (GyV3) and a novel gyrovirus (tentatively designated as gyrovirus 4 (GyV4)) were identified in human stool specimens. GyV4, as well as CAV and AGV2/HGV were also detected in chicken skin and meat used for human consumption.

A novel gyrovirus (GyV4) was identified in human stool and in chicken meat sold for human consumption. This virus was phylogenetically distinct from previously reported gyroviruses in chicken and humans (chicken anemia virus, human gyrovirus, avian gyrovirus 2 and recently reported gyrovirus 3). The epidemiology and pathogenesis of this virus in humans and in chicken needs to be further investigated.
