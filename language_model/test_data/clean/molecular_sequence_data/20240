The FKBPs (FK506-binding proteins) belong to a ubiquitous family of proteins that are found in a wide range of taxonomic groups. These proteins participate in a variety of pathways, including protein folding, down-regulation of T-cell activation and inhibition of cell-cycle progression.

A cDNA encoding the 12 kDa FKBP gene orthologue (FKBP12) in Bombyx mori was been isolated from both Bm-5 cultured cells and silk-gland tissue. Using the FKBP12 cDNA in combination with the B. mori 6x whole-genome shotgun database, we were able to identify the FKBP12 gene, as well as the positions of its intron-exon junctions.

FKBP12 exon sizes and intronic positions are highly conserved among FKBP12 orthologues in 24 diverse genomes. Comparison of 41 FKBP12 genes revealed several intronic insertion and deletion events throughout evolution. In addition, paralogous FKBP12 isoforms were identified in all 12 vertebrate genomes. Both structural and phylogenetics analyses suggest that the isoforms may be evolving independently, possibly due to the distinct functional roles played by each paralogue.
