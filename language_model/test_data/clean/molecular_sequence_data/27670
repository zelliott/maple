We report the presence of a 402 bp group I intron in the chloroplast small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene of Chlamydomonas moewusii. The intron in inserted within the highly conserved '530 loop', at a site corresponding to positions 531-532 of the E. coli 16rRNA. Residues surrounding the insertion site almost certainly play an important role in ribosomal proofreading function as they proved to be protected by tRNAs in E. coli 16S rRNA (Moazed and Noller 1986; Stern et al. 1986). The C. moewusii intron revealed a secondary structure model which differs substantially from those of the typical subgroup IA and IB introns. This model, however, shows striking similarities with the structures of the C. reinhardtii chloroplast 23S rRNA gene intron (Rochaix et al. 1985), the S. cerevisiae mitochondrial COB3 intron (Holl et al. 1985) and the three introns of phage T4 in the nrdB, td and sunY genes (Shub et al. 1988). The SSU rRNA gene intron is absent from C. eugametos, an alga that is interfertile with C. moewusii. The presence/absence of the intron account for a 390 bp restriction fragment length polymorphism between the two algal SSU rRNA genes, a polymorphic locus that is strictly co-inherited with a tightly linked streptomycin resistance mutation (sr-2) in interspecific hybrids between the two algae.
