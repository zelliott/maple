Chrysosporium undulatum sp. nov., showing intermediate characteristics between Chrysosporium and Malbranchea, is described and illustrated. This taxon is characterised by long and curved to loosely coiled hyphal appendages, deflected to wavy fertile hyphae forming dense tufts and small, subglobose, frequently intercalary, verrucose conidia. Restriction enzyme analysis and comparison of sequences of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 ribosomal DNA region of the most similar species strongly support this proposal.
