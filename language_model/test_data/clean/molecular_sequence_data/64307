A sample of mossy soil taken from the eastern lava flow of northern Candlemas Island, South Sandwich archipelago, yielded six isolates of aerobic, endospore-forming bacteria. Miniaturized routine phenotypic tests and other observations, amplified rDNA restriction analysis and SDS-PAGE analysis suggested that the strains represent a novel taxon. 16S rDNA sequence comparisons support the proposal of a novel species, Bacillus shackletonii sp. nov., the type strain of which is LMG 18435(T) (=CIP 107762(T)).
