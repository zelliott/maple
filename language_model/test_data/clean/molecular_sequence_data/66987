Naturally occurring nucleopeptidic replication primers (VPg-pUpU) of poliovirus and coxsackie virus were chemically synthesized. The synthesis was accomplished via block-coupling of two minimally protected fragments of the target structures: a short RNA-nucleopeptide and a longer peptide segment containing diverse side-chain functionalities. The synthetic VPg-pUpU of coxsackie virus was characterized by NMR spectroscopy.
