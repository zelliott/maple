Saccharomyces cerevisiae cellular RNase P is composed of both protein and RNA components that are essential for activity. The isolated holoenzyme contains a highly structured RNA of 369 nucleotides that has extensive sequence similarities to the 286-nucleotide RNA associated with Schizosaccharomyces pombe RNase P but bears little resemblance to the analogous RNA sequences in procaryotes or S. cerevisiae mitochondria. Even so, the predicted secondary structure of S. cerevisiae RNA is strikingly similar to the bacterial phylogenetic consensus rather than to previously predicted structures of other eucaryotic RNase P RNAs.
