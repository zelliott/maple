Botulinum neurotoxin type D and exoenzyme C3 have been separately purified from Clostridium botulinum strain D-1873 to apparent homogeneity. Both ADP-ribosylated a rat liver cytosolic protein of 24 kDa. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of C3 was determined and showed a low degree of homology with those of the light and heavy chains of neurotoxins of various types which have been reported previously. However, a polyclonal antibody raised against C3 cross-reacted with the light chains, but not with the heavy chains, of type C1 and D neurotoxins. Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody recognizing the light chains of type C1 and D neurotoxins interacted with C3. These results suggest that the light chain of type C1 or D neurotoxin and exoenzyme C3 share at least one epitope in common with each other.
