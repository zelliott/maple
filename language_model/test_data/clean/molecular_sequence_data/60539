Metallointercalator-peptide conjugates that provide small molecular mimics to explore peptide-nucleic acid recognition have been prepared. Specifically, a family of peptide conjugates of [Rh(phi)(2)(phen')](3+) [where phi = 9,10-phenanthrenequinone diimine and phen' = 5-(amidoglutaryl)-1,10-phenanthroline] has been synthesized and their DNA-binding characteristics examined. Single amino acid modifications were made from the parent metallointercalator-peptide conjugate [Rh(phi)(2)(phen')](3+)-AANVAIAAWERAA-CONH(2), which targets 5'-CCA-3' site-specifically. Moving the glutamate at position 10 in the sequence of the appended peptide to position 6 {[Rh(phi)(2)(phen')](3+)-AANVAEAAWARAA-CONH(2)} changed the sequence preference of the metallointercalator-peptide conjugate to 5'-ACA-3'. Subsequent mutation of the glutamate at position 6 to arginine {[Rh(phi)(2)(phen')](3+)-AANVARAAWARAA-CONH(2)} caused more complex changes in DNA recognition. Thermodynamic dissociation constants were determined for these metallointercalator-peptide conjugates by photoactivated DNA cleavage assays with the rhodium intercalators. At 55 degrees C in the presence of 5 mM MnCl(2), [Rh(phi)(2)(phen')](3+)-AANVAIAAWERAA-CONH(2) binds to a 5'-CCA-3' site with K(d) = 5.7 x 10(-)(8) M, whereas [Rh(phi)(2)(phen')](3+)-AANVAEAAWARAA-CONH(2) binds to its target 5'-ACA-3' site with K(d) = 9.9 x 10(-8) M. The dissociation constant for [Rh(phi)(2)(phen')](3+) with random-sequence DNA is 7.0 x 10(-7) M. Structural models have been developed and refined to account for the observed sequence specificities. As with much larger DNA-binding proteins, with these metal-peptide conjugate mimics, single amino acid changes can lead to single or multiple base changes in the DNA site targeted.
