Antibodies, with their high affinity and specificity, are widely utilized in the field of protein engineering, medicinal chemistry, and nanotechnology applications, and our recent studies have demonstrated the recognition and binding of antibody for the surface on inorganic material. In this study, we generated a high-affinity gold-binding antibody fragment by a combination of peptide-grafting and phage-display techniques and showed the availability of the material-binding fragment for one-pot functionalization of nanoparticles as interface molecules. After a gold-binding peptide sequence was grafted into one of the complementarity determining regions of a single variable domain of a heavy-chain camel antibody, a combinatorial library approach raised by 20 times the affinity of the peptide-grafted fragment. The high-affinity gold-binding fragment (E32) spontaneously adsorbed on gold nanoparticles, and consequently the nanoparticles formed a stable dispersion in a high-ionic-strength solution. Multivalent and bispecific antibodies constructed on the E32 platform by means of fusion technology functionalized gold nanoparticles in one pot, and these functionalized nanoparticles could be used to obtain surface plasmon resonance scattering images of cancer cells and to spontaneously link two different nanomaterials. Here, we propose the bispecific antibodies as convenient interface molecules in the nanosized world.
