It has been previously demonstrated that the ilvGMEDA operon is expressed in vivo from the promoters ilvGp2 and ilvEp. An additional internal promoter is identified and designated ilvAp. This internal promoter, which allows independent expression of ilvA, has been analyzed both in vivo and in vitro. Our results indicate that: (1) ilvAp exists in both Escherichia coli K-12 and Salmonella typhimurium, as demonstrated by fusion to the galK reporter gene; (2) ilvAp is located in the distal coding sequence of ilvD; (3) the ilvAp sequences are not identical for these two bacterial species; (4) transcription from ilvAp of E. coli K-12 was demonstrated; (5) expression from ilvAp responds to the availability of oxygen; (6) potential 3' 5'-cyclic AMP receptor protein binding sites exist adjacent to ilvAp.
