Ultrasonography is a non-invasive method for prenatal detection of diastrophic dysplasia (DTD) in the second trimester of pregnancy. As there is a need for genetic counselling as early as possible we wished to develop a method based on molecular analysis. Five fetuses in families with a previous history of DTD were studied by typing them and their relevant family members for DNA markers closely linked to the DTD gene. The DNA analyses predicted that three of the fetuses were unaffected and two affected. These results were concordant with those obtained by ultrasonography, and the phenotype of the fetus was correctly predicted in all cases. DNA analysis provides a reliable means of prenatal diagnosis in the first trimester of pregnancy.
