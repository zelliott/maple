We have previously shown that the gas-vesicle protein GvpC is present on the outer surface of the gas vesicle, can be reversibly removed and rebound to the surface, and increases the critical collapse pressure of the gas vesicle. The GvpC molecule, which contains five partially conserved repeats of 33 amino acids (33-RR) sandwiched between 18 N-terminal and 10 C-terminal amino acids, is present in a ratio of 1:25 with the GvpA molecule, which forms the ribs of the gas vesicle. By using recombinant techniques we have now made modified versions of GvpC that contain only the first two, three or four of the 33-amino-acid repeats. All of these proteins bind to and strengthen gas vesicles that have been stripped of their native GvpC. Recombinant proteins containing three or four repeats bind in amounts that give the same ratio of 33-RR:GvpA (i.e. 1:5) as the native protein, and they restore much of the strength of the gas vesicle; the protein containing only two repeats binds at a lower ratio (1:7.7), however, and restores less of the strength. Ancestral proteins with only two, three or four of the 33-amino-acid repeats would have been functional in strengthening the gas vesicle but the progressive increase in number of repeats would have provided strength with increased efficiency.
