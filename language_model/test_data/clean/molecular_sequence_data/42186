The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect and type HPV DNA in 40 cases of esophageal carcinoma, which were collected from the high risk region in Fujian. Twenty-four 60% of the 40 patients were positive for HPV DNA after esophagotomy. HPV 6 DNA was found in 12 (50%) of the 24 patients HPV 16 DNA in 2 (8%), but HPV 6, HPV 16 in 4(17%) and HPV unknown type in 6(25%). No reaction was found for HPV 18 and 11. HPV 16 and 6 were detected in 2 lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma. HPV types were in accordance with their primary tumors. HPV effects on esophagus mucosa adjacent to tumors in 27 cases consistent with cervical lesions. Among them, koilocytosis of statistically significance (P < 0.05). The evidence showed that HPV may be a possible etiological agent for esophageal carcinoma in high risk regions.
