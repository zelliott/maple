Pleckstrin is a substrate for protein kinase C in activated platelets that contains at its N and C termini two of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domains that have been proposed to mediate protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions. We have recently shown that pleckstrin can inhibit agonist-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis and that this inhibition requires an intact N-terminal PH domain (residues 6 to 99). In the present studies, we have identified the sites of phosphorylation in pleckstrin and examined their contribution to pleckstrin function. In human platelets activated with thrombin or phorbol esters, and in COS-1 cells expressing pleckstrin, a combination of phosphopeptide analysis and site-directed mutagenesis shows that three residues in the intervening sequence between the two pleckstrin PH domains become phosphorylated: Ser113, Thr114, and Ser117. Replacing all three of these sites with glycine decreased phosphorylation by > 90% and reduced pleckstrin's ability to inhibit phosphoinositide hydrolysis by as much as 80%. Replacing the phosphorylation sites with alanine residues had a similar effect, while substitution with aspartate, glutamate, or lysine residues produced pleckstrin variants that were fully active even in the absence of phosphorylation. These results suggest that phosphorylation enhances pleckstrin's activity by introducing a cluster of charges into a region adjacent to, but not within, the N-terminal PH domain. This may have an allosteric effect on the N-terminal PH domain, regulating its interaction with other molecules necessary for the inhibition of phosphoinositide hydrolysis.
