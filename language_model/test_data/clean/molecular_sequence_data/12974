Denture-induced stomatitis is a common intraoral disease which is associated with high levels of Candida albicans adhesion to a denture surface. The aim of this study was to produce a surface-modified denture resin, which is usually manufactured from poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), carrying an immobilized anticandidal protein. PMMA was modified by surface polymerization of methyl methacrylic acid to enhance adsorption of a potent candidacidal salivary protein, histatin 5. The modified PMMA showed higher surface adsorption and desorption of histatin 5 than the unmodified material. Because histatin 5 destabilizes C. albicans cell membranes and allows efflux of intracellular molecules, candidacidal activity was monitored by dye release from fungal cells. Adsorbed histatin 5 did not release dye from the yeast cells; however, dye was detected as histatin was desorbed from the surface. In an adhesion assay, modified PMMA decreased human submandibular-sublingual saliva (HSMSL) mediated adherence of yeast cells to the polymer. Precoating histatin 5 onto unmodified PMMA also abolished HSMSL-mediated adhesion. These experiments show that dental acrylic may be surface modified and loaded with histatin 5 as a means of controlled release of histatin 5 to an affected area. This surface modification may additionally reduce adhesion of C. albicans cells to the saliva-coated material.
