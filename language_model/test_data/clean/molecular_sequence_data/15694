Recently, ubiquitin was suggested as a promising anti-inflammatory protein therapeutic. We found that a peptide fragment corresponding to the ubiquitin(50-59) sequence (LEDGRTLSDY) possessed the immunosuppressive activity comparable with that of ubiquitin. CD and NMR spectroscopies were used to determine the conformational preferences of LEDGRTLSDY in solution. The peptide mixture, obtained by pepsin digestion of ubiquitin, was even more potent than the intact protein. Although the peptide exhibited a well-defined conformation in methanol, its structure was distinct from the corresponding 50-59 fragment in the native ubiquitin molecule.
