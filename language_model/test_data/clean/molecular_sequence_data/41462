Independent surveys across the globe led to the proposal of a new basidiomycetous yeast genus within the Bulleromyces clade of the Tremellales, Bandoniozyma gen. nov., with seven new species.

The species were characterized by multiple methods, including the analysis of D1/D2 and ITS nucleotide sequences, and morphological and physiological/biochemical traits. Most species can ferment glucose, which is an unusual trait among basidiomycetous yeasts.

In this study we propose the new yeast genus Bandoniozyma, with seven species Bandoniozyma noutii sp. nov. (type species of genus; CBS 8364(T)  =  DBVPG 4489(T)), Bandoniozyma aquatica sp. nov. (UFMG-DH4.20(T)  =  CBS 12527(T)  =  ATCC MYA-4876(T)), Bandoniozyma complexa sp. nov. (CBS 11570(T)  =  ATCC MYA-4603(T)  =  MA28a(T)), Bandoniozyma fermentans sp. nov. (CBS 12399(T)  =  NU7M71(T)  =  BCRC 23267(T)), Bandoniozyma glucofermentans sp. nov. (CBS 10381(T)  =  NRRL Y-48076(T)  =  ATCC MYA-4760(T)  =  BG 02-7-15-015A-1-1(T)), Bandoniozyma tunnelae sp. nov. (CBS 8024(T)  =  DBVPG 7000(T)), and Bandoniozyma visegradensis sp. nov. (CBS 12505(T)  =  NRRL Y-48783(T)  =  NCAIM Y.01952(T)).
