We have recently isolated immune response genes of the major histocompatibility B complex of the chicken (the B-L beta genes) by cross-hybridization in low stringency with an HLA class II beta chain probe. After reviewing the main results obtained, we present a detailed analysis of the region flanking the first gene characterized, B-L beta III. By Southern blot analysis with exon-specific probes, we demonstrate the presence of another related B-L beta gene 10 kb on the 3' side of B-L beta III, the B-L beta V gene. Moreover, retrospective analysis of the phage clones initially isolated with the HLA-DQ beta probe, using a chicken class I probe that we isolated by chromosome walking from the B-L beta genes, indicates that the B-L beta III gene is closely linked on its 5' side to a class I gene, B-FVI.
