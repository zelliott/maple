Inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC) generates two important second messengers, inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol. The recently cloned rat PLC beta 4 cDNA is highly homologous to the norpA cDNA of Drosophila melanogaster. We have mapped the PLC beta 4 gene expression in rat brain tissue sections by in situ hybridization. The PLC beta 4 gene is expressed at high abundance in cerebellar Purkinje cells and neurones of the substantia nigra, the median geniculate bodies and the thalamic nuclei. PLC beta 4 transcripts are also detected in the mammillary nuclei, the neocortex, the habenula and the olfactory bulbs. The specific pattern of gene expression we have observed should help to clarify the relationships between the PLC beta 4 and various constituents of second-messenger systems involved in transduction mechanisms triggered by the stimulation of seven transmembrane domain receptors. The strong gene expression in Purkinje cells and retinal neurones suggests that PLC beta 4 may be involved in the pathogenesis of mouse and human neurological diseases characterized by ataxia and retinal degeneration.
