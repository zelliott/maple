The focal adhesion-associated protein (FAAP), product of the murine D10Wsu52e gene, is involved in modulating cell adhesion dynamics. The ubiquitously expressed protein belongs to the highly conserved UPF0027 family, the newly identified RNA >p ligase family. To understand the mechanisms underlying FAAP expression and regulation, we first mapped its major transcription start site at the nucleotide 79  bp upstream of the ATG codon. The murine FAAP 2.1  kb 5'-flanking region was cloned, analyzed, and aligned with the corresponding 1.7  kb region of its human homolog HSPC117. Despite the differences in activity, cell in vitro transfection and testis in vivo electroporation identified a 0.2 kb efficient promoter region lacking a functional TATA-box. Gel shift assays confirmed the specific interaction between Yin Yang-1 (YY1) and the potential element in the proximal region of the FAAP promoter. Site mutation, truncation, RNAi, and overexpression analyses suggested that YY1 is an important regulator of the FAAP promoter.
