Pex14p, an S. cerevisiae peroxin, is attached to the outer face of the peroxisomal membrane and is a component of the protein import machinery. Pex14p interacts with both the PTS1 and PTS2 receptors. It is the only known peroxisomal membrane protein that binds the PTS2 receptor and might thus mediate the membrane docking event of PTS2-dependent protein import. These results suggest that the two import pathways overlap and, furthermore, that Pex14p represents the point of convergence. Pex14p also interacts with two other membrane-bound peroxins including Pex13p, another binding protein for the PTS1 receptor. The data presented here are consistent with the idea of a common translocation machinery for both PTS-dependent protein import pathways in the peroxisomal membrane.
