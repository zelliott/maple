Laccase can catalyze the oxidation of a wide range of organic and inorganic substrates. In this study, an easily detectable method was employed for screening laccase-producing microorganisms by using 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) as laccase-secretion indicator. A novel laccase-producing strain was isolated and identified as Paecilomyces sp. WSH-L07 according to the morphological characteristics and the comparison of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene sequences. In further investigation, the production of laccase by Paecilomyces sp. WSH-L07 was greatly enhanced by the nontoxic inducers of copper sulphate and methylene blue. Under the induction of 50 microM copper sulphate and 20 microM methylene blue, the maximum laccase production was obtained. When these inducers were added into cultivation medium at 24 h and 12 h, respectively, an increment of about 100 times of laccase activity compared with that of in inducer-free medium and about two times of that of in single copper-supplemented medium was observed. Compared with other Paecilomyces species, Paecilomyces sp. WSH-L07 exhibit the better laccase-producing characteristics with an activity of 1,650 U/l on the eighth day, suggesting its potential ability for industrial application.
