p29, a 29 kDa protein recognised by D5, a monoclonal antibody prepared against partially purified cytosolic estrogen receptor (ER), has been purified to homogeneity from ZR-75-1, a human breast cancer cell line. Ammonium sulphate fractionation followed by immunoaffinity chromatography on a three column system using Protein A-Sepharose coupled D5, produced purified p29. Silver stained SDS one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and two-dimensional PAGE showed p29 to have been purified to homogeneity. Amino acid analysis showed no unusual characteristics. Partial N-terminal sequencing studies showed that purified p29 shared a 100% homology with the sequence of a pp89, murine cytomegaloviral protein.
