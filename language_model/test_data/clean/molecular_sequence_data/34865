A potentially broad-range PCR system for gltA gene amplification has been designed. A nearly full (992 bp) sequence of the gltA gene was amplified in two steps. DNA was extracted from organs (spleen and liver) of four mostly spread species of rodents: Apodemus agrarius and Apodemus peninsulae mice; Clethrionomys rufocanus and Microtus fortis voles. All amplicons have been sequenced. The incidence of Bartonella species in rodents was 73%, 60%, 60%, and 83% for the above-mentioned rodents, respectively. Several genotypes have been identified, including two gltA genotypes close to B. taylorii, four gltA genotypes close to B. grahamii, and one genotype of a potentially new species. Several Bartonella species were found in both mice species, although each vole species harbored a single species of Bartonella. High incidence of Bartonella infection was found in all studied species of small rodents in the Russian Far East. Several amplified genotypes probably belong to local strains of B. taylorii and B. grahamii, and one genotype represents a possible new species.
