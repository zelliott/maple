VDJ genes of rabbit B cells are diversified by a somatic gene conversion-like mechanism in which V(H) gene segments 5' of the VDJ gene serve as donors. To assess whether somatic mutation also contributes to Ab diversification in the rabbit, we searched for mutations 3' of VDJ genes because mutations in this region presumably result from somatic mutation rather than gene conversion. We PCR-amplified and cloned the region extending 534 bp 3' of VDJ genes from splenic DNA of young and adult rabbits. Results of nucleotide sequence analysis of the clones revealed a high mutation frequency (2.4%) within the first 120 bp downstream of VDJ genes. This frequency decreased rapidly with increasing distance 3' of the VDJ genes. The mutations demonstrated both strand bias and dinucleotide preferences characteristic of somatic hypermutation. We conclude that Ab diversity in rabbit is generated not only by somatic gene conversion but also by somatic hypermutation.
