A horseshoe-shaped, orange-pigmented strain, HMD3055(T), was isolated from a solar saltern in Korea. Strain HMD3055(T) grew optimally at 25 °C and with a salt concentration of 3-5 %. The predominant quinone of strain HMD3055(T) was menaquinone (MK)-7. The major fatty acids of strain HMD3055(T) were iso-C15 : 0, summed feature 3 (comprising C16 : 1ω6c and/or C16 : 1ω7c) and summed feature 9 (iso-C17 : 1ω9c and/or 10-methyl C16 : 0). The polar lipids of HMD3055(T) consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine, one unidentified phospholipid, one unidentified aminolipid and five unidentified polar lipids. The phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain HMD3055(T) formed a distinct lineage within the genus Cyclobacterium. Strain HMD3055(T) was closely related to Cyclobacterium lianum (95.8 %), Cyclobacterium lianum HY9(T) (95.8 %), C. marinum DSM 745(T) (93.2 %) and C. amurskyense KMM6143(T) (92.6 %) form a distinct lineage from other members of the genus Cyclobacterium. The DNA G+C content of strain HMD3055(T) was 45.6 mol%. On the basis of the evidence presented in this study, it is concluded that strain HMD3055(T) represents a novel species of the genus Cyclobacterium, for which the name Cyclobacterium jeungdonense sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is HMD3055(T) ( = KCTC 23150(T) = CECT 7706(T)).
