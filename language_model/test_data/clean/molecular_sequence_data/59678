A novel myb-like gene (AtmybL2) was isolated from an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library. The single copy gene was localised on chromosome I. A gene specific transcript is preferentially found in leaves. The predicted gene product consists of a conservative N-terminal myb-domain known to be involved in DNA-binding and a unique proline-rich C-terminal part. Remarkably, the myb-domain includes only one of the typical two or three tryptophan repeats found in other myb-like proteins.
