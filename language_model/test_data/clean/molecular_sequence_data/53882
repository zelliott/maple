The integrase gene (int) on the genome of &phi;FSW, which is a temperate bacteriophage of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (formerly denoted as S-1), and the four attachment sites on the genomes of the phage and its host were characterized by sequencing. The &phi;FSW integrase was found to belong to the integrase family of site-specific tyrosine recombinase. The attachment sites shared a 40bp common core within which an integrative site-specific recombination occurs. The common core was flanked on one side by an additional segment of high sequence similarity. An integration plasmid, consisting of int, the phage attachment site (attP), and a selectable marker, inserted stably into the bacterial attachment site (attB) within the common core, as did the complete prophage genome at a frequency of more than 10(3)/microg of plasmid DNA. This plasmid was used as a test system for a preliminary mutational analysis of int and attP. The attB common core was located within and near the end of an open reading frame that appears to encode a homolog to glucose 6-phosphate isomerase, an enzyme of the glycolytic pathway. It is unlikely that the prophage integration inactivates this protein, since a change of only the C-terminal amino acid is predicted because of the sequence similarity between attP and attB.
