Zoo-FISH and somatic cell hybrid panels have earlier demonstrated extended synteny conservation between human chromosome 3 (HSA3) and pig chromosome 13 (SSC13). In the present study, eight human genes viz., ADCY5, CASR, COL7A1, COL8A1, ITIH1, RHO, SIAT1 and XPC, spread along the length of HSA3, were chosen for expanding the comparative map between the two chromosomes. Using human and rat cDNAs, or human- and porcine-specific PCR products as probes, 8 porcine lambda clones were isolated. After subcloning and partial sequence determination, identity of the clones with regards to the specific genes was established. The eight type 1 markers thus obtained were biotin labeled and FISH mapped to pig metaphase spreads. All lambda clones localized to SSC13. In combination with the hitherto published mapping data of coding sequences on SSC13, a preliminary comparative status depicting the relative organization of this chromosome with respect to HSA3 was developed. The comparative map thus obtained bears significance in searching for candidate genes of economically important traits mapped to SSC13.
