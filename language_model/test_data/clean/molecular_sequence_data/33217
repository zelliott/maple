In an attempt to discover novel biomarker proteins in type 2 diabetes prognosis, we investigated the influence of hypoglycemic extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) obtained from the macrofungus Tremella fuciformis on the differential levels of plasma proteins in ob/ob mice using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). The 2-DE analysis demonstrated that 92 spots from about 900 visualized spots were differentially regulated, of which 40 spots were identified as principal diabetes-associated proteins. By comparing control with EPS-fed mice, we found that at least six proteins were significantly altered in ob/ob mice, including Apo A-I, IV, C-III, E, retinol-binding protein 4, and transferrin, and their levels were interestingly normalized after EPS treatment. Western blot analysis revealed that the altered levels of the two regulatory molecules highlighted in diabetes and obesity (e.g., resistin and adiponectin) were also normalized in response to EPS. The Mouse Diabetes PCR Array profiles showed that the expression of 84 genes related to the onset, development, and progression of diabetes were significantly downregulated in liver, adipocyte, and muscle of ob/ob mice. EPS might act as a potent regulator of gene expression for a wide variety of genes in ob/ob mice, particularly in obesity, insulin resistance, and complications from diabetes mellitus.
