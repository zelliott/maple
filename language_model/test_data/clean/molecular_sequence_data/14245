Lactobacillus plantarum is a highly versatile lactic acid bacterium found in various ecological niches, such as fermented vegetable, meat, and dairy products and the gastrointestinal tract. We sequenced the genome of L. plantarum NC8, a naturally plasmid-free strain, which has been used as a model strain in many laboratories worldwide.
