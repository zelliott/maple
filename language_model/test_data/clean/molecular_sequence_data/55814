N-terminal fragments of PTH-related protein (PTHrP), PTHrP-(1-34), and PTHrP-(1-40) stimulated both adenylyl cyclase and a mechanism that increases membrane-associated protein kinase C (PKC) activity in ROS 17/2 rat osteosarcoma cells. There were two peaks in the PKC response to the N-terminal PTHrP fragments: one peak was obtained with picomolar and the other with nanomolar PTHrP concentrations. The PKC-stimulating picomolar concentrations of the PTHrP fragments did not detectably stimulate adenylyl cyclase, but the nanomolar concentrations did. Since a similar two-peak response of PKC activity was obtained with PTHrP-(28-34), the single, N-terminal PKC activation domain of the PTHrP is in the same 28-34 region of the molecule as that of PTH despite this region having different primary amino acid sequences in the two hormones. Unlike PTH, PTHrP has a second PKC activation domain, as indicated by the ability of picomolar concentrations of the PTHrP-(107-111) fragment to stimulate maximally membrane-associated PKC activity in the osteosarcoma cells.
