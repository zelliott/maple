Seven saponins named pithedulosides A-G were isolated from the seeds of Pithecellobium dulce. Their structures were established through spectral analyses as echinocystic acid 3-O-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside, echinocystic acid and oleanolic acid 3-O-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl- (1-->2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosides and 3-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl -(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosides, oleanolic acid 3-O-alpha-L-arabinopyranosy-(1-->2)-alpha-L- arabinopyranosyl-(1-->6)-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)]-beta- D-glucopyranoside, and 3-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1-->6) -[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)]--beta-D-glucopyranoside.
