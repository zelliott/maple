GABAA receptors with functional benzodiazepine receptors have been reconstituted by coexpression of alpha-, beta- and gamma-subunit cDNAs. In brain, proteins of the alpha- and beta-subunits, but not the gamma 2-subunit have been identified. Using an antipeptide antiserum, we now demonstrate that the gamma 2-subunit is a protein of 43 kDa. It is present in at least 50% of GABAA receptors, as shown by immunoprecipitation.
