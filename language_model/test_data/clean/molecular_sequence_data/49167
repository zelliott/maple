Candida albicans exhibits the ability to grow in either a yeast or a mycelia form in response to different environmental factors. The mycelia form, found in infected tissues, is important as a virulence factor in the adherence of the organism to the host epithelium. In vitro, the morphological transition can be induced by environmental shifts in the growing conditions, or by a variety of exogenous factors, including ambient pH, nutritional status and temperature. The differential-display reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (DDRT-PCR) is a powerful technique for comparing gene expression between cell types, stages of development or differentiation. Hyphae related genes were identified and characterized using a PCR-based differential display. Candida albicans formed a germ tube when cultured in rabbit serum, RPMI 1640 medium or 39 degrees C-YPD medium. We gained 21 cDNA bands showing a different expression pattern from that of the uninduced culture. DNA was extracted from the same location of the isolated bands, and PCR was performed under the same conditions, which reamplified the PCR product, showing the specific expression patterns according to the culture conditions. We cloned 18 germ tube-related cDNA clones (inserts average size is 80 - 700 bp) and sequenced them. The nucleotide sequences of the 18 clones were identified through in the present study from GenBank, and were found to have the accession number (AF405213-AF405230). We could not find any nucleotide sequence having a high homology with these clones. This study could form a part of the projects in the search for genes related to the germ tube formation of C. albicans.
