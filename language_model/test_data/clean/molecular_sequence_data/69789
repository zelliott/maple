Satellite RNA depend for their multiplication on the co-infection of a host cell by a helper virus which can itself multiply independently of the satellite. Four types of satellite RNA have been distinguished on the basis of the size of the RNA and what sort, if any, of protein they encode. One of them, the B-type, comprises relatively large RNA which are messenger RNA for non-structural proteins. Many of these satellites are typified by having nepoviruses as helper viruses. In general, the presence of nepovirus mRNA satellites in a virus culture causes little or no modification to the symptoms of infection by the helper virus and has little effect on its yield. Some satellites appear to be highly specific to a strain of helper virus but others can be helped by heterologous viruses. The proteins encoded by nepovirus mRNA satellites have a M(r) of 38,000 to 48,000 and are relatively basic, in particular in the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of the molecules. However, there is little similarity in amino acid sequence between proteins encoded by different satellites and no peptide motif could be found in all satellite proteins. The results of reverse genetics experiments with satellites suggest that the satellite-encoded protein is essential for the multiplication of the satellite RNA. This system has considerable potential for the study of the mechanisms of replication both of satellite and helper virus RNA.
