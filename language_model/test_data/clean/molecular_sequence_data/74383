Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) mediate rapid excitatory synaptic transmission throughout the peripheral and central nervous systems. They transduce binding of nerve-released ACh into opening of an intrinsic channel, yet the structural basis underlying transduction is not fully understood. Previous studies revealed a principal transduction pathway in which alphaArg 209 of the pre-M1 domain and alphaGlu 45 of the beta1-beta2 loop functionally link the two regions, positioning alphaVal 46 of the beta1-beta2 loop in a cavity formed by alphaPro 272 through alphaSer 269 of the M2-M3 loop. Here we investigate contributions of residues within and proximal to this pathway using single-channel kinetic analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and thermodynamic mutant cycle analysis. We find that in contributing to channel gating, alphaVal 46 and alphaVal 132 of the signature Cys loop couple energetically to alphaPro 272. Furthermore, these residues are optimized in both their size and hydrophobicity to mediate rapid and efficient channel gating, suggesting naturally occurring substitutions at these positions enable a diverse range of gating rate constants among the Cys-loop receptor superfamily. The overall results indicate that alphaPro 272 functionally couples to flanking Val residues extending from the beta1-beta2 and Cys loops within the ACh binding to channel opening transduction pathway.
