Measles virus (MV) expresses at least 3 proteins from the phosphoprotein (P) cistron. Alternative translation initiation directs synthesis of the C protein from the +1 reading frame, while so-called RNA editing generates a second population of mRNAs which express the V protein from the -1 reading frame which lies within and overlaps the larger P reading frame. While the P protein has been demonstrated to be an essential cofactor for the L protein in the formation of active transcriptase complexes, the functions of the V and C proteins remain unknown. In order to investigate these functions, we have expressed the MV P, V and C proteins as GST fusions in E. coli for affinity purification and use in an in vitro binding assay with other viral and cellular proteins. The P protein was found to interact with L, NP, and with itself. These interactions were mapped to the carboxy-terminal half of the protein which is absent in the V protein. In contrast, both the V and C proteins failed to interact with any other viral proteins, but were each found to interact specifically with one or more cellular proteins. Appropriate aspects of these results were confirmed in vivo using the yeast two-hybrid system. These observations suggest that the V and C proteins may be involved in modulation of the host cellular environment within MV-infected cells. Such activity would be distinct from their previously proposed role in the possible down-regulation of virus-specific RNA transcription and replication.
