FlhB is a key protein in the regulation of protein export by the bacterial flagellar secretion system. It is composed of two domains: an N-terminal transmembrane domain and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (FlhBc). FlhBc from Salmonella typhimurium has been successfully crystallized using the vapour-diffusion method. The crystals diffracted to 2.45 Å resolution and belonged to space group P4(2)2(1)2, with unit-cell parameters a=b=49.06, c=142.94 Å. A selenomethionine-containing variant of FlhBc has also been crystallized in the same space group and was used for initial phase calculation by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method.
