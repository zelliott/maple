The influence of molecular structure and DNA binding mode on the ability of cationic porphyrins to photosensitize DNA strand break formation has been studied for a series of meso-substituted pyridinium porphyrins using electrophoretic and DNA sequencing techniques. Porphyrins substituted with pyridyl groups in which the heterocyclic nitrogen is in the para or meta position vis-Ã -vis the substitution point are capable of intercalative binding and are considerably more efficient DNA photosensitizers than the corresponding non-intercalating ortho compounds. Within each group of porphyrins the photosensitizer efficiency increases with the number of positive charges. Using DNA sequencing experiments, we have demonstrated that photomodification occurs primarily at the guanine and thymine bases, and that alkali-labile sites produced by photo-oxidation are as important as direct cleavage events. The kinetics of strand degradation in aerated and degassed solution suggest that type II reactions (probably mediated by singlet oxygen) occur with significantly higher yield than type I reactions and are responsible for the formation of alkali-labile sites in aerated systems. These observations seem to confirm the hypothesis that those structural features which influence the strength and mode of binding also serve to establish favourable porphyrin-DNA interactions for photosensitization.
