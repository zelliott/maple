Human nuclear poly(ADP-ribosyl) transferase (ADPRT) protein content in cells suggests that ADPRT expression is stringently controlled. Analysis of the 3 kb promoter sequence, which is required for high level expression, revealed an extraordinary architecture: several Sp1 motifs are located in the vicinity of the first exon but the closest CCAAT/TATA boxes are several hundred basepairs away. Four Alu type repetitive sequences are in the promoter structure. Within these Alu sequences there exist inverted repeat elements, which could form two mutually exclusive types of DNA tertiary structure consisting of quadruplex DNA and loops resembling rackets. Thereby, a CCAAT/TATA element would be moved to spatial vicinity of the Sp1 site activating the promoter. Deletion analysis showed the functional significance of these racket elements. We also obtained evidence for DNA racket structures when we studied mutational mechanisms in a human adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficient patient. One of his alleles harbours a novel complex type of deletion/insertion mutation. Based on several highly informative sequence features in this genomic region a model is proposed for the generation of this unusual type of mutation involving two steps: an initial targeting step and a subsequent complex rearrangement. This process includes the formation of a DNA racket structure, which resembles that of the ADPRT promoter. Thus we conclude that DNA racket structures seem to be of general importance in nature.
