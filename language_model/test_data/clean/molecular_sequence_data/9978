An anti-axolemma monoclonal antibody, designated G21.3, has been isolated in order to understand molecular mechanisms involved in myelination. Both biochemical and morphological studies showed that the monoclonal antibody inhibits myelin production by oligodendrocytes in cerebellar slice cultures. On Western blots of axolemma preparations, the antibody recognized 140- and 120-kD proteins. The present study involves the isolation and characterization of the G21.3 antigen. The G21.3-immunoreactive proteins of 140 and 120 kD were purified from the adult rat sciatic nerve and amino acid sequencing of these proteins revealed significant homology to alpha I and alpha II chains of collagen type I. Biochemical and Western blot analysis using pure collagen, collagen I antibody and collagenase D suggest that the antigen isolated from sciatic nerve is collagen. However, immunofluorescence studies using the G21.3 antibody, collagen I antibody, collagenase D and Northern blot analysis using a collagen probe do not fully support the view that the G21.3 antigen in the CNS is also a collagen. We conclude that the G21.3 antigen is a collagen-like protein involved in CNS myelination.
