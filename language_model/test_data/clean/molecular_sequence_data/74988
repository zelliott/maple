The nucleotide sequence of gene 19 of bacteriophage T4, the structural gene of the tail tube protein, was determined by both the dideoxy and the Maxam-Gilbert methods. The predicted Mr of tube protein gene product 19 is 18,842. The N-terminal amino acid of the tube protein was determined by Edman degradation, and the C-terminal sequence was confirmed by isolation of the C-terminal tryptic peptide. In the noncoding region between genes 18 and 19, there are two late-T4-promoter consensus sequences, 51 bases apart. The implication of the two late promoter sequences was examined by an S1 nuclease protection experiment. Both serve as weak promoters, but the bulk of the transcripts arise from further upstream of the two promoters.
