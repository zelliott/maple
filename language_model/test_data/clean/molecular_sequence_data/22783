Glyptapanteles indiensis (Braconidae, Hymenoptera) is an endoparasitoid of Lymantria dispar, the gypsy moth. Expression of G. indiensis polydnavirus (GiBV)-encoded genes within the pest host results in inhibition of immune response and development and alteration of physiology, enabling successful development of the parasitoid. Here, GiBV genome segment F (segF), an 18.6 kb segment shown to encode nine protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) genes and a single ankyrin repeat gene (ank), is analysed. PTPs have presumed function as regulators of signal transduction, while ankyrin repeat genes are hypothesized to function in inhibition of NF-kappaB signalling in the parasitized host. In this study, transcription of each gene was mapped by 5'- and 3'-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) and temporal and tissue-specific expression was examined in the parasitized host. For polydnavirus gene prediction in the parasitized host, no available gene prediction parameters were entirely precise. The mRNAs for each GiBV segF gene initiated between 30 and 112 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon. All were encoded in single open reading frames (ORFs), with the exception of PTP9, which was transcribed as a bicistronic message with the adjacent ank gene. RT-PCR indicated that all GiBV segF PTPs were expressed early in parasitization and, for most, expression was sustained over the course of at least 7 days after parasitization, suggesting importance in both early and sustained virus-induced immunosuppression and alteration of physiology. Tissue-specific patterns of PTP expression of GiBV segF genes were variable, suggesting differing roles in facilitating parasitism.
