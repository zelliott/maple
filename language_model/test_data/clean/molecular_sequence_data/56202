The mitochondria of maize plants with S-type cytoplasm possess a family of single and double-stranded RNA molecules, termed RNA plasmids, that replicate in a DNA-independent manner typical of RNA viruses. We have determined the sequence of the smallest and most abundant member of this family, a single-stranded RNA termed RNA b. The 719 nucleotide sequence of RNA b lacks open reading frames of significant length. Probes complementary to the determined (+) strand sequence identified two larger RNA species of 2900 and > 4000 nucleotides in S-type maize mitochondria, the smaller of which corresponds to a previously identified member of the RNA plasmid family designated RNA a. These probes also unexpectedly identified a low abundance form of RNA b in N-type maize mitochondria. (+) strand probes identified corresponding (-) strand forms in S cytoplasm that likely represent components of replication intermediates. Primer extension experiments demonstrated that RNA b is an internally deleted form of the larger RNA plasmid, RNA a, and that it has a discrete and homogeneous 5' terminus. The solubility of RNA b in 2 M-LiCl as well as structural modelling studies indicated that it has a very high degree of secondary structure. Analysis of specific cleavage products generated by treatment of RNA b-oligonucleotide duplexes with RNase H indicated that the only identifiable forms of RNA b were linear molecules with relatively homogeneous 3' termini; no circular forms were detected. RNA b was found to share a 13 nucleotide sequence with the circular cadang-cadang viroid; 11 of these nucleotides fall within the central conserved region of viroid RNAs. In addition, RNA b shares certain structural similarities with phage Q beta and "variant" RNAs that serve as in vitro templates for the Q beta replicase. Collectively, our results indicate that RNA b is a "defective-interfering" member of an RNA family representing a new and apparently distinct class of RNA replicons.
