Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) from 36 wild species of the genus Helianthus has been analysed with three restriction endonucleases (Bam HI, Hind III and Sst I). Out of the 71 restriction sites described on the reference cpDNA (sunflower cpDNA), three insertions/deletions and seven site modifications were detected during the survey of the other cpDNAs. Since restriction mapping showed only a very limited fraction of the DNA variability, we chose to adapt the S1 nuclease mapping technique to detect fine variations between chloroplast genomes. For this purpose, DNA-DNA heteroduplexes obtained between sunflower and wild-species DNAs were digested by S1 nuclease and the resulting mismatches were detected by classical endonuclease restriction and hybridization methods. The S1 nuclease mapping results were confirmed by sequencing one S1 nuclease-sensitive region detected between cultivated sunflower and two perennial wild-type species. As a result of these analyses, it appeared that the combination of restriction mapping and S1 nuclease mapping might be helpful to differentiate taxonomically close cytoplasms.
