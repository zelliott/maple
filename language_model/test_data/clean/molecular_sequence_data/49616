Protein structure prediction by using bioinformatics can involve sequence similarity searches, multiple sequence alignments, identification and characterization of domains, secondary structure prediction, solvent accessibility prediction, automatic protein fold recognition, constructing three-dimensional models to atomic detail, and model validation. Not all protein structure prediction projects involve the use of all these techniques. A central part of a typical protein structure prediction is the identification of a suitable structural target from which to extrapolate three-dimensional information for a query sequence. The way in which this is done defines three types of projects. The first involves the use of standard and well-understood techniques. If a structural template remains elusive, a second approach using nontrivial methods is required. If a target fold cannot be reliably identified because inconsistent results have been obtained from nontrivial data analyses, the project falls into the third type of project and will be virtually impossible to complete with any degree of reliability. In this article, a set of protocols to predict protein structure from sequence is presented and distinctions among the three types of project are given. These methods, if used appropriately, can provide valuable indicators of protein structure and function.
