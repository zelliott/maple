Total RNAs were extracted from the venom gland of the snake Gloydius ussuriensis. The cDNA of gussurobin, a thrombin-like enzyme from Gloydius ussuriensis, was cloned and amplified by RT-PCR. Assay of the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA allowed postulation of the complete amino acid sequence for Gloydius ussuriensis, Chinese Viperdae. Its amino acid sequence exhibits significant homology with that of other snake thrombin-like enzymes. The cDNA of gussurobin was inserted into the vector pPIC 9K and expressed successfully in Pichia pastoris, strain GS115. The recombinant gussurobin was separated and purified from 500 ml culture and showed one band on SDS-PAGE.
