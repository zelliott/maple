Two genomic clones which cover a 30-kb region containing the ribosomal RNA cistron from Trypanosoma cruzi have been isolated. The location of the 18S, 24S alpha and 24S beta RNA species within the cistron was determined. The complete sequences of the genes corresponding to the 24S alpha RNA and to a small RNA (S1), as well as two internal transcribed spacers were obtained by sequencing a cDNA and a genomic fragment. A locus containing sequences related to the 24S alpha RNA has been determined. Sequence data and structural characterization of this locus strongly suggest that this region contains a 24S alpha RNA pseudogene.
