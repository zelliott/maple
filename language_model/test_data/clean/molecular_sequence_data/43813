A fragment of mouse genomic DNA containing a pseudogene corresponding to the processed transcript of the DP1 locus was isolated and analysed. The pseudogene sequence, on comparison with the genomic locus and the corresponding mRNA indicated the presence of several small deletions and point mutations. In addition, the pseudogene showed a deletion for the second exon of the DP1 gene indicating the occurrence of an exon slippage event during its formation. We also describe the chromosomal mapping of the pseudogene to chromosome 1 by fluorescence in situ hybridisation and distinguish it from the localisation of the actual murine DP1 genomic locus on mouse chromosome 8.
