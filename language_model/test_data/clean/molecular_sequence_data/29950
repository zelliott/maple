We molecularly cloned JC polyomavirus DNAs from urine samples of eight nonimmunosuppressed patients and two healthy individuals. The cloned viral DNAs all contained an archetypal regulatory sequence from which various regulatory sequences of JC polyomavirus isolates derived from patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy could have evolved by deletion and amplification.
