Porphyrins linked to oligonucleotides produce various types of photodamage on a complementary target DNA. The observed reactions include oxidation of guanine bases and cross-linking reactions of the oligonucleotide to its target sequence. Guanines located close to the porphyrin macrocycle were the most altered as compared to more remote guanines on the target sequence. No specific reaction was observed when the complexes were dissociated at temperatures above the melting temperature of the oligonucleotide-target hybrid. Both cross-linking and oxidation reactions accounted for ca. 60% modification of the target chains in the complex. Our results show that oligonucleotides covalently linked to porphyrins are efficient systems for inducing irreversible sequence-specific photodamage on a target DNA.
