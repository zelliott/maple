An analysis of partial sequences of the 16S ribosomal rRNA gene (582 bp) of 20 poison frog species (Dendrobatidae) confirmed their phylogenetic relationships to bufonid and leptodactylid frogs. Representatives of the ranoid families and subfamilies Raninae, Mantellinae, Petropedetinae, Cacosterninae, Arthroleptidae, Astylosternidae, and Microhylidae did not cluster as sister group of the Dendrobatidae. Similar results were obtained in an analysis using a partial sequence of the 12S gene (350 bp) in a reduced set of taxa and in a combined analysis. Within the Dendrobatidae, our data supported monophyly of the genus Phyllobates but indicated paraphyly of Epipedobates and Colostethus. Minyobates clustered within Dendrobates, contradicting its previously assumed phylogenetic position. Phobobates species clustered as a monophyletic unit within Epipedobates. Allobates was positioned in a group containing two Colostethus species, indicating that lack of amplexus, presence of skin alkaloids, and aposematic coloration evolved independently in Allobates and the remaining aposematic dendrobatids.
