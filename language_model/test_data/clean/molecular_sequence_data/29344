Crotamine, isolated from the venom of the South American rattlesnake Crotalus durissus terrificus is a strongly basic 42-amino acid polypeptide belonging to the small basic myotoxin family. As no tridimensional structure is available for this myotoxin subfamily, despite its important pharmacological interest, we propose in this paper a theoretical 3D model for crotamine. Starting from a homology modelling procedure, followed by intensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in water and complementary CD experiments, the designed 3D model is the first example of a tridimensional structure in this family of small basic myotoxins. Crotamine, therefore, belongs to a newly identified structural family presenting a common fold also found in beta-defensin and antopleurine-B. The proposed 3D model will be used for future calculations about crotamine aggregation and interaction with membranes.
