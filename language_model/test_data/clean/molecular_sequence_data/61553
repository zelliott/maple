nPTB is a member of the polypyrimidine tract-binding (PTB) protein family, which participates in alternative pre-mRNA processing. Tissue-specific splicing of exon 10 in nPTB (HGMW-approved symbol PTBP2) may play an important role in regulating the functional activity of nPTB in neuronal versus nonneuronal cells. In this study, we found that 297 consecutive intronic nucleotides flanking this alternatively spliced exon 10 were identical between human, green monkey, mouse, rat, and pig, while 207 consecutive intronic nucleotides were identical between human and bird DNA. In addition, a 2-kb sequence spanning this intron region showed 85 and 70% conservation in mammal and bird DNA, respectively. Unexpected intergenic sequence conservation between human and mouse genomes has recently been identified. We have now identified intragenic (intronic) sequence conservation from mammals to birds. The striking conservation of this large segment of flanking intronic sequence suggests an important role in tissue-specific splice site selection and may function in regulating the production of functional nPTB.
