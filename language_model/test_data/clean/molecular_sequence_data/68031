Three series of basic proteins and peptides were selected for use in studying the adsorption behavior of fused-silica capillary electrophoresis columns. A comparative study of untreated and treated fused-silica columns was done. The polymers used as coating materials ranged from very hydrophobic to very hydrophilic. The average efficiency of weakly hydrophilic Ucon-coated capillaries for basic proteins was over 1 million theoretical plates at a buffer pH of 4.8. For this coating, it was found that the maximum column efficiency was obtained at a film thickness of approximately 100 nm. It was easily seen that both ionic and hydrophobic interaction forces can play important roles in protein adsorption onto the capillary walls. Furthermore, strongly hydrophilic polymer coatings may possibly lead to hydrogen-bonding interactions, which decrease column efficiency. Studies have been conducted using two series of polypeptides with varying chain lengths. One series was used to study the effect of polypeptide chain length on retention behavior. Efficient separations of bioactive peptide drugs on Ucon-coated columns were achieved. The results indicate that high efficiency and resolution of basic peptides tested can be realized on columns modified with weakly hydrophilic polymers at a pH value of about 5.
