The process of translational reinitiation in Escherichia coli was studied in a two cistron system where expression of the downstream reporter gene was dependent on translation of an upstream reading frame. The dependence was almost absolute. Upstream translation increased expression of the downstream gene by two to three orders of magnitude. This large difference allowed us to quantitate restarts in a meaningful manner. In the absence of a Shine and Dalgarno (SD) region reinitiation occurred but its efficiency was about 10% of that found in the SD carrying counterpart. We discuss three ways by which translational coupling between neighboring cistrons can be enforced.
