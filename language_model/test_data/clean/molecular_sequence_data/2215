Escherichia coli p-aminobenzoate synthase is composed of two nonidentical subunits encoded by pabA and pabB and has been assumed to be the sole enzyme responsible for p-aminobenzoate biosynthesis from chorismate and glutamine. Plasmids were constructed that overproduce the p-aminobenzoate synthase subunits 250-500-fold. Partial purification of the subunits revealed that they form a diffusible intermediate that is subsequently converted to p-aminobenzoate by a second enzyme (Mr = 49,000) temporarily designated enzyme X.
