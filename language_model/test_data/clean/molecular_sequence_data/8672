The insertion sequence IS6110 has an important role in diagnostic PCR and typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We have evaluated a one-tube nested PCR which detects IS6110. Positive results were obtained with DNAs from four of four M. tuberculosis isolates, seven of eight M. fortuitum isolates, seven of seven M. avium-M. intracellulare complex isolates, four of five M. kansasii isolates, four of five M. xenopi isolates, two of four M. malmoense isolates, and one of two M. chelonei isolates. These results were confirmed by hybridization of genomic DNA from bp 505 to 685 of the IS6110 from M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Dot blot hybridization of genomic DNAs from these isolates with the same probe cinfirmed the presence of a homologous sequence in these mycobacterial species. These data suggest that false-positive results may be obtained for clinical samples when some methods based on IS6110 are used [corrected].
