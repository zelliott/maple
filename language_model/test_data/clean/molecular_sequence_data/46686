Tandem repeats of a novel, putative, zinc-binding motif (MYM) have been described within the products of two, highly homologous genes: ZNF198/RAMP/FIM and ZNF261/DXS6673E. ZNF198, mapping to 13q11-q12, was recently shown to fuse to the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 gene in the t(8;13)(p11;q11-q12) rearrangement associated with a stem cell leukemia/lymphoma syndrome. ZNF261 at Xq13.1 is disrupted by a t(X;13)(q13.1;q32) rearrangement in a mentally retarded patient and is a candidate gene for nonspecific X-linked mental retardation. Here we have cloned another member of this family, designated ZNF258, and mapped it to chromosome band 14q12. In addition, ZNF262/KIAA0425 was identified as a further member of the family and mapped to 1p32-p34. The predicted protein products of ZNF258 and ZNF262 maintain the repeats of the MYM motif. Isolation of these new members will facilitate the functional characterization of the MYM family and motif.
