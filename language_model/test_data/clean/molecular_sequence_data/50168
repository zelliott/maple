Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are a multifaceted group of mutualistic symbionts that are common to terrestrial ecosystems. The interaction between AM fungi and plant roots is of environmental and agronomic importance. Understanding the molecular changes within the host plant upon AM fungal colonisation is a pre-requisite to a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying the interaction. Differential mRNA display was conducted on leaf tissue of tomato plants colonised and non-colonised by the AM fungus Glomus mosseae and five putative differentially regulated cDNAs were identified. All cDNAs isolated shared high sequence similarity to known plant genes. Differential screening was initially used to establish whether the cDNAs were differentially expressed. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to establish gene expression patterns for all five clones within leaf and root tissue of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal colonised tomato plants. Differential regulation was observed for all five cDNAs. Down-regulation within the leaf tissue of mycorrhizal plants was observed for 4 out of the 5 cDNAs with an up-regulation observed only for one. Tissue specific regulation was observed for several cDNAs, with down-regulation observed in mycorrhizal leaf tissue and up-regulation observed within mycorrhizal root tissue as compared to non-mycorrhizal tissue.
