Ovine β2 subunit of the interleukin (IL)-12 receptor (IL-12Rβ2) was cloned from mRNA preparation of mitogen-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The complete coding sequence for ovine IL-12 Rβ2 was found to be 2586 nucleotides in length encoding 862-amino-acid residue protein. It showed 96.4% homology at the nucleotide level and 94.1% homology at the amino acid level with bovine IL-12 Rβ2. The ovine IL-12 Rβ2 subunit shares common structural and functional elements with their counterparts from the other species. Phylogenetic tree showed that ovine IL-12Rβ2 was clustered into the Artiodactyla group, together with those of cattle and pig, which was distinct from the other groups. Real-time RT-PCR was used to investigate expression of the IL-12Rβ2 in different tissues of sheep in order to determine the characterization of this receptor in tissue. Expression analysis showed that IL-12Rβ2 mRNA expression was detected at all the detected tissues with the exception of thymus.
