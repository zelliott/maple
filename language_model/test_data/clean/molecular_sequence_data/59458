A 850 bp fragment of the 5' flanking region of the glucoamylase gene (glaA) was synthesized from A. niger T21 genome using PCR. The function detection vector was constructed by fusing this fragment to E. coli hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene (hph) and was used to transform A. niger. The high hygromycin resistance transformants thus obtained verified that the synthesized fragment functioned as a promoter in filamentous fungi. Southern blot analysis showed the hph gene has been integrated into genomic DNA of A. niger transformant.
