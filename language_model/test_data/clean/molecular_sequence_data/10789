Using the Drosophila EcR-B1 cDNA as a probe, we have cloned the putative ecdysteroid receptor from the mealworm Tenebrio molitor. We have isolated two cDNAs with different 5' termini that contain a complete open reading frame. These two cDNAs encode two proteins with distinct N-terminal regions corresponding to two isoforms. The coleopteran receptor is obviously related to the ecdysteroid receptor of other insects, but shares only 89% and 61% amino acid identities with the DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains of the Drosophila receptor, respectively. Its expression pattern has been examined in the epidermis during the last larval instar and pupal stage of T. molitor, in correlation with the hemolymph ecdysteroid titer. Hybridizations revealed two transcripts of 7 kb and 6.5 kb detected in most stages during metamorphosis and corresponding to the A and B1 isoforms. These two mRNAs are highly evident just before the rise of each ecdysteroid peak both in prepupae and in pupae. They show almost the same expression pattern in epidermis except for the second part of the pupal stage, during which only the A isoform is detected.
