We have undertaken a comprehensive study of the gene conversion of all the mitochondrial introns of Saccharomyces capensis. The approach used involved the measurements of intron transmission amongst the progeny of crosses between a recipient strain (Saccharomyces cerevisiae intronless mitochondria) and various donor strains (Saccharomyces capensis, with various combinations of mitochondrial introns). We have shown that the S. capensis second intron (bi2 of cytochrome b gene) is extremely active as a donor in gene conversion whereas its homologous S. cerevisiae intron is not. Determination of sequence of the S. capensis intron demonstrates that it differs from that of the homologous S. cerevisiae intron (bi2) by a very small number of nucleotide substitutions.
