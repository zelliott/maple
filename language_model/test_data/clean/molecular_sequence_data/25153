We present a general model for the evolution of chromosome-specific satellite DNA subfamilies. Sus scrofa domestica has a bimodal karyotype with two autosomal subsets of 12 meta-/submetacentric (Mc) and 6 acrocentric (Ac) chromosome types (Mc and Ac "subgenomes"). We show that the centromeric heterochromatin is characterised by two distinct satellite DNA families designed Mc1 and Ac2. Mc1 is a diverse satellite family of the Mc subgenome of which certain members with a 100 bp repeat unit are found to occur at the pericentromeric regions of each Mc autosome, while others are chromosome-specific, e.g. clone Mc pAv1.5, a higher order repeat variant, which hybridises specifically to chromosome 1. Ac2 is a homogeneous satellite occurring at the subterminal pericentromeric regions of all Ac autosomes. DNA sequence analyses showed that all clones investigated are built up from a 14 bp repeat unit which is highly conserved. In situ hybridisation to meiotic pachytene nuclei revealed a distinct spatial arrangement of the Ac2 centromeric satellite.
