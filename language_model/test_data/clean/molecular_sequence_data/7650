beta-Hexosaminidase gene mutations were analyzed in two adult-onset Sandhoff disease Italian patients by PCR analysis of a common known mutation (delta 5') and by heteroduplex analysis of genomic and RT-PCR DNA fragments, covering the whole gene. The patients' genotypes were delta 5'/C1214%, and G890A/C1214T, respectively. As mutation C1214T (Pro405Leu) is also present in the other two late-onset cases so far described, we suggest that C1214T is a common mutation in this type of Sandhoff disease. Mutation G890A (Cys297Tyr) is a novel mutation which presumably causes altered processing of the pro beta chain.
