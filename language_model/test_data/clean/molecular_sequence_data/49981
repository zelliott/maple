During a large-scale screen of a human fetal brain cDNA library, a full-length cDNA encoding a novel Rap2 interacting protein was isolated and sequenced. The cDNA is 3397bp long and has a predicted open reading frame encoding a protein of 329 aa. The predicted protein shows high homology to mouse and human RPIP8, and has a RUN domain near its C-terminus. The gene was mapped to human chromosome 7q21-7q22 and has 9 exons and 8 introns. The expression pattern was also detected by cycle-limited reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
