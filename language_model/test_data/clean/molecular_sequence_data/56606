We investigated the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the associated random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique in the analysis of DNA and specific genes in plant cells at different stages of regeneration in in vitro cultures. We demonstrate that both procedures can be used to differentiate reproducibly between closely related species as well as to reveal levels of DNA polymorphism in regenerated plants. We also demonstrate that both procedures, using protocols that we have developed, are applicable at all tissue culture stages, from single isolated protoplasts to regenerated plants. Possible explanations for the variation levels detected in regenerated wheat plants are advanced.
