We report the cDNA cloning, partial genomic organization, and expression pattern of Stra10, a novel retinoic acid-inducible gene in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. Four murine cDNA isoforms have been isolated, which are likely to result from alternative splicing. The predicted protein sequences exhibit approximately 85% identity with the Pbx-related Meis1 homeobox gene products, which are involved in myeloid leukemia in BXH-2 mice, and one of the Stra10 isoforms corresponds to the recently published Meis2 sequence (Nakamura et al. [1996] Oncogene 13:2235-2242). The Meis2 homeodomain is identical to that of Meis1, and is most closely related to those of the Pbx/TGIF homeobox gene products. By in situ hybridization analysis, we show that the Meis2 gene displays spatially restricted expression patterns in the developing nervous system, limbs, face, and in various viscera. In adult mice, Meis2 is mainly expressed in the brain and female genital tract, with a different distribution of the alternative splice forms in these organs.
