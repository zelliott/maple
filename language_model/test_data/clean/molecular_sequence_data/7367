The protein NfxB, involved in conferring resistance to quinolones in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has a helix-turn-helix motif which is similar to that of other DNA-binding proteins. It appears to affect the membrane-associated energy-driven efflux of some antibiotics (H. Nikaido, Science 264:382-388, 1994). We constructed a plasmid that overproduced NfxB in Escherichia coli and purified the protein. Two species of NfxB (23 and 21 kDa), which are probably translated from different initiation codons, were isolated. Both proteins are also expressed in vivo in P. aeruginosa, with the 23-kDa NfxB being the major species. NfxB specifically binds upstream of the nfxB coding region as demonstrated by gel retardation and DNase I footprinting. Expression of the phi (nfxB'-lacZ+) (Hyb) gene was repressed in the presence of the nfxB gene product provided by a second compatible plasmid in E. coli. In the P. aeruginosa wild-type strain (PAO2142), NfxB was undetectable by immunoblotting; however, it was detected in the nfxB missense mutant (PK1013E). These results suggested that NfxB negatively autoregulates the expression of nfxB itself. Since the 54-kDa outer membrane protein (OprJ) (N. Masuda, E. Sakagawa, and S. Ohya, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 39:645-649, 1995) was overproduced in nfxB mutants, NfxB may also regulate the expression of membrane proteins that are involved in the drug efflux machinery of P. aeruginosa.
