For more effective screening of suspects, we combined two methods to individualize the biologic evidence from a crime scene: polymerase chain reaction (PCR) dot-blot hybridization for DNA typing of HLA Dq alpha; and PCR direct sequencing for DNA typing of HLA DQ beta. PCR-DQ alpha was typed by an AmpliType HLA DQ alpha kit from Cetus. PCR-DQ beta was typed by direct sequence using the dideoxy chain termination method. In 20 DNA samples, complete separation was demonstrated by these two polymorphic DNAs. This will be of considerable use in screening suspects in crime investigation work. The sensitivity of PCR is useful for trace evidence, and the rapid results of dot-blot hybridization and the precise results of direct sequencing have significant advantages.
