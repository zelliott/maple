The intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is necessary for ligand-induced signaling. To determine whether cellular protein tyrosine kinases are substrates for EGF-activated receptors, phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were isolated from EGF-treated cells and assayed for tyrosine kinase activity using peptide substrates. A tyrosine kinase activity that is distinct from the EGF receptor was adsorbed to monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody columns and eluted with phenyl phosphate. Near-maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of this kinase occurred within 1 min of cell stimulation with an ED50 for EGF of 2.5 nM. The kinase was deactivated by incubation with purified CD45 tyrosine phosphatase in vitro, but activity could be restored by incubation with purified EGF receptor and Mn2+ ATP. These results suggest a cascade of tyrosine kinase signaling analogous to well characterized serine/threonine kinase cascades.
