The bacteriophage Mu C gene encodes a 16.5 kDa site-specific DNA binding protein that is a transcriptional activator of the four "late" promoters, Pmom, Plys, PI and PP. A symmetrical consensus C recognition sequence, TTAT[N5-6]ATAA, containing an inverted tetrad repeat separated by a spacer of five to six G+C-rich nucleotides, has been proposed. To investigate this, we used oligonucleotide mutagenesis to introduce random substitutions within and flanking the proposed C-target region; each variant site was tested for C recognition by an in vivo functional transactivation assay. We observed that all single mutations, in either tetrad, reduced C activation. Although two out of ten substitutions within the spacer reduced activation, the spacer region does not appear to make specific contact with C. We also used in vitro chemical-protection and -interference to study C contacts with Pmom. The results indicate that C contacts Pmom DNA on only one face of the helix through interactions within two adjacent major grooves; this conclusion was supported by gel shift analyses using synthetic oligonucleotide duplexes containing I.C or other base-pair substitutions. Evidence is also presented that C-Pmom contacts are asymmetrical, and that they extend two nucleotides 3' to the promoter-proximal tetrad. We also show that C binding induces a deformation, possibly a bend, in Pmom DNA.
