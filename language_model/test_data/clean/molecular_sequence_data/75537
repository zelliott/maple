Plasmid pJMC21 contains Escherichia coli chromosomal DNA encoding Lon protease, HU-beta (HU-1), and an unidentified 67,000-dalton protein. A kanamycin resistance cassette was used in the construction of insertion and deletion mutations in hupB, the gene encoding HU-beta on plasmid pJMC21. The reconstructed plasmids were linearized and used to introduce hupB chromosomal mutations into JC7623 (recBC sbcBC). These mutations, as expected, mapped in the 9.8-min region of the E. coli chromosome by P1 transduction (16% linkage to proC+). Southern blot hybridization of chromosomal fragments verified that hupB+ was replaced by the mutant allele, with no indication of gene duplication. All the mutant strains had growth rates identical to that of wild-type E. coli, were resistant to UV irradiation and nitrofurantoin, and supported the in vivo transposition-replication of bacteriophage Mu, Mu lysogenization, Tn10 transposition from lambda 1098, and lambda replication-lysogenization. The only observable phenotypic variation was a reduced Mu plaque size on the hupB mutant strains; however, the yield of bacteriophage Mu in liquid lysates prepared from the mutant strains was indistinguishable from the yield for the wild type.
