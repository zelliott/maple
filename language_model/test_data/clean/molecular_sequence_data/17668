Molecular mimicry has been considered as a possible way for parasites to escape host immune responses. This work concerns the characterization of protein determinants shared by Schistosoma mansoni and its intermediate host Biomphalaria glabrata. Parasite (Sm39) and mollusc (Bg 39) cross-reactive proteins were identified and shown to induce in rabbit and mouse, antibodies specific for invertebrate determinants. Ultrastructural studies demonstrated that antibodies to Sm39 specifically bound to muscular structures of parasite and mollusc. Molecular cloning and sequencing indicated that Bg39 corresponded to a muscular isoform of tropomyosin. The mollusc sequence showed a 51-65% homology with seven different muscular tropomyosins from vertebrate and invertebrate species. The highest score of homology was observed with S. mansoni tropomyosin, suggesting that cross-reactive determinants could be specific for the trematode and its intermediate host. In miracidia, Sm39 epitopes were also shown to be contained in the vesicles present in epidermal ridges and cellular bodies. Such vesicles are involved in the formation of a protective tegument around sporocysts, suggesting a possible role of cross-reactive tropomyosins in miracidia and/or sporocyst-snail interactions.
