The aim of this study was to establish an identification method for the anginosus group within the genus Streptococcus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using a primer pair based on the group-specific sequences of penicillin-binding protein 2B (pbp2b) gene, a 275-bp fragment was amplified from each species in the group but no size-matched products were obtained in other streptococci. Further identification in the species or subspecies level was possible by a multiplex PCR with primers for the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of Streptococcus anginosus, the hyaluronate lyase genes both of Streptococcus intermedius and Streptococcus constellatus subsp. constellatus, and the intermedilysin (ily) gene of S. intermedius. In the case ofStreptococcus constellatus subsp. pharyngis, the amplified fragment from the S. intermedius-type hyaluronate lyase gene was obtained, while that from the ily gene was not. These results also indicate that two different hyaluronate lyase genes are distributed among the anginosus group.
