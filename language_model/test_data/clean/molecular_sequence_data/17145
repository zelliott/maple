The metal-induced assembly of a designed peptide-based rubredoxin model is described. The C16C19-GGY peptide has the sequence Ac-K(IEALEGK)(2)(CEACEGK)(IEALEGK)GGY-amide in which the presence of the Cys-X-X-Cys metal binding domain of rubredoxin was used to place cysteine residues at the hydrophobic "a" and "d" positions upon formation of a homodimeric alpha-helical coiled-coil. Circular dichroism spectroscopy shows that the apopeptide exists as a random coil and assembles into a coiled-coil in the presence of Cd(2+). Metal binding is monitored by the appearance of a new LMCT band at 238 nm. UV-Vis titrations and SDS-PAGE experiments are used to show that this designed metalloprotein exists as a metal-bridged coiled-coil dimer.
