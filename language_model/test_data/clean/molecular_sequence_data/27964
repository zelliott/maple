The gene structure of rat cathepsin H was determined. It comprises at least 12 exons of various lengths (32-433 bp) spanning in total more than 17.5 kbp. The gene structure does not correspond well to the functional unit of the proteinase. The region around the active site Cys residue, the most conserved region among cysteine proteinases, is split by an intron. This is a common characteristic among the gene structures of cysteine proteinases.
