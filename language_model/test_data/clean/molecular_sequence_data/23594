Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a potent mitogen for a variety of cell types. The 53-amino acid mature EGF protein is encoded by sequences in exons 20 and 21 of a gene spanning over 110 kb. In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of 7.5 kb of bovine genomic sequence homologous to exon 19 through 21 from EGF genes from other mammalian species. The cloned gene fragment had an unusual sequence composition in the form of an in-frame TGA codon in the coding sequence. The sequence was expressed at low levels in kidney tissue and the corresponding cDNA contained the TGA codon. The level of similarity between the bovine exonic sequence and the human, porcine, murine, feline, and canine corresponding sequences varied from 64% to 73%; however, when only sequences encoding the mature EGF protein were compared, the level of similarity between the bovine sequence and the sequence from these species was 59% to 66%. The sequence similarity of the deduced mature protein was lower (34% to 39%) than the sequence similarity of the deduced propeptide. Although the cloned sequences could originate from a bovine EGF pseudogene, the possibility exists that they originate from the functional EGF gene. An as yet unidentified mechanism to by-pass the stop codon would allow the synthesis of a functional EGF protein. Alternatively, the cloned sequence could originate from an EGF-like gene.
