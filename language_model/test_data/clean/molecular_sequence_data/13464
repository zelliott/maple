The genome of Lelystad virus (LV), a positive-strand RNA virus, is 15 kb in length and contains 8 open reading frames that encode putative viral proteins. Synthetic polypeptides of 15 to 17 amino acids were selected from the amino acid sequences of ORFs 2 to 7 and anti-peptide sera were raised in rabbits. Using these anti-peptide sera and porcine anti-LV serum, we identified three structural proteins and assigned their corresponding genes. Virions were found to contain a nucleocapsid protein of 15 kDa (N), an unglycosylated membrane protein of 18 kDa (M), and a glycosylated membrane protein of 25 kDa (E). The N protein is encoded by ORF7, the M protein is encoded by ORF6, and the E protein is encoded by ORF5.
