THY1 gene encodes a cell surface glycoprotein predominantly expressed in brain and peripheral nerves. Human THY1 gene region on chromosome 11q23 has been implicated in susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (Wong et al., 1991). Two primers derived from the sequences flanking the polymorphic MspI site in intron 2 of the human THY1 gene (Gatti et al., 1988) were selected for RCP to amplify a 566 bp fragment that spans the MspI polymorphism. Polymorphism was detected by MspI digestion of the PCR product.
