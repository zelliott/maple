1. The parvalbumin from the very fast striated muscle of the swimbladder of the toadfish (Opsanus tau) has been purified to homogeneity and its amino acid sequence has been completely elucidated. 2. The polypeptide chain is made of 109 residues, belongs to the beta group of parvalbumins and presents characteristics common to many other parvalbumins, i.e. a blocked N-terminal group, a cysteine and an arginine residue at positions 18 and 75 respectively and a quadruplet of acidic residues in the region 59-62.
