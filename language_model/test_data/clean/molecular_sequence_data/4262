Biopolymers from marine prokaryotes, both Bacteria and Archaea, offer a number of novel material properties and commercial opportunities. The characteristics of marine exopolysaccharides and melanins that enhance the survival ability of the organisms producing them can be exploited for a number of products ranging from emulsifiers to adhesives. In the prokaryotes, the polyhydroxyalkanoates form carbon-storage molecules, but their technological application is entirely different, serving as a potential base material for biodegradable plastics. Marine biopolymers are a significant and undeveloped biological resource.
