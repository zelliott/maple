A new Tetratrichomonas species was identified by molecular and phylogenetic approaches in the pleural fluid from a patient with encysted empyema leading to dyspnea. This observation raised the questions of the real prevalence of pulmonary trichomonosis in humans, the zoonotic potential of trichomonads, and the existence of human-host-adapted strains.
