Histatins are a group of histidine-rich polypeptides found in human parotid and submandibular gland secretions. These polypeptides are microbiocidal, possibly involved in maintaining the acquired enamel pellicle, and enhance the glycolytic activity of certain oral micro-organisms. Histatins 1, 3 and 5 are homologous proteins with 38, 32 and 24 amino acid residues, respectively; the cDNAs coding for histatins 1 and 3 have now been isolated and sequenced. The cDNA sequences were highly homologous but contained differences throughout their length, indicating that they arise from different genes that may be derived from a common ancestral gene. Northern blots were hybridized to a series of oligonucleotide probes, designed on the basis of histatin cDNA sequences, and these positively identified mRNAs for histatins 1 and 3. In addition, there was a third mRNA, which hybridized to several histatin oligonucleotide probes, suggesting that histatin 5 might be derived from a distinct mRNA and not by proteolytic processing of histatin 3. A Northern blot of macaque parotid gland total RNA also showed three histatin mRNAs, indicating that similar histatins exist in a non-human primate.
