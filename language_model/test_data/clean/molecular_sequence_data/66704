Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) exists as several isoforms that are found in various compartments in plant cells. The cytosolic and chloroplast APXs appear to play important roles in antioxidation metabolism in plant cells, yet the function of peroxisomal APX is not well studied. In this study, the localization of a putative peroxisomal membrane-bound ascorbate peroxidase, APX3 from Arabidopsis, was confirmed by studying the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-APX3 fusion protein in transgenic plants. GFP-APX3 was found to co-localize with a reporter protein that was targeted to peroxisomes by the peroxisomal targeting signal 1. The function of APX3 in Arabidopsis was investigated by analysing an APX3 knockout mutant under normal and several stress conditions. It was found that loss of function in APX3 does not affect Arabidopsis growth and development, suggesting that APX3 may not be an important antioxidant enzyme in Arabidopsis, at least under the conditions that were tested, or the function of APX3 could be compensated by other antioxidant enzymes in plant cells.
