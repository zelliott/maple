CS7.4 is the major cold-shock protein specifically expressed to a level as high as 13% of the total cellular protein within the first hour when Escherichia coli cell culture is shifted from 37 to 15 degrees C [Goldstein et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 283-287]. It consists of 70 amino acid residues with a very high content of aromatic residues. CS7.4 was overproduced and purified to homogeneity. Its secondary structure was analyzed by examining circular dichroism at both the far and near-UV regions; the results suggest that the protein is largely beta-sheet in conformation. The predominance of beta-sheet structure in the protein was confirmed by using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. A folded compact conformation was also verified by fluorescence emission spectroscopy. We evaluated Tm, delta H, and delta S from the thermal denaturation profile of the protein. Unusual spectral features observed in the far-UV region are attributed to the high content of aromatic residues. The protein is relatively small and contains no disulfide bonds. However, it is surprisingly stable to heat denaturation.
