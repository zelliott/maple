A polyphasic taxonomic analysis of all species of the genus Catellatospora with validly published names revealed morphological, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic heterogeneity. The type species, Catellatospora citrea, and Catellatospora methionotrophica, Catellatospora chokoriensis, Catellatospora coxensis and Catellatospora bangladeshensis had similar morphological and chemotaxonomical properties. Phylogenetic studies based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that Catellatospora koreensis and Catellatospora tsunoense were heterogeneous and were also heterogeneous with other species of the genus Catellatospora with respect to the menaquinone composition. DNA-DNA hybridization data showed that the type strains of Catellatospora koreensis and Catellatospora tsunoense were significantly different from each other and other recognized species in the genus Catellatospora. Therefore, on the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genomic differences, two new genera with the names Catelliglobosispora gen. nov. and Hamadaea gen. nov. are proposed to accommodate two species classified originally as belonging to the genus Catellatospora and Catelliglobosispora koreensis gen. nov., comb. nov. and Hamadaea tsunoensis gen. nov., comb. nov. are described. The type species of the genus Catelliglobosispora is Catelliglobosispora koreensis (type strain LM 042T=JCM 10976T=DSM 44566T=IMSNU 50729T) and the type species of the genus Hamadaea is Hamadaea tsunoensis (type strain 6420-P T=JCM 9105T=DSM 44101T=IMSNU 22005T).
