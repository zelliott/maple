In a previous investigation it was demonstrated that circulating antibodies to a 66-kDa corneal epithelial antigen (BCEA-A) are associated with peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK) in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). The aim of this study was to identify BCEA-A.

The 66-kDa antigen was purified from a bovine corneal epithelial protein extract, using DE52 ion exchange chromatography. Purified protein was used to raise rabbit polyclonal antibodies. These antibodies were used to screen a bovine corneal epithelial cDNA expression library. Positive clones were purified and sequenced. Clones were identified by DNA sequence homology searches of the GenBank DNA database.

A cDNA clone that demonstrated strong binding to both the rabbit polyclonal antibody and patient sera, showed 85% homology to rabbit cytokeratin 3 (K3). K3 is a basic cytokeratin specific to corneal epithelium. No bovine DNA sequence for K3 is available. However, bovine K3 is larger than rabbit K3, with a molecular weight of 66 kDa. Immunofluorescence using both patient sera and the rabbit antibody demonstrated a cytoplasmic binding pattern on human corneal epithelium.

This evidence suggests that the 66-kDa autoantigen (BCEA-A) associated with PUK in WG is cytokeratin 3, and this may form the basis of a diagnostic/prognostic test.
