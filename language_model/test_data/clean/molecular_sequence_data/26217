U6 is the most highly conserved of the five spliceosomal RNAs. It is associated with U4 by an extensive base-pairing interaction, which is disrupted immediately prior to the first nucleolytic step of splicing. It has been proposed that this event activates catalysis by unmasking U6. Using a combination of doped synthesis and site-directed mutagenesis to generate point mutations in U6, we have now identified 12 positions, in three domains, at which single nucleotide substitutions or deletions result in lethal or temperature-sensitive phenotypes. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that most of these mutants retain the ability to assemble into U4/U6 and U4/U5/U6 snRNPs. Notably, although mutations at three positions in U6 that base-pair with U4 are lethal, mutations in the complementary residues in U4 are fully viable. Furthermore, compensatory mutations in U4 that restore base-pairing fail to suppress the phenotypes of the U6 mutations. This demonstrates a function for U6 independent of its role in base-pairing. Remarkably, two of the three essential regions in U6 identified genetically correspond to intron insertion points in two yeast species. A temperature-sensitive mutation at one of these sites is defective in the second step of splicing in vitro.
