Monocytes/macrophages play a critical role in the pathogenesis of HIV infection, both as targets for virus replication and as sources of production of multifunctional cytokines. Endothelins, peptides with potent vasoconstricting activities originally isolated from endothelial cells, are also produced and secreted by macrophages in a manner similar to that of other cytokines. In an attempt to explore the potential role of endothelins in HIV-infection, we investigated the effect of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, glycoprotein 120, on monocytic endothelin-1 production. This glycoprotein has been identified as a potent stimulator of monokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, which have been implicated as potential mediators of HIV-encephalopathy. We found that glycoprotein 120, similar to LPS, stimulates the secretion of endothelin-1, as well as TNF-alpha, from macrophages in a concentration-dependent manner. Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we found that circulating monocytes in HIV-infected individuals show a distinct expression of the endothelin-1 gene that is not detectable in healthy controls, indicating chronic activation of this gene in HIV-infection. In addition, cerebral macrophages in patients with HIV-encephalopathy were strongly positive for endothelin. Thus, monocytic endothelins appear to be stimulated during HIV infection. Their potent vasoactive properties render them potential candidates for mediating alterations in the cerebral perfusion pattern associated with the AIDS dementia complex.
