The cactus protein is the Drosophila homologue of the mammalian I kappa B family of cytoplasmic anchor proteins. We have expressed in E. coli and purified a cactus fusion protein, CACT-Bgl. CACT-Bgl protein contains the six ankyrin repeat sequences which are necessary for specific binding to the Drosophila rel family transcription factor dorsal. We show that the purified CACT-Bgl protein can bind specifically to dorsal and, using circular dichroism spectroscopy, that the protein adopts a largely alpha-helical secondary structure. A further analysis of the ankyrin repeat domains of cactus, using an improved secondary structure prediction program indicates that the N-terminal of the repeat will form into a loop structure and the C-terminal section into an interrupted, amphipathic alpha-helix. On the basis of these findings we propose that the ankyrin repeats of cactus fold together into helical bundles interconnected by diverged loops.
