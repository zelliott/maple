One or more proteinaceous factors with insecticidal activities in the locust pathogen Serratia marcescens HR-3 culture filtrates were found to cause the death of grassland locusts. A novel insecticidal protein was purified to homogeneity. It was a monomer of 61 kDa. The purified protein showed a strong insecticidal effect with a median lethal dosage of 12.1 microg locust(-1) and contained a high level of protease activity (101 U ml(-1)). Insecticidal activity was significantly decreased when the protein was pretreated with ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid and 1-10-phenanthroline, and it was restored when the treated protein was incubated with Zn(2+). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of insecticidal protein showed sequence similarity with metalloprotease from S. marcescens SM6 and Serratia spp. E15. Our results suggested that the factor primarily responsible for insecticidal activity toward locusts was a zinc-dependent 61-kDa metalloprotease.
