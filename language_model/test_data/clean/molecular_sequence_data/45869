The structure of the C-terminal antifreeze-like (AFL) domain of human sialic acid synthase was determined by NMR spectroscopy. The structure comprises one alpha- and two single-turn 3(10)-helices and two beta-strands, and is similar to those of the type III antifreeze proteins. Evolutionary trace analyses of the type III antifreeze protein family suggested that the class-specific residues in the human and bacterial AFL domains are important for their substrate binding, while the class-specific residues of the fish antifreeze proteins are gathered on the ice-binding surface.
