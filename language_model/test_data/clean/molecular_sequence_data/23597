The Escherichia coli stress protein YciF was overexpressed and purified by three chromatographic steps. Crystals were obtained using ammonium sulfate as a precipitant. The YciF protein crystals diffracted beyond 2.25 A resolution using a rotating-anode X-ray source. The lattice type is rhombohedral, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 80.0, c = 131.03 A, alpha = beta = 90.0, gamma = 120.0 degrees. The crystal belongs to space group R32.
