The organization of the gene encoding tomato prosystemin, a 200 amino acid protein precursor of the 18 amino acid polypeptide inducer of proteinase inhibitor synthesis in tomato and potato plants, is reported. The prosystemin sequence reveals that the gene, which is composed of five homologous pairs of exons plus a non-homologous exon at the C-terminus containing the systemin sequence, has evolved by several gene duplication-elongation events from a much smaller ancestral gene. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence homologies among the exons suggest that a small ancestral gene was duplicated to form at least two tandem repeats, followed by subsequent duplication-elongation events that resulted in five tandemly repeated nucleotide sequences and three duplicated amino acid sequence elements. Since the systemin nucleotide or amino acid sequence was not duplicated, it was either not part of the gene duplication-elongation events or its coding region evolved separately and may even have been added to the tandemly repeated part of the gene at a later time.
