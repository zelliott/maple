To clone and analyze the conserved protein gene in Streptococcus sanguinis(S.s) ATCC10556.

Southern blotting hybridization, molecular cloning techniques and dot blotting hybridization were employed to obtain the target clone which harbored the specific DNA fragment. The nucleotide sequence of the target clone was determined. The gene and its product were analyzed by Genework software and bioinformatics techniques.

The conserved protein gene in Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC10556 was cloned for the first time and named as Streptococcus sanguinis conserved protein gene (Sscp gene). The Genbank accession number for Sscp gene is AY032739. The conserved protein gene in S.s ATCC10556 (named sscp163) was a transmembrane protein and contained two AAA domains.

sscp163 protein might take part in the cell division in Streptococcus sanguinis; its function is similar to that of FtsK in E.coli.
