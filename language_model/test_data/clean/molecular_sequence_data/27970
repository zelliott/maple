We have recently described the sequence of the Zn2+-binding domain (43 amino acid residues) of a newly detected Zn2+-binding protein which reversibly inactivates phosphofructokinase-1 in a Zn2+-dependent manner [(1986) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 5895-5900; (1988) Eur. J. Biochem. 177, 561-568]. Here, we describe the primary sequence of this protein based on a full-length cDNA. A sequence comparison reveals the identity of the Zn2+-binding protein with a protein called parathymosin-alpha.
