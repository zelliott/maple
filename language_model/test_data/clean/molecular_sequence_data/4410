The nucleotide sequence of 17.3 kbp downstream of addA (98 degrees) on the Bacillus subtilis chromosome was determined. Twenty putative ORFs were identified. Three of them coincided with known B. subtilis genes, addA, sbcD and wprA. The product of four other ORFs showed similarity to SbcC of Clostridium perfringens, CotH of B. subtilis, 2-hydroxyhepta-2,4-diene-1,7-diodate isomerase of Methanococcus jannaschi and a putative ORF of Pseudomonas syringae. In addition, a sequence of 7.6 kbp downstream of citG (189 degrees) was analysed. Among 10 putative ORFs identified, two coincided with known genes, citG and mrgA, whilst three showed homology with X86780, a sensory protein kinase of Streptomyces hygroscopicus, an alkaline phosphatase regulatory protein and a hypothetical protease, YyxA, of B. subtilis.
