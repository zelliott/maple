A novel NADP(+)-dependent L-1-amino-2-propanol dehydrogenase was isolated from Rhodococcus erythropolis MAK154, and characterized.

The enzyme was inducibly produced on cultivation with aminoalcohols such as 1-amino-2-propanol, 1-amino-2-butanol and 2-aminocyclohexanol. The enzyme catalyses the NADP(+)-dependent oxidation of several aminoalcohols, and also the NADPH-dependent asymmetric reduction of an aminoketone compound to a double chiral aminoalcohol, d-pseudoephedrine. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that the enzyme might belong to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family.

NADP(+)-dependent L-1-amino-2-propanol dehydrogenase isolated from R. erythropolis MAK154 reversibly catalysed dehydrogenation of aminoalcohols, and exhibited a unique sterospecifity for the reduction reaction.

The enzyme is a promising catalyst for the production of double chiral compound, d-pseudoephedrine, from prochiral substrate.
