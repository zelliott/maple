We have cloned and sequenced cDNAs coding for the R1 and R2 proteins of ribonucleotide reductase from zebrafish (Danio rerio). This ribonucleotide reductase shows high amino acid sequence identity to those of other vertebrates. The R1 cDNA has a coding sequence of 2382 bp, yielding a 794 amino acid protein, and the R2 cDNA has a coding sequence of 1158 bp, yielding a 386 amino acid protein. The zebrafish R1 shows 94% similarity and R2 shows 91% similarity to the human R1 and R2, respectively. The similarity extends to intron positions, of which the equivalent of mouse R2 intron 3 has been studied.
