The putative receptor-binding region of human transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha) has been shown to be contributed by two fragments: an A-chain (residue 12-18) and a 17-residue carboxyl fragment (residue 34-50) that includes a disulfide-containing C-loop (residue 34-43). An approach to the synthesis of two-chain analogs containing an intermolecular disulfide linked A-chain and the 17-residue carboxyl fragment (C-fragment) possessing receptor-binding activity is described. The synthesis was achieved by the solid-phase method using the Boc-benzyl protecting group strategy. The single Cys of the A-chain was activated as a mixed disulfide with 2-thiopyridine to form the intermolecular disulfide bond with Cys41 or Cys46 of the C-fragment on the resin support. Prior to this reaction, the acetamido (Acm) protecting group of Cys41 or Cys46 was removed by Hg(OAc)2 on the resin support. The peptide and side chain protecting groups including the S-methylbenzyl moiety of the Cys34 and Cys43 were concomitantly cleaved by high HF. The intramolecular disulfide with two unprotected Cys was formed in the presence of an intermolecular disulfide. This intramolecular disulfide bond formation was usually not feasible under the traditionally-held scheme at basic pH since disulfide interchange would occur faster than intramolecular oxidation. To prevent the disulfide interchange, a new method was devised. The intramolecular disulfide bond oxidation was mediated by dimethylsulfoxide at an acidic pH, at which the disulfide interchange reaction was suppressed. The desired product was obtained with a 60-70% yield.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
