In order to investigate the mechanisms by which oestrogenic hormones influence the vascular system, we have studied their metabolism and the functioning of oestrogen receptors in bovine aortic endothelial cells from primo-secondary cultures, a widely studied model of vascular pathophysiology. We have demonstrated the enzymic activity of oestradiol-17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 17-ketoreductase and aromatase in these cells. Immunocytochemical analyses, using two different monoclonal antibodies that recognize epitopes in the A/B domain of the oestrogen receptor, showed that this molecule has a predominantly cytoplasmic localization even after the addition of oestrogen to the culture medium. We showed that the hormone-receptor complexes were functional by demonstrating their transactivating ability in transfection experiments using the luciferase gene reporter and an oestrogen-responsive element transcriptional enhancer, although the amplitude of the response was in the range of only 140-150%: this was not a consequence of the presence of a specific limiting factor, but instead might be related to the peculiar subcellular localization of the oestrogen receptor.
