Whilst DNA spends much of its time in the double-stranded form, frequently in storage, wrapped around histones and packaged as chromatin, it can also form other complex structures, which may play a role in natural regulation and gene control. These alternative structures therefore also present an interesting novel series of targets for artificial intervention, and so may lead to novel therapeutics. In this review, I describe the current understanding of how genomic and bioinformatics studies may be used to understand the roles that one such structure, the four-stranded guanine-rich G-quadruplex, may play in the genome, and outline how these may be considered as targets for intervention. I will also describe recent work looking at RNA G-quadruplexes, and the biological roles they may play.
