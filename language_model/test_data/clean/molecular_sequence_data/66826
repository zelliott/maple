A novel allele HLA-B*2730 and the haplotype HLA-A*03-B*2730-Cw*02-DRB1*16-DRB5 have been found in a Slovene patient and his mother. The exon 2 sequence is identical to that of HLA-B*2702, and the exon 3 sequence is identical to that of HLA-B*2719. A possible mechanism for the generation of B*2730 is a gene conversion event.
