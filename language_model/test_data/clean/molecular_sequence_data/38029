VanD-type Enterococcus faecium BM4416 was constitutively resistant to vancomycin and to teicoplanin by synthesis of peptidoglycan precursors ending in D-alanyl-D-lactate. Like E. faecium BM4339, the only VanD-type strain described so far, BM4416 produced an impaired D-alanine:D-alanine ligase. Unlike for BM4339, which had a 5-bp insertion in ddl, inactivation of the gene in BM4416 was due to insertion of IS19.
