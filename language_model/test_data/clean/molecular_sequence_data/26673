Three new and one known species of the genus Aporcelaimellus with simple uterus and typical caudal region, mainly col-lected in natural areas of southeastern Iberian Peninsula, are studied, including descriptions, measurements, line illustrations and LM pictures. Aporcelaimellus baeticus sp. n. is characterized by a body length of 1.96-2.95 mm, lip region offset by constriction and 17-20 μm broad, odontostyle 17-22 μm long, neck 510-635 μm long, pharyngeal expansion 250-335 μm long, a dorsal cell mass at level of anterior end of intestine, uterus 60-150 μm long or 0.9-1.7 times the corresponding body diameter, vulva transverse (V = 48-54), tail convex conoid with broadly rounded terminus (30-46 μm, c = 47-80, c' = 0.7-1.1), spicules 99-103 μm long, and 18-21 irregularly spaced ventromedian supplements which lack hiatus. Aporcelaimellus brevicaudatus sp. n. is characterized by a body length of 1.54-2.14 mm long, lip region offset by a more or less distinct constriction and 14-16 μm broad, odontostyle 13-15 μm long, neck 512 μm long, pharyngeal expansion 255 μm long, uterus 39-57 μm long or 0.9-1.0 times the corresponding body diameter, V = 50-55, tail short and rounded to hemispherical (24-27 μm, c = 66-82, c' = 0.6-0.7) with inner core hardly reaching the middle of tail length, and male unknown. Aporcelaimellus rotundus sp. n. is characterized by its body 2.01-2.58 mm long, lip region offset by constriction and 19-20 μm broad, odontostyle 22-23 μm long, neck 455-579 μm long, pharyngeal expansion 226-316 μm long, a dis-tinct dorsal cell mass present at cardia level, uterus 28-74 μm long or 0.5-0.9 times the corresponding body diameter, V = 47-52, female tail short and conoid to rounded (27-33 μm, c = 64-90, c' = 0.7-0.9), and males unknown. New data, including SEM pictures, sequences and taxonomic comments, are provided for A. waenga.
