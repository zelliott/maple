Plant seed development and germination are under strict temporal and spatial regulation, and transcription factors play important roles in this regulation. In the present study we identified an EST expressed specifically in the developing soybean seeds. The full length of the gene was obtained through further RACE analysis and the gene was named GmSGR. Sequence analysis revealed that this gene belonged to the AP2/ERF transcription factor family. Its AP2 domain had the highest similarity with that of the A-3 member AtABI4 of DREB subgroup in the AP2/ERF family in Arabidopsis. GmSGR did not exhibit transcriptional activation activity in the yeast assay system. GmSGR was overexpressed in Arabidopsis and the germination rates of the transgenic seeds were significantly higher than that of the wild type seeds under higher concentrations of ABA and glucose respectively. However, the germination rates of the transgenic seeds were lower than that of control under salt stress. The expression of AtEm6 and AtRD29B was higher in the seedlings of the transgenic plants than that in the wild-type seedlings. These results suggest that GmSGR may confer reduced ABA sensitivity and enhanced salt sensitivity to the transgenic seeds through regulating the expression of AtEm6 and AtRD29B genes.
