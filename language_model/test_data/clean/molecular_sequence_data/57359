The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase II subunit gene RPB7 was isolated and sequenced. RPB7 is a single copy gene whose sequence predicts a 19,000 Dalton protein of 171 amino acids. RPB7 is known to dissociate from RNA polymerase II as an RPB4/RPB7 subcomplex in vitro. RPB7 also appears to interact with RNA polymerase II in a manner dependent upon RPB4, since RNA polymerase II purified from cells lacking RPB4 also lacks RPB7. Previous results have demonstrated that deletion of the RPB4 results in slow growth and cold- and temperature-sensitivity. In contrast, deletion of the RPB7 gene revealed that it is essential for cell growth and viability. Loss of both the RPB4 and the RPB7 genes causes lethality. These results suggest that RPB7 contributes to the function of RNA polymerase II in the absence of RPB4 either in a manner independent of its association with the enzyme or by directly binding to the enzyme in a manner independent of its association with RPB4.
