To more fully understand the extent of genetic diversity of PRRSV in China, we analyzed the Nsp2 and ORF5 gene sequences of 35 representative PRRSV isolates from 2008 to 2012. Sequence analysis revealed that the Nsp2 and ORF5 genes have undergone genetic variation. Furthermore, the isolate FJLYDX04 contains five insertions at positions 599 to 603 and is the first isolate from China reported to have an insertion in Nsp2. Our results suggest that the highly pathogenic PRRSV has become the dominant strain in China and that Chinese PRRSV has undergone rapid evolution and can circumvent immune responses induced by currently used vaccines.
