In order to obtain cDNA clones coding for CYP4 proteins in frog Xenopus laevis, degenerate primers were designed utilizing the conserved sequences of known CYP4s and were used to amplify partial cDNA fragments from liver mRNA. Five new CYP genes were identified. Three of these genes, XL-1, -2 and -3, were assigned to the CYP4T subfamily found previously in fish and amphibians. The other two genes, XL-4 and XL-5, were quite similar to CYP4F and CYP4V subfamilies, respectively. Subsequently, two full-length cDNA clones corresponding to XL-4 and XL-5 were isolated and characterized. The resultant cDNAs, designated as CYP4F42 and CYP4V4, had open reading frames encoding proteins of 528 and 520 residues, respectively. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the expression of CYP4F42 was limited to the liver, kidney, intestine and brain. In contrast, CYP4V4 mRNA was expressed ubiquitously.
