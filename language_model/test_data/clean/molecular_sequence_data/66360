A potassium channel peptide toxin (AETX K) was isolated from the sea anemone Anemonia erythraea by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50, reverse-phase HPLC on TSKgel ODS-120T and anion-exchange HPLC on Mono Q. AETX K inhibited the binding of (125)I-alpha-dendrotoxin to rat synaptosomal membranes, although much less potently than alpha-dendrotoxin. Based on the determined N-terminal amino acid sequence, the nucleotide sequence of the full-length cDNA (609bp) encoding AETX K was elucidated by a combination of degenerate RT-PCR, 3'RACE and 5'RACE. The precursor protein of AETX K is composed of a signal peptide (22 residues), a propart (27 residues) ended with a pair of basic residues (Lys-Arg) and a mature peptide (34 residues). AETX K is the sixth member of the type 1 potassium channel toxins from sea anemones, showing especially high sequence identities with HmK from Heteractis magnifica and ShK from Stichodactyla helianthus. It has six Cys residues at the same position as the known type 1 toxins. In addition, the dyad comprising Lys and Tyr, which is considered to be essential for the binding of the known type 1 toxins to potassium channels, is also conserved in AETX K.
