Gaucher disease is the most frequent lysosomal storage disease and the most prevalent Jewish genetic disease. About 30 identified missense mutations are causal to the defective activity of acid beta-glucosidase in this disease. cDNAs were characterized from a moderately affected 9-year-old Ashkenazi Jewish Gaucher disease type 1 patient whose 80-year-old, enzyme-deficient, 1226G (Asn370----Ser [N370S]) homozygous grandfather was nearly asymptomatic. Sequence analyses revealed four populations of cDNAs with either the 1226G mutation, an exact exon 2 (delta EX2) deletion, a deletion of exon 2 and the first 115 bp of exon 3 (delta EX2-3), or a completely normal sequence. About 50% of the cDNAs were the delta EX2, the delta EX2-3, and the normal cDNAs, in a ratio of 6:3:1. Specific amplification and characterization of exon 2 and 5' and 3' intronic flanking sequences from the structural gene demonstrated clones with either the normal sequence or with a G+1----A+1 transition at the exon 2/intron 2 boundary. This mutation destroyed the splice donor consensus site (U1 binding site) for mRNA processing. This transition also was present at the corresponding exon/intron boundary of the highly homologous pseudogene. This new mutation, termed "IVS2 G+1----A+1," is the first splicing mutation described in Gaucher disease and accounted for about 3.4% of the Gaucher disease alleles in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The occurrence of this "pseudogene"-type mutation in the structural gene indicates the role of acid beta-glucosidase pseudogene and structural gene rearrangements in the pathogenesis of this disease.
