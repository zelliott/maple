Members of the rab subfamily of GTPases have been implicated as important components in vesicle trafficking in the eukaryotes. Individual rab proteins have a remarkable degree of specific subcellular localization. As a first approach to the study of these proteins in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei we have undertaken a survey of the rab subfamily using a strategy based on degenerate polymerase chain reaction utilizing the miniexon and the highly conserved WDTAGQE box which comprises part of the GTP-binding site. A number of T. brucei partial cDNAs were obtained from procyclic stage cDNA, and seven of these clones (designated rtb 1, 3-7, 9) were clearly members of the rab family. Northern analysis of poly(A)-selected RNA indicates that rtb1, 3, 4, and 7 are constitutively expressed at low levels in both life-stages of T. brucei. By Southern analysis of trypanosome genomic DNA and specific PCR from an isolated genomic clone, we show that two of the genes, RTB1 and RTB7, are adjacent or at least closely linked in the T. brucei genome, while the other five are dispersed. These data provide important molecular reagents for dissecting the unusual secretory pathway in this organism.
