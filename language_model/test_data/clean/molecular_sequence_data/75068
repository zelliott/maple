Previous studies from this laboratory have provided evidence that the duplication of the IgG2a heavy chain constant region gene (C gamma 2a) in the murine myeloma cell line MPC-11 occurred via unequal sister chromatid exchange. We now report the determination of the DNA sequences of the germ-line regions in which this exchange has occurred. The two donor sequences have long regions of virtual identity. Furthermore, both chromatids contain stretches of T-C and T-G dinucleotides; the latter has the potential to form Z-DNA. Localization of the actual breakpoints via genomic Southern blot analysis suggests a novel mechanism for the recombination and strongly implicates the simple sequence in the process.
