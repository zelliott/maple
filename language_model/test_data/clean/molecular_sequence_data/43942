We have cloned the RAG-1 promoter region and have determined that almost all detectable promoter activity resides within a 208-bp fragment. Sequence analysis of this promoter region has identified potential recognition motifs for a number of lymphocyte-restricted and ubiquitous transcription factors. Subsequent assays have revealed that the NF-Y transcription factor interacts with a CCAAT site within the RAG-1 promoter and appears to play an important role in the positive transcriptional regulation of this gene.
