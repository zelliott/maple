A total of 125 strains collected in Azerbaijan between 1999 and 2002 from HIV seropositives were genetically classified. Of 84 strains classified using HMA, 91.6% were subtype A, 1.2% subtype B, and 7.1% untypeable. Of 41 strains analyzed using partial pol gene sequences, 90.2% were subtype A, 7.3% subtype B, and 2.4% CRF03_AB. Most sequenced A strains clustered with those circulating in countries of the former Soviet Union (FSU). Two of three sequenced B strains were from individuals who traveled to FSU clustering tightly with B strains from Nikolayev, Ukraine. CRF03_AB, characteristic of the 1996 epidemic in Kaliningrad, Russia, was sequenced from an individual who lived in Russia from 1995 until 2001. The HIV epidemic in Azerbaijan is concentrated in IDU and is closely connected to other such epidemics to the east based on genetics. Of the 41 sequenced strains, 95% were close genetic relatives of HIV strains in IDU networks in the FSU.
