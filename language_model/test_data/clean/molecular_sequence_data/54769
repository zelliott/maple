Dengue viruses infect cells by attaching to a surface receptor which remains unknown. The putative receptor molecules of dengue virus type 2 on the surface of mosquito (AP-61) and mammalian (LLC-MK2) cell lines were investigated. The immunochemical detection and structural analysis of carbohydrates demonstrated that the neutral glycosphingolipids, L-3 (GlcNAcβ1-3Manβ1-4Glcβ1-1'Cer) in AP-61 cells, and nLc(4) Cer (Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1'Cer) in LLC-MK2 cells were recognized by the virus. These findings strongly suggest that neutral glycosphingolipids share the key determinant for virus binding and that the β-GlcNAc residue may play an important role in dengue virus binding to the host cell surface.
