A full-length cDNA clone encoding a cytosolic isoform of serine acetyltransferase (SATase; EC 2.3.1.30) was isolated by screening a soybean seedling cDNA library with a (32)P-labeled expressed sequence tag. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the isolated cDNA revealed a single open-reading frame of 858 base pairs encoding a 30-kDa polypeptide. The deduced amino acid sequence of soybean SATase revealed significant homology with other plant SATases. Analysis of genomic DNA by Southern blotting indicated that SATase is encoded by a small gene family. The authenticity of the isolated SATase cDNA was confirmed by the expression of the cDNA in an Escherichia coli cysteine-auxotrophic mutant resulting in the growth of the mutant in minimal medium without cysteine. Expression of soybean SATase in E. coli resulted in the production of a 34-kDa protein that was subsequently purified by nickel-affinity column chromatography. The purified protein exhibited SATase activity, indicating that the E. coli-expressed protein is a functionally active SATase. The recombinant soybean SATase was inhibited by l-cysteine, the end product of the cysteine biosynthetic pathway. Antibodies raised against the recombinant soybean SATase cross-reacted with a 34-kDa protein from Arabidopsis leaves, but failed to detect any proteins from soybean leaves and seeds. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that SATase mRNA was expressed at low levels during soybean seed development. In comparison to Arabidopsis leaves, the SATase activity was several-fold lower in soybean leaves and seeds, suggesting that SATase is a low-abundance enzyme.
