Zinc-finger proteins play important roles in various cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In this study, we identified a gene encoding a zinc finger protein named ZNF449, which was isolated from human testis cDNA library and mapped to Xq26.3 by searching the UCSC genomic database. The ZNF449 cDNA consists of 4035 nucleotides and has a 518-amino acids open reading frame. The predicted protein contains a leucine-rich region (LER or SCAN domain) at the N-terminus. At the C-terminus of the protein, there are 7 C(2)H(2) (Cys2-His2) zinc-finger motifs. The expression pattern of ZNF449 showed that it was ubiquitously expressed in 18 human adult tissues. ZNF449 protein was located in the nucleus when overexpressed in cultured cells. These results indicate that ZNF449 is a member of the zinc-finger family and it may function as a transcription factor.
