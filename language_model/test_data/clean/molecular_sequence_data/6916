The leucocyte specific transcript - 1 (LST1) represents the human homolog of the mouse B144 transcript, encoded within the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) region of the human major histocompatibility complex class III interval. The gene is localized about 4 kilobases upstream of the lymphotoxin beta gene. It spans a polymorphic genomic region encompassing the microsatellites TNFd and TNFe in intron 3 and a polymorphic Pvu II restriction site 260 base pairs downstream of the polyadenylation signal. Isolation of a full-length cDNA clone revealed that LST1 codes for IFN-gamma-inducible 800 nt transcripts, which are present in lymphoid tissues, T cells, macrophages, and histiocyte cell lines. The cDNA contains three long open reading frames (ORF) with the most likely ORF encoding a transmembrane protein. Its close linkage to the TNF genes and pattern of expression point toward a possible role for LST1 in the immune response.
