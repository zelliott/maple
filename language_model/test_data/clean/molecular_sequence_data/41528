Helical bundles are found in all the known structures of peanut allergens. The peptide fragments, which survive gastrointestinal digestion of the allergens and are absorbed intact, are hypothesized to reassociate and form stable helical bundles in the circulation, which could elicit a specific IgE response resulting in peanut allergy. The hypothesis is supported by the finding of a diminished allergenicity of an isoform of the peanut allergen, Ara h 3, which has a major deletion. A very probable consequence of this deletion is the reduced tendency to form a stable helix bundle. The discovery of structurally disrupted isoforms of the other peanut allergens and the breeding of plants that contain only those isoforms could lead to the elimination of peanut allergy.
