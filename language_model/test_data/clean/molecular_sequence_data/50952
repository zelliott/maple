Bioactive microbial metabolites are attracting increasing attention as useful agents for medicine, veterinary medicine, agriculture, and as unique biochemical tools. A review of the current trends in the discovery of new metabolites shows that the number of active compounds with non-antibiotic type of activity has increased, resulting in an expansion of the variety of bioactivity of microbial metabolites. Factors that contribute to the increased rate of discovery include: development of new methods for activity measurement, exploitation of novel groups of microorganisms as sources of active compounds, new directions for chemical modification, and incorporation of newer knowledge of biotechnology into screening systems. To exemplify this, typical screening methods, and chemical and biological properties of several bioactive compounds obtained by these methods are discussed.
