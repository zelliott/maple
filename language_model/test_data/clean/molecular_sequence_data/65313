A dark yellow-coloured bacterium, JS13-8(T), was isolated from a soil sample from Jeju Island, Republic of Korea. The cells were aerobic, Gram-negative, non-motile, short rods (0.5-0.7 x 0.8-1.4 microm). Growth occurred at 15-35 degrees C (optimally at 30 degrees C), at pH 5.0-8.0 (optimally at pH 6.0-7.0) and at 0-1 % NaCl (w/v). Flexirubin pigment was produced. A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain JS13-8(T) was closely related to Niabella aurantiaca KACC 11698(T) (95.0 % sequence similarity). The major respiratory quinone system was MK-7 and the predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(15 : 1) G, iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH and summed feature 3. The DNA G+C content was 45 mol%. On the basis of the phylogenetic, physiological and chemotaxonomic data, strain JS13-8(T) represents a novel species of the genus Niabella, for which the name Niabella soli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is strain JS13-8(T) (=KACC 12604(T)=DSM 19437(T)).
