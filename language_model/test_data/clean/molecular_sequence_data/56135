We have characterized a Borrelia burgdorferi clone (CA-11 2A) that does not synthesize the major outer surface proteins, OspA and OspB. While the osp operon is intact and capable of expression, no mRNA transcript is detectable in this clone. These results suggest that osp operon expression in the B. burgdorferi clone can be regulated at the level of transcription.
