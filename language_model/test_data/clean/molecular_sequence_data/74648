Trivalent arsenicals have high affinity for thiols (such as free cysteines) in proteins. We describe here the use of this property to develop a collision-induced dissociation (CID) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) technique for the identification of reactive cysteines in proteins. A trivalent arsenic species, dimethylarsinous acid (DMA (III)), with a residue mass (103.9607) and mass defect distinct from the normal 20 amino acids, was used to selectively label reactive cysteine residues in proteins. The CID fragment ions of the arsenic-labeled sequences shifted away from the more abundant normal fragments that would otherwise overlap with the ions of interest. Along with the internal and immonium ions, the arsenic-labeled fragment ions served as MS/MS signatures for identification of the binding sites and for assessment of the relative reactivity of individual cysteine residues in a protein. Using this method, we have identified two highly reactive binding sites in rat hemoglobin (Hb): Cys-13alpha and Cys-125beta. Cys-13alpha was bound to DMA (III) in the Hb of rats fed with arsenic, and this binding was responsible for arsenic accumulation in rat blood, while Cys-125beta was found to bind to glutathione in rat blood. This study revealed the relative reactivity of the cysteines in rat Hb in the following decreasing order: Cys-13alpha >> Cys-111alpha > Cys-104alpha and Cys-13alpha >> Cys-125beta > Cys-93beta. Arsenic-labeling is easy and fast for identification of active binding sites without enzymatic digestion and acid hydrolysis, and useful for characterization and identification of metal binding sites in other proteins.
