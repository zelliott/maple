We have isolated a cDNA that encodes the human regulatory myosin light chain isoform predominant in adult atrial muscle. The cDNA contains an open reading frame of 175 amino acids and encodes a hydrophilic protein of a largely helical structure with two potential phosphorylation sites. The protein is different from any other regulatory myosin light chain so far described and is the product of a previously uncharacterized single copy gene. An isoform-specific probe was used to analyze the expression of this isoform in adult muscle and in cardiac and skeletal muscle development in vivo and in vitro. Parallel analysis of the corresponding human alkali myosin light chain (predominant in adult atrium) showed that both isoforms are expressed in early heart development, in both atrium and ventricle. Although the atrial alkali light chain is expressed throughout embryonic striated muscle development, the regulatory myosin light chain was not detected in skeletal myogenesis in vivo or in vitro. Thus the atrial isoforms are not universally or exclusively "paired" and can be independently regulated. We propose that the manner in which these particular isoforms fulfill the functional requirements of the muscle at different developmental times may have direct impact on their regulation.
