ENOD12 is one of the first nodulin genes expressed upon inoculation with Rhizobium and also purified Nod factors are able to induce ENOD12 expression. The ENOD12 gene family in pea (Pisum sativum) has two members. A cDNA clone representing PsENOD12A [26] and a PsENOD12B genomic clone [7] have been previously described. The isolation and characterization of a PsENOD12A genomic clone is presented in this paper. By using a Vicia hirsuta-Agrobacterium rhizogenes transformation system it is shown that both genes have a similar expression pattern in transgenic V. hirsuta root nodules. Promoter analyses of both PsENOD12 promoters showed that the 200 bp immediately upstream of the transcription start are sufficient to direct nodule-specific and Nod factor-induced gene expression.
