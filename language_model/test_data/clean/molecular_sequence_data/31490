Ten strains of Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacteria were isolated from the burial mound soil collected before the dismantling and samples collected during the dismantling work on the Takamatsuzuka Tumulus in Asuka village, Nara Prefecture, Japan in 2007. On the basis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of the isolates, they were accommodated in the genus Gluconacetobacter (class Alphaproteobacteria) and can be separated into four groups within the cluster containing the genus Gluconacetobacter. One of the groups demonstrated a phylogenetic position identical to that of Gluconacetobacter asukensis, which was isolated from small holes on plaster walls of the stone chamber interior of Kitora Tumulus in Asuka village, Nara Prefecture, Japan. The remaining three groups consisted of novel lineages within the genus Gluconacetobacter. A total of four isolates were selected from each group and carefully identified using a polyphasic approach. The isolates were characterized on the basis of their possessing Q-10 as the major ubiquinone system and C18 : 1ω7c (58.5-65.2 %) as the predominant fatty acid. A DNA-DNA hybridization test was used to determine that the three lineages represented novel species, for which the names Gluconacetobacter tumulisoli sp. nov., Gluconacetobacter takamatsuzukensis sp. nov. and Gluconacetobacter aggeris sp. nov. are proposed. The type strains are T611xx-1-4a(T) ( = JCM 19097(T) = NCIMB 14861(T)), T61213-20-1a(T) ( = JCM 19094(T) = NCIMB 14859(T)) and T6203-4-1a(T) ( = JCM 19092(T) = NCIMB 14860(T)), respectively.
