Integrin adhesion receptors modulate cell functions, including cell proliferation and survival. The beta 1C integrin, an alternatively spliced form of beta 1A, containing a unique cytoplasmic domain sequence, inhibits cell growth in vitro. In vivo, the expression of beta 1C correlates with a benign, nonproliferative phenotype in epithelial cells. The studies discussed in this article indicate that modulation of cell proliferation, in normal or pathological conditions, might be achieved by the regulated expression of variant integrin subunits.
