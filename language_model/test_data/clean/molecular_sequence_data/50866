We have found the enrichment in rat liver tritosomes of an enzyme which hydrolyzed the synthetic substrate, Ala-Ala-Phe-pNA, under acidic conditions. The enzyme cleaved the substrate in an exopeptidolytic manner, releasing Ala-Ala-Phe. The enzyme was solubilized from tritosomes and partially purified. Beside Ala-Ala-Phe-pNA, the obtained enzyme was shown to cleave angiotensin III (Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and des-1Tyr-dynorphin A 1-8 (Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu-Arg-Arg-Ile) with tripeptide units. The results obtained suggested that the enzyme preferred an aromatic amino acid at the third position of a substrate peptide.
