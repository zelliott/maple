The novel allele, HLA-A*1115, was identified in an 'Educational Scheme' sample (ED03/03 - from a north-western European Caucasoid blood donor) distributed by the UK National External Quality Assessment Schemes for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics. ED03/03 was typed by serology, the polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific primers and sequence-based typing. A*1115 is most similar to A*110101 with a single mismatch (G to C) at constant position 565, leading to a conservative amino acid change from valine (GTG) to leucine (CTG) at codon 165 in the alpha(2) domain. This substitution has not been reported for any other HLA class I allele so far. The HLA-A*1115-bearing haplotype was B*350101; Cw*040101; DRB1*140101; DRB3*020201; DQA1*010401; DQB1*0503; DPA1*0103/07; DPB1*030101. Extensive serological typing indicated that this allele essentially encodes a 'normal' HLA-A11 specificity.
