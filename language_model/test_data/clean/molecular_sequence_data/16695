A targeted genomics approach was used to construct a cDNA array of potential pathogen-regulated genes for investigating host-pathogen interactions in pine trees (Pinus species). This array, containing a nonredundant set of 311 cDNAs, was assembled by combining smaller sets of cDNAs generated by differential display or suppression subtraction hybridization using a variety of pathogen treatments and elicitors. The array was probed to identify host genes regulated by Fusarium circinatum, a necrotrophic fungus that incited pitch canker disease on pine stems. A set of 29 cDNAs were induced during the disease state. Notably, cDNAs on the array that were derived from experiments with fusiform rust, incited by Cronartium quercuum f. sp. fusiforme (a biotrophic fungus) were unregulated by Fusarium. the results imply distinct genetic responses in pine to diseases incited by necrotrophs and biotrophs. This cDNA collection expands the genomics toolkit for understanding interactions between conifers and their microbial associates in forest ecosystems.
