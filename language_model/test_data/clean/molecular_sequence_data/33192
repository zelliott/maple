A novel actinomycete, strain S187(T), was isolated from a marine sediment sample collected from Xinghai Bay, Dalian, China. Growth occurred on ISP medium 2 containing 0-9 % NaCl and at pH 6.0-9.0 and 10-45 degrees C. The cell wall of strain S187(T) contained the isomer ll-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H(6)) (40.8 %), MK-9(H(8)) (38.2 %) and MK-9(H(2)) (8.8 %). The major fatty acids were iso-C(16 : 0) (29.6 %), anteiso-C(15 : 0) (14.0 %) and anteiso-C(17 : 0) (11.6 %). Cells contained phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol mannosides and one unknown phospholipid. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 72.01 mol%. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the isolate had similarities of 98.1 and 97.5 % with those of Streptomyces flavofuscus NRRL B-8036(T) (=DSM 41426(T)) and Streptomyces albiaxialis DSM 41799(T), respectively, showing that the novel strain should be assigned to the genus Streptomyces. DNA-DNA hybridizations with the two above-mentioned Streptomyces species showed 31.4 and 46.9 % relatedness, respectively. Moreover, the three strains differed in some physiological and biochemical properties. Thus, on the basis of phenotypic and genotypic analyses, it is proposed that strain S187(T) represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces xinghaiensis sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is S187(T) (=NRRL B-24674(T)=CCTCC AA 208049(T)=KCTC 19546(T)).
