In a sperm-transmitted mtDNA of Mytilus galloprovincialis we found an insertion that is not present in the typical genome and whose origin can be explained by a sequence of three events: a tandem duplication, a nonhomologous recombination, and a deletion. Unless such events are extremely rare in this species, the identical gene arrangement of the two gender-specific genomes should imply strong selection for same gene order and size.
