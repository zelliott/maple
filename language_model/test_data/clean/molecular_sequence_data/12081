We have identified a gene encoding the human ribosomal protein (r-protein) S7. The S7 gene contains seven exons and six introns spanning about 6 kb. Organization of the gene is similar to that of Xenopus laevis S8, the only homologous intron-containing gene isolated so far. An mRNA transcribed from this gene has an open reading frame (ORF) of 582 nucleotides (nt), which encodes a protein of 194 amino acids (22.1 kDa). The transcription start point (tsp) was mapped by a primer extension assay to a C residue within a pyrimidine-rich tract. Human S7 (hS7) is identical to rat S7 (rS7) and exhibits significant similarity with the X. laevis, insect and plant homologs. We have used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to localize S7 to chromosome 2p25.
