Recent characterizations of mucins at the molecular level indicate that at least eight mucin genes are expressed by epithelia of mucosal surfaces. The purpose of this study was to determine whether these cloned mucins, designated MUC1, MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, MUC5AC, MUC5B, MUC6, and MUC7, are expressed by epithelia of the female reproductive tract. Northern blot analysis, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry were performed using RNA and tissue from surgically removed human reproductive tract specimens including endocervix, ectocervix, vagina, endometrium, and fallopian tube. Complementary DNA to the tandem repeat regions of MUCs 1, 2, 3, 5AC, 5B, and 6; oligonucleotides to the tandem repeat regions of MUCs 4, 6, and 7; and antibodies that recognize unique mucin tandem repeats were used. The data demonstrate that the endocervical epithelium expresses five mucin genes: MUCs 1, 4, 5AC, 5B, and 6. The ectocervical and vaginal epithelia express MUCs 1 and 4, although vaginal expression of MUC4 appears patchy. Endometrial epithelium expresses MUC1 and low amounts of MUC6. MUC6 immunoreactivity was detected only is scattered endometrial glands located in the basalis region in specimens from pre- and postmenopausal women. The only mucin detected in the fallopian tube was MUC1. These data indicate that the endocervical epithelium expresses multiple mucin genes and that the stratified epithelia of the ectocervix and vagina also produce mucins that may function in reproductive processes and protection of the reproductive tract tissues.
