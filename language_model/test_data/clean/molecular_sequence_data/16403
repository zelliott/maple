Epoxide hydrolase (EH) activity was recently described in yeasts and highly selective hydrolysis of epoxides was observed during whole cell biotransformations. To expand the available molecular data regarding yeast EHs, the EH encoding gene from Rhodosporidium paludigenum (CBS 6565) was isolated, cloned and sequenced. The genomic EH sequence revealed a 1600 bp sequence interrupted by six introns. cDNA sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1236 bp with a deduced polypeptide length of 411 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed a relative high degree of sequence homology compared to the amino acid sequence of the EH from Rhodotorula glutinis.
