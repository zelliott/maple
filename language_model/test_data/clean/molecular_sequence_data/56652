The carboxyl-terminal tripeptide of alpha-MSH(1-13), Lys-Pro-Val, antagonizes anorexia induced by interleukin-1 beta (IL-1). The present studies were undertaken to determine if the Lys-Pro dipeptide portion of this tripeptide likewise antagonizes anorexia induced by ICV administration of 0.5 pmol IL-1 in rats previously deprived of food. This dose of Lys-Pro did significantly attenuate the IL-1-induced anorexia, but only for 1 h after infusion. Simultaneous administration of a larger dose (5.0 pmol) of Lys-Pro reversed the IL-1-induced anorexia during both the 0-1-h and 2-4-h periods. In addition, both 0.5 and 5.0 pmol of the D-substitute tripeptide, Lys-D-Pro-Thr (LDPT), similarly attenuated the IL-1-induced anorexia. The ICV administration of 5.0 pmol Lys-Pro also did not have any significant effects on food consumption. These results indicate that the dipeptide Lys-Pro may have a short-term antagonistic action against the anorexia induced by IL-1, and it is possible that this action may be partially mediated by the blockade of IL-1 on its own receptor.
