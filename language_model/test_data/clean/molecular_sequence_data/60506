Two high Mr protein bands (440 and 420 kDa) in sheep brain microsomal membranes were labeled with the photoaffinity ATP analog, O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl adenosine 5'-triphosphate (Bz2ATP). The 420 kDa band is labeled by [alpha-32P]-Bz2ATP with about 1000-fold higher affinity than the 440 kDa band. The heavily labeled 420 kDa band is identified as dynein heavy chain based on its partial amino acid sequence, and cross-reactivity with anti-dynein antibodies. The 440 kDa protein is immunologically identified as the type-2 RyR. Bz2ATP binding is obtained in the absence of divalent cations. Bz2ATP and ATP increased the binding of ryanodine to its receptor up to 3-fold, and increased the binding affinity up to 6-fold. Other nucleotides stimulate ryanodine binding with decreasing effectiveness: Bz2ATP > ATP > ADP > AMP > AMP-PNP > GTP > cAMP. With respect to nucleotide specificity, this binding site is similar to the skeletal muscle RyR (type 1). However, the brain RyR may have additional one or more sites with lower affinity with inhibitory effect on ryanodine binding. These results suggest that the major RyR isoform in sheep brain corresponds to the type-2 isoform, and that modulation of ryanodine binding by ATP involves its binding to the RyR protein. The association of dynein with brain microsomal membranes may reflect a linkage of RyR to the cytoskeleton.
