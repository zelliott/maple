Hamy3, a novel type myosin heavy chain from sunflower is the smallest myosin described so far, with only 900 amino acid residues. One interesting finding in Hamy3 is the glycine to glutamine alteration at residue 741, which corresponds to chicken skeletal muscle myosin glycine 699 (G699). G699 is found in 125 out of 129 myosin sequences and is interpreted in terms of its role as a pivot point for motion in the myosin "lever arm hypothesis". Changes in this crucial part of myosin might indicate a role that is different from the generation of intracellular motility.
