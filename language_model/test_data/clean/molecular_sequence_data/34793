Pisolithus is cosmopolitan in both tropical and temperate regions and forms ectomycorrhizal associations with a wide range of woody plants. Pisolithus indicus, a new species associated with Vateria indica (Dipterocarpaceae) is reported in this study from a dipterocarp native forest in the Western Ghats in India, using both morphological and molecular tools. The length of ITS1 and ITS2 regions of the present collection differed with other sequences of Pisolithus available in the databases. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this species did not show significant homology with existing Pisolithus sequences reported previously and formed a separate branch linking with another Pisolithus isolate from dipterocarps. Molecular and morphological evidence showed that P. indicus is a new species associated with dipterocarps in India.
