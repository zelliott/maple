Anaphylactic shock was induced in rabbits by injecting bovine serum albumin (BSA) as an antigen. Measurements of the enzyme activities in the fibrinolytic system confirmed that a rapid and strong increase of plasminogen activator (PA) was induced during anaphylaxis. The euglobulin fibrinolytic activity (EFA) as estimated by the plasminogen-rich fibrin plate method rose significantly, peaking at 15 min after the BSA injection (when the arterial pressure was minimum). However, EFA was not detected by the plasminogen-poor fibrin plate method. The tissue-type PA (t-PA) activity using the natural substrate plasminogen increased significantly with a peak at 15 min. The amidolytic activity also simultaneously increased significantly using the t-PA substrate, H-D-Ile-Pro-Arg-pNA. The plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) activity remained at baseline levels until 30 min, but rose fourfold at 90 min. The main plasma fibrinolytic enzyme which increased in anaphylaxis was proved by zymography to be t-PA with a molecular weight (MW) of 69,000.
