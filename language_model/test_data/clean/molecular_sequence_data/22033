The taxonomic position of three novel, marine, heterotrophic, aerobic, pigmented, gliding bacteria, isolated from the green alga Ulva fenestrata in the Sea of Japan, was determined. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the strains belong to the genus Arenibacter. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization experiments supported by phenotypic and chemotaxonomic data showed that the isolates represent a novel species of the genus Arenibacter, for which the name Arenibacter palladensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KMM 3961T (= LMG 21972T = CIP 108849T).
