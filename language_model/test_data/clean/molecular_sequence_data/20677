Lupus-associated anti-dsDNA Abs plays an important role in the triggering and development of human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The method of targeting B cells that produce anti-dsDNA Abs has become a promising way to treat autoantibody-mediated SLE in the immunotherapy field. In this study, we reported a novel pseudovirus, which consisted of the peptide DWEYSVWLSN and a plasmid encoding the Diphtheriatoxin A fragment (DTA). Our data demonstrated that vaccination of lupus-prone (BWF1) mice with the pseudovirus could eliminate anti-dsDNA antibody-producing B cells, reduce serum anti-dsDNA antibody levels, impede the development of proteinuria and improve survival. These findings suggested that this novel pseudovirus ablated autoreactive B cells and might represent a promising therapeutic strategy for autoantibody-mediated diseases.
