Two new anti-allergic compounds, torososide B and torosachrysone 8-O-6"-malonyl gentiobioside were isolated from the seeds of Cassia torosa Cav., and their structures were established as physcion 8-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl- (1-->3)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside and torosachrysone 8-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->6)-6-malonyl beta-D-glucopyranoside on the basis of spectral and chemical evidence. Torososide B and torosachrysone 8-O-6"-malonyl gentiobioside were found to inhibit the release of leucotrienes from rat peritoneal mast cells induced by calcium ionophore A 23187.
