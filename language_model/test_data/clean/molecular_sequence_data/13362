The capability of rat pituitary cells to express receptors for pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) and VIP was evaluated by binding studies and measurement of adenylate cyclase activity on whole gland preparations and by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (TR-PCR) using specific primers on preparations from isolated cell populations enriched in PRL- and GH-producing cells. Data obtained on whole gland preparations indicated that selective PACAP receptors (PACAP Type I) predominated. The mRNA coding for PACAP Type I and for the non-selective PACAP receptors Type II VIP2 (but not VIP1) were identified. The mRNA coding for four different spliced variants of the PACAP Type I receptor were detected. In PRL producing cells, three variants and the VIP2 mRNA were detected, whereas in GH-producing cells the mRNA coding for the variant having a 28-amino acid insert (termed HOP) in the third intracellular loop was the only present.
