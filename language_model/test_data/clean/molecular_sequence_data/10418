A genomic clone of RbcS was isolated from an alfalfa (Medicago sativa L. cv. Apica) genomic library and characterized. Although this clone has structural features similar to a functional gene, the second exon is interrupted by a stop codon and thus is not fully translatable in the plant. Sequence analysis of the 5' and 3' noncoding regions of RbcSK-1A showed a high sequence homology to the flanking sequences of the RbcS-3A gene from pea. The regions of homology contain many important cis-regulatory elements shown to be essential for regulation of the RbcS-3A gene in pea. The promoter of this alfalfa rubisco clone was used in a translational fusion to test its ability to control the expression of the GUS reporter gene in an homologous nuclear background. High levels of GUS enzyme activity were recorded. These strong levels are comparable to some exceptionally high levels produced in other studies following the use of photosynthesis gene promoters in fusions with the GUS reporter gene.
