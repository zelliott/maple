Among the many calcium-binding proteins in the nervous system, parvalbumin, calbindin-D28K and calretinin are particularly striking in their abundance and in the specificity of their distribution. They can be found in different subsets of neurons in many brain regions. Although it is not yet known whether they play a 'triggering' role like calmodulin, or merely act as buffers to modulate cytosolic calcium transients, they are valuable markers of neuronal subpopulations for anatomical and developmental studies.
