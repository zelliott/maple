The value of the mass balance strategy is illustrated in the sequence determination of S. aureus V8 protease. Capillary electrophoresis, electrospray mass spectrometry, and high performance tandem mass spectrometry are used as well as proteolysis and Edman degradation. The carboxy terminus is found to contain 17 irregularly repeating units of the triptych motifs NNP and DNP, which provide a challenge to any strategy involving mapping, sequencing, and overlapping of hydrolytic peptides.
