The chloroperoxidase gene from the filamentous fungus Caldariomyces fumago has been isolated within a 16.3-kilobase insert in the vector lambda EMBL3. The DNA sequence of the gene and its immediate flanking regions has been determined, and the start site of transcription has been mapped by primer extension.
