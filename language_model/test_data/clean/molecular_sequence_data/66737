Reduced levels of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in the medial amygdala (MeA) and bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BST) have been hypothesized to play a significant role in the expression of male behaviors associated with monogamy. Therefore, the regulation of ERalpha could be a critical factor in determining male behavior and the evolution of monogamy. Central expression of ERalpha immunoreactivity was compared in hybrid offspring from crosses between two phenotypically distinct populations of prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). Illinois voles (IL) are socially monogamous and display low levels of ERalpha, while Kansas voles (KN) display some characteristics associated with polygyny and have higher levels of ERalpha. In offspring from hybrid crosses, the pattern of ERalpha expression was dependent upon parentage; the two types of hybrid crosses did not produce the same ERalpha pattern in the offspring. In the BST and MeA, hybrid males expressed ERalpha patterns consistent with those of males from their mother's population, while hybrid females had ERalpha patterns typical of females belonging to their father's population. The parental-specific patterns of ERalpha expression are suggestive of genomic imprinting, therefore, the vole ERalpha (Esr1) gene was cloned and sequenced, and examined for allele-specific expression. Results from this study indicate that while maternal factors may play a major role the expression of ERalpha in their male offspring, genomic imprinting is unlikely to be involved, suggesting another mechanism is responsible.
