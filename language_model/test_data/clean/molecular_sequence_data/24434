Previously we showed that the expression of a Clostridium perfringens phospholipase C gene (plc) is activated by promoter upstream phased A-tracts in a low temperature-dependent manner. In this paper we characterize the interaction between the alpha subunit of C. perfringens RNA polymerase and the phased A-tracts. Hydroxyl radical footprinting and fluorescence polarization assaying revealed that the alpha subunit binds to the minor grooves of the phased A-tracts through its C-terminal domain with increased affinity at low temperature. The result provides a molecular mechanism underlying the activation of the plc promoter by the phased A-tracts.
