The amino-acid sequence of a putative tryptophan monooxygenase (PTMO) from Ralstonia solanacearum is homologous with that of proenzyme (proPAO) of l-Phe oxidase (deaminating and decarboxylating) (PAO) from Pseudomonas sp. P-501 in their overall sequences. PTMO was expressed in E. coli and purified, but had no catalytic activity to oxidize l-Phe. By treating PTMO with various proteases, the Pronase-treated PTMO (PTMOp) showed a relatively high activity to oxidize l-Phe, l-Trp, l-Tyr and l-Met. Studies on the stoichiometry of the reaction showed that l-Phe and l-Tyr were mostly oxygenated, that l-Met was mostly oxidized, and both oxygenation and oxidation of l-Trp was observed. Initial velocity patterns were a ping-pong type with l-Phe and l-Tyr, and a sequential type with l-Trp and l-Met as substrate. The spectrum of enzymes with sufficient amounts of these substrates to reduce the enzyme showed a long wavelength species (purple complex) with l-Phe, but not with l-Tyr, l-Trp and l-Met. These results lead to the conclusion that PTMO and PTMOp belong to proPAO and PAO, respectively.
