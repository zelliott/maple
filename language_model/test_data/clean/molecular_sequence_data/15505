An alkaliphilic actinobacterium, designated strain CAAS 252(T), was isolated from the black liquor treatment system of a cotton pulp mill in Wuhan, China. Cells of strain CAAS 252(T) were Gram-positive, non-motile, non-endospore-forming, short rod-shaped, and grew optimally at 42 degrees C and pH 9-10 in the presence of 3 % (w/v) NaCl. Strain CAAS 252(T) contained MK-7, MK-8 and MK-9 as the major menaquinones and anteiso-C(17 : 0), anteiso-C(15 : 0) and C(16 : 0) as the predominant cellular fatty acids and had a peptidoglycan type of A4alpha, Lys-Gly-d-Asp. The DNA G+C content was 60.2 mol%. Based on analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences (94.7-96.8 % similarity), DNA-DNA hybridization (<70 % relatedness) and chemotaxonomic characteristics, strain CAAS 252(T) belonged to the genus Nesterenkonia, but differed from all recognized species. Therefore, it is proposed that strain CAAS 252(T) represents a novel species of the genus Nesterenkonia, for which the name Nesterenkonia alba sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CAAS 252(T) (=CCTCC AB 207011(T)=DSM 19423(T)).
