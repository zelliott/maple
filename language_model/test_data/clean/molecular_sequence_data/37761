Four proteins of bacteriophage MB78 having apparent molecular weights as 35, 14, 21 and 16 kDa are expressed from 3.9 kb SalI-HindIII fragment located almost in the middle of the phage genome. Analysis of the sequence supported by some experimental evidences suggest that these four proteins are expressed from polycistronic message without any intercistronic gap. Stop and start codons of consecutive ORFs overlap and rare initiation codons are used. Computer analysis of the sequence suggests the presence of two more open reading frames within the ORFs of 35 and 16 kDa proteins but in the opposite orientation, i.e. in the complementary strand.
