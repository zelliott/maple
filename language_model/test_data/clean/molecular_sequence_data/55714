Tyr-W-MIF-1 (Tyr-Pro-Trp-Gly-NH2) was recently isolated from human brain cortex. We have now isolated it from bovine hypothalami by solid phase extraction and several consecutive rpHPLC steps monitored by an RIA originally developed for the endogenous brain peptide Tyr-MIF-1 (Tyr-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2). Determination of the sequence of the purified material and comparison of its chromatographic behavior with synthetic Tyr-W-MIF-1 confirmed the structure. The synthetic peptide and the isolated material showed almost identical binding to mu opiate receptors.
