Although the PHLIPs are able to enhance gastrointestinal contractility to a very modest extent, the actual physiological significance of the PHLIPs is not completely understood at the present time. Should the high Mr PHLIM be the precursor molecule(s), the PHLIPs may represent partial enzymatic hydrolysis products of the amino-terminal region of the precursor(s). In this regard, it is interesting to note that immunohistochemical staining of rat duodenum indicates the presence of PHY antiserum cross-reacting material in Brunner's glands, which appear to be involved in secretion of mucin. The amphibian peptide, bombesin, has also been detected in amphibian skin mucous glands by immunochemistry; other investigators have indicated that cerulein, an amphibian analog of the carboxy-terminal region of cholecystokinin, is discharged along with mucin from cutaneous glands in Xenopus after the injection of adrenalin.
