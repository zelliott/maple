During homologous recombination in Escherichia coli the RuvA, B and C proteins interact specifically with the Holliday junction formed by the action of RecA to promote the strand-exchange reaction. RuvA, a homotetrameric protein of molecular weight 88 kDa, has been overexpressed in E. coli, purified and co-crystallized with a synthetic Holliday junction substrate made from four 18-base deoxyoligonucleotides. Crystals were grown using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method with sodium acetate as the precipitant. The crystals diffract to a resolution of 6 A and belong to the monoclinic system, space group C2, with cell parameters a = 148, b = 148, c = 106 A and beta = 123 degrees. The X-ray analysis of these crystals should reveal the structure of the Holliday junction and its mode of binding to RuvA, providing new insights into the molecular mechanism of genetic recombination.
