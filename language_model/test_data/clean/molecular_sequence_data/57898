The second exon of the DRB1 gene encoding for the first domain of the HLA-DR beta 1-chain was sequenced in 16 patients (10 DR4/DR1 positive, 6 DR4/DR1 negative) with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We could confirm the strong association of susceptibility to RA with functionally equivalent conformations on otherwise distinct MHC molecules. At least one HLA-DR allele in all of the analysed DR4 or DR1 positive patients showed such an epitope with a minimal variability limited to residue 71. However, in HLA-DR4 and -DR1 negative patients such a similar epitope could not be detected.
