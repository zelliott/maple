Linear viruses with double-stranded DNA genomes are classified into two families, Lipothrixviridae and Rudiviridae. The members of these two families, all of which infect hyperhermophilic members of the domain Archaea, differ significantly in the complexity of their virions as well as in their mechanisms of genome replication. However, recent structural and genomic studies have revealed a robust evolutionary link between members of the two families. To acknowledge this relationship we propose to unify the two families into the new taxonomic order "Ligamenvirales".
