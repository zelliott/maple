Stargazin is an accessory protein of AMPA receptors that enhances surface expression and also affects the biophysical properties of the receptor. AMPA receptor domains necessary for either of these two processes have not yet been identified. Here, we used confocal imaging and electrophysiology of heterologously expressed, fluorophore-tagged GluR1, GluR2, and stargazin to study surface expression and desensitization kinetics. Stargazin-mediated trafficking was sensitive to the nature of the AMPA receptor cytoplasmic domain. The insertion of YFP after residue 15 of the truncated cytoplasmic tail of GluR1i perturbed stargazin-mediated trafficking of the receptor but not its modulation of desensitization kinetics. This construct also failed to permit fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with stargazin in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas FRET between fluorophore-tagged stargazin and non-truncated AMPA receptors demonstrated a specific interaction between these proteins, both in the ER and the plasma membrane. Rather than encoding a specific binding site, the fluorophore-tagged C terminus may restrict access to one or more ER retention sites. Although perturbations of the C terminus impeded stargazin-mediated trafficking to the plasma membrane, the effects of stargazin on the biophysical properties of AMPA receptors (i.e. modulation of desensitization) remained intact. These data provide strong evidence that the AMPA receptor domains required for stargazin modulation of gating and trafficking are separable.
