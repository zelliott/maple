The E. coli low molecular mass penicillin-binding proteins (PBP's) are penicillin sensitive, enzymes involved in the terminal stages of peptidoglycan biosynthesesis. These PBP's are believed to anchor to the periplasmic face of the inner membrane via C-terminal amphiphilic alpha-helices but to date the only support for this hypothesis has been obtained from theoretical analysis. In this paper, the conformational behaviour of synthetic peptides corresponding to these C-terminal anchoring domains was studied as a function of solvent, pH, sodium dodecyl sulphate micelles and phospholipid (DOPC, DOPG) vesicles using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The CD data showed that in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol or sodium dodecylsulphate, all three peptides have the capacity to form an alpha-helical conformation but in aqueous solution or in the presence of phospholipid vesicles only those peptides corresponding to the PBP5 and PBP6 C-termini were observed to do so. A pH dependent loss of alpha-helical conformation in the peptide corresponding to the PBP5 C-terminus was found to correlate with the susceptibility of PBP5 to membrane extraction. This correlation would agree with the hypothesis that an alpha-helical conformation is required for membrane interaction of the PBP5 C-terminal region.
