The ggt encoding gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) from Bacillus subtilis (natto) was cloned and sequenced. The DNA sequence contains a single open reading frame of 1761 bp that might be translated to a protein of 587 amino acid residues, and indicates that B. subtilis (natto) GGT is synthesized as prepro-GGT and processed later into large and small subunits. The putative catabolite responsive element (CRE) was located upstream of the ggt coding region.
