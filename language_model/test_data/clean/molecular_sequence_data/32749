The human EVI5 gene was originally isolated through its involvement with a constitutional chromosome translocation in a patient with stage 4S neuroblastoma. Recently, it has been shown that EVI5 is a centrosomal protein in interphase cells, which relocalizes to the midbody during late phases of mitosis. Disruption of its function leads to incomplete cell division and the formation of multinucleate cells. The EVI5 protein contains a TBC (TRE2/BUB/CDC16 homology) motif located in the N-terminal region. Proteins containing a TBC domain have been shown in some cases to act as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and function through the interaction with Rab-like small G proteins. Despite the identification of over 50 TBC-containing proteins, and over 70 Rab-like proteins, only three combinations have been shown to have Rab/GAP activity to date. In this study, using linear ion trap mass spectroscopy, we have demonstrated that EVI5 exists in a protein complex with Rab11. Further, using a specific Rab-binding assay, we have shown that EVI5 preferentially interacts with the guanosine triphosphate-bound form of Rab11, and in a GAP activity assay, we have confirmed that EVI5 functions as a GAP for the Rab11 GTPase.
