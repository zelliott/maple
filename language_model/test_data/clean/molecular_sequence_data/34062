Electron microscopy (EM), real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and conventional PCR were used to identify viruses associated with infection in 2 transplantation patients. An autologous haematopoietic stem cell, liver and renal transplant recipient was found to be positive for simian virus 40 (SV40). Dual BK virus and SV40 infection was found in a heart and renal transplantation patient. SV40 infection can occur in immunocompromised patients.
