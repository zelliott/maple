dUTPase is an essential enzyme involved with nucleotide metabolism and replication. We report here the X-ray structure of Trypanosoma cruzi dUTPase in its native conformation and as a complex with dUDP. These reveal a novel protein fold that displays no structural similarities to previously described dUTPases. The molecular unit is a dimer with two active sites. Nucleotide binding promotes extensive structural rearrangements, secondary structure remodeling, and rigid body displacements of 20 A or more, which effectively bury the substrate within the enzyme core for the purpose of hydrolysis. The molecular complex is a trapped enzyme-substrate arrangement which clearly demonstrates structure-induced specificity and catalytic potential. This enzyme is a novel dUTPase and therefore a potential drug target in the treatment of Chagas' disease.
