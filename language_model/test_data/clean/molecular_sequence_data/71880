The production of type 8 capsular polysaccharide (CP8) in Staphylococcus aureus is regulated in response to a variety of environmental factors. The cap8 genes required for the CP8 production in strain Becker are transcribed as a single large transcript by a primary promoter located within a 0.45-kb region upstream of the first gene of the cap8 gene cluster. In this study, we analyzed the primary cap8 promoter region in detail. We determined the transcription initiation site of the primary transcript by primer extension and identified the potential promoter sequences. We found several inverted and direct repeats upstream of the promoter. Deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis showed that a 10-bp inverted repeat of one of the repeats was required for promoter activity. We showed that the distance but not the specific sequences between the inverted repeat and the promoter was critical to the promoter activity. However, insertion of a DNA sequence with two or four helix turns in this intervening region had a slight effect on promoter activity. To demonstrate the biological significance of the 10-bp inverted repeat, we constructed a strain with a mutation in the repeat in the S. aureus Becker chromosome and showed that the repeat affected CP8 production mostly at the transcriptional level. By gel mobility shift assay, we demonstrated that strain Becker produced at least one protein capable of specific binding to the 10-bp inverted repeat, indicating that the repeat serves as a positive regulatory protein binding site. In addition, reporter gene fusion analysis showed that the cap8 promoter activity was influenced by various growth media and affected most by yeast extract. Our results suggest that yeast extract may exert its profound inhibitory effect on cap8 gene expression through the 10-bp inverted repeat element.
