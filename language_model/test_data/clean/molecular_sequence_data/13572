The N-terminal domain of histone H4 has been implicated in various nuclear functions, including gene silencing and activation and replication-linked chromatin assembly. Many of these have been identified by using h4 mutants in the yeast S. cerevisiae. In a recent paper, Megee et al. use this approach to show that mutants in which all four N-terminal H4 lysines are substituted with glutamines accumulate increased levels of DNA damage. A single lysine, but not an arginine, anywhere in the N-terminal domain suppresses this phenotype. It is suggested that histone H4 plays a role in maintaining genome integrity through the cell cycle, possibly by a mechanism involving lysine acetylation.
