Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced RNA degradation has been used recently as an antivirus agent to inhibit specific virus replication. This report shows that 21 nt duplexes of siRNA of the influenza virus M gene can cause specific inhibition of influenza virus matrix (M1) protein expression in transfected 293T cells. Furthermore, it is shown that a lentivirus vector can be used to effectively deliver M gene siRNAs into Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and can cause specific inhibition of M1 protein expression and influenza virus replication. Therefore, lentivirus-mediated delivery of siRNA and gene silencing can be used in studying the specific functions of virus genes in replication and may have a potential therapeutic application.
