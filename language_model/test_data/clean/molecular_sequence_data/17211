The recent completion of a first draft of the human genome has allowed "in silico" genome browsing to become routine. Such computer-based research is now a useful adjunct to experiments based at the bench, and is accelerating gene discovery and the analysis and understanding of genes in their genomic contexts. This review summarises recent findings on genes encoding proteins of the troponin complex. We describe the organization of the three pairs of genes which encode isoforms of troponins I and T, and discuss how this relates to their evolution and regulation. Detailed analysis of the chromosomal context of the cardiac troponin I and slow skeletal troponin T genes reveals a region of densely packed differentially expressed genes, including new genes identified by automatic genome annotation. This information is discussed within the context of detailed analysis of the best-studied gene in this region, cardiac troponin I. In this way, we illustrate the uses to which a combination of conventional bench experiments and "in silico" analyses may be put in understanding the relationship between structure and function within the genome.
