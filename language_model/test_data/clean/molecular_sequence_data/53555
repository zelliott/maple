It is recognised that gel-separated proteins can experience a frequent modification provoked by the interaction of unpolymerized acrylamide monomers with the thiol group of cysteine to form a beta-cysteinyl-S-propionamide adduct. Other groups which have been implicated in this reaction include the hydroxyl group of tyrosine, the straightepsilon-amino group of lysine, and the free N-terminus. In a series of recent publications it has been demonstrated that at pH approximately 9.5 and in the presence of cysteine, none of these groups experienced measurable interaction with acrylamide monomers. To emphasise this conclusion we have used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation with a reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer to examine a number of cysteine-free proteins incubated for various intervals with 30 mM acrylamide monomers at pH 9.5. These high resolution data suggest that, for short incubation times (>/=1 hour) and in the absence of cysteine, the straightepsilon-NH(2) group of lysine is the likely adduction site of acrylamide. Longer incubation times (>/=24 hours) with acrylamide monomers rendered the role of Cys as the favourite alkylation site less evident.
