Sorbin is a 153-amino acid peptide that was initially discovered in the porcine duodenum. We have reported previously that this peptide regulates intestinal electrolyte transport and have described accumulation sites in the rat digestive tract. In the present study, we investigated the anatomical distribution and the site(s) of sorbin production in the porcine digestive tract using immunocytochemistry. The use of polyclonal antisera, which by cross-reaction studies were shown to be specific for different regions of the molecule, revealed a diversified distribution. Sorbin predominated in endocrine cells preferentially localized in the pyloric glands, duodenal crypts of Lieberk√ºhn, and pancreatic islets; in the gastrointestinal tract, sorbin coexisted with Met-enkephalin or with substance P in a small fraction of serotonin-storing [enterochromaffin (ED)] cells, i.e. EC2 cells and EC1 cells, respectively; in the pancreas, sorbin coexisted with insulin in the beta-cells, also considered as serotonin-storing cells in the pig, and with EC cells in the exocrine pancreas. An enteric neuronal system containing sorbin was also reported. Our results demonstrate that sorbin is a component of the serotonin-storing cell type in the porcine gastrointestinal tract and pancreas, and suggest potential directions to investigate the functions of this new regulatory peptide.
