In the present study, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from HIV+ subjects as well as cardiac transplant recipients, and the presence of A- and B-type Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was determined using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Of the HIV+ patients studied, 24% were found to be infected with A-type EBV, 27% with B-type EBV, and 39% with both A and B virus types. Analysis of PBMCs from cardiac transplant recipients revealed that 39% were infected with A-type EBV, 33% with B-type EBV, and 28% with both EBV types. These results demonstrate a higher prevalence of infection with B-type EBV in HIV+ patients, than had been found previously by an analysis of spontaneously generated lymphoblastoid cell lines. The data indicated that it is not HIV per se which is responsible for the high incidence of B-type EBV in HIV+ individuals.
