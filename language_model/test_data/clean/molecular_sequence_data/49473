In recent years there has been considerable interest in telomerase as a target for therapeutic intervention in oncology. This largely stems from the vast number of studies that have demonstrated expression and activity of the enzyme telomerase in the majority of human cancer tissues with little or no activity detectable in normal somatic tissues. These studies have led to an interest in the role of telomerase in cancers associated with domesticated species, in particular tumors that affect dogs. This article reviews the biology of telomerase and the biological significance of telomerase activity in canine tumors and discusses the clinical implications of telomerase expression in canine cancers with regard to therapeutics and diagnostics.
