Post-invasive third-stage larvae (pL3) of Acanthocheilonema viteae were labeled with [(35)S]-methionine in vivo, and proteins released into the culture supernatant before and during the third molt were analyzed. The molting supernatant (MSN) contained abundant proteins of 14, 18, 29, and 36 kDa. The 14- and 29-kDa proteins were exclusively found in the MSN, while the 18- and 36-kDa proteins were also produced by nonmolting pL3, albeit in much lower quantities. The cDNA for the most abundant protein in the MSN, an 18-kDa protein (Av18), was isolated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with reverse transcribed (RT) RNA of pL3, using information of the protein sequence. The Av18 full-length cDNA of 583 base pairs contained the 5' spliced leader sequence of nematodes, an open reading frame of 427 base pairs, and a poly(A) tail in typical distance to a polyadenylation signal. The deduced amino acid sequence encodes for a protein with a calculated size of 15.8 kDa. The N-terminus starts with a hydrophobic signal sequence and a predicted cleavage site after amino acid 20. The Av18 protein showed homologies to the deduced amino acid sequence of the larval transcripts Bm-alt-1 and alt-2 of Brugia malayi and to the Dirofilaria immitis proteins Di20/22 as well as to the Onchocerca volvulus proteins Ov-alt-1 and Ov-alt-2. Av18 is present in all parasite stages within the mammalian host, as determined by immunoblot with sera against the Escherichia coli-expressed protein and RT-PCR experiments. However, it was released into culture medium only by L3 and adult female worms. In female worms Av18 was localized in the cuticular region as demonstrated by immunofluorescent antibody tests using cryosections.
