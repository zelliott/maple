This publication marks the beginning of the construction of a gene-protein index that relates proteins which are resolved on the two-dimensional protein map of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with their corresponding genes. We report the identification of 36 novel polypeptide spots on the yeast protein map. They correspond to the products of 26 genes. Together with the polypeptide spots previously identified, this raises to 41 the number of genes whose products have been identified on the protein map. The proteins identified here are concerned with four major areas of yeast cellular physiology: carbon metabolism, heat shock, amino acid biosynthesis and purine biosynthesis. Given the molecular weight and isoelectric point of the identified proteins, and the codon-usage bias of the corresponding genes, it can be estimated that 25 to 35% of all the soluble yeast proteins are detectable under the labelling and running gel conditions used in this study.
