The SSA3 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a member of the HSP70 multigene family, is expressed at low levels under optimal growth conditions and is dramatically induced in response to heat shock. Sequences coinciding with two overlapping heat shock elements, located 156 base pairs upstream of the transcribed region, were necessary and sufficient for regulation of heat induction. The SSA3 promoter was also activated in an ssa1ssa2 double-mutant strain. This increase in the expression of SSA3 was mediated via the same upstream activating sequences that activated transcription in response to heat shock.
