Escherichia coli isolate MEV, responsible for a bloodstream infection, was resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, and ertapenem. Molecular and biochemical characterization revealed the production of a novel, chromosome-borne, extended-spectrum AmpC (ESAC) β-lactamase with a Ser-282 duplication and increased carbapenemase activity. This study demonstrates for the first time that chromosome-borne ESAC β-lactamases can contribute to the emergence of ertapenem resistance in E. coli clinical isolates.
