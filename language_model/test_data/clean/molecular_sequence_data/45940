An L-amino acid oxidase was isolated from the venom of the common viper Vipera berus berus by a three-step procedure combining gel filtration, ion exchange and hydrophobic chromatography. The enzyme is a non-covalently bound homodimer with a monomeric molecular mass of 57.7 kDa. The N-terminal amino acid sequence and the internal peptide sequences show close structural homology with other snake venom L-amino acid oxidases. The purified protein catalyzed oxidative desamination of L-amino acids, the most specific substrate is L-Phe. The best substrates among the studied 20 amino acids were: L-Met, L-Leu, L-Phe, L-Ile, L-Arg and L-His. Five amino acids, L-Ser, L-Pro, Gly, L-Thr and L-Cys, were not oxidized. The enzyme inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation dose-dependently with an IC50 of 0.07 microM. The effect was neutralized by catalase. V. berus berus LAAO induced apoptosis in cultured HeLa and K562 cells as shown by DNA fragmentation gel pattern. The induction of apoptosis was inhibited by catalase.
