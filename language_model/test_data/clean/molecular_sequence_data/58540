Sequences from the putative 5' nontranslated region of GB virus A were isolated from mystax, owl monkeys, and tamarins. Though sequences of isolates from each animal species are virtually identical at the nucleotide level (95%), isolates from different species are dramatically different (52 to 79% identical) and genetically cluster on this basis.
