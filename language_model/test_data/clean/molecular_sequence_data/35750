To identify regions of 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) important for the function of the protein and the binding of leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors, we performed a cross-species analysis of FLAP. FLAP from all 10 mammalian species analyzed (human, monkey, horse, pig, cow, sheep, rabbit, dog, rat, and mouse) were immunologically cross-reactive and specifically bound leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors with high affinity. Using the polymerase chain reaction, cDNA clones for FLAP from six species (monkey, horse, pig, sheep, rabbit, and mouse) were isolated and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences of FLAP show a high degree of identity to each other and to the published sequences for human and rat FLAP. Two regions of the protein are almost totally conserved among all of the species analyzed. This suggests that these regions have functional significance and may be involved in inhibitor binding.
