The use of DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) to analyze variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) sequences dispersed in the human genome, has become a powerful tool for the study of population genetics due to the very substantial polymorphism involved. Because the markers usually employed for twin zygosity determination (such as sex combination, placentation, HLA typing, blood group antigens, etc) may not be uniformly informative, we propose the use of synthetic olygonucleotides, representing VNTR "core" sequences, for the determination of zygosity in twins.
