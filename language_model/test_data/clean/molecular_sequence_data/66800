Self-tumor Ags that elicit antitumor immune responses in responses to IFN-alpha stimulation remain poorly defined. We screened a human testis cDNA library with sera from three polycythemia vera patients who responded to IFN-alpha and identified a novel Ag, MPD6. MPD6 belongs to the group of cryptic Ags without conventional genomic structure and is encoded by a cryptic open reading frame located in the 3'-untranslated region of myotrophin mRNA. MPD6 elicits IgG Ab responses in a subset of polycythemia vera patients, as well as patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and prostate cancer, suggesting that it is broadly immunogenic. The expression of myotrophin-MPD6 transcripts was up-regulated in some tumor cells, but only slightly increased in K562 cells in response to IFN-alpha treatment. By using bicistronic reporter constructs, we showed that the translation of MPD6 was mediated by a novel internal ribosome entry site (IRES) upstream of the MPD6 reading frame. Furthermore, the MPD6-IRES-mediated translation, but not myotrophin-MPD6 transcription, was significantly up-regulated in response to IFN-alpha stimulation. These findings demonstrate that a novel IRES-mediated mechanism may be responsible for the translation of unconventional self-Ag MPD6 in responsive to IFN-alpha stimulation. The eliciting antitumor immune response against unconventional Ag MPD6 in patients with myeloproliferative diseases suggests MPD6 as a potential target of novel immunotherapy.
