Fibronectin is an important component of the extracellular matrix and is involved in a diverse range of physiological processes. It is a mosaic protein composed almost entirely of three types of module, F1, F2 and F3. Although the structures of single F1, F2 and F3 modules have been available for a number of years, in many cases the key to understanding the structure-function relationships in fibronectin and other proteins containing these modules lies in studies of module pairs and larger domains. This review focuses on recent advances in the understanding of the structure and function of fibronectin modules.
