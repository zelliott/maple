In order to understand better the structural and functional relations between protein kinase CK2 catalytic subunit, the triphosphate moiety of ATP, the catalytic metal and the peptidic substrate, we built a structural model of Yarrowia lipolytica protein kinase CK2 catalytic subunit using the recently solved three-dimensional structure of the maize enzyme and the structure of cAMP-dependent protein kinase peptidic inhibitor (1CDK) as templates. The overall structure of the catalytic subunit is close to the structure solved by Niefind et al. It comprises two lobes, which move relative to each other. The peptide used as substrate is tightly bound to the enzyme, at specific locations. Molecular dynamic calculations in combination with the study of the structural model led us to identify amino acid residues close to the triphosphate moiety of ATP and a residue sufficiently far from the peptide that could be mutated so as to modify the specificity of the enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace by charged residues both glycine-48, a residue located within the glycine-rich loop, involved in binding of ATP phosphate moiety, and glycine-177, a residue close to the active site. Kinetic properties of purified wild-type and mutated subunits were studied with respect to ATP, MgCl(2) and protein kinase CK2 specific peptide substrates. The catalytic efficiency of the G48D mutant increased by factors of 4 for ATP and 17.5 for the RRRADDSDDDDD peptide. The mutant G48K had a low activity with ATP and no detectable activity with peptide substrates and was also inhibited by magnesium. An increased velocity of ADP release by G48D and the building of an electrostatic barrier between ATP and the peptidic substrate in G48K could explain these results. The kinetic properties of the mutant G177K with ATP were not affected, but the catalytic efficiency for the RRRADDSDDDDD substrate increased sixfold. Lysine 177 could interact with the lysine-rich cluster involved in the specificity of protein kinase CK2 towards acidic substrate, thereby increasing its activity.
