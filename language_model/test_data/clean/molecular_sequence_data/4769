The full extent of genetic diversity among small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs), i.e., caprine arthritis encephalitis viruses (CAEVs) and maedi-visna viruses (MVVs), remains unknown. This is due in part to the fact that few sequences of CAEV are available. To contribute to this knowledge, gag, pol, and env nucleotide sequences from an SRLV named CA680 originating from a goat from western France were determined. This analysis revealed that this virus is closely related to the Cork and 63 CAEV American isolates. Mismatched amino acids between the CA680 virus and prototype CAEVs ranged from 6.7, 0. 7, and 17.5% for gag, pol, and SU sequences, respectively. The differences between the CA680 virus and MVV prototypes ranged from 16.5, 12.5, and 32.3% for the protein sequences, respectively. A screening using a heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) adapted to SRLVs revealed that 6 of 10 caprine virus field isolates were closely related to CA680, indicating that this latter isolate was a prototype of CAEVs common in the west of France. Phylogenetic trees drawn using CA, RT, or SU sequences of numerous SRLVs and rooted with EIAV sequences revealed that CA680 and CAEV prototypes, all infectious for goat, clustered in one group. From these HMA and phylogenetic analyses, it appears that U.S. and French caprine SRLVs form a clade that had emerged from a much more diverse group containing all SRLVs infectious for sheep. These ovine SRLVs form a more ancient group in which the EIAV is rooted.
