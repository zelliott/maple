Ten phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) amino acids possessing allyl (Al) or allyloxycarbonyl (Aloc) side-chain-protecting groups have been characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography for use in Edman degradation sequence analysis. Optimized separation of side-chain-protected and -unprotected PTH amino acids was achieved on a C-18 reversed-phase column with a two-step gradient spanning 32 min. Five of the side-chain-protected amino acids [Cys(Al), Cys(Aloc), Lys(Aloc), Thr(Aloc), Tyr(Al)] were completely stable to the conditions of PTH derivatization, four [Asp(OAl), Arg(Aloc)2, Glu(OAl), Ser(Aloc)] were partially deprotected during PTH derivatization, and one [His(Aloc)] was completely deprotected during PTH derivatization. All allyl-based derivatives were well resolved from their side-chain-unprotected counterparts. Studies on the stability to piperidine treatment showed Asp(OAl), Cys(Al), Glu(OAl), Lys(Aloc), Thr(Aloc), and Tyr(Al), and possibly Arg(Aloc)2 and Ser(Aloc), to be suitable for peptide synthesis by 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-based chemistry. Edman degradation of Al and Aloc side-chain-protected Conus geographus Lys9-alpha-conotoxin GI synthesized on 4-methylbenzhydrylamine-copoly(styrene-1%-DVB)-resin demonstrated the usefulness of these derivatives for solid-phase preview sequence analysis.
