Activation of the osmoregulated trimeric betaine transporter BetP from Corynebacterium glutamicum was shown to depend mainly on the correct folding and integrity of its 55 amino acid long, partly alpha-helical C-terminal domain. Reorientation of the three C-terminal domains in the BetP trimer indicates different lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions of the C-terminal domain during osmoregulation. A regulation mechanism is suggested where this domain switches the transporter from the inactive to the active state. Interpretation of recently obtained electron and X-ray crystallography data of BetP led to a structure-function based model of C-terminal molecular switching involved in osmoregulation.
