Base-excision DNA repair (BER) is the principal pathway responsible for the removal of aberrant, genotoxic bases from the genome and restoration of the original sequence. Key components of the BER pathway are DNA glycosylases, enzymes that recognize aberrant bases in the genome and catalyze their expulsion. One major class of such enzymes, glycosylase/lyases, also catalyze scission of the DNA backbone following base expulsion. Recent studies indicate that the glycosylase and lyase functions of these enzymes are mechanistically unified through a common amine-bearing residue on the enzyme, which acts as both the electrophile that displaces the aberrant base and an electron sink that facilitates DNA strand scission through imine (Schiff base)/conjugate elimination chemistry. The identity of this critical amine-bearing residue has not been rigorously established for any member of a superfamily of BER glycosylase/lyases.

Here, we report the identification of the active-site amine of the human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (hOgg1), a human BER superfamily protein that repairs the mutagenic 8-oxoguanine lesion in DNA. We employed Edman sequencing of an active-site peptide irreversibly linked to substrate DNA to identify directly the active-site amine of hOgg1 as the epsilon-NH2 group of Lys249. In addition, we observed that the repair-inactive but recognition-competent Cys249 mutant (Lys249-->Cys) of hOgg1 can be functionally rescued by alkylation with 2-bromoethylamine, which functionally replaces the lysine residue by generating a gamma-thia-lysine.

This study provides the first direct identification of the active-site amine for any DNA glycosylase/lyase belonging to the BER superfamily, members of which are characterized by the presence of a helix-hairpin-helix-Gly/Pro-Asp active-site motif. The critical lysine residue identified here is conserved in all members of the BER superfamily that exhibit robust glycosylase/lyase activity. The ability to trigger the catalytic activity of the Lys249-->Cys mutant of hOgg1 by treatment with the chemical inducer 2-bromoethylamine may permit snapshots to be taken of the enzyme acting on its substrate and could represent a novel strategy for conditional activation of catalysis by hOgg1 in cells.
