An esterase-encoding gene, estR5, was directly obtained from the genomic DNA of goat rumen contents. The 555-bp full-length gene encodes a 184-residue polypeptide (EstR5) without putative signal peptide. Deduced EstR5 shared the highest identity (50%) to a putative arylesterase from Ruminococcaceae bacterium D16. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that EstR5 was closely related with microbial esterases of gastrointestinal source. A comparison of the conserved motifs shared with GDSL proteins revealed that EstR5 could be grouped into the GDSL family and was further classified into the subfamily of SGNH hydrolases. The gene estR5 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. Recombinant EstR5 exhibited highest catalytic efficiency towards α-naphthyl acetate followed by phenyl acetate and p-nitrophenyl acetate and had no activity towards PNP esters with acyl chains longer than C8. The enzyme exhibited optimal activity at around 60°C and pH 8.0, was stable at pH ranging from 6.0 to 11.0 and was slightly activated by detergent Tween, Nonidet P-40, and Triton X-100. These properties suggest that EstR5 has great potential for basic research and industrial applications. To our knowledge, this is the first arylesterase obtained from rumen microenvironment.
