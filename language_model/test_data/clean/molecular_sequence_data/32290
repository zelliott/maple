DNA methyltransferase 2 (Dnmt2) is a dual-specificity DNA methyltransferase, which contains a weak DNA methyltransferase and novel tRNA methyltransferase activity. However, its biological function is still enigmatic. To elucidate the expression profiles of Dnmt2 in Artemia franciscana, we isolated the gene encoding a Dnmt2 from A. franciscana and named it as AfDnmt2. The cDNA of AfDnmt2 contained a 1140-bp open reading frame that encoded a putative Dnmt2 protein of 379 amino acids exhibiting 32% approximately 39% identities with other known Dnmt2 homologs. This is the first report of a DNA methyltransferase gene in Crustacean. By using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, AfDnmt2 was found to be expressed through all developmental stages and its expression increased during resumption of diapause cysts development. Southern blot analysis indicated the presence of multiple copies of AfDnmt2 genes in A. franciscana.
