The 200kb linear plasmid pSLA2-L was suggested to be involved in the production of two macrolide antibiotics, lankamycin (Lm) and lankacidin (Lc), in Streptomyces rochei 7434AN4. Hybridization experiments with the polyketide synthase (PKS) genes for erythromycin and actinorhodin identified two eryAI-homologous regions and an actI-homologous region on pSLA2-L. The nucleotide sequence of a 3.6kb SacI fragment carrying one of the eryAI-homologs revealed that it codes for part of a large protein with four domains for ketoreductase, acyl carrier protein, ketosynthase, and acyltransferase. Gene disruption confirmed that the two eryAI-homologs are parts of a large type-I PKS gene cluster for Lm. A 4.8kb DNA carrying the actI-homologous region contains four open reading frames (ORF1-ORF4) as well as an additional ORF, i.e. ORF5, which might code for a thioesterase. Deletion of the ORF2-ORF4 region showed that it is not involved in the synthesis of Lm or Lc. Thus, it was confirmed that pSLA2-L contains two PKS gene clusters for Lm and an unknown type-II polyketide.
