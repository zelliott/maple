To investigate the molecular phylogenetic status of the Korean goral, Nemorhaedus caudatus raddeanus, and Japanese serow, Capricornis crispus, we determined partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of twelve Korean gorals and sixteen Japanese serows, and compared them with those of the major lineages of Rupicaprini species including two other Nemorhaedus species and two other Capricornis species. The Korean gorals examined possessed two haplotypes with only one nucleotide difference between them, while the Japanese serows showed slightly higher sequence diversity with five haplotypes. Genetic distances and molecular phylogenetic trees indicated that there is considerable genetic divergence between the Korean goral and N. caudatus (the Chinese goral) [Groves and Shields (1996)], but virtually none between Korean and Russian gorals. The Korean and Russian gorals may therefore be distinct from the Chinese goral. The data highlight the importance of conservation of the goral populations of these regions, and the need to reconsider the taxonomic status of Korean and Russian gorals. Our study also clearly demonstrated sufficient genetic distance between serows and gorals to justify their assignment to separate genera. Of the three species of Capricornis, the Formosan serow, C. swinhoei is more closely related to C. sumatraensis than to the Japanese serow, suggesting that the Formosan serow is a distinct species. Preliminary data on intraspecific genetic variation in the Japanese serow are also presented.
