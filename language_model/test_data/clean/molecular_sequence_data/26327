Antithrombin III is a plasma glycoprotein responsible for thrombin inhibition in the blood coagulation cascade. The X-ray structure of its cleaved form has been determined and refined to 3.2 A resolution. The overall topology is similar to that of alpha 1-antitrypsin, another member of the serpin (serine protease inhibitor) superfamily. The biological activity of antithrombin III is mediated by a polysaccharide, heparin. The binding site of this effector is described. A possible structural transition from the native to the cleaved structure is discussed.
