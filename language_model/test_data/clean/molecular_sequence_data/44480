Escherichia coli 30S ribosomal subunits were UV-irradiated to induce intramolecular crosslinks in the 16S rRNA. Intact 16S rRNA was purified and subjected to gel electrophoresis, under denaturing conditions, to separate molecules on the basis of the crosslinked loop size. Molecules separated this way were enriched for specific crosslinks and could be analyzed by the reverse transcription arrest assay to determine exact crosslinking sites. Thirteen crosslinking sites have been identified at single nucleotide resolution. Of these, eight are within or adjacent to secondary structure elements: one of these (C582 x G760) involves an interaction between nucleotides within an interior loop, one (C1402 x X1501) involves an interaction between nucleosides in adjacent base pairs, and the others involve interactions between nucleotides that are within junction regions (A441 x G494, U562 x U884, C934 x U1345, and U991 x U1212) or are interactions between nucleotides (C54 x A353 and U1052 x C1200) that somehow cross known base pairs. Five other crosslinks connect sites distant in the secondary structure and provide global constraints for the arrangement of RNA regions within RNA domains I and II (U244 x G894, G894 x A1468, C967 x C1400) and within domain III (U1126 x C1281 and A1093 x G1182). These crosslinks, known at single-nucleotide resolution, are useful in the prediction of local RNA regions, as well as the global structure.
