We have determined the chromosomal localization of the murine gene encoding a 75-kDa inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase (Inpp5b). Using two independent approaches, fluorescence in situ hybridization and interspecific backcross analysis, we show that Inpp5b maps to distal mouse Chromosome 4. This map position is within the conserved linkage group corresponding to the short arm of human Chromosome 1, where the human homologue, INPP5B, has been shown to map previously. The position of Inpp5b on mouse Chromosome 4 is in the vicinity of the mouse developmental mutation dysgenetic lens (dyl). However, using a genetic approach, we show that Inpp5b maps distal to dyl on mouse Chromosome 4.
