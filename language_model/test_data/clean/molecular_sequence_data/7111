Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify transcripts encoding cytochrome b5 from cDNA synthesised from RNA isolated from developing seeds of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). The sequence of the amplified products indicated that the clones encoded a second form of tobacco cytochrome b5, different from that previously characterised (Smith et al. 1994, Plant Mol Biol 25:527-537). Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR was used to amplify the 5' and 3' ends of the transcript. Northern blotting and RNAse protection assays of RNA samples isolated from different tobacco tissues indicated that this second cytochrome b5 form was expressed only in developing seeds. Therefore, it seems likely that this message is the product of a tobacco cytochrome b5 gene specifically expressed in seeds.
