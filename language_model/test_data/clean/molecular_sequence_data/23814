Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection presents itself with a variety of clinical manifestations. The present work aims to describe the prevalence of HBV genotypes and the occurrence of precore mutation A-1896 in a population group of the Eastern Amazon region of Brazil and to correlate them with the clinical presentation of chronic HBV infection. 51 HBsAg carriers (HBV-DNA positive) were selected and divided into three groups: A (14 asymptomatic subjects), B (20 HBeAg positive symptomatic patients) and C (17 HBeAg negative symptomatic patients). Using an automa ed DNA sequencer ABI model 377 by sequencing for determined of genotypes and precore mutation. The results showed that the genotype A was the most commonly found (81.1%, 89.5% and 93.7% in groups A, B and C, respectively) and precore mutation A-1896 was described in 11.5% (3/26) of group A subjects. Genotype A of HBV was the most prevalent (89.1%) and low occurrence of precore mutation A-1896, both not associate with the worst outcome of the chronic infection of HBV.
