In order to assess the significance of the aminoterminal residues of the B beta chain in expression of polymerization sites of the E domain, we have prepared polyclonal antiserum against a synthetic peptide corresponding to beta 43-47 of human fibrinogen. Affinity purified immunoglobulin IgG and Fab prepared from these antibodies reacted strongly and specifically with the synthetic pentapeptide and intact fibrinogen molecule. This specificity was determined both by radioimmunoassay and Western blot analysis of fibrinogen and its plasmic fragments and described in our previous paper (Cierniewski et al., 1986, Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 884, 594-597). Immunochemically purified anti beta 43-47 antibodies and their Fab fragments were strong inhibitors of the fibrin monomer polymerization. Our results imply that amino acid sequence beta 43-47 recognized by these antibodies may be in a close vicinity to the contact sites of the E domain.
