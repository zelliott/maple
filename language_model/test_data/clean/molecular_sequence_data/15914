The nuclear PET122 gene from S. cerevisiae is necessary for translation of a single mitochondrial mRNA that encodes subunit III of cytochrome c oxidase. We report here the cloning and nucleotide sequence of PET122, and properties of the predicted protein product, which consists of 242 residues. Analysis of PET122-lacZ translational fusions confirms that the PET122 coding region is translated in vivo and indicates that the PET122 protein product is targeted to mitochondria. A 117 residue domain located in the carboxy-terminal half of the PET122 protein, at least part of which is shown by characterization of mutants to be critical for PET122 function, exhibits 24% identity and 59% similarity to a portion of the catalytic domain of E. coli alanyl-tRNA synthetase. However, pet122 mutants are not defective in mitochondrial translation per se, as would be expected if PET122 encoded a tRNA synthetase. Instead, the PET122 protein may carry out one or more activities in common with tRNA synthetases, such as binding of ATP or RNA.
