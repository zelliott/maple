A tRNA(Val) (GAC) gene is located in opposite orientation 552 nucleotides (nt) down-stream of the cytochrome oxidase subunit III (coxIII) gene in sunflower mitochondria. The comparison with the homologous chloroplast DNA revealed that the tRNA(Val) gene is part of a 417 nucleotides DNA insertion of chloroplast origin in the mitochondrial genome. No tRNA(Val) is encoded in monocot mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), whereas two tRNA(Val) species are coded for by potato mtDNA. The mitochondrial genomes of different plant species thus seem to encode unique sets of tRNAs and must thus be competent in importing the missing differing sets of tRNAs.
