New Zealand Black (NZB) mice spontaneously develop a severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia due to the production of anti-mouse red blood cell (MRBC) autoantibodies. The contribution of variable region genes and somatic mutations in the pathogenicity of anti-MRBC autoantibodies was investigated by mRNA sequencing of eight NZB anti-MRBC monoclonal autoantibodies, among which five are capable of inducing anemia in BALB/c mice. Here we report that at least three VH gene families (J558, J606 and 3609) and five Vchi subgroups (V chi 8, 9, 19, 21 and 28), in combination with several D, JH and Jchi gene segments, encode anti-MRBC autoantibodies. Thus, the NZB anti-MRBC autoantibodies, whether pathogenic or not, are encoded by a large number of immunoglobulin gene elements and by members of known VH and Vchi gene families with preferential usage of VH gene families most distal to the D regions. The presence of several mutations in the JH gene segments of both IgM and IgG anti-MRBC autoantibodies, whether pathogenic or not, strongly suggests that their VH regions may be highly mutated and that the mechanism of somatic diversification might be important in the generation of anti-MRBC autoantibodies. Our results support the idea that anti-MRBC autoimmune responses are likely to be generated by an antigen-driven mechanism.
