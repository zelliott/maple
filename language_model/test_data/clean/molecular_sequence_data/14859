The establishment of endometrial receptivity is a prerequisite for successful pregnancy, which is controlled by a complex mechanism. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that have emerged as important regulators of gene expression. However, the contribution of miRNAs in endometrial receptivity is still unknown. Here we used rhesus monkey as an animal model and compared the endometrial miRNA expression profiles during early-secretory (pre-receptive) phase and mid-secretory (receptive) phase by deep sequencing. A set of differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, 8 of which were selected and validated using quantitative RT-PCR. To facilitate the prediction of their target genes, the 3'-UTRome was also determined using tag sequencing of mRNA 3'-termini. Surprisingly, about 50% of the 10,677 genes expressed in the rhesus monkey endometrium exhibited alternative 3'-UTRs. Of special interest, the progesterone receptor (PGR) gene, which is necessary for endometrial receptivity, processes an ultra long 3'-UTR (~10 kb) along with a short variant (~2.5 kb). Evolutionary analysis showed that the 3'-UTR sequences of PGR are poorly conserved between primates and rodents, suggesting a species-biased miRNA binding pattern. We further demonstrated that PGR is a valid target of miR-96 in rhesus monkey and human but not in rodents, whereas the regulation of PGR by miR-375 is rhesus monkey-specific. Additionally, we found that miR-219-5p regulates PGR expression through a primate-specific long non-coding RNA immediately downstream of the PGR locus. Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying endometrial receptivity and presents intriguing species-specific regulatory roles of miRNAs.
