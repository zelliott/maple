As part of the CANCER Antimicrobial Surveillance Program in North America, a Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate, strain 07-406, was shown to possess a metallo-beta-lactamase, designated VIM-7. bla(VIM-7) is located on a 24-kb plasmid which can be readily transferred into Enterobacteriaceae and other pseudomonads. This is the first report of a mobile metallo-beta-lactamase gene, bla(VIM-7), being detected within the United States.
