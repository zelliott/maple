The N-terminal cytosolic T1 domain of the mammalian voltage gated potassium channel Kv1.4 is strongly involved in the tetramerization of the Kv1.4 subunit that is required for forming a functional ion channel. The T1 domain forms a stable tetramer of 48 kDa in solution that cannot be dissociated into monomers. In spite of the high molecular mass it was possible to completely assign the backbone and part of the side chain resonances by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy on uniformly (2)H, (13)C, (15)N enriched protein. The secondary structure analysis derived from the chemical shifts is in line with the expectations from X-ray structures of related proteins.
