A method for DNA sequencing that combines limited chemical degradation of 3'-fluorescent-labeled DNA with densitometric analysis using an automatic sequencer is presented. The DNA sequence is determined in a single electrophoretic lane by monitoring the intensities of bands representing products of cleavage at the four bases obtained by solvolysis in hot aqueous piperidine (10%) followed by treatment with hot formamide. An application of the method for the detection of point mutations is reported.
