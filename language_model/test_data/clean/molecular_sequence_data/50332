Antisera to a highly conserved region of chromogranin A (sequence KELTAE) and to a hexapeptide (sequence KGQELE) adjacent to the putative C-terminus of pancreastatin, a peptide whose sequence is found within the chromogranin A molecule, have been used to examine the localisation of immunoreactivity (IR) to these peptides in Ascaris suum. IR to both peptides was found in the nerve rings and nerve cords. In addition, KGQELE-IR was also observed in the pharyngeal neurones and in a network of fibres on the surface of the female gonoduct. The staining was specific in that it could be abolished by preincubation of the antisera with the appropriate antigen. The two antisera appeared to be staining different subsets of neurones, suggesting that (at least) two peptides were being recognised. The wide-spread distribution of IR to both peptides throughout the nervous system of the parasite suggests that the peptides carrying the epitopes recognised by the antisera are of fundamental importance to the functioning of the parasite's nervous system.
