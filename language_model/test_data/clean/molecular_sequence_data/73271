In the present paper we describe the identification of an antigenic epitope that appears to be associated with the surface membrane of the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite, probably implicated in infectivity. Anti-TcMe antibodies inhibited the infectivity of fibroblast LLC-MK2 cells by 34% relative to a preimmune serum. The epitope was specifically recognized by 55% of the sera from 80 chagasic patients. The anti-TcMe antibody immunoprecipitated proteins of about 60 and 40 kDa from epimastigote and cell-culture trypomastigote forms, respectively. It is likely that the 60- and 40-kDa proteins are processed from higher-molecular-weight precursors, since the antibody immunoprecipitated protein fractions in the range of 115-150 kDa from in vitro translation products of poly A+ RNA.
