We describe here the construction of a family of expression vectors, based on the P2 promoter of the Escherichia coli rrnB gene by removing regulatory sequences downstream of the Pribnow-box and replacing them with the lac operator. These vectors allow cloning of foreign genes in such a way that their products are synthesized either in the form of fusion proteins of different length, or without fusion partners, with or without the original translational initiation signals. One of the vectors contains a synthetic oligothreonine-coding sequence that helps to stabilize the product of the cloned gene. These vectors allow high-level regulated expression of foreign genes, even if their products are relatively short peptides.
