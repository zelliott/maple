Myotube migration and the formation of muscle attachments are crucial events for the proper development of muscle patterning in the Drosophila embryo. This paper describes the identification of a new embryonic muscle-specific protein, MSP-300, in Drosophila. This protein is initially expressed by muscle precursors at muscle-ectoderm and muscle-muscle attachment sites. As development continues, MSP-300 becomes associated with muscle myofibrillar network. Studies of the subcellular localization of this muscle-specific protein in primary embryonic cultured myotubes show that MSP-300 decorates actin filaments, and that it is specifically enriched in sites where actin microfilaments are linked to the plasma membrane. Migrating myotubes exhibit high levels of this protein at their leading edge while, in myotubes that have already developed sarcomeric architecture, the protein is localized mainly at the Z-discs. Sequence of a partial 3.9 kb cDNA clone and molecular analysis of the predicted protein sequence of this protein indicates that it encodes a high relative molecular mass protein (approximately 300 x 10(3), which exhibits at least five spectrin-like repeats. Several properties are shared by MSP-300 and members of the spectrin superfamily: it is associated with actin microfilaments, its sequence exhibits spectrin-like repeats and it is localized at sites where actin is linked to the plasma membrane. This protein could have a developmental role in the formation of muscle-ectoderm attachments and may be involved in myotube migration on the ectoderm.
