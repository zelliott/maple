Expression of functionally active bovine visual rhodopsin was achieved by sequential transcription and translation in vitro of rhodopsin gene cDNA with co-translational insertion of the protein into phosphatidylcholine liposomes. The recombinant rhodopsin has functional, spectral and immunochemical properties similar to those of natural rhodopsin from bovine retina. Two mutant rhodopsins, Cys316----Ser and Asp330----Asn, Asp331----Asn, were produced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The first mutation does not affect rhodopsin's ability to stimulate transducin GTPase and visual cGMP phosphodiesterase activities, while the second double mutation leads to a sharp decrease in rhodopsin activity.
