The functions of plant glycoside hydrolases and transglycosidases have been studied using different biochemical and molecular genetic approaches. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of various carbohydrates containing compounds present in the plant tissues. The structural and functional diversity of the carbohydrates implies a vast spectrum of enzymes involved in their metabolism. Complete genome sequence of Arabidopsis and rice has allowed the classification of glycoside hydrolases in different families based on amino acid sequence data. The genomes of these plants contain 29 families of glycoside hydrolases. This review summarizes the current research on plant glycoside hydrolases concerning their principal functional roles, which were attributed to different families. The majority of these plant glycoside hydrolases are involved in cell wall polysaccharide metabolism. Other functions include their participation in the biosynthesis and remodulation of glycans, mobilization of energy, defence, symbiosis, signalling, secondary plant metabolism and metabolism of glycolipids.
