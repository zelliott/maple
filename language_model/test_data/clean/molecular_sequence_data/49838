Pancreatic AR42J cells have the feature of pluripotency of the precursor cells of the gut endoderm. Dexamethasone converts them to exocrine cells or liver cells. Using mRNA differential display techniques, we have identified a novel Ca2+-dependent member of the mitochondrial solute carrier superfamily, which is expressed during the course of differentiation, and have designated it MCSC. The corresponding cDNA comprises an open reading frame of 1407 base pairs encoding a polypeptide of 469 amino acids. The carboxyl-terminal-half of MCSC has high similarity with other mitochondrial carriers, and the amino-terminal-half has three canonical elongation factor-hand motifs and has calcium binding capacity. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed 79.1% homology to the rabbit peroxisomal Ca2+-dependent member of the mitochondrial superfamily, but the subcellular localization of the protein was exclusively mitochondrial, not peroxisomal. Northern blot and Western blot analyses revealed its predominant expression in the liver and the skeletal muscle. In the liver, the expression level of MCSC was higher in the adult stage than in the fetal stage, and MCSC was highly up-regulated in dexamethasone-treated AR42J cells before the expression of albumin. Taken together, MCSC may play an important role in regulating the function of hepatocytes rather than in differentiation in vivo.
