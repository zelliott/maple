Hb O-Arab [beta 121(GH4)Glu-->Lys] was detected in two Mediterranean families, one from Southern Italy and the other from Albania. The GAA-->AAA mutation at codon 121 was characterized by DNA sequencing. The mutant genes were associated with the same beta-globin gene framework variant and with the rare Hpa I/3' beta polymorphic restriction site generating a 7.0 kb fragment. However, at 5' the gene of the Italian family was associated with the restriction fragment length polymorphism subhaplotype [+ - - - +] and the Taq I/3'G gamma polymorphic site, while that of the Albanian family was associated with subhaplotype [- - - - +] but not with the Taq I/3'G gamma site. The particular features of these polymorphisms support the hypothesis of an African origin for the Hb O-Arab gene and a subsequent recombination event leading to the haplotype found in the Italian family.
