The phage 434 Cro protein, the N-terminal domain of its repressor (R1-69) and that of phage lambda (lambda6-85) constitute a group of small, monomeric, single-domain folding units consisting of five helices with striking structural similarity. The intrinsic helix stabilities in lambda6-85 have been correlated to its rapid folding behavior, and a residual hydrophobic cluster found in R1-69 in 7 M urea has been proposed as a folding initiation site. To understand the early events in the folding of 434 Cro, and for comparison with R1-69 and lambda6-85, we examined the conformational behavior of five peptides covering the entire 434 Cro sequence in water, 40% (by volume) TFE/water, and 7 M urea solutions using CD and NMR. Each peptide corresponds to a helix and adjacent residues as identified in the native 434 Cro NMR and crystal structures. All are soluble and monomeric in the solution conditions examined except for the peptide corresponding to the 434 Cro helix 4, which has low water solubility. Helix formation is observed for the 434 Cro helix 1 and helix 2 peptides in water, for all the peptides in 40% TFE and for none in 7 M urea. NMR data indicate that the helix limits in the peptides are similar to those in the native protein helices. The number of side-chain NOEs in water and TFE correlates with the helix content, and essentially none are observed in 7 M urea for any peptide, except that for helix 5, where a hydrophobic cluster may be present. The low intrinsic folding propensities of the five helices could account for the observed stability and folding behavior of 434 Cro and is, at least qualitatively, in accord with the results of the recently described diffusion-collision model incorporating intrinsic helix propensities.
