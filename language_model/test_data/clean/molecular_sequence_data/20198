The Arabidopsis thaliana lysyl tRNA synthetase (AtKRS) structurally and functionally resembles the well-characterized prokaryotic class IIb KRS, including the propensity to aminoacylate tRNA(Lys) with suboptimal identity elements, as well as non-cognate tRNAs. Transient expression of AtKRS in carrot cells promotes aminoacylation of such tRNAs in vivo and translational recoding of lysine at nonsense codons. Stable expression of AtKRS in Zea mays causes translational recoding of lysine into zeins, significantly enriching the lysine content of grain.
