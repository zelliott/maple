We investigated the expression pattern of dehydration responsive element-binding protein-3 in tomato under different abiotic stresses. Full length LeDREB3 cDNA was isolated from tomato plant, followed by phylogenetic analysis based on deduced amino acid sequences that revealed significant sequence similarity to DREB proteins belonging to diverse families of plant species. Southern blot analysis showed duplicate copies of LeDREB3 in the tomato genome while organ-specific expression profiling indicated constitutive expression of LeDREB3 in all tested organs, which was particularly strong in flower. LeDREB3 expression was significantly induced by Nacl, drought, low temperature and H(2)O(2). Moreover, LeDREB3 was slightly regulated by treatment with ABA and MV. These observations suggest that the LeDREB3 gene may be involved in the response of the tomato plant to stress. [BMB reports 2009; 42(9): 611-616].
