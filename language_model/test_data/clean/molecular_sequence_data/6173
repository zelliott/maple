Lambda ZAP cDNA library constructed from spleen of a p53-deficient mouse was screened by South-Western technique using Fragment A, a DNA sequence that p53 specifically binds to, as a probe. One (clone 2) of six clones isolated was identical to MEF2c, a MADS-family transcription factor. Transcripts of the mef2c gene was also detected in spleen where the expression has not been reported so far. Isolated clones except clone 2 had a growth-suppression activity on p53-deficient osteosarcoma cell line (Saos II). Clone 2 repressed the transactivation from Fragment A by p53, suggesting that MEF2c may act as a negative regulator of p53-responsive element.
