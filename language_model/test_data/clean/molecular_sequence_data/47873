EDG-3 is a receptor for sphingosine-1-phosphate mapped on human chromosome 9q22.1-q22.2. We used the compact Fugu genome for its linkage analysis. The Fugu EDG-3 was composed of one intron and two exons, encoding a 384 amino acid protein that has 56.9% homology with the human EDG-3. Approximately 3 kb apart, a neuronal Shc (N-Shc) gene was identified. It spans 7 kb containing 12 coding exons, and has an overall 53.4% similarity with the human protein. We mapped the human N-Shc gene to chromosome 9q21.3-q22.2. This is the first report of the genomic structure and the linkage of these two genes conserved between Fugu and human.
