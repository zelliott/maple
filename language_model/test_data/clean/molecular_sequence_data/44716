We previously described the cDNA sequence of HPC-1/syntaxin 1A (HGMW-approved symbol STX1A) from rat and bovine brains. HPC-1/syntaxin 1A belongs to the syntaxin family and is apparently involved in intracellular membrane transport and the exocytosis of neurotransmitters. In this study, we isolated the cDNA and the genomic DNA clone for human HPC-1/syntaxin 1A and carried out gene mapping. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrid panels and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis using a genomic DNA clone provided evidence that the gene for human HPC-1/syntaxin 1A maps to chromosome region 7q11.2.
