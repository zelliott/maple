Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) following successful therapy of a primary malignancy has been recognized with increasing frequency among cancer survivors over the past several years. Many of these t-AML cases are associated with the use of intensive chemotherapy regimens that employ one or more agents which target eukaryotic topoisomerase II (topo II), and demonstrate non-random chromosomal translocations involving either the MLL (ALL-1, HRX) gene at 11q23 or the AML1 gene at 21q22. Although many investigators have speculated that these translocations are induced by the therapeutic use of topo II inhibitors, the molecular sequence of events by which topo II inhibitors might induce a chromosomal translocation are not well understood. We describe here the reproducible induction of highly specific, double-strand DNA cleavage at a specific site within the AML1 locus by topo II inhibitors. This DNA cleavage, which maps to a region of the AML1 locus frequently disrupted by chromosomal translocations, can be induced in several cell lines, with multiple different topo II inhibitors, indicating that this phenomenon is not restricted to a specific cell type or specific topo II inhibitor. It is conceivable that site-specific double-strand DNA cleavage within the AML1 locus induced by topo II inhibitors represents the initial molecular event leading to a chromosomal translocation and t-AML.
