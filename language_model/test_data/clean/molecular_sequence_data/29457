Solution properties of amphiphilic methoxy poly(ethylene oxide)-block-amyloses (MPEO-amyloses) in chloroform were investigated by SLS and DLS. The results indicated that MPEO-amyloses dissolved in chloroform containing 2 wt % DMSO by their self-associations. The complexation of MPEO-amylose with methyl orange (MO) was significantly enhanced in the amylose domain of the associate in chloroform. The blue shift of the maximum absorption and strong induced circular dichroism with exciton coupling were observed in the MPEO-amylose MO complex in chloroform. The self-assembly of MPEO-amylose in chloroform shows a unique feature for binding with MO. MPEO-block-amylose is a novel amphiphilic polymer with amylose as a molecular recognition site.
