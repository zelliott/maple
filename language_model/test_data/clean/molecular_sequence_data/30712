The distribution of neuropeptide Y (NPY)-immunoreactive neurons was studied in human frontal cerebral cortex from surgical biopsy specimens by immunohistochemical techniques. NPY-containing neurons were identified in all cortical sublayers except sublayer I. The stained neurons were of the multipolar, bitufted, round or triangular form with dendritic and axonal processes. The immunoreactive neurons were considered to be cortical interneurons, due to their nonpyramidal form, and since their processes could be followed intracortically particularly in direction to superficial cortical layers. The NPY precursor molecule is processed to NPY by a dibasic cleavage, and NPY is further enzymatically amidated before release and receptor activation can be achieved. Antisera raised against Cys-NPY(32-36)amide recognize amidated NPY not cross-reacting with nonamidated NPY. These antisera and immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of a population of NPYamide-immunoreactive cells morphologically indistinguishable from the NPY-immunoreactive cells in the human frontal cortex. By comparing the number of immunoreactive cells in adjacent sections, it appears that the number of NPY-immunoreactive cells was higher than those immunoreactive to NPYamide. Also, the density of NPY fibers was much higher compared with the number stained with NPYamide antiserum. The present immunohistochemical study indicates that NPY in its amidated form is contained in a subpopulation of human cortical NPY-immunoreactive neurons and may participate as an active neurotransmitter/modulator within the human cerebral cortex.
