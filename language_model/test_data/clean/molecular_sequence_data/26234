Tyr-MIF-1 (Tyr-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2) was previously isolated from bovine hypothalamus. We have now purified it from the parietal cortex of human brain tissue by gel filtration chromatography and four subsequent high performance liquid chromatographic steps. During isolation, the peptide content was followed by radioimmunoassay and compared with the elution of synthetic Tyr-MIF-1 in identical chromatographic systems. This extends evidence for the presence of Tyr-MIF-1 from bovine to human brain tissue and from hypothalamus to cortex.
