Cytomegalovirus is a widespread opportunistic pathogen affecting immunocompromised individuals in whom neutrophils may mediate virus dissemination and contribute to progression of disease. Recent sequence analysis suggests that genes absent or altered in attenuated strains may influence pathogenesis. We have found two genes, UL146 and UL147, whose products have sequence similarity to alpha (CXC) chemokines. UL146 encodes a protein, designated vCXC-1, that is a 117-aa glycoprotein secreted into the culture medium as a late gene product, where its presence correlates with the ability to attract human neutrophils. Recombinant vCXC-1 is a fully functional chemokine, inducing calcium mobilization, chemotaxis, and degranulation of neutrophils. High-affinity vCXC-1 binding is shown to be mediated via CXCR2, but not CXCR1. vCXC-1 exhibits a potency approaching that of human IL-8. As the first example of a virus-encoded alpha chemokine, vCXC-1 may ensure the active recruitment of neutrophils during cytomegalovirus infection, thereby providing for efficient dissemination during acute infection and accounting for the prominence of this leukocyte subset in cytomegalovirus disease.
