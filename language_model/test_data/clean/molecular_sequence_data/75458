Four of the genes for the subunits of the proton-translocating ATPase of Bacillus megaterium have been cloned into pBR322. Previous studies have shown that two of these genes, for the alpha and beta subunits, can complement Escherichia coli mutants defective in the genes for those subunits (Hawthorne, C.A., and Brusilow, W.S.A. 1985. J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5245-5248). We report here a restriction map of the cloned region and the complete nucleotide sequence of the genes for the beta and epsilon subunits as well as the deduced amino acid sequences and molecular weights of those subunits.
