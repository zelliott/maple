We have purified a steroid-inducible 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from Clostridium scindens to apparent homogeneity. The final enzyme preparation was purified 252-fold, with a recovery of 14%. Denaturing and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis showed that the native enzyme (Mr, 162,000) was a tetramer composed of subunits with a molecular weight of 40,000. The isoelectric point was approximately pH 6.1. The purified enzyme was highly specific for adrenocorticosteroid substrates possessing 17 alpha, 21-dihydroxy groups. The purified enzyme had high specific activity for the reduction of cortisone (Vmax, 280 nmol/min per mg of protein; Km, 22 microM) but was less reactive with cortisol (Vmax, 120 nmol/min per mg of protein; Km, 32 microM) at pH 6.3. The apparent Km for NADH was 8.1 microM with cortisone (50 microM) as the cosubstrate. Substrate inhibition was observed with concentrations of NADH greater than 0.1 mM. The purified enzyme also catalyzed the oxidation of 20 alpha-dihydrocortisol (Vmax, 200 nmol/min per mg of protein; Km, 41 microM) at pH 7.9. The apparent Km for NAD+ was 526 microM. The initial reaction velocities with NADPH were less than 50% of those with NADH. The amino-terminal sequence was determined to be Ala-Val-Lys-Val-Ala-Ile-Asn-Gly-Phe-Gly-Arg. These results indicate that this enzyme is a novel form of 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.
