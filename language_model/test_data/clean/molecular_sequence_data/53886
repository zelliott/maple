The plant knotted1 (kn1)-like homeobox genes are known to play important roles in the maintenance of shoot apical meristem (SAM), determination of cell fate and differentiation of vegetative tissues. To study structural diversity of the three homologous loci encoding a KN1-like homeobox protein in the hexaploid wheat genome, we isolated clones from a cDNA library of young spikes of Japanese common wheat cultivar 'Norin 26'. Three different but highly homologous cDNAs were isolated and their sequences were determined. The mean homology of the deduced amino acid sequences was 96% as compared to the barley ortholog KNOX3. The wheat kn1-like homeobox proteins named WKNOX1 are encoded by a single set of homologous genes on the homologous group 4 chromosomes in the three component genomes of common wheat, i.e. 4A, 4B and 4D. The nucleotide sequence data and the Southern blot pattern suggested that the three homologous loci of wknox1 genes are highly conserved through polyploid evolution of wheat. They were expressed in SAM-containing shoots and young spikes but not in developed leaves, glumes and lemmas and callus tissues. The ectopic expression of the wknox1 was observed in lemma of wheat Hooded (Hd) mutants. The result suggested that the Hd gene is a dominant allele of the wknox1 locus on chromosome 4A.
