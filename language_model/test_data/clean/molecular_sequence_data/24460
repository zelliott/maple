Oxidation of adjacent cysteine residues into a cystine forms a strained eight-membered ring. This motif was tested as the basis for an enzyme with an artificial redox switch. Adjacent cysteine residues were introduced into two different structural contexts in ribonuclease A (RNase A) by site-directed mutagenesis to produce the A5C/A6C and S15C/S16C variants. Ala5 and Ala6 are located in an alpha-helix, whereas Ser15 and Ser16 are located in a surface loop. Only A5C/A6C RNase A had the desired property. The catalytic activity of this variant decreases by 70% upon oxidation. The new disulfide bond also decreases the conformational stability of the A5C/A6C variant. Reduction with dithiothreitol restores full enzymatic activity. Thus, the insertion of adjacent cysteine residues in a proper context can be used to modulate enzymatic activity.
