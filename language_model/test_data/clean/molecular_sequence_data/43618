The nucleotide sequence of a 10.5 kb region (map position 0.332 to 0.410) of bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) was determined. This region contained three open reading frames (ORFs) homologous to herpes simplex virus DNA polymerase catalytic subunit (DNApol, UL30), major DNA-binding protein (MDBP, UL29) and ICP18.5 assembly protein (ICP18.5, UL28). The BHV-1 DNApol. MDBP and ICP18.5 ORFs were 1246, 1203 and 826 amino acids long with a calculated molecular mass of 134.2 kDa, 124.4 kDa and 86.9 kDa, respectively. They showed a high homology with alphaherpesvirus homologs despite large differences in the G + C content of the UL30-UL28 segment ranging from 44.4% for varicella zoster virus to 71.5% for BHV-1. Particularly well conserved among Alphaherpesvirinae are the putative functional domains of the DNApol and MDBP proteins which are discussed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that BHV-1 clustered in the Varicellovirus genus with the animal D-type viruses. In this group, the BHV-1 position was shown to vary according to the investigated genes. Indeed, pseudorabies virus clustered with BHV-1 in the DNApol tree but with equine herpesvirus 1 in the ICP18.5 tree.
