We measured the relative steady-state levels of the mRNA transcribed from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae REV3 gene in cells at different stages of the mitotic and meiotic cycles, and after UV irradiation. This gene is thought to encode a DNA polymerase concerned only with a specific recovery function, the replication on mutagen-damaged templates that produces damaged-induced mutations. In keeping with this proposed function, the REV3 gene showed no evidence of the periodic transcription at the G1/S boundary of the mitotic and meiotic cycle that occurs with genes encoding replication enzymes. However, levels of REV3 mRNA were much increased in late meiotic cells, like those of transcripts of some other DNA repair-related genes. Steady-state levels of REV3 transcript were increased only slightly in response to UV irradiation.
