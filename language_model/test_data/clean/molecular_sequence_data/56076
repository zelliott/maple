The promoter of the human proto-oncogene MYC has been the first cellular target shown to be subject to regulation by the E2F transcription factor. E2F also has binding sites in other promoters regulated by cell proliferation and during the cell cycle. We have analyzed Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the presence of an E2F-analogous protein. GAL1-based promoter constructs carrying the E2F binding site of the MYC or the adenovirus E2 promoter showed transcriptional activity in yeast cells. A DNA-binding factor, designated YE2F, binds specifically to the E2F consensus sequence and was partially purified from yeast extracts. YE2F showed identical contact points within the MYC binding site as authentic E2F protein from mammalian cells. The results suggest that the existence of an E2F-like protein in the yeast S. cerevisiae.
