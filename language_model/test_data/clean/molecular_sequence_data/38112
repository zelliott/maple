The mechanisms of chronic disease and recovery from relapses in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis, are unknown. Deletion of myelin-specific lymphocytes by apoptosis may play a role in termination of the inflammatory response. One pathway of apoptosis is the passive cell death or "cell death by neglect" pathway, which is under the control of the Bcl family of genes. To investigate the role of passive cell death pathway in EAE, we used mice with transgenic expression of the long form of the bcl-x gene (Bcl-x(L)) targeted to the T-cell lineage. We found that mice transgenic for Bcl-x(L) have an earlier onset and a more chronic form of EAE induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide 35-55 compared with wild-type littermate mice. This was not due to an expanded autoreactive cell repertoire. Primed peripheral lymphocytes from Bcl-x(L) transgenic mice showed increased proliferation and cytokine production to MOG peptide in vitro compared with lymphocytes from wild-type animals. Immunohistologic studies demonstrated increased cellular infiltrates, immunoglobulin precipitation, and demyelination in the Bcl-x(L) transgenic central nervous system (CNS) compared with controls. There was also a decreased number of apoptotic cells in the CNS of Bcl-x(L) transgenic mice when compared with littermates at all time points tested. This is the first report of an autoimmune disease model in Bcl-x(L) transgenic mice. Our data indicate that the passive cell death pathway is important in the pathogenesis of chronic EAE. These findings have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases.
