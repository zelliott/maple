Four neuropeptides were identified from the brain and corpora cardiaca-corpora allata (CC-CA) of the mealworm beetle Tenebrio molitor using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and information derived from the genome of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. Leucomyosuppressin (a FLRFamide), previously associated with cockroaches, but also subsequently identified from honey bee seen as a prominent peptide in both brain and CC-CA of T.molitor. A coding sequence for this peptide is found in the genome of T. castaneum. In addition, three FXPRLamides (pyrokinins), provisionally Tenmo-PK-1, Tenmo-PK-2 and Tenmo-PK-3 (HVVNFTPRLamide, SPPFAPRLamide, HL(I)SPFSPRLamide) were identified in both CC-CA and brain of T. molitor, again on the basis of predicted occurrence or similarity in T. castaneum. The sequence of Tenmo-PK-2 is the same as the PK-2 of the cockroach, Periplaneta americana. Other peptides readily predicted from the genome of T. castaneum include two AKH/HrTH peptides (Trica-AKH-1; pELNFSTDWamide and Trica-AKH-2; pELNFTPNWamide), the second of which is identical to Pyrap-AKH, an AKH-related peptide (Trica AKH-L; pEVTFSRDWPamide), two CRF-related diuretic factors (Trica-DH 37 and Trica-DH 47), the latter identical to Tenmo-DH 47, a putative antidiuretic factor (Trica-ADFb; LYDDGSYKPHVYGF-OH), two sulfakinin-like peptides (Trica-SK-1; pETSDDY(SO(3))GHLRFamide, and Trica SK-2; GEEPFDDYGHMRFamide), a potential allatostatin-C (Trica-AS; pESRYRQCYFNPISCF-OH), six allatostatin-B/myoinhibitory peptides (Trica-AST-B-1,2,3,4,5 & 6; DWNKDLHIWamide, GWNNLHEGWamide, AWQSLQSGWamide, NWGQFHGGWamide, SKWDNFRGSWamide, EPAWSNLGIWamide), an allatotropin-like peptide (Trica-ATL; GIEALKYHNMDLGTARGYamide), four 'CAPA'-related peptides (Trica-CAPA-1,2,3,4; NKLASVYALTPSLRVamide, RIGKMVSFPRIamide, PGANSGGMWFGPRLamide, SENFTPWAYIILNGEAPIIREVHYSPRLamide), proctolin (RYLPT), a potential SIFamide (Trica-SIFa; TYRKPPFNGSIFamide), an arginine-vasopressin-related peptide (Trica-AVP; CLITNCPRGamide) and an ITP-related peptide (Trica-ITP). No evidence was found for the presence of 'A' allatostatins (Y/FxFGLamides) or corazonin, either in T. molitor, or in the genome of T. castaneum.
