This article deals with the elucidation of the steroid-binding site of human sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). 17 beta-Bromoacetoxydihydrotesterone (BA-DHT) reacted with highly purified SHBG in a time-dependent and irreversible fashion. The interaction could be totally inhibited by the simultaneous addition of an excess of dihydrotesterone. At the completion of the reaction, the molar ratio of BA-DHT to SHBG was approximately unity. SHBG was affinity labeled with [14C]BA-DHT and submitted to acid hydrolysis. The released amino acids were evaluated on high performance liquid chromatography, and virtually all of the 14C was identified as 3-[14C]carboxymethylhistidine. Furthermore, [14C]BA-DHT-labeled SHBG was digested with trypsin, followed by isolation of the released tryptic peptides by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The 14C was localized to a single tryptic peptide. It contained 2' histidyl residues, corresponding to residues 235 and 251 in the known amino acid sequence of SHBG. Although most of the 3-[14C]carboxymethylhistidine, or its phenylthiohydantoin derivative, was trapped on the filter of the amino acid sequenator, sufficient radioactivity emerged to identify histidyl residue 235 as the labeled amino acid.
