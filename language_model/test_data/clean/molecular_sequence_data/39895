Six acetic acid producing, diazotrophic bacteria were isolated from soil adhering to corn roots. These isolates were shown to be Gluconacetobacter azotocaptans and they shared some features with G. johannae and G. diazotrophicus but differed on the basis of colony morphology on different media, use of carbon sources and use of l-amino acids as a nitrogen source. The species identity was confirmed using 16S rDNA sequence analysis, PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene with species-specific primers and amplified rDNA restriction analysis. This is the first report of the presence of this bacteria on corn plants. Scope of the paper: This is the first report of the occurrence and association of Gluconacetobacter azotocaptans with corn.
