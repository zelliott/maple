Two divergent strains of adenovirus type 31 were analyzed by neutralization test and restriction endonuclease (RE) patterns in an effort to find the basis for their genetic variability. One strain, isolated from the throat of a child in Maryland during an upper respiratory illness in 1968, was partially neutralized by Ad 31 antisera (to 16-fold lower than homologous titer) while its own antiserum fully neutralized prototype Ad 31 virus, but shared only 9% of comigrating RE fragments with Ad 31 prototype (vs. 30% with Ad 18 prototype); however, PCR tests specific for the inverted terminal repeat (ITR) sequence of Ads 12 and 18 were negative. The other strain, recovered from a stool sample from an infant with diarrhea in Georgia in 1979, was inhibited by Ad 31 antiserum to within 4-fold homologous titer, but shared only 15% of comigrating fragments with Ad 31 prototype (vs. 91% with Ad 18 prototype); ITR-specific PCR tests with this virus were positive for Ad 12/Ad 18. These data suggest that both strains are from separate evolutionary lines of Ad 31 unrelated to all other isolates studied to date by RE analysis, and that the partial neutralization by prototype Ad 31 antisera might represent small mutations in the hexon gene.
