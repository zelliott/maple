The proto-oncogene c-myc codes for a nuclear phosphoprotein, a transcription factor composed of the typical basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper domains. Its expression is coupled to a multitude of physiological processes and regulated by a variety of hormones, growth factors, cytokines, lymphokines and the nutritional status, development and differentiation. Its key roles have been characterized, e.g. in adipogenesis, myogenesis and folliculogenesis. We have isolated and sequenced a 6.4-kb genomic fragment encoding the porcine c-myc proto-oncogene. The gene shows the typical c-myc structure with three exons, three putative promoters and a deduced protein of 439 amino acids. The porcine c-myc was mapped to chromosome 4p13 by screening of a porcine-rodent hybrid cell panel.
