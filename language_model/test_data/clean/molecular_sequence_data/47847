1. Accumulations of phosphorylated neurofilaments are seen in affected motor neurones in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 2. The authors demonstrate that cyclin dependent kinase-5 (cdk-5) will induce cellular phosphorylation of neurofilament heavy chain side-arms to generate epitopes for several antibodies that label these neurofilament accumulations. 3. By creating recombinant neurofilament fragments of NF-H side-arm domains, the authors also map the epitopes for several of these antibodies. 4. Finally, the authors demonstrate that cdk-5 is also present in affected motor neurones in ALS. These studies implicate cdk-5 in the pathogenesis of ALS.
