Twenty equine microsatellites were isolated from a genomic phage library, and their genetical and physical localization was sought by linkage mapping and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Nineteen of the markers were found to be polymorphic with, in most cases, heterozygosities exceeding 50%. The markers were mapped in a Swedish reference family for gene mapping, comprising eight half-sib families from Standardbred and Icelandic horse sires. Segregation was analyzed against a set of 35 other markers typed in the pedigree. Thirteen of the microsatellites showed linkage to at least one other marker, with a total of 21 markers being involved in these linkages. In parallel, 18 of the microsatellites could be assigned to their chromosomal region by FISH. These assignments involved eight equine autosomes: ECA1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 15, and 16. The genetical and physical mappings revealed by this study represent a significant extension of the current knowledge of the equine genome map.
