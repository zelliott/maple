Recent epidemiological studies on Streptococcus suis infections in pigs indicated that, besides serotypes 1, 2 and 9, serotype 7 is also frequently associated with diseased animals. For the latter serotype, however, no rapid and sensitive diagnostic methods are available. This hampers prevention and control programs. Here, we describe the development of a type-specific PCR test for the rapid and sensitive detection of S. suis serotype 7. The test is based on DNA sequences of capsular (cps) genes specific for serotype 7. These sequences were identified by cross-hybridization of several individual cps genes with the chromosomal DNAs of 35 different S. suis serotypes.
