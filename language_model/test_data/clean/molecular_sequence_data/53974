A single vanD-containing Enterococcus faecium strain (N97-330) was isolated in Canada. The vanD-containing region was cloned and sequenced. Although the proteins have more than 96% identity to a previously described vanD region in BM4339, the vanS(D) gene contains a frameshift mutation that leads to a predicted truncated protein. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the ddl gene revealed the presence of an IS982-like element (ISEfm1) which interrupted the D-Ala-D-Ala ligase. This suggested the constitutive expression of the vanD operon, which was confirmed. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis fingerprinting demonstrated that BM4339 was not related to N97-330 (>15 band differences). Both strains contained multiple copies of the IS982-like element.
