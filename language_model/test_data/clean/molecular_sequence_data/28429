A DNA clone of HIV-1, JH3, was isolated from a Japanese patient with hemophilia and the gag and env genes were sequenced. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were similar to those reported and showed high divergence in the env gene, particularly in the extracellular domain of the env. The genetic variation of JH3 isolated from a Mongolian was within the range of those of isolates from whites and blacks. The gag and env polypeptides were efficiently expressed in E. coli as fusion proteins with beta-galactosidase, and the products were shown to be useful as diagnostic reagents.
