Serological surveys for small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) infections have revealed seropositive sheep in several mixed herds, where sheep are kept together with seropositive goats. Here we have examined the genetic relationships in LTR, pol and env surface unit (SU) and the growth patterns in goat (GSM) and sheep (FOS) synovial membrane cell cultures of SRLV isolates obtained from both mixed and single species herds. Phylogenetic analyses of pol and env SU revealed that Norwegian SRLVs derived from both goat and sheep in mixed herds are distributed into group C, while isolates obtained from unmixed sheep flocks cluster in group A, together with maedi-visna-like representatives of the A1 subtype. In this study, the direction of group C virus transmission is proposed to be from goat to sheep. The replication efficiency in GSM and FOS cultures and the cytopathic phenotype induced by the SRLV isolates gave no indication of any species-specific characteristics. No particular nucleotide sequences of the LTR-U3 region or env SU were identified that could be related to cytopathic phenotype. This study shows that sheep in Norway harbour SRLVs belonging to phylogenetic groups A and C, and this provides further evidence for cross-species infection being a regular characteristic of SRLVs, which may represent an important source for viral persistence.
