A peptide identical in structure to the carboxyl-terminal flanking nonapeptide of rat progastrin, predicted by cDNA sequence, was synthesized. The synthetic peptide was used for production of a rabbit antiserum. This antiserum was used to develop a radioimmunoassay specific for rat carboxyl terminal flanking peptide. This assay was used to monitor the purification of immunoreactivity from rat antral extracts. Gel permeation, anion exchange and reverse phase chromatography steps resulted in a single absorbance peak associated with the carboxyl terminal flanking peptide immunoreactivity. The purified peptide eluted in the same position as the synthetic peptide during all three types of chromatography. This material was shown to be identical in mass to Ser-Ala-Glu-Glu-Glu-Asp-Gln-Tyr-Asn, the predicted sequence of the carboxyl terminal nonapeptide of rat progastrin.
