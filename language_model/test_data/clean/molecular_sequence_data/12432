Perinatal infection with variants of hepatitis B virus occurs despite combined immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B immunoglobulin and currently licensed plasma-derived and recombinant yeast hepatitis B vaccines. Several variants have been detected during a large study of infants born to carrier mothers in Singapore. The most frequent variant was a virus in which a single amino acid substitution Gly to Arg occurred at amino acid position 145 of the outer protein coat of the virus. Similar mutations have been described in Italy, Japan, the USA and a number of other countries. The emergence of antibody escape mutants is a cause for concern for the detection of virus and possibly for future immunization programmes.
