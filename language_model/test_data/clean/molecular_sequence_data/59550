Homologous regions were revealed and analyzed within the first intron of the mouse and human mts1 genes. Maximal homology was detected between microsatellite DNA sequences from the first intron of the mouse gene (+804, +863) and the human gene (+600, +645). DNase I hypersensitive sites were revealed within these regions in both mouse and human cell lines tested, thus showing functional significance of the homology detected. In both the mouse and the human genes, the 5' end of homologous regions is flanked by a DNA sequence similar to a NF-kB/Rel protein-binding consensus sequence. Previously, this sequence was demonstrated to be involved in a complex regulatory element of the mouse mts1 gene. In comparison with the kB-like sequence, mouse, rat, and human sequences were found to involve one, two, and three nucleotide substitutions, respectively. Alterations in a spectrum of nuclear proteins bound to various kB-like sequences were analyzed. Possible effects of these alterations on mts1 transcription regulation were discussed. The possibility of the human kB-like sequence to function as positive regulator of transcription initiation was demonstrated in vivo.
