To screen and identify the serum biomarker of anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding (ADUB), to determine the expression of biomarker protein in menses of ADUB patients, and to investigate the relation between ADUB and the biomarker proteins.

Subjects included 128 ADUB patients and 93 age-matched controls(normal women). Their serum and supernatant of mense were collected and stored for use at -80 degree. The differential proteins in the serum of the 2 groups were detected by CM10 and analyzed by Biomarker Wizard 3.2 software. Then, the differential proteins were identified by Tricine-SDS-PAGE gel separation, spectrometry identification, and immunoprecipitation. The expression of the protein identified above in the menses was tested by ELISA, RT-PCR, and Western blotting. SPSS 14.1 was applied for statistical analysis and chart drawing.

Five differential protein peaks were screened and their peak values were 11.80, 13.59, 13.79, 13.85, and 14.20 km/z, respectively. The intensity of protein peak (11.80 km/z) which was identified as serum amyploid protein A (SAA) of ADUB was significantly higher than that of the controls (P<0.05). While the intensity of protein peak (13.59 km/z ) which was identified as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) of ADUB was obviously lower than that of the controls (P<0.05). The intensity of protein peak 13.08, 13.85, and 14.20 was not different between the cases and controls. SAA expressed highly in the menses of ADUB but low in that of the controls. Conversely, VEGF expressed highly in the menses of the control but low in that of the ADUB.

Two biomarkers which might be related with ADUB have been correctly screened and identified as SAA and VEGF. It needs further study whether the increased expression of SAA and reduced expression of VEGF are the cause or result of ADUB.
