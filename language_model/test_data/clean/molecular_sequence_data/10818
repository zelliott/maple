Vectors derived from adeno-associated virus (AAV) have the potential to stably transduce mammalian cells by integrating into host chromosomes. Despite active research on the use of AAV vectors for gene therapy, the structure of integrated vector proviruses has not previously been analyzed at the DNA sequence level. Studies on the integration of wild-type AAV have identified a common site-specific integration locus on human chromosome 19; however, most AAV vectors do not appear to integrate at this locus. To improve our understanding of AAV vector integration, we analyzed the DNA sequences of several integrated vector proviruses. HeLa cells were transduced with an AAV shuttle vector, and integrated proviruses containing flanking human DNA were recovered as bacterial plasmids for further analysis. We found that AAV vectors integrated as single-copy proviruses at random chromosomal locations and that the flanking HeLa DNA at integration sites was not homologous to AAV or the site-specific integration locus of wild-type AAV. Recombination junctions were scattered throughout the vector terminal repeats with no apparent site specificity. None of the integrated vectors were fully intact. Vector proviruses with nearly intact terminal repeats were excised and amplified after infection with wild-type AAV and adenovirus. Our results suggest that AAV vectors integrate by nonhomologous recombination after partial degradation of entering vector genomes. These findings have important implications for the mechanism of AAV vector integration and the use of these vectors in human gene therapy.
