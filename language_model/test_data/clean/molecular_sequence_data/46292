Sotos syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome characterized by distinctive facial features, developmental delay, and macrocephaly. Here, we present a 10-year-old girl with prenatal and postnatal overgrowth, prominent forehead, pointed chin, and advanced bone age. She also has a persistent falcine sinus in the posterior falx cerebri, patent ductus arteriosus, unilateral renal agenesis, and scoliosis. A pituitary macroadenoma was also found with external compression of the inferior aspect of the optic chiasm. We identified a de novo missense mutation of the NSD1 (nuclear receptor-binding SET domain protein 1) gene in this patient. Computational three-dimensional structural analysis revealed that the NSD1 mutation induced major alterations.
