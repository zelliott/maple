Diminished cellular responsiveness to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is frequently correlated with decreased transcription of the type II receptor for TGF-beta (TGF-beta RII). We have cloned and characterized the human TGF-beta RII promoter and, using S1 nuclease mapping and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction, have identified five alternative transcription start sites within the region -33 to +57. DNA transfection experiments and electrophoretic mobility shift assays have revealed the existence of five distinct regulatory regions including two positive regulatory elements and two negative regulatory elements in addition to the core promoter region. The first positive regulatory element (-219 to -172) interacts with two distinct nuclear protein complexes, at least one of which appears to be a previously unidentified transcription factor. The second positive regulatory element (+1 to +35) also interacts with two separate protein complexes, both of which appear to be novel transcription factors. Deletion of either positive regulatory element markedly decreased expression of the target gene, suggesting that both positive regulatory elements are necessary for basal expression levels of TGF-beta RII.
