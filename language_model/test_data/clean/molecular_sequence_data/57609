Pyocins S1 and S2 are S-type bacteriocins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with different receptor recognition specificities. The genetic determinants of these pyocins have been cloned from the chromosomes of P. aeruginosa NIH-H and PAO, respectively. Each determinant constitutes an operon encoding two proteins of molecular weights 65,600 and 10,000 (pyocin S1) or 74,000 and 10,000 (pyocin S2) with a characteristic sequence (P box), a possible regulatory element involved in the induction of pyocin production, in the 5' upstream region. These pyocins have almost identical primary sequences; only the amino-terminal portions of the large proteins are substantially different. The sequence homology suggests that pyocins S1 and S2, like pyocin AP41, originated from a common ancestor of the E2 group colicins. Purified pyocins S1 and S2 make up a complex of the two proteins. Both pyocins cause breakdown of chromosomal DNA as well as complete inhibition of lipid synthesis in sensitive cells. The large protein, but not the pyocin complex, shows in vitro DNase activity. This activity is inhibited by the small protein of either pyocin. Putative domain structures of these pyocins and their killing mechanism are discussed.
