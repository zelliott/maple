Self-incompatibility (SI) enables flowering plants to discriminate between self- and non-self-pollen. In Brassica, SI is controlled by the highly polymorphic S locus. The recently identified male determinant, termed SP11 or SCR, is thought to be the ligand of S receptor kinase, the female determinant. To examine functional and evolutionary properties of SP11, we cloned 14 alleles from class-I S haplotypes of Brassica campestris and carried out sequence analyses. The sequences of mature SP11 proteins are highly divergent, except for the presence of conserved cysteines. The phylogenetic trees suggest possible co-evolution of the genes encoding the male and female determinants.
