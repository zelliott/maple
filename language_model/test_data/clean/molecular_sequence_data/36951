Previously, we have reported that conjugation of antisense oligonucleotides to poly(L-lysine) (PLL) lowers their inhibitory concentration in several biological models. We have now tested these conjugates for inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. PLL-conjugated oligonucleotides complementary to the translation initiation site of Tat protein protect cells from the cytopathic effect of HIV-1 in acute infection assays. The EC50 of conjugates is approximately 0.15 microM, which represents a strong reduction in concentration as compared to nonconjugated oligonucleotides (EC50 = 20 microM). In contrast with most reports in the literature, we have observed sequence specific antiviral effects with PLL conjugates. This was particularly noteworthy in antiviral experiments performed with HIV-1 isolates presenting heterogeneity in the 5' end of the tat mRNA sequence. Two mismatches at the target site were sufficient to reduce very significantly the antiviral activity of the conjugates but did not modify the effect of nonconjugated oligonucleotides. Unlike free oligonucleotides, PLL-conjugated ones do not interfere with virus penetration and/or reverse transcription as demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of viral DNA.
