Bid protein, a member of the "BH3-only" subgroup of Bcl-2 family, plays a critical role in mammalian apoptosis regulation. In this study, we have cloned the chicken Bid gene, which encodes a 193 amino acid protein and shares 40% homology with human and mouse Bid proteins. Bid sequence comparison emphasises the conservation of both the functional domain BH3 and the proteolytic cleavage sites. An induction of apoptosis by chicken Bid and the cleavage of the protein, after TNFalpha treatment, were also demonstrated. In addition, mRNA Bid expression was detected along all embryo stages and tissues examined, suggesting a role for this protein in the developmental process. This is the first report demonstrating the functionality of a "BH3-only" protein in chicken.
