DP IV and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in thymus-derived lymphocytes of rats was assayed in vitro. The DP IV activity was measured fluorimetrically by hydrolysis of Leu-Pro-AMC, and the SOD activity by the inhibition of autooxidation of L-adrenaline. In order of their competitive inhibitory potency the following peptides were tested against DP IV and SOD activity: Ile-Pro-Ile (diprotin A), Val-Pro-Leu (diprotin B), Ile-Pro, Leu-Pro, Val-Pro, Tyr-D--Ala-Ala-Pro, Phe-Pro, Tyr-Pro, Ala-Ala-Pro and Gly-Pro. The peptides, in the order of their potency against DP IV, were effective to inhibit the SOD activity in T lymphocytes. Zn2+ ions exerted an inhibition on both DP IV and SOD activity in a near equimolar concentration. The involvement of Zn2+ as well as the peptides liberated by hydrolysis of polypeptides in regulation of cell-mediated immune responses has been discussed.
