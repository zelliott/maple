The three-dimensional structure of the fMet-tRNA(fMet) -binding domain of translation initiation factor IF2 from Bacillus stearothermophilus has been determined by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Its structure consists of six antiparallel beta-strands, connected via loops, and forms a closed beta-barrel similar to domain II of elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G, despite low sequence homology. Two structures of the ternary complexes of the EF-Tu small middle dotaminoacyl-tRNA small middle dot GDP analogue have been reported and were used to propose and discuss the possible fMet-tRNA(fMet)-binding site of IF2.
