We have studied the DNA binding properties of a polypeptide consisting of the carboxyl terminal 37% of UL9, the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) origin of replication binding protein. Using a Sindbis virus expression system, we expressed and partially purified this truncated form of UL9 (UL9CT) which contains the site-specific DNA binding domain. UL9CT specifically recognized UL9 binding sites on a 200 base pair DNA fragment containing the HSV origin ori(s) and appeared to bind as a dimer to each site. DNAse I footprint analysis showed that UL9CT protected the two high affinity binding sites of ori(s), but unlike full-length UL9, UL9CT did not induce a conformational change in the origin. Addition of anti-UL9CT antibody to the UL9CT-origin complex, however, caused a conformational change in the origin to be evident. Our results suggest that a domain, or domains, in the amino terminus are necessary for a UL9-induced origin conformational change to occur and that UL9-UL9 interactions between binding sites are involved.
