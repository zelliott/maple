A gene (EGL2) encoding an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase in peas has been cloned as a homologue of EGL1. EGL2 encodes a polypeptide of 506 amino acids, including a 24-mer putative signal polypeptide. The gene product contains a domain conserved in endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (family 9) showing 60% amino acid identity to EGL1. EGL2 mRNA was accumulated only in the elongating regions of pea stems, although EGL1 mRNA was abundant in both elongating and non-elongating tissues. However, the level of EGL2 mRNA was not increased by the treatment with sucrose and auxin in pea segments. These results suggest that the expression of EGL2 either requires the presence of other factors related to the auxin effect or occurs independent of auxin in the elongating pea stems.
