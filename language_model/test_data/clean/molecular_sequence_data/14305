Bluetongue virus serotype 2 (IND2003/02) was isolated in Tiruneveli City, Tamil Nadu State, India, and is stored in the Orbivirus Reference Collection at the Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright, United Kingdom. The entire genome of this isolate was sequenced, showing that it is composed of a total of 19,203 bp (all 10 genome segments). This is the first report of the entire genome sequence of a western strain of BTV-2 isolated in India, indicating that this virus has been introduced and is circulating in the region. These data will aid in the development of diagnostics and molecular epidemiology studies of BTV-2 in the subcontinent.
