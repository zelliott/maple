Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the major cause of failure in cancer chemotherapy. Recent reports even suggest that MDR is associated with elevated invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. In the current study, we used a proteomic approach to identify genes that play an important role in MDR induced cell migration. 2D-PAGE and MALDI-TOF/MS-based proteomics approach were used to separate and identify differentially expressed proteins between MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR, a p-glycoprotein-overexpressing adriamycin-resistance breast cancer cell line. Annexin a2 (Anxa2) was identified as highly expressed in MCF-7/ADR cells, but not in MCF-7 cells. Small interference RNA-mediated gene suppression demonstrated that Anxa2 was required for enhanced cell proliferation and invasion of the MCF-7/ADR cells. Down-regulation of Anxa2 alone was not sufficient to revert the cell sensitivity to adriamycin, suggesting that Anxa2 was not required for MDR phenotype. Taken together, our results showed that expression of Anxa2 is enhanced when cancer cells, MCF-7, acquired drug resistance and it plays an essential role in MDR-induced tumor invasion.
