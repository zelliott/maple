Von Willebrand disease (vWD) is a common inherited bleeding disorder in humans, and can be divided into a mild (type 1) and severe (type 3) form. Previous linkage studies identified one subject with vWD type 1 who transmitted different alleles of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) gene to his two affected children, one having vWD type 3 and the other having type 1. By screening the promoter and coding sequence (52 exons) of the vWF gene, three missense mutations were detected in this family. The type 1 individual who transmitted different alleles of the gene to his two sick children carries two substitutions, one in exon 5 and the other in exon 18 on the respective alleles. The relationship between the genotype (mutations) and the phenotype in this family is complex. In order further to correlate the relationship in vWD type 1 individuals, fifty-five subjects who carry one null allele of the vWF gene were collected. All these subjects are from vWD type 3 families with known mutations. Biochemical data of these 55 subjects indicate that gene dosage and other factors, such as blood group, age, and environment factors, play a critical role in the development of the phenotype of the disease.
