Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites were transformed with the coding sequence of the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of the primate malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi. A single inoculation of live transformed tachyzoites elicited an antibody response directed against the immunodominant repeat epitope (EQPAAGAGG)2 of the P. knowlesi CS protein in rhesus monkeys. Notably, these animals failed to show a positive serum conversion against T. gondii. Antibodies against Toxoplasma antigens were detected only after a second inoculation with a higher number of transformed tachyzoites. This boost induced an increased antibody response against the P. knowlesi CS protein associated with immunoglobulin class switching, thus demonstrating the establishment of immunological memory. These results indicate that the Toxoplasma-derived CS protein is efficiently recognized by the monkey immune system and represents an immunodominant antigen in transformed parasites.
