Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA)-6 is essential for EBV-induced immortalization of primary human B-lymphocytes in vitro. Previous studies have shown that EBNA-6 acts as a transcriptional regulator of viral and cellular genes; however at present, few functional domains of the 140 kDa EBNA-6 protein have been completely characterized. There are five computer-predicted nuclear localization signals (NLS), four monopartite and one bipartite, present in the EBNA-6 amino acid sequence. To identify which of these NLS are functional, fusion proteins between green fluorescent protein and deletion constructs of EBNA-6 were expressed in HeLa cells. Each of the constructs containing at least one of the NLS was targeted to the nucleus of cells whereas a construct lacking all of the NLS was cytoplasmic. Site-directed mutation of these NLS demonstrated that only three of the NLS were functional, one at the N-terminal end (aa 72-80), one in the middle (aa 412-418) and one at the C-terminal end (aa 939-945) of the EBNA-6 protein.
