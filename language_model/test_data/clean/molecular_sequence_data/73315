Electrophoretic analysis of the proteins bound to poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid), PHB-, granules in Methylobacterium extorquens, M. rhodesianum as well as the PHB-leaky mutants Mu 1 and Mu 11, which were isolated from the latter, resulted in two dominant low-molecular weight proteins, which were referred to as GA11 and GA20. After purification of these proteins antibodies against the GA11 and GA20 protein of M. extorquens were obtained. Both proteins bound to the surface of PHB granules as revealed by immunoelectron microscopy of whole cells of M. extorquens and M. rhodesianum. With cells of the PHB-leaky mutants Mu 1 and Mu 11 no specific labeling was observed. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the GA11 and the GA20 protein were determined. We found significant homologies between the sequences of the investigated strains. The use of oligonucleotide probes based on the N-terminal sequences of the GA20 protein from M. rhodesianum to identify the corresponding structural genes in various genomic libraries failed.
