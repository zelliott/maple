Recent advances in genetic studies have elucidated structure of gonadotropin receptors. This transmembrane receptor contains seven transmembrane domains and induces multiple biological changes in granulosa/theca cells resulting in follicular maturation in women. The signal transduction involves G protein mediated systems, cAMP mediated systems and phospholipase C systems. This paper reviews recent advances in gonadotropin receptor system and its signal transduction pathway.
