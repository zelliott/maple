A facultatively anaerobic, Gram-staining-negative, pale red-pigmented, non-motile, rod-shaped, moderately halophilic bacterium, designated strain YIM J14(T), was isolated from a sediment sample from a salt mine in Yunnan, south-western China. Growth occurred at NaCl concentrations of between 2 % and 15 % (w/v) and optimally with 5-9 % NaCl. The optimum temperature and pH for growth of the strain were 28 °C and pH 7.5. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0, anteiso-C15 : 0 and iso-C17 : 1ω9c/10-methyl-C16 : 0. The polar lipid profile was composed predominantly of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine and one unknown phospholipid. Minor amounts of other lipids were also detectable. The genomic DNA G+C content was 47.2 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons indicated that strain YIM J14(T) was related to Gracilimonas tropica in the phylum Bacteroidetes. The level of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strain YIM J14(T) and Gracilimonas tropica CL-CB462(T) was 96.9 %. A DNA-DNA hybridization experiment between strain YIM J14(T) and Gracilimonas tropica indicated levels of relatedness of 28 %. Chemotaxonomic data supported the placement of strain YIM J14(T) in the genus Gracilimonas. DNA-DNA hybridization and biochemical and physiological characterization allowed strain YIM J14(T) to be differentiated from Gracilimonas tropica. It is therefore considered to represent a novel species of the genus Gracilimonas, for which the name Gracilimonas mengyeensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain YIM J14(T) ( = ACCC 10717(T) = DSM 21985(T)).
