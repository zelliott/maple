Phytanic acid (3,7,10,14-tetramethylhexadecanoic acid) is a branched-chain fatty acid which is known to accumulate in a number of different genetic diseases including Refsum disease. Due to the presence of a methyl-group at the 3-position, phytanic acid and other 3-methyl fatty acids can not undergo beta-oxidation but are first subjected to fatty acid alpha-oxidation in which the terminal carboxyl-group is released as CO(2). The mechanism of alpha-oxidation has long remained obscure but has been resolved in recent years. Furthermore, peroxisomes have been found to play an indispensable role in fatty acid alpha-oxidation, and the complete alpha-oxidation machinery is probably localized in peroxisomes. This Review describes the current state of knowledge about fatty acid alpha-oxidation in mammals with particular emphasis on the mechanism involved and the enzymology of the pathway.
