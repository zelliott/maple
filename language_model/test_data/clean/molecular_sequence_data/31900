In this work M. galloprovincialis and O. edulis specimens were surveyed for a pathological study in the Gulf of Naples (Mediterranean sea, Campania Region, southern Italy). Clusters of Nocardia sp.-like cells were observed in histological slides. PCR amplification, sequencing and in situ hybridization were carried out in order to corroborate Nocardia species identification for both hosts. Blast results showed a 99% of maximum identity with Nocardia crassostreae sequences in Genbank. This is the first report of N. crassostreae in the new host M. galloprovincialis and, in a new area, the Mediterranean Sea.
