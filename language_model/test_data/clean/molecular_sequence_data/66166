VP1, a putative alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide (alpha-AMP) inhibited growth of Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli at 500microM. The peptide induced stable surface pressure changes in monolayers formed from B. subtilis native lipid extract (circa 4.5mNm(-1)) but transient pressure changes in corresponding E. coli monolayers (circa 1.0mNm(-1)), which led to monolayer disintegration. Synthetic lipid monolayers mimetic of the extracts were used to generate compression isotherms. Thermodynamic analysis of B. subtilis isotherms indicated membrane stabilisation by VP1 (DeltaG(Mix)<0), via a mechanism dependent upon the phosphatidylglycerol to cardiolipin ratio. Corresponding analysis of E. coli isotherms indicated membrane destabilisation by the peptide (DeltaG(Mix)>0). Destabilisation correlated with PE levels present and appeared to involve a mechanism resembling those used by tilted peptides. These data emphasise that structure/function analysis of alpha-AMPs must consider not only their structural characteristics but also the lipid make-up of the target microbial membrane.
