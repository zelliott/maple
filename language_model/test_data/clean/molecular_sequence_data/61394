Circulating platelets, essential for thrombosis and hemostasis, originate from megakaryocytes. Megakaryocyte growth, differentiation and survival processes are regulated by the c-Mpl receptor ligand. In the current study we used differential display to identify part of the program of genes regulated during Mpl ligand-induced murine megakaryocyte differentiation. Several of the genes, including the retinoblastoma binding protein p84, were found to be induced, while others were repressed. One such repressed gene was identified as a TATA-binding protein (TBP)-Associated Factor (TAF) family member, TAF(II)32, previously reported to be upregulated during apoptosis. Our analysis of various cell types suggested that the previously identified species homologs, human TAF(II)32 and murine TAF(II)32, are in fact different isoforms, which we propose to re-name TAF(II)32alpha and TAF(II)32beta, respectively. Only the TAF(II)32beta isoform is regulated during Mpl ligand-induced megakaryocyte differentiation, which suggests individual roles for the two forms.
