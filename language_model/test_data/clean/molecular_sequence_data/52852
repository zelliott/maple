The astacin-related metalloproteases Bone Morphogenetic Protein-1 (BMP1) and Tolloid possess multiple functions in the maturation of extracellular matrices containing fibrillar collagens. We are interested in developing an in-vitro model system to study the role of BMP1 and Tolloid in chondrocytes and osteoblasts. Cloning of the cDNAs for chick BMP1 and Tolloid reveals that the two gene products are more than 80% identical to their human and mouse homologs and are similarly derived from the same genetic locus. Anti-BMP1/Tolloid antibodies have been developed, and detect two proteins of 80 and 116kDa. Chick BMP1 and Tolloid message and proteins are found in a variety of embryonic and juvenile tissues, including chondrocytes and osteoblasts. Tolloid message and protein are generally less abundant than BMP1 message; this discrepancy is greatest in growth plate chondrocytes. Tolloid protein is more tightly bound than BMP1 to the extracellular matrix produced by cultured osteoblasts. The Chordin gene is also expressed in chondrocytes and osteoblasts, suggesting that BMP1 and Tolloid influence BMP signaling as well as matrix maturation during skeletogenesis.
