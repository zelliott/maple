Pectin esterases (PE, EC 3.1.1.11) catalyse the demethylation of pectin. As a result of its activity, structural interactions among cell wall components during cell wall turnover and loosening are affected. In plants, PEs are typically encoded by a gene family. This family has been studied in strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) in order to investigate the role of distinct PE genes during fruit ripening and senescence. By a combination of a PCR-based library screening and RT-PCR four different strawberry PE cDNAs, termed FaPE1 to FaPE4, have been isolated. Differential expression of each FaPE gene in various organs and during fruit development was revealed by northern blot. FaPE1 is specifically expressed in fruit, showing an increasing expression during the ripening process up to a maximum in the turning stage. Concerning hormone regulation, auxin treatment increased FaPE1 mRNA levels in green fruit, whereas exogenous ethylene decreased FaPE1 mRNA levels in ripe and senescing fruits. It is proposed that this repression of FaPE1 expression could be involved in textural changes occurring during fruit senescence.
