The master two-dimensional gel database of human colon carcinoma cells currently lists cellular proteins from normal crypts and the colorectal cancer cell lines LIM 1863, LIM 1215 and LIM 1899 (Ward et al., Electrophoresis 1990, 11, 883-891; Ji et al., Electrophoresis 1994, 15, 391-405). Updated two-dimensional electrophoretic (2-DE) maps of cellular proteins from LIM 1215 cells, acquired under both nonreducing and reducing conditions, are presented. Fifteen cellular proteins are identified in the reducing 2-DE gel map, and seven in the nonreducing gel map, along with a tabular listing of their M(r)/pI loci and mode of identification. We also include our mass spectrometric based procedures for identifying 2-DE resolved proteins. This procedure relies on a combination of capillary column (0.10-0.32 mm internal diameter) reversed-phase HPLC peptide mapping of in-gel digested proteins, peptide mass fingerprinting, sequence analysis by either collision-induced dissociation or post-source-decay fragmentation, and protein identification using available database search algorithms. These data, and descriptions of the micro-techniques employed in this laboratory for identifying 2-DE resolved proteins can be accessed via the internet URL: http:(/)/www.ludwig.edu.au.
