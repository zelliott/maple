In order to determine important bases at two single-stranded regions [SSrA (726-731 nt) and SSrB (762-766)] derived mainly from secondary structure models in genomic hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme possessing self-cleavage activity, we have constructed several point mutants at these two regions on the HDV88 molecule (683-770). Among the bases at SSrA and SSrB regions C763 was found to play an essential role during self-cleavage process since substitutions to any other bases viz. A or G or U completely abolished the activity.
