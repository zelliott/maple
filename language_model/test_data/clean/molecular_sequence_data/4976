Streptomycin- and sulfonamide-resistant Erwinia amylovora CA3R from California contained an 8.7-kb plasmid, pEa8.7, with a sulII-strA-strB resistance region; furthermore, PCR, sequencing, hybridization, and restriction analyses showed that pEa8.7 was closely related or identical to broad-host-range plasmid RSF1010. Although RSF1010 has been found in a variety of bacteria, this is the first report of its presence in plant pathogenic bacteria.
