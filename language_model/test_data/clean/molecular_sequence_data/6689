The beta 1-6 structure of N-linked oligosaccharides, formed by beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT-V), is associated with metastatic potential. We established a highly metastatic subclone, B16-hm, from low metastatic B16-F1 murine melanoma cells. The gene encoding beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT-III) was introduced into the B16-hm cells, and three clones that stably expressed high GnT-III activity were obtained. In these transfectants, the affinity to leukoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin was reduced, whereas the binding to erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin was increased, indicating that the level of beta 1-6 structure was decreased due to competition for substrate between intrinsic GnT-V and ectopically expressed GnT-III. Lung metastasis after intravenous injection of the transfectants into syngeneic and nude mice was significantly suppressed, suggesting that the decrease in beta 1-6 structure suppressed metastasis via a mechanism independent of the murine system. These transfectants also displayed decreased invasiveness into Matrigel and inhibited cell attachment to collagen and laminin. Cell growth was not affected. Our results demonstrate a causative role for beta 1-6 branches in invasion and cell attachment in the extravasation stage of metastasis.
