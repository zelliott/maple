Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most frequent cancer encountered in children. Little is known about the molecular pathology of childhood T cell ALL. Oncogenesis is a multistep process that involves alterations in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Recently, a mutator phenotype detectable by microsatellite instabilities was shown to be associated with predisposition to cancer. This new mechanism for human carcinogenesis is caused by defects in the DNA replication/repair system. To study the involvement of some of these mutational events in the development of T cell ALL, we have initiated a systematic search for losses of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite instabilities in children affected with this disease. These patients were allelotyped by PCR using 56 microsatellite markers located near known or putative tumor suppressor genes. The microsatellite patterns were altered in more than 80% of the patients. LOH were detected in chromosomes 6p, 12p and 9p. Two third of the patients were deleted for chromosome 9p21, suggesting the involvement of a tumor suppressor gene, probably the p16 gene. The only patient refractory to chemotherapy was shown to be associated with a mutator phenotype. This is the first documented case of a childhood neoplasia associated with genomic instabilities. Our results suggest that defects in DNA replication/repair components are involved in the development of a subset of childhood T cell ALL.
