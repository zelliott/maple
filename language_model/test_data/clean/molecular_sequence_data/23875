A large gene family encoding proteins with a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motif exists in flowering plants but not in algae, fungi, or animals. This suggests that PPR protein genes expanded vastly during the evolution of the land plants. To investigate this possibility, we analysed PPR protein genes in the basal land plant, the moss Physcomitrella patens. An extensive survey of the Physcomitrella expressed sequence tag (EST) databases revealed 36 ESTs encoding PPR proteins. This indicates that a large gene family of PPR proteins originated before the divergence of the vascular plant and moss lineages. We also characterized five full-length cDNAs encoding PPR proteins, designated PPR513-10, PPR566-6, PPR868-14, PPR986-12, and PPR423-6. Intracellular localization analysis demonstrated two PPR proteins in chloroplasts (cp), whereas the cellular localization of the other three PPR proteins is unclear. The genes of the cp-localized PPR513-10 and PPR566-6 were expressed differentially in protonemata grown under different light-dark conditions, suggesting they have distinctive functions in cp. This is the first report and analysis of genes encoding PPR proteins in bryophytes.
