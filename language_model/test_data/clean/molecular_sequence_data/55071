Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a mixture of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented macules localized on the back of the extremities and caused by the mutations in the DSRAD gene.

Two Chinese pedigrees of typical DSH were subjected to mutation detection in DSRAD. Direct sequencing of all PCR products of the whole coding regions of DSRAD was performed to identify the mutation.

The c.1615delG (p.V539fs) mutation was found in the affected members but not in the healthy individuals in family 1 and the c.ins1372-9 CCACAGAT (p.D458fs) mutation was found in patients but not in the healthy members of family 2.

Our study found two novel frameshift mutations in the DSRAD gene. We add new variants to the knowledge of DSRAD mutations in DSH.
