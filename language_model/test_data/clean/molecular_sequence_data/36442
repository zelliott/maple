The copy number of the genes encoding 16S ribosomal RNA was analysed for the genomes of geographically diverse strains of Helicobacter pylori, and restriction site variation within and around the genes was characterized. A DNA probe of 550 bp was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA of the type strain NCTC 11637. This probe constituted a sequence internal to the 3' end of the 16S rrn gene. Homology profiles were compared for genomic Southern blots made with four restriction enzymes cutting within and outside the probe sequence. A copy number of two was established for all 12 strains analysed. This approach yielded significantly simpler data than does conventional 'ribotyping ' of H. pylori. It was equally discriminatory, however, and provided strain-specific 16S rrn gene 'signatures'. These represent both fundamental physical-genetic information and a novel approach to typing this gastric pathogen.
