Rat and human steroid sulfatases were purified from liver and placenta, respectively, by the same procedure. The rat and human enzymes were solubilized with Triton X-100, and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography with a monoclonal antibody showing high binding activities to both the enzymes. They were further purified by high-pressure anion-exchange chromatography to compare their structural and catalytic properties. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that both enzymes had a molecular weight of 62,000. The enzymes had similar amino acid compositions and amino-terminal amino acid sequences. Significant differences of the optimum pH, Michaelis constant and maximum velocity were observed between these enzymes. The optimum pH of each enzyme varied from 6.0 to 8.0, depending on substrates and with or without Triton X-100. In detergent-free media, steroid sulfates competitively inhibited the ability of these enzymes to hydrolyze 4-nitrophenyl sulfate. In media containing Triton X-100, on the other hand, the inhibition types of the steroid sulfates on the hydrolyzing activities of the rat and human enzymes were noncompetitive- and mixed-types, respectively.
