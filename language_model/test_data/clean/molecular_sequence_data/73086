Genes that regulate the serotonin (5-HT) system including 5-HT receptors may be involved in mood disorders. We studied 5-HT2A receptor exons and the adjacent intron regions in 102 patients with mood disorders (71 depressive disorders and 31 bipolar disorders). In 34 mood disorder cases, the gene encoding the 5-HT1A receptor had been sequenced, but no disease-specific polymorphism was found. The substitution of C for T at position 102 in exon 1, which had been reported by Warren et al., was confirmed. The corresponding amino acid, serine, did not change. The allele frequency of C [corrected] at position 102 was significantly higher in patients with depressive disorders than in those with bipolar disorders and healthy control subjects. Furthermore, the mean age of onset in the patients heterozyous for the T and C alleles was lower than that in those homozygous for the C allele. No other polymorphism in the gene was found.
