The nonstructural nef gene product of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), p27, is a regulatory "early phase" protein produced by HIV-infected cells. As a possible negative regulator of transcription, it has been suggested that p27 may be involved in the control of HIV proviral latency. Immune reactivity to p27 may result in early destruction of HIV-replicating cells before viral assembly or of latently infected cells. It appeared, thus, of interest to investigate the immunogenicity of the molecule in chimpanzees immunized against HIV antigens. Two of the six chimpanzees that were injected with soluble recombinant p27 in association with other HIV proteins, displayed significant and sustained T-helper lymphocyte proliferative responses to p27 and to the other antigens. Using a set of synthetic peptides spanning the entire p27 sequence, two T-cell epitopes could be located: one within the last 20 amino-acids of the C terminus of the molecule, the other around the region of residues 118-122. Sera from the same animals also reacted to p27 in a radioimmunoassay as well as to some of the peptides in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Sequential B-cell epitopes could thus be determined as being located in the regions of amino acids: 17-35, 52-66, and 185-205. The results obtained with peptides spanning the region between amino acid residues 65 and 172 indicate that at least two additional B-cell epitopes were present in the region comprised between amino acid 65 and 146. Interestingly, the extreme C terminus of the molecule encompasses both immunodominant T- and B-cell epitopes. Taken together, these observations should prove useful for the rational design of a HIV vaccine.
