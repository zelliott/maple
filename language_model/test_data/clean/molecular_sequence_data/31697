A Gram-negative, aerobic, non-flagellated, non-gliding and rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated M-M16(T), was isolated from seashore sand around a seaweed farm on the South Sea, South Korea, and its taxonomic position was investigated by using a polyphasic study. Strain M-M16(T) grew optimally at 30 Â°C, at pH 7.0-8.0 and in the presence of 2 % (w/v) NaCl. Strain M-M16(T) exhibited the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values to the type strains of Gaetbulibacter lutimaris (96.5 %) and Flaviramulus basaltis (95.8 %). Neighbour-joining and maximum-parsimony phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain M-M16(T) clustered with the type strains of Gaetbulibacter species and F. basaltis. Strain M-M16(T) contained MK-6 as the predominant menaquinone and iso-C15:1 G, iso-C15:0 and iso-C17:0 3-OH as the major fatty acids. The major polar lipids detected in strain M-M16(T) were phosphatidylethanolamine and one unidentified lipid. The DNA G+C content of strain M-M16(T) was 37.4 mol%. The phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic data and other phenotypic properties revealed that strain M-M16(T) represents a novel genus and species within the family Flavobacteriaceae, for which the name Sabulilitoribacter multivorans gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of S. multivorans is M-M16(T) (= KCTC 32326(T) = CCUG 63831(T)).
