The gating characteristics of two ion channels in the inward-rectifier K+ channel superfamily were compared at the single-channel level. The strong inward rectifier IRK1 (Kir 2.1) opened and closed with kinetics that were slow relative to those of the weakly rectifying ROMK2 (Kir 1.1b). At a membrane potential of -60 mV, both IRK and ROMK had single-exponential open-time distributions, with mean open times of 279 +/- 58 ms (n = 4) for IRK1 and 23 +/- 1 ms (n = 7) for ROMK. At -60 mV (and no EDTA) ROMK2 had two closed times: 1.3 +/- 0.1 and 36 +/- 3 ms (n = 7). Under the same conditions, IRK1 exhibited four discrete closed states with mean closed times of 0.8 +/- 0.1 ms, 14 +/- 0.6 ms, 99 +/- 19 ms, and 2744 +/- 640 ms (n = 4). Both the open and the three shortest closed-time constants of IRK1 decreased monotonically with membrane hyperpolarization. IRK1 open probability (Po) decreased sharply with hyperpolarization due to an increase in the frequency of long closed events that were attributable to divalent-cation blockade. Chelation of divalent cations with EDTA eliminated the slowest closed-time distribution of IRK1 and blunted the hyperpolarization-dependent fall in open probability. In contrast, ROMK2 had shorter open and closed times and only two closed states, and its Po was less affected by hyperpolarization. Chimeric channels were constructed to address the question of which parts of the molecules were responsible for the differences in kinetics. The property of multiple closed states was conferred by the second membrane-spanning domain (M2) of IRK. The long-lived open and closed states, including the higher sensitivity to extracellular divalent cations, correlated with the extracellular loop of IRK, including the "P-region." Channel kinetics were essentially unaffected by the N- and C-termini. The data of the present study are consistent with the idea that the locus of gating is near the outer mouth of the pore.
