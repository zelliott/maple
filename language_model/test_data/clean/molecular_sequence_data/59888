The expression of the Bacillus subtilis spoIVB gene, which encodes a developmental cell-cell signalling molecule, has been characterized. In some conditions, this gene can be transcribed by RNA polymerase associated with either sigma F or sigma G, in contrast to previous studies implying exclusive control by sigma G. However, during sporulation, only sigma G directs significant levels of spoIVB expression.
