The Drosophila heat shock cognate gene 4 (hsc4), a member of the hsp70 gene family, encodes an abundant protein, hsc70, that is more similar to the constitutively expressed human protein than the Drosophila heat-inducible hsp70. Developmental expression revealed that hsc4 transcripts are enriched in cells active in endocytosis and those undergoing rapid growth and changes in shape.
