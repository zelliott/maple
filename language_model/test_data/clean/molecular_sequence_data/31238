Molecular-dynamic calculations predict that, if Tyr24 and Asn84 are each replaced by a Cys residue, it should be possible to form a third disulfide bond in ribonuclease T1 (RNase T1) between these residues, with only minimal conformational changes at the catalytic site. The gene encoding such a mutant variant of RNase T1 (Tyr24----Cys24, Asn84----Cys84) was constructed by the cassette mutagenesis method using a chemically synthesized gene. In order to reduce the toxic effect of the mutant enzyme (RNase T1S) on an Escherichia coli host, we arranged for the protein to be secreted into the periplasmic space by using a vector that harbors a gene for an alkaline phosphatase signal peptide under the control of the trp promoter. The nucleolytic activity of RNase T1S toward pGpC was approximately the same as that of RNase T1 at 37 degrees C (pH 7.5). Moreover, at 55 degrees C, RNase T1S retained nearly 70% of its activity while the activity of the wild-type enzyme was reduced to less than 10%. RNase T1S was also more resistant to denaturation by urea than the wild-type enzyme. However, unlike RNase T1, RNase T1S was irreversibly and almost totally inactivated by boiling at 100 degrees C for 15 min.
