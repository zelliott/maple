The hydrophobin EAS from the fungus Neurospora crassa forms functional amyloid fibrils called rodlets that facilitate spore formation and dispersal. Self-assembly of EAS into fibrillar rodlets occurs spontaneously at hydrophobic:hydrophilic interfaces and the rodlets further associate laterally to form amphipathic monolayers. We have used site-directed mutagenesis and peptide experiments to identify the region of EAS that drives intermolecular association and formation of the cross-Î² rodlet structure. Transplanting this region into a nonamyloidogenic hydrophobin enables it to form rodlets. We have also determined the structure and dynamics of an EAS variant with reduced rodlet-forming ability. Taken together, these data allow us to pinpoint the conformational changes that take place when hydrophobins self-assemble at an interface and to propose a model for the amphipathic EAS rodlet structure.
