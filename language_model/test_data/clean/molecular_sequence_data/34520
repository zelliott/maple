We investigate the folding behavior of protein sequences by numerically studying all sequences with a maximally compact lattice model through exhaustive enumeration. We get the prionlike behavior of protein folding. Individual proteins remaining stable in the isolated native state may change their conformations when they aggregate. We observe the folding properties as the interfacial interaction strength changes and find that the strength must be strong enough before the propagation of the most stable structures happens.
