Three new triterpenoid saponins were isolated from the roots of Gypsophila oldhamiana. Their structures were elucidated, using a combination of homonuclear and heteronuclear 2D nmr and fabms, as 3-0-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-->2)-[beta-D-xylopyranolyl-(1-->3)] -beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl quillaic acid methyl ester [1], 3-0-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-->2)-[beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->3)]-beta- D-glucuronopyranosyl gypsogenin methyl ester [2], and 3-0-beta-D-galactopyranolsyl-(1-->2)-[beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->3) ]-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl quillaic acid 28-[0-beta-D-fucopyranosyl(1-->4)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->3)]-alpha-L- rhamnopyranosyl] ester.
