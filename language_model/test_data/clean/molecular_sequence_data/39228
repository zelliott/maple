Leaf samples of yellow passionfruit (Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa) displaying fruit woodiness symptoms were collected in seven Brazilian states and the Federal District. Viral infection was confirmed by host range and ELISA, and fourteen viral isolates were obtained. All isolates were capable of infecting several leguminous host species, although differences in symptom severity were noticeable. Woodiness symptoms were reproduced in yellow passionfruit, and mosaic symptoms were induced in common bean. All isolates infected cowpea, reported as a non-host of passion fruit woodiness virus (PWV). Indirect ELISA demonstrated that all isolates were serologically related to each other and also to cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus (CABMV). The complete sequence of the capsid protein was determined for all isolates. Comparison of these sequences with those of other potyviruses indicated the highest identity with CABMV isolates (85 to 94%). Identity with PWV isolates ranged from 54 to 70%. Phylogenetic analysis grouped all of the Brazilian isolates in a monophyletic cluster with the CABMV isolates, clearly distinct from the PWV isolates. Furthermore, this analysis demonstrated that a group of previously characterized isolates from Brazil that had been designated as PWV should be reclassified as CABMV. Together, these results provide unequivocal evidence that, in Brazil, passionfruit woodiness disease is primarily caused by CABMV. The presence of PWV in Brazil has yet to be confirmed.
