The composition of 681 aerobic and heterotrophic strains that were isolated on two different media was assessed at four sampling points along a approximately 300 m stretch of a karst water rivulet. Based on partial sequence analysis of 16S rRNA genes, members of 35 genera were identified; however, only a few species dominated as their representatives were repeatedly isolated at different sampling sites. Determination of the phylum affiliation showed that the isolates included members of Bacteriodetes (especially the genus Flavobacterium) and Proteobacteria (mainly Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas). MALDI-TOF analysis and/or similarities of partial sequences of flavobacterial strains resulted in the generation of almost complete 16S rRNA gene sequences for 100 isolates, about 60 of which may represent novel phylospecies. The number as well as the intra-phylum distribution of the isolates changed with distance from the discharge site. While phylogenetically restricted at the spring, diversity increased at downstream sampling sites.
