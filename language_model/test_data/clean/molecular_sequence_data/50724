We describe procedures for preparing extracts of Xenopus oocytes, eggs, and somatic cells that will accurately transcribe class II genes. A variety of viral and Xenopus promoters direct the accurate initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II in these extracts. Optimal ionic conditions (100-200 mM KCl, 12 mM MgCl2), template concentration (20-40 micrograms/ml), incubation time (30-60 min), and temperature (25 degrees C) for class II gene transcription are described.
