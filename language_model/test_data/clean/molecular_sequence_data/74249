Notch signaling is involved in a large range of developmental processes, and has been functionally implicated in body plan segmentation in two of the three diverse segmented taxa, the vertebrates and arthropods. Here we investigate expression of Notch, Delta, and hes gene homologues during larval and juvenile development in the polychaete annelid Capitella sp. I., a member of the third group of segmented animals. During larval stages, CapI-Notch, CapI-Delta, CapI-hes2, and CapI-hes3 transcripts are initially detected in broad ectodermal domains in future segments as well as in the brain and foregut; later, CapI-Notch, CapI-Delta, and CapI-hes2 transcripts are detected in the presumptive chaetal sacs. In contrast, CapI-hes1 has a segmentally reiterated pattern in a restricted region of the mesoderm in each presumptive segment. CapI-Notch, CapI-Delta, CapI-hes2, and CapI-hes3 and CapI-hes1 are all expressed in the terminal growth zone that generates post-metamorphic segments, however, CapI-hes1 has a non-overlapping complementary expression pattern to that of CapI-Notch and CapI-Delta. CapI-Delta and CapI-Notch transcripts are localized to already formed segments, with posterior boundaries that correlate with the posterior boundary of the nascent segment, while CapI-hes1 lies posterior to CapI-Notch and CapI-Delta. The localization of CapI-Notch, CapI-Delta, and CapI-hes transcripts correlate with areas of rapid cell proliferation in Capitella, which include the brain, foregut, and terminal growth zone.
