1H NMR spectroscopy assignments have been obtained for starch acetates using COSY and HOHAHA experiments by comparison with the spectra of amylose triacetate and of peracetylated malto-oligosaccharides (maltotriose, maltotetraose, maltoheptaose). These assignments are valuable for the location and evaluation of the substitution pattern in modified starches. The bulk of the 1H NMR spectra of highly acetylated starch strongly resembles the spectrum of amylose triacetate in which all protons are identified and display distinct chemical shifts. The resolving power of the HOHAHA experiment allowed the distinction of minor spin systems. Beside these strong signals pertaining to an average 2.3.6-tri-O-acetyl-alpha-(1-->4) linked D-glucopyranose unit in an infinite chain, the combination of COSY and HOHAHA experiments allowed the identification of these systems to the terminal, n-1, n-2, and to partially acetylated glucopyranosyl units. As an example, two different preparations of starch acetates with degrees of substitution 2.74 and 2.63 were examined. In one case, NMR demonstrates that the defects of acetylation are random on the polymeric chain (with corresponding signals for unacylated secondary hydroxyl positions at delta 3.61 and 3.40) while in another case, these signals are not detectable, probably due to the presence of clusters of non-acetylated residue forming solid-like zones.
