Thrombomodulin (TM) is a glycoprotein localized mainly on endothelial cell surfaces, and is a major regulator of vascular thromboresistance. The entire open reading frame of canine TM cDNA comprises 1737 bp, encoding 578 amino acid residues. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence from canine TM with those of human, mouse, rat, rabbit and bovine (partial) TM sequences revealed 73.1%, 69.1%, 65.8%, 74.3% and 69.5% identity, respectively. Canine TM mRNA expression was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis in lung, liver, spleen, kidney, pancreas and lymph node, and was relatively low in heart, cerebrum, urinary bladder and uterus. The present results provide valuable data for research into canine coagulation disorders.
