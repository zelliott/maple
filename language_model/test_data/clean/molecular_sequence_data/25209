An expression vector designed for overexpression of plastocyanin in the periplasmic space of E. coli has been developed. The vector contains the signal peptide sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin and the mature sequence of spinach plastocyanin. The precursor is efficiently translocated to the periplasmic space and correctly processed to mature plastocyanin. No detectable amount of plastocyanin was present in the cytoplasmic or in the membrane fraction. A large scale preparation of the recombinant plastocyanin in a 20 litre fermentor yielded approximately 30 mg of pure plastocyanin. The recombinant protein obtained from E. coli shows CD, EPR and optical properties identical to plastocyanin isolated from spinach.
