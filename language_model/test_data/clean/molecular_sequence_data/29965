We have used low stringency screening with the Drosophila melanogaster s36 chorion gene to recover its homologue from genomic and cDNA libraries of the medfly, Ceratitis capitata. The same gene has also been recovered from a genomic library of D. virilis. The medfly s36 gene shows similar developmental specificity as in Drosophila (early choriogenesis). It is also specifically amplified in ovarian follicles; this is the first report of chorion gene amplification outside the genus Drosophila. Alignments of s36 sequences from three species show that, in addition to its regulatory conservation, the s36 gene is extensively conserved in sequence, in a region corresponding to a central protein domain, and in short regions of 5' flanking DNA that might correspond to cis-regulatory elements.
