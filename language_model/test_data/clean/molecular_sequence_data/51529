SecA is one of seven Sec proteins that comprise the prokaryotic protein translocation apparatus. A chloroplast-encoded secA gene has been identified from the unicellular chromophytic alga Pavlova lutherii. The gene predicts a protein that is related to the SecA proteins of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The presence of secA, as well as the previously described secY and hsp70 genes, on the chloroplast genome of P. lutherii suggests that this eukaryotic organism utilises protein translocation mechanisms similar to those of bacterial cells.
