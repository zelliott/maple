In order to purify the glycosyltransferases involved in the assembly of lipid-linked oligosaccharides and to be able to study the acceptor substrate specificity of these enzymes, methods were developed to prepare and purify a variety of lipid-linked oligosaccharides, differing in the structure of the oligosaccharide moiety. Thus, Man9 (GlcNAc)2-pyrophosphoryl-dolichol was prepared by isolation and enzymatic synthesis using porcine pancreatic microsomes, while Glc3Man9(GlcNAc)2-PP-dolichol was isolated from Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Treatment of these oligosaccharide lipids with a series of selected glycosidases led to the preparation of Man alpha 1,2Man alpha 1,2Man alpha 1,3[Man alpha 1,6(Man alpha 1,3)Man alpha 1,6]Man beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1,4GlcNAc-PP-dolichol; Man alpha 1,2Man alpha 1,2Man alpha 1,3[Man alpha 1,6]Man beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1, 4GlcNac-PP-dolichol; and Man alpha 1,6(Man alpha 1,3)Man alpha 1, 6[Man alpha 1,3]Man beta 1,4GlcNAc-beta 1,4GlcNAc-PP-dolichol. The preparation, isolation, and characterization of each of these lipid-linked oligosaccharide substrates are described.
