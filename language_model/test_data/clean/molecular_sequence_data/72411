We determined the ratio of N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) to N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) in swine respiratory epithelia by fluorometric high-performance liquid chromatography, and examined the binding specificity of swine influenza virus strains for gangliosides containing different molecular species of sialic acid (Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc), and for bovine erythrocyte sialoglycoprotein 2 (GP-2) containing Neu5Gc as its predominate sialic acid (96% of total sialic acids). The presence of Neu5Gc, which had not been detected in human tracheal epithelia, and Neu5Ac in swine tracheal epithelia was observed in a 1:1 ratio. The swine influenza virus H1 and H3 isolates tested, except for A/swine/Iowa/15/30 (H1N1), displayed a marked binding ability for sialylsugar chains containing Neu5Gc compared with that of the human influenza virus strains. These results suggest that swine influenza viruses recognize sialylsugar chains containing the molecular species of sialic acid present predominantly in the swine tracheal epithelium.
