In this study we identified a novel protein which may contribute to the transcriptional inactivity of Alu retroposons in vivo. A human cDNA clone encoding this protein (ACR1) was isolated from a human expression library using South-western screening with an Alu subfragment, implicated in the regulation of Alu in vitro transcription and interacting with a HeLa nuclear protein down-regulated in adenovirus-infected cells. Bacterially expressed ACR1 is demonstrated to inhibit RNA polymerase III (Pol III)-dependent Alu transcription in vitro but showed no repression of transcription of a tRNA gene or of a reporter gene under control of a Pol II promoter. ACR1 mRNA is also found to be down-regulated in adenovirus-infected HeLa cells, consistent with a possible repressor function of the protein in vivo. ACR1 is mainly (but not exclusively) located in cytoplasm and appears to be a member of a weakly characterized redox protein family having a central, highly conserved sequence motif, PGAFTPXCXXXXLP. One member of the family identified earlier as peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP)20 is known to interact in a sequence-specific manner with a yeast homolog of mammalian cyclosporin-A-binding protein cyclophilin, and mammalian cyclophilin A (an abundant ubiquitously expressed protein) is known to interact with human transcriptional repressor YY1, which is a major sequence-specific Alu-binding protein in human cells. It appears, therefore, that transcriptional silencing of Alu in vivo is a result of complex interactions of many proteins which bind to its Pol III promoter.
