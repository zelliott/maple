Among the recently cloned serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptors, the 5-HT6 subtype is of special interest for at least two reasons: 1) it is abundant in limbic areas which participate in the control of mood and emotion; and 2) some antidepressants and antipsychotics are potent 5-HT6 receptor antagonists. Studies using polyclonal anti-5-HT6 receptor antibodies and an antisense oligonucleotide were performed in order to investigate further the function(s) of 5-HT6 receptors in the rat brain. Immunocytochemistry at the light and electron microscope levels showed that 5-HT6 receptors are mainly confined to the dendritic compartment, suggesting that they could mediate 5-HT actions on neuronal firing. In some limbic areas, 5-HT6 receptor-like immunoreactivity is also associated with neuronal cilia with yet unknown functions. Continuous i.c.v. infusion with an antisense oligonucleotide for 3-4 days resulted in decreased 5-HT6 receptor-like immunostaining of the nucleus accumbens and anxiogenic behaviours in the social interaction and elevated plus maze tests. Selective 5-HT6 receptor ligands are eagerly expected to investigate further the potential implication of these receptors in limbic-dependent behaviours.
