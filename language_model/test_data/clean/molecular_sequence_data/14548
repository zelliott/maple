Webspinners (order Embioptera) are polyneopteran insects characterized by enlarged foretarsi with silk glands, whose silk is used to produce galleries in which the insects live gregariously. The phylogenetic position of webspinners has been debated. In the present study, an almost complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence of Embioptera is reported for the first time. The mtDNA of a webspinner,  Aposthonia japonica , has the 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs) generally found in metazoan mtDNA sequences. There is a translocation of a large region including atp6, atp8, cox3, nad3, and nad5 as well as a duplication of the 12S rRNA gene. The rearrangement does not seem to affect nucleotide composition, although amino acid composition in some parts of the mtDNA is biased compared with other Polyneoptera species. Based on phylogenetic analyses using nucleotide sequences of all PCGs concatenated with two rRNA genes and the amino acid sequences of all PCGs, A. japonica is sister to Verophasmatodea, a suborder of typical stick and leaf insects.
