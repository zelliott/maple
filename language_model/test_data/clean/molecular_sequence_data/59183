The gene (ssb) encoding the single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO was detected on a 2.1 kbp PstI-fragment of chromosomal DNA. The protein (PaeSSB) encoded by this gene consists of 165 aa and has a M(r) of 18549. The genomic sequence was confirmed by amino acid sequencing of the amino terminus of SSB protein isolated from P. aeruginosa PAO. PaeSSB shows 68% homology to the respective protein of E. coli. The nucleotide sequence upstream of the P. aeruginosa ssb gene shows little homology to the regulatory region upstream of the ssb gene of E. coli. The ssb gene was located at a distance of 690-870 kbp from the origin of replication on a physical map of P. aeruginosa PAO. In vivo PaeSSB could replace the SSB protein of E. coli (EcoSSB) if its production was controlled by the lac promoter on a high-copy vector. PaeSSB was overproduced in E. coli. Both the overproduced protein and PaeSSB isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO are post-translationally modified by cleavage of the first methionine. Analytical ultracentrifugation shows that PaeSSB is a stable homotetramer. The copy number of PaeSSB in P. aeruginosa is 1200 +/- 250 tetramers per cell. Preliminary characterization of the DNA binding properties shows PaeSSB to have a lower affinity for single-stranded DNA than EcoSSB.
