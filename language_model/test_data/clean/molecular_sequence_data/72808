cDNAs encoding the long-chain acyl-CoA hydrolases (ACHs) from rat brain and liver, referred to as rBACH and rLACH1, respectively, were isolated and sequenced. The rBACH cDNA contained an open reading frame encoding a 338-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular weight of 37,559, of which the deduced amino acid sequence matched partial amino acid sequences directly determined for peptides generated by tryptic digestion or CNBr cleavage of purified rBACH. The rLACH1 cDNA contained an open reading frame encoding a 343-amino acid polypeptide with a molecular weight of 38,240. When expressed in Escherichia coli, these cDNAs produced palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity and 44-kDa proteins with molecular masses similar to those of purified rBACH and rLACH1 (43 kDa). These expressed proteins and enzyme activity were immunoblotted and neutralized, respectively, by anti-rBACH or anti-rLACH1 antibodies. rLACH1 cDNA had 84 and 94% identity with rBACH cDNA at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. However, the 5'-end of the former cDNA which contained the N-terminal coding region of rLACH1 was entirely different from the corresponding region of rBACH cDNA, suggesting that these enzymes may be generated by alternative use of exons of the same gene. Northern blot analysis showed that ACH mRNA was expressed constitutively in the rat brain and testis, whereas its expression in the liver was inducible by treatment with the peroxisome proliferator. This study demonstrated the molecular diversity of ACH and suggested the presence of tissue-specific mechanisms to regulate the ACH gene expression.
