A three-gene operon, named yctCBA (Yersinia citrate transporter), induced by citrate and repressed by glucose was identified from a previously selected in vivo-induced (ivi) clone in the fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri. Interestingly, despite being an ivi clone, the drastic growth reduction of the yctC mutant in the presence of citrate, and the relatively high content of this compound in rainbow trout serum, the operon was not required for virulence.
