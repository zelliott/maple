Strain HME6451(T) was isolated from Lake Soyang in Korea. Phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain HME6451(T) formed a lineage within the genus Pedobacter. The strain HME6451(T) was closely related to Pedobacter daechungensis (95.4% sequence similarity), Pedobacter lentus (94.4%), and Pedobacter glucosidilyticus (93.8%). And strain HME6451(T) was a Gram-staining-negative, short rod-shaped, strictly aerobic bacterium. The major fatty acids were iso-C15:0 (41.2%), summed feature 3 (comprising C16:1 ω7c and/or C16:1 ω6c; 23.1%), and iso-C17:0-3OH (10.1%). The polar lipids of HME6451(T) were consisted of one phosphatidylethanolamine, one unidentified aminolipid, one unidentified phospholipid and four unidentified polar lipids. The DNA G+C content was 36.0 mol%. On the basis of the evidence presented in this study, strain HME6451(T) represent a novel species of the genus Pedobacter, for which the name Pedobacter soyangensis sp. nov., is proposed the type strain HME6451(T) (=KCTC 23467(T) =CECT 7865(T)).
