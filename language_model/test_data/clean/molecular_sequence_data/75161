Previously, we described a family of novel broad spectrum antimicrobial peptides, magainins, from the skin of Xenopus laevis. In this report we show that at least two other Xenopus peptides, present in the skin and its secretions, PGLa and a peptide released from the xenopsin precursor, exhibit antimicrobial properties comparable to the magainins. The identification of these newer members provides insight into the structural diversity of vertebrate antimicrobial peptides.
