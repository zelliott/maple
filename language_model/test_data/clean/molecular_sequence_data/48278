The ces-1 and ces-2 genes of C. elegans control the programmed deaths of specific neurons. Genetic evidence suggests that ces-2 functions to kill these neurons by negatively regulating the protective activity of ces-1, ces-2 encodes a protein closely related to the vertebrate PAR family of bZIP transcription factors, and a ces-2/ces-1-like pathway may play a role in regulating programmed cell death in mammalian lymphocytes. Here we show that ces-1 encodes a Snail family zinc finger protein, most similar in sequence to the Drosophila neuronal differentiation protein Scratch. We define an element important for ces-1 regulation and provide evidence that CES-2 can bind to a site within this element and thus may directly repress ces-1 transcription. Our results suggest that a transcriptional cascade controls the deaths of specific cells in C. elegans.
