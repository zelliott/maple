A catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O) gene was found from Sulfolobus solfataricus strain 98/2. Heterologous thermophilic C23O expressed in Escherichia coli showed the highest activity against catechol and 4-chlorocatechol, and at neutral pH. The C23O gene located with a putative multicomponent monooxygenase (MM) gene cluster that exactly matched with the homologous region of S. solfataricus strain P2. Primary sequence comparison identified an insertion sequence (IS) element inserted into a putative MM protein A N-terminal fragment gene in strain 98/2. Both ends of the transposase gene in the IS element, ISC1234, were flanked by 19 bp inverted repeat and 4 bp direct repeat sequences which are typical features of mobile elements. Our analysis and the two geographically distant origins of strains 98/2 and P2 (USA and Italy, respectively) suggest that the two strains have evolved from a common ancestor.
