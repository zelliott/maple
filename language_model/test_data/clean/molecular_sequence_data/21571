Wolbachia are cytoplasmically inherited alpha-proteobacteria well known for inducing a variety of reproductive abnormalities in the diverse arthropod hosts they infect. Despite their obligate intracellular lifestyle which usually protects bacteria from phage infection, Wolbachia harbor a widespread temperate phage called WO. Evidences of horizontal phage transfers indicate that this phage could promote genetic exchanges between strains leading to evolutionary changes in the genomes of Wolbachia, and could be involved in the phenotypes these bacteria induced. In this study, we report the survey of Wolbachia and WO phage infections in 20 populations of the Uzifly Exorista sorbillans, a tachinid endoparasite of silkworm Bombyx mori, collected from different geographic regions of India. Previous studies demonstrated that Wolbachia is associated with positive reproductive fitness effects in this species. Polymerase chain reaction using the ftsZ gene encoding for a Wolbachia cell division protein and the orf7 capsid protein gene of the phage showed that all flies checked were infected by Wolbachia and its phage WO. Phylogenetic analyses based on the Wolbachia surface protein gene revealed 100% of double infections by the arthropod supergroups A and B. These results can serve as a valuable basis for understanding the evolution of Wolbachia bacteria and may provide information about the dynamics of Wolbachia-host associations. This knowledge could be exploited for the use of Wolbachia for effective control strategies of the Uzifly, a serious menace of the silkworm B. mori.
