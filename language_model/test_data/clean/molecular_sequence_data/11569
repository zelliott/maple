Further improvements in technology for efficient monitoring of genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs) in the environment are needed. Technology for monitoring rRNA is well established but has not generally been applicable to GEMs because of the lack of unique rRNA target sequences. In the work described herein, it is demonstrated that a deletion mutant of a plasmid-borne Vibrio proteolyticus 5S rRNA gene continues to accumulate to high levels in Escherichia coli although it is no longer incorporated into 70S ribosomes. This deletion construct was subsequently modified by mutagenesis to create a unique recognition site for the restriction endonuclease BstEII, into which new sequences could be readily inserted. Finally, a novel 17-nucleotide identifier sequence from Pennisetum purpureum was embedded into the construct to create an RNA identification cassette. The artificial identifier RNA, expressed from this cassette in vivo, accumulated in E. coli to levels comparable to those of wild-type 5S rRNA without being seriously detrimental to cell survival in laboratory experiments and without entering the ribosomes. These results demonstrate that artificial, stable RNAs containing sequence segments remarkably different from those present in any known rRNA can be designed and that neither the deleted sequence segment nor ribosome incorporation is essential for accumulation of an RNA product.
