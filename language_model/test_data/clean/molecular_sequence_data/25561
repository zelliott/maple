The roles of the TATA element and sequences near the mRNA initiation site in specifying the location of initiation sites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were examined, using the Schizosaccharomyces pombe ADH gene. The importance of spacing was demonstrated by analysis of a series of deletions that removed from 8-50 bp between the TATA element and ATG translation initiation site of this gene. Primer extension mapping showed that increasing deletion length is associated with a progressive shift downstream in the location of the initiation sites. The distance of a given site from the promoter affected the relative ability of the site to be utilized for initiation. For this gene, a permissive region for transcription initiation exists between 55 and 125 bases downstream of the TATA element, and a zone of 75-115 bases allows maximal usage of an initiation site. The presence of a TATA sequence was shown to be necessary in S. cerevisiae for maintaining the location of this "window" of initiation. The TATA sequence is essential for function of the gene in S. pombe. This gene, as well as the majority of the 63 S. cerevisiae genes surveyed, uses initiation sites which fit a PyAA/T(Pu) consensus. Cis-acting mutations were recovered which restored ADH activity to a deletion allele that initiates its mRNAs downstream of the ATG. DNA sequence and transcript analysis with these mutants confirmed the requirement of proper spacing and conformity of initiation sites to the PyAA/T(Pu) consensus for efficient transcript initiation.
