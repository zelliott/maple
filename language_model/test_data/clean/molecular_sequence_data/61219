Type 1 pili-adhesive fibers expressed in most members of the Enterobacteriaceae family-mediate binding to mannose receptors on host cells through the FimH adhesin. Pilus biogenesis proceeds by way of the chaperone/usher pathway. The x-ray structure of the FimC-FimH chaperone-adhesin complex from uropathogenic Escherichia coli at 2.5 angstrom resolution reveals the basis for carbohydrate recognition and for pilus assembly. The carboxyl-terminal pilin domain of FimH has an immunoglobulin-like fold, except that the seventh strand is missing, leaving part of the hydrophobic core exposed. A donor strand complementation mechanism in which the chaperone donates a strand to complete the pilin domain explains the basis for both chaperone function and pilus biogenesis.
