1. The present review describes the results of a cloning that was successfully employed in the study of optic nerve regeneration in fish. 2. Three intermediate filaments (IFs) expressed by the glial fish optic nerve were cloned. 3. By the use of this approach it was possible to resolve the controversial question of whether glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is expressed in the fish optic nerve. 4. Moreover, as a result of the information that emerged from the cloning, it was possible to raise well-characterized monospecific antibodies and successfully exploit them in order to determine glial cell maturation, lineage and plasticity, monitor the glial cell response to injury of the fish optic nerve, and compare it to that of a non-regenerative system.
