The BRCA1-associated protein BARD1 is a putative tumor suppressor. We suggest that BARD1 is a mediator of apoptosis since (1) cell death in vivo (ischemic stroke) and in vitro is accompanied by increased levels of BARD1 protein and mRNA; (2) overexpression of BARD1 induces cell death with all features of apoptosis; and (3) BARD1-repressed cells are defective for the apoptotic response to genotoxic stress. The proapoptotic activity of BARD1 involves binding to and elevations of p53. BRCA1 is not required for but partially counteracts apoptosis induction by BARD1. A tumor-associated mutation Q564H of BARD1 is defective in apoptosis induction, thus suggesting a role of BARD1 in tumor suppression by mediating the signaling from proapoptotic stress toward induction of apoptosis.
