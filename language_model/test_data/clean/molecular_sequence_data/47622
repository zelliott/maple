Basic residues are known to play a critical role in the attachment of protein domains to membrane interfaces. Many of these domains also contain hydrophobic residues that may alter the binding and the position of the domain on the interface. In the present study, the role of phenylanine in determining the membrane position, dynamics and free energy of a peptide derived from the effector domain of the myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) protein was examined. Deuterium NMR in membranes containing phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS) indicates that this peptide, MARCKS(151-175), partially penetrates the membrane interface when bound and alters the effective charge density on the membrane interface by approximately 2 charges per bound peptide. However, a derivative of this peptide in which the five phenylalanines are replaced by alanine, MARCKS-Ala, does not penetrate the interface when membrane-bound. This result was confirmed by depth measurements by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy on several spin-labeled derivatives of the Phe-less derivative. In contrast to nitroxides on MARCKS(151-175), nitroxides on the derivative lacking Phe do not reside within the bilayer but are in the aqueous phase when the peptide is bound to the membrane. The Phe to Ala substitutions shift the position of the labeled side chains by approximately 10-15 A. The side-chain dynamics of MARCKS-Ala are strongly influenced by membrane charge density and indicate that this peptide is drawn closer to the membrane interface at higher charge densities. As expected, MARCKS-Ala binds more weakly to membranes composed of PS/PC (1:9) than does the native MARCKS peptide; however, each phenylalanine contributes only 0.2 kcal/mol to the binding energy difference, far less than the 1.3 kcal/mol expected for the binding of phenylalanine to the membrane interface. This energetic discrepancy and the differences in membrane position of these peptides can be accounted for by a dehydration energy that is encountered as the peptide approaches the membrane interface. This energy likely includes a Born repulsion acting between the charged peptide and the low dielectric membrane interior. The interplay between the long-range attractive Coulombic force, the short-range repulsive force and the hydrophobic effect controls the position and energetics of protein domains on acidic membrane interfaces.
