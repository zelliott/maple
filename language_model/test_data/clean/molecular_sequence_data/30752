The dhfrI gene, mediating high-level trimethoprim resistance, was earlier found only on Tn7. Evidence is given here for an alternative location of this gene at a site identical to sites observed earlier for dhfrII on plasmid R388, dhfrV on pLMO20, and aadA on Tn21. All these genes and dhfrI are precisely inserted as discrete GTTA-flanked elements at distinct loci in very conserved surrounding sequences. One of these dhfrI insertions was observed to occur in association with a similarly inserted aadA nucleotidyltransferase gene, which mediates streptomycin and spectinomycin resistance. Close to the insertion site, there is an open reading frame translating into a 337-amino-acid peptide which shows striking similarities to recombinases of the integrase family, sulI, the sulfonamide resistance gene, is very often found close to the insertion point forming a genetic surrounding, originally observed as a part of Tn21-like transposons. The alleged integration mechanism thus provides a recombination pathway for the genetic linkage of sulfonamide and other antibiotic resistance genes, including the most frequently encountered gene for trimethoprim resistance, dhfrI. Furthermore, the newly observed location of dhfrI could shed light on the evolution of the antibiotic resistance region of Tn7, which could be able to take up genes by the same mechanism as that of Tn21-like transposons.
