We have constructed a new genetic linkage map of the Werner syndrome (WRN) region, using microsatellites from a library which was developed by a chromosome microdissection and enzymatic amplification method. These microsatellites were used to genotype members of CEPH families using a simplified detection system of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. Two-point analysis was used to assign 4 microsatellite markers relative to each marker and other markers reported in the CEPH public data base. We confirmed that these 4 markers are located to the WRN region, 8p11.2-p22. Such microsatellites microdissected from the definite chromosome region may be useful for positional cloning.
