DAB389-mIL-4 is a murine interleukin-4 (mIL-4) diphtheria toxin-related fusion protein which has been shown to be selectively toxic to cells expressing the mIL-4 receptor. In this report, we have used site-directed and in-frame deletion mutagenesis to study the role of the putative C-terminal alpha-helix (helix E) of the mIL-4 component of DAB389-mIL-4 in the intoxication process. We demonstrate that deletion of the C-terminal 15 amino acids of the fusion toxin leads to loss of cytotoxicity. The substitution of Phe496 with either Pro, Ala or Tyr, results in a greater than 20-fold decrease in cytotoxic activity of the respective mutant fusion toxins. In addition, substitution of Leu497 with either Ala or Glu results in a similar loss of cytotoxic activity. All of these mutant forms of the mIL-4 fusion toxin demonstrate a significant decrease in binding affinity (Ki) to the mIL-4 receptor in a competitive radioligand binding assay. In marked contrast, however, the substitution of Asp495 with Asn results in a 4-fold increase in cytotoxic potency and binding affinity to mIL-4 receptor bearing cells in vitro.
