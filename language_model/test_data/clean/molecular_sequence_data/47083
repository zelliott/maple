We have cloned c-Irx2, a chick homologue of the Xiro2 and mIrx2 genes and a new member of the Iroquois family of homeodomain-containing transcription factors. Strikingly, c-Irx2 expression reveals an early subdivision of the neural plate at late primitive streak stages which later transiently resolves to a single stripe within the developing hindbrain corresponding to rhombomere 1.
