Polymorphic microsatellite markers were developed in Reaumuria soongorica, a desert shrub occurring widely in western China, to investigate its genetic diversity and population genetic structure.

Using the combined biotin capture technique, 10 novel polymorphic microsatellite loci primer sets were isolated and characterized in 90 individuals from six populations of R. soongorica. Five to 14 alleles per locus were identified for these microsatellites. Observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.132 to 0.593, and 0.217 to 0.803, respectively.

These microsatellite markers provide a useful tool to assess the genetic variation and population structure of R. soongorica.
