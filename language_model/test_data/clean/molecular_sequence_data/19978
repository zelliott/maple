Malaria parasites exhibit sequence diversity for a number of stage specific antigens. Several studies have proved that apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) is an effective target for eliciting a protective immune response in humans and other experimental animals. We have investigated the sequence variation in Plasmodium vivax AMA-1 (Pv AMA-1) from different Indian isolates. This is the first study of its kind for the nearly full length Pv AMA-1 from India. Our analysis reveals greater degree of genetic diversity in Pv AMA-1 than reported so far and identifies five novel haplotypes. This is significant to establish the antigenic repertoire of isolates in a malaria endemic country like India.
