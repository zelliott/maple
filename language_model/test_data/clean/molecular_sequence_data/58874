The human NBR1 cDNA has previously been identified using polyclonal sera to CA125, an ovarian tumor antigen used in monitoring ovarian cancer. The gene was mapped to the BRCA1 region on chromosome 17q21 and subsequently found to lie in close proximity to the recently identified BRCA1 gene. The NBR1 protein has a B-box motif but the function of the protein is as yet unknown. To investigate the function and importance of this gene, we have studied the conservation of this gene in other species and in particular in the mouse. We have isolated murine Nbr1 cDNA and genomic clones. Translation of the cDNA sequence indicates that the protein is highly conserved, being 89% similar and 84% identical to the human. Analysis of the murine Nbr1 genomic clones indicates that it maps less than 1 kb from the Brca1 gene and that, unlike that in human, this region is not duplicated.
