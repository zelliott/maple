The EcoRI, RsaI, and MspI RFLPs (restriction fragment length polymorphisms) of the COL1A2 gene, one of the two genes that encode for the polypeptides of type I collagen, have been studied in four West African and two Asian populations to evaluate their potential effectiveness as anthropological markers. All three RFLPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The comparisons between present data on two of the major human groups and those on Europeans and Amerindians show a considerable heterogeneity for each of the three RFLPs under study. EcoRI, in particular, appears to be highly effective in distinguishing Africans, Europeans, and Asians from each other. As expected, the analysis at the haplotype level considerably improves the discriminating efficiency of these three markers by creating a clear-cut distinction between Tharus and Indonesians, the two Asian populations of the present survey. In fact, even though these two populations exhibit the same frequencies for the RsaI and MspI alleles, the frequency of the MspI(-) allele among the RsaI(-) chromosomes is 0.5 +/- 0.14 in the Indonesian sample and 0 + 0.04 in the Tharu sample.
