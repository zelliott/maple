A type II arabinogalactan-degrading enzyme (FoGal1) was purified from Fusarium oxysporum 12S, and the corresponding cDNA was isolated. FoGal1 had high similarity to enzymes of glycoside hydrolase family 5. Treatment of larch wood arabinogalactan with the recombinant enzyme indicated that FoGal1 is a beta-1,6-galactanase that preferentially debranches beta-1,6-galactobiose from the substrate.
