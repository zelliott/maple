The endo-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidases (ENGase) acting on the N-N'-diacetylchitobiosyl core of N-glycosylproteins are essential reagents for the investigation of the structure and the functions of glycoproteins. These enzymes were largely studied with the aim of offering more tools with new and broader substrate specificities to the community of glycobiologist. Conversely, little attention was given to their potential role in the physiology of bacteria, even though it had been shown that ENGases are important enzymes for the physiology of animal and plant cells. In this brief review, we present the main characteristics of the bacterial ENGases and confine our discussion to biological aspects of their action in bacterial systems.
