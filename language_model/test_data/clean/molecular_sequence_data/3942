Receptor-interacting protein (RIP) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is critically involved in tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNF-R1)-induced NF-kappa B activation. In a yeast two-hybrid screening for potential RIP-interacting proteins, we identified ZIN (zinc finger protein inhibiting NF-kappa B), a novel protein that specifically interacts with RIP. ZIN contains four RING-like zinc finger domains at the middle and a proline-rich domain at the C terminus. Overexpression of ZIN inhibits RIP-, IKK beta-, TNF-, and IL1-induced NF-kappa B activation in a dose-dependent manner in 293 cells. Domain mapping experiments indicate that the RING-like zinc finger domains of ZIN are required for its interaction with RIP and inhibition of RIP-mediated NF-kappa B activation. Overexpression of ZIN also potentiates RIP- and TNF-induced apoptosis. Moreover, immunofluorescent staining indicates that ZIN is a cytoplasmic protein and that it colocalizes with RIP. Our findings suggest that ZIN is an inhibitor of TNF- and IL1-induced NF-kappa B activation pathways.
