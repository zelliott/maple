The cloned cDNA for rat prostacyclin synthase was found to contain a 1503-bp open reading frame which encoded a 501-amino acid protein sharing 84.0% identity with the human enzyme. RNA blot analysis revealed that the rat prostacyclin synthase mRNA, as a single species of 2.1 kb, is expressed abundantly in the aorta and uterus. High levels of expression were also observed in the stomach, lung, heart, testis, liver, and skeletal muscle. Low but significant expression was also seen in the brain and kidney. Furthermore, the regional distribution and cellular localization of prostacyclin synthase mRNA were examined by in situ hybridization analysis of rat tissue sections. The definitive signals for the mRNA were localized in smooth muscle cells of the arteries, bronchi and uterus, and in the cells of the fibrous tunic surrounding the seminiferous tubules, which are characterized as smooth muscle cells. Besides smooth muscle cells, signals were also detected in the fibroblasts of the heart myocardium, lung parenchyma cells and kidney inner medulla tubules and interstitial cells.
