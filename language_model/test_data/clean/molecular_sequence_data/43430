Eighteen gangliosides were isolated from dogfish (Squalus acanthias) brain, and their structures and compositions were determined by methylation analysis, enzymatic hydrolysis and partial hydrolysis with mild acid. Tetra- and pentasialogangliosides were also analysed by liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry. The dogfish brain gangliosides were characterized by a variety of molecular species. The most abundant ganglioside was GM2 (22.8% of the total sialic acid content), followed by GQ1c (16.0%), GP1c (13.4%), and GD2 (12.5%). The abundance of gangliosides containing a gangliotriaose core (GM2 and GD2), and c-series polysialogangliosides (GQ1c and GP1c) was a prominent feature of dogfish brain, differing from the brain gangliosides of teleosts and other vertebrates. A battery of trisialogangliosides was also found. A ganglioside which had an a- and alpha-series hybrid-structure (IV3NeuAc,III6NeuAc,II3NeuAc-Gg4Cer) comprised 1.4% of the total. The major fatty acids comprised 16:0, 18:0, 18:1, 22:1 and 24:1. The gangliosides with a gangliotriaose core predominantly contained 22:1. Sphinganine and 4-sphingenine comprised the long-chain bases.
