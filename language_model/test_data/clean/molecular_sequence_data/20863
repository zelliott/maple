It is a classical result of Stein and Waterman that the asymptotic number of RNA secondary structures is 1.104366 . n(-3/2) . 2.618034(n). In this paper, we study combinatorial asymptotics for two special subclasses of RNA secondary structures - canonical and saturated structures. Canonical secondary structures are defined to have no lonely (isolated) base pairs. This class of secondary structures was introduced by Bompf√ºnewerer et al., who noted that the run time of Vienna RNA Package is substantially reduced when restricting computations to canonical structures. Here we provide an explanation for the speed-up, by proving that the asymptotic number of canonical RNA secondary structures is 2.1614 . n(-3/2) . 1.96798(n) and that the expected number of base pairs in a canonical secondary structure is 0.31724 . n. The asymptotic number of canonical secondary structures was obtained much earlier by Hofacker, Schuster and Stadler using a different method. Saturated secondary structures have the property that no base pairs can be added without violating the definition of secondary structure (i.e. introducing a pseudoknot or base triple). Here we show that the asymptotic number of saturated structures is 1.07427 . n(-3/2) . 2.35467(n), the asymptotic expected number of base pairs is 0.337361 . n, and the asymptotic number of saturated stem-loop structures is 0.323954 . 1.69562(n), in contrast to the number 2(n - 2) of (arbitrary) stem-loop structures as classically computed by Stein and Waterman. Finally, we apply the work of Drmota to show that the density of states for [all resp. canonical resp. saturated] secondary structures is asymptotically Gaussian. We introduce a stochastic greedy method to sample random saturated structures, called quasi-random saturated structures, and show that the expected number of base pairs is 0.340633 . n.
