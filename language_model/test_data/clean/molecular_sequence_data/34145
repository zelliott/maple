Uniparental chromosome elimination occurs in several interspecific hybrids of plants. We studied the mechanism underlying selective elimination of the paternal chromosomes during the early development of Hordeum vulgare × Hordeum bulbosum embryos. The following conclusions regarding the role of the centromere-specific histone H3 variant (CENH3) in the process of chromosome elimination were drawn: (i) centromere inactivity of H. bulbosum chromosomes triggers the mitosis-dependent process of uniparental chromosome elimination in unstable H. vulgare × H. bulbosum hybrids; (ii) centromeric loss of CENH3 protein rather than uniparental silencing of CENH3 genes causes centromere inactivity; (iii) in stable species combinations, cross-species incorporation of CENH3 occurs despite centromere-sequence differences, and not all CENH3 variants get incorporated into centromeres if multiple CENH3s are present in species combinations; and (iv) diploid barley species encode two CENH3 variants, the proteins of which are intermingled within centromeres throughout mitosis and meiosis.
