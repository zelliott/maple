A gene coding for a protein containing two Scavenger Receptor Cysteine-Rich (SRCR) motifs, four Limulus factor C, Coch-5b2 and Lgl1 (LCCL) motifs; and one Polycystin-1, Lipoxygenase and Alpha Toxin (PLAT) motif was cloned from Plasmodium chabaudi and homologues identified in the P. falciparum and P. yoelii genome data bases. At least one of these sequence motifs (SRCR) has adhesive properties in other proteins, therefore, we propose to name this protein PSLAP for Plasmodium SRCR, LCCL Adhesive-like Protein. Southern blotting and chromosome analysis showed that pslap is a single copy gene on chromosome 14 in P. falciparum 3D7. pslap mRNA is strongly expressed in P. falciparum gametocytes, but was undetectable on Northern blots of RNA from the asexual blood stages. Polyclonal antibodies raised to different parts of PSLAP detected a protein expressed in late gametocytes, but not in the early stages of gametocytogenesis or asexual blood stages of P. falciparum. We suggest that PSLAP functions in the mosquito, for example, in modulation of the invertebrate host immune response or in protection against complement factors in the blood meal.
