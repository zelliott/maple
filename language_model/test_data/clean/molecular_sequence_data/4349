A polymeric fraction (the O-antigenic side-chain) has been isolated from the lipopolysaccharide of Burkholderia gladioli pv. gladioli strain NCPPB 1891 after mild acid hydrolysis. The components of the polymer and their molar proportions were L-Rha (1), D-Gal (1), D-Man (1), and O-acetyl (1). By means of chemical degradations and NMR studies, the repeating unit of the polymer was shown to be a linear trisaccharide of the structure shown. [formula: see text]
