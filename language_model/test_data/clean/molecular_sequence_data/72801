The glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide receptor (GIP-R) is a member of the secretin and parathyroid hormone (PTH) family of seven transmembrane-spanning receptors. Point mutations of a histidine at the junction between the first intracellular loop and the second membrane-spanning domain and a threonine in the sixth membrane-spanning domain of the human PTH-receptor have been reported to be associated with constitutive activation of the PTH receptor in Jansen-type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia. In this study, we explored whether such mutations in the GIP-R might similarly induce constitutive, ligand-independent activation of the receptor. Single amino acid substitutions in the GIP receptor were made by site-directed mutagenesis and receptor binding and cAMP levels were measured in transfected human embryonal kidney cell line (L293). Mutation of the threonine at position 340 in the sixth transmembrane spanning domain to proline (T340P) led to agonist-independent constitutive activity and exhibited a four-fold increase in basal cAMP level as compared to the wild-type GIP-R. The increase in cAMP level in T340P mutant was proportional to the amount of transfected plasmid and corresponded to the receptor number on the cell surface. Despite its high basal cAMP level, the T340P mutant could be further stimulated by GIP, with maximal cAMP generation comparable to the wild-type receptor. The change of amino acid histidine at position 169 to arginine (H169R), however, behaved like the wild type receptor and did not possess constitutive activity. These results illustrate that a point mutation of threonine to proline at position 340 results in constitutive activation of the GIP receptor, without affecting its sensitivity to agonist stimulation.
