Sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS-1) ribosomal DNA region were compared among 88 soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria) from 12 sites (within three general areas) along the New England coast to determine whether populations were genetically heterogeneous. Two sequence variants were observed, with type 1 having a 3-nucleotide insertion and one point mutation relative to type 2. Allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR); using primers specific to each sequence type, was performed to determine the distribution of individuals who had both allelic forms. DNA from soft-shell clams collected from three areas (Cobscook Bay, Maine; Gulf of Maine; and southern New England) were compared chi 2 analyses of allele-specific PCR results revealed no significant heterogeneity among the three population distributions.
