Calcium currents can be modulated by receptor activation of the GTP-binding protein G(o). We have determined whether the two forms of G(o), Go1 and Go2, differentially regulate calcium current magnitude. Using identified neurons of the pond snail Helisoma, we demonstrate that a high-voltage-activated (HVA) calcium current is reduced by addition of the neuropeptide Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide (FMRFamide) and that this inhibition is mediated by a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G protein pathway. Using this calcium current as an assay for G protein activity, we microinjected GTP gamma S-activated alpha-subunits of G proteins into neuronal somata. We demonstrate that the calcium current is differentially regulated by the two forms of alpha o. Microinjection of alpha o2*, but not alpha o1*, reduces calcium current magnitude.
