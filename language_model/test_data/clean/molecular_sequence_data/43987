NADH-dichlorophenol-indophenol oxidoreductases (PMOs) were purified from synaptic plasma membranes or synaptic vesicles (small recycling vesicles) from both bovine and rat brains and from a neuroblastoma cell line, NB41A3. Several isoforms could be identified in purified plasma membranes and vesicles. Purification of the enzyme activity involved protein extraction with detergents, (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, chromatography under stringent conditions and native PAGE. PMO activity could be attributed to a very tight complex of several proteins that could not be separated except by SDS/PAGE. SDS/PAGE resolved the purified complex into at least five proteins, which could be micro-sequenced and identified unambiguously as hsc70, TOAD64 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase tightly associated with the brain-specific proteins aldolase C and enolase-gamma. Enzyme activity could be purified from both synaptic plasma membranes and recycling vesicles, yields being much greater from the latter source. Highly purified plasma membranes (prepared from a neuroblastoma cell line NB41A3 by iminobiotinylation of intact cells and affinity purification with avidin and anti-avidin antibodies under very stringent conditions) also displayed PMO activity tightly associated with TOAD64. The association of PMO in a tight complex was confirmed by its immunoprecipitation from cellular and membrane extracts of NB41A3 using antibodies directed against any component protein of the complex followed by immunodetection with antibodies directed against the other members. Antibodies also inhibited the enzyme activity synergistically. In addition, induction of the different components of the complex during dichlorophenol-indophenol stress was demonstrated by the S1 RNase-protection assay in synchronized NB41A3 cells. The role of the complex in membrane fusion and cellular response to extracellular oxidative stress during growth and development is discussed.
