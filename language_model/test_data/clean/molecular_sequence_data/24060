Cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) is one of the exotoxins produced by Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, an agent of localized aggressive periodontitis. We constructed N-terminal deletion mutants of CdtA using an Escherichia coli expression system and found that ADelta19-47, with a deletion from Asn-19 to Pro-47, showed comparable CDT activity but no apparent heterogeneity of CdtA. The wild-type CDT (wtCDT) and the mutant CDT (ADelta19-47CDT) were purified to homogeneity by introducing a histidine tag into the C-terminal end of CdtB. Both purified wtCDT and purified ADelta19-47CDT showed strong CDT activity and a tripartite structure composed of CdtA (subunit A), 31 kDa CdtB (subunit B), and 18.5 kDa CdtC (subunit C) in nearly a 1:1:1 stoichiometry. Importantly, subunit A was identified as heterogeneous with three CdtA variants in wtCDT, but homogeneous in ADelta19-47CDT. Purified CDTs also showed high stability that was absolutely dependent on the presence of sucrose in the buffer. In conclusion, the region from the Asn-19 to Pro-47 of CdtA contributes to the heterogeneous production of CdtA, but is dispensable for the toxin activity. Furthermore, this study describes an effective protocol for the purification of a native rather than reconstituted CDT, and clarifies the subunit composition of the active CDT holotoxin.
