To detect the relationship of mtDNA mutation with inherited deafness and the reason for pedigree's hypersensitivity to ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics(AmAn).

Pedigree investigations were conducted. The blood samples were obtained from 12 pedigrees, and DNA was extracted from the isolated leukocytes. After that, mtDNA fragments were amplified by PCR. The 1555(G), 3243(G) and 7445(G) mutations were detected by Alw 26 I, Apa I and Xba I restriction endonuclease digestion respectively, and then sequencing of 12S rRNA, tRNA(Leu(UUR)), tRNA(Ser(UCN))and 16S rRNA gene was performed.

Restriction endonuclease digestion and sequence analysis showed that all the pedigrees carried mtDNA mutation, among them, 10 pedigrees carried 1555(G) mutation; 2 pedigrees, 7445(G) mutation; no pedigree was found to harbor the 3243(G) mutation. Sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene showed that the mutations are 2230(G), 2230(AG), 2243(AG), 2230(AA).

The pedigrees that carried 1555(G) or 7445(G) mutation showed hereditary or congenital hearing loss. The 1555(G) or 7445(G) mutation in association with 16S rRNA gene mutation led to pedigree's hypersensitivity to AmAn ototoxicity.
