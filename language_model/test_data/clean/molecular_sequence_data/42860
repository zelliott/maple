The reliability of arbitrarily primed amplification products was tested. The segregation analysis of 266 amplification products obtained using 17 different 10-mer oligonucleotides in 34 megagametophytes from a single tree of Picea abies was carried out. Fifty-four out of the 165 variable bands fit the 1:1 segregation ratio expected for Mendelian traits. The segregation ratio of a subset of six RAPD markers in five other individuals from the same population confirmed their genetic nature. Our results strengthen the evidence previously reported that RAPDs markers can be considered Mendelian traits useful in the detection of genetic variability among both different individuals and populations.
