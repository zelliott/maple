The structural gene for translational initiation factor IF2 (infB) from Streptococcus faecium was identified by cross-hybridization with DNA probes derived from the corresponding gene of Bacillus stearothermophilus. The entire infB gene (ca. 2.8 kb) was cloned and sequenced. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence shows that S. faecium initiation factor IF2 (785 amino acids, Mr 86,415) displays extensive homology (ca. 69% and 53%) with the region comprising three-quarters of the molecule from the carboxy-terminus of B. stearothermophilus and Escherichia coli IF2, respectively. The region comprising one-quarter of the molecule from the amino-terminus, on the other hand, does not display any significant homology.
