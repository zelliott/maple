We have encountered an allele which seems to be another type of O allele at the human histo-blood group ABO locus. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of this allele over the coding region in the last two coding exons. This allele does not possess the single-nucleotide deletion found common among all the O alleles previously analyzed. Compared with A1 allele, this allele has three nucleotide substitutions resulting in two amino acid substitutions. The introduction of these amino acid substitutions into the A1 transferase expression construct apparently abolished the enzymatic activity of A1 transferase.
