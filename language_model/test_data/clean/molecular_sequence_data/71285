Chemokines mediate their effects by binding to cell-surface receptors that belong to the seven-transmembrane-domain superfamily of proteins. Chemokine receptors have been subject to intense scrutiny following the recent discovery that several of them are co-receptors for HIV-1. Here, Richard Horuk reviews the latest developments in chemokine receptor research with a particular focus on their role as HIV-1 co-receptors.
