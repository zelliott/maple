To date proopiomelanocortin (POMC), the precursor protein for melanotropin (MSH), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), lipotropins (LPH), and beta-endorphin (beta-END) in the pituitary gland, has been studied extensively over a wide spectrum of vertebrate classes. A paucity of information exists, however, with regard to POMC in the avian class, where to date POMC from only one species, the domestic chicken, appears to have been fully characterized. In the present study, we report the use of three clones of cDNA to provide the complete nucleotide sequence of ostrich prePOMC cDNA, consisting of 1072 bp (excluding the poly(A) tail). The deduced amino acid sequence of 253 amino acid residues includes the N-terminal signal peptide of 17 amino acid residues. The predicted amino acid sequence in the overall arrangement of its domains, conforms to that found in other tetrapods. Sequence domains for gamma-MSH, ACTH, alpha-MSH, gamma-LPH, beta-MSH, and beta-END are located at positions 74-85, 134-172, 134-146, 175-220, 203-220, and 223-253, respectively, in ostrich prePOMC, but some of them may not be released in the ostrich pituitary gland, despite the presence of nine potential processing sites consisting of 2-4 dibasic amino acids each. Substitution of glutamic acid for a dibasic amino acid at position 202 in ostrich prePOMC could prevent release of beta-MSH. To date the release of pro-gamma-MSH, beta-LPH, ACTH, gamma-LPH, and beta-END have been confirmed by direct isolation and characterization from ostrich pituitary extracts. In the present study, we have also identified ACTH, gamma-LPH and beta-END in a single frozen ostrich pituitary slice by means of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. When compared to a wide range of vertebrate prePOMC molecules, ostrich prePOMC revealed a high level of amino acid sequence identity (77%) with chicken prePOMC, which is the only other avian sequence available. As with other vertebrate classes, considerable intraclass differences were also evident between chicken and ostrich prePOMCs, which belong to different avian orders. Identity of ostrich prePOMC with non-avian tetrapod counterparts is only moderate (53-56%), whereas lower identities (20-49%) are evident over a range of fish prePOMCs.
