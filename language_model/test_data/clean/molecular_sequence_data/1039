The major chromosomal protein of the mature sperm of the surf clam, Spisula solidissima, is a histone H1-related protamine-like (PL-I) protein of low electrophoretic mobility. We report here the complete sequence of two isoforms of its encoding genes. These genes encode a protein of 453 and 454 amino acids, respectively. The predicted mass of the larger isoforms (51,437 Da) was confirmed using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The amino-terminal tail of the S. solidissima PL-I is greatly elongated because of the presence of 39 tandem hexapeptide repeats of the motif (K/R)KRSAS with a few semiconservative amino acid substitutions. These repeats are very closely mirrored by their encoding DNA sequence, which indicates that an expansion because of sequence duplication most likely occurred. The C-terminal domain consists of a histone H1-related core with a predicted winged-helix tertiary structure, which is followed by an unstructured lysine-rich tail. This information provides additional molecular support for the classification and underlying evolution of sperm nuclear basic proteins in bivalve molluscs.
