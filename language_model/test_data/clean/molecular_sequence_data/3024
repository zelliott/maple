Cyanobacteria that form akinetes as well as heterocysts present a rare opportunity to investigate the relationships between alternative differentiation processes and pattern formation processes in a single bacterium. Because no akinete marker gene has been identified, akinete formation has been little studied genetically. We report the first identification of an akinete marker gene.
