In order to study the regulation of the synthesis of glutamine synthetase in response to changes in environmental parameters (light and nitrogen sources), we have cloned and sequenced the glnA gene from the filamentous cyanobacterium Calothrix PCC 7601. This gene consists of 472 codons and encodes a polypeptide of M(r) 52,290 highly homologous to that from Anabaena PCC 7120, but more distant from those identified from other procaryotes. The relative abundance of the two glnA transcripts (1.6 and 1.8 kb) is equivalent in cells grown under either red or green light, but the 1.6-kb species predominates in nitrate-grown cells and the 1.8-kb species in ammonia-grown cells. The very high identity (74%) observed between the 374-bp long nucleotide sequence upstream from the Calothrix and Anabaena glnA genes suggests the existence of similar regulatory signals for the control of glnA expression in both cyanobacteria.
