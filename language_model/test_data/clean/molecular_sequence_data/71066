Analysis of 12 Helicobacter pylori promoters indicates the existence of a consensus -10 hexamer (TAtaaT) but little conservation of -35 sequences. In this study, mutations in either the H. pylori vacA -10 region or the -35 region resulted in decreased vacA transcription and suggested that an extended -10 motif is utilized. Thus, despite the lack of a -35 consensus sequence for H. pylori promoters, the -35 region plays a functional role in vacA transcription.
