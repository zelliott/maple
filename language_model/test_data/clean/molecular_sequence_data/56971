The DNA sequence of heat-labile enterotoxin from the chicken enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 21d strain was determined by direct dideoxy sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA and was compared with those of heat-labile enterotoxins from porcine and human enterotoxigenic E. coli strains EWD 299 and H 10407. The structural genes of the A and B subunits of chicken heat-labile enterotoxin were identical to those of human heat-labile enterotoxin from the human H 10407 strain. Moreover, 67 base pairs of the upstream and 60 base pairs of the downstream region of the chicken heat-labile enterotoxin gene were also identical to that of the human heat-labile enterotoxin from strain H 10407. However, the patterns of plasmids from the 21d and H 10407 strains were different. The 21d strain had no band corresponding to the 42-MDa plasmid of the H 10407 strain encoding the heat-labile enterotoxin gene but it had a smaller plasmid. These data suggest that although the DNA sequence of chicken heat-labile enterotoxin is identical to that of human heat-labile enterotoxin, the plasmid encoding the chicken heat-labile enterotoxin gene in the chicken might be different from that encoding the human heat-labile enterotoxin gene in the H 10407 strain.
