Present work reported a novel domain--D8C (domain with conserved eight cysteines in liver-specific ZP domain-containing protein, glycoprotein 2 (GP-2) and uromodulin (UMOD)), present in liver-specific LZP, UMOD, GP-2 and some uncharacterized proteins, most of which are membrane proteins, extracellular proteins or nuclear membrane proteins. D8C contains eight well-conserved cysteine residues, which were predicted to form four pairs of disulfide bridges. D8C is composed mainly of beta-strands. Mutation in the D8C at Cys217 in human UMOD is associated with familial juvenile hyperuricaemic nephropathy, which might be due to the disruption of the disulfide bridge. Identification of D8C would further the understandings of related proteins.
