Sunflower downy mildew, caused by Plasmopara halstedii, is one of the major diseases of this crop. Development of elite sunflower lines resistant to different races of this oomycete seems to be the most efficient method to limit downy mildew damage. At least two different gene clusters conferring resistance to different races of P. halstedii have been described. In this work we report the cloning and mapping of two full-length resistance gene analogs (RGA) belonging to the CC-NBC-LRR class of plant resistance genes. The two sequences were then used to develop 14 sequence tagged sites (STS) within the Pl5/Pl8 locus conferring resistance to a wide range of P. halstedii races. These STSs will be useful in marker-assisted selection programs.
