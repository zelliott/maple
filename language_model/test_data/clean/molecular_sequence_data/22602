Vibrio cholerae is the causative agent of cholera, a severe and devastating diarrheal disease. V. cholerae lives naturally in various aquatic habitats during interepidemic periods. Recent studies reveal that quorum-sensing systems, which exist in many bacteria and help them monitor their population densities and regulate various cellular functions, control V. cholerae pathogenesis, biofilm formation, and protease production. In this study we surveyed quorum-sensing systems in 16 geographically diverse V. cholerae strains from epidemic-causing O1 and O139 strains as well as non-O1/non-O139 and environmental isolates and discovered an unexpectedly high rate of dysfunctional components. We also found that a functional quorum-sensing system conferred a survival advantage on bacteria in biofilms when the bacteria were exposed to seawater, though quorum sensing was less important to survival in a planktonic state under the same conditions. These findings suggest that variations in quorum-sensing systems are due to environmental selective pressures and might be beneficial to V. cholerae's fitness under certain conditions found in its natural reservoirs.
