We have studied the DNA from 170 individuals affected with familial adenomatous polyposis and from 20 uneffected individuals. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of polymerase chain reaction amplified DNA from the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene demonstrated three major patterns consistent with the existence of two different sequences in exon 13 of the gene in the human population. Direct sequencing of the amplified product from DNAs producing these three patterns confirmed the presence of a polymorphism in the coding region of the APC gene.
