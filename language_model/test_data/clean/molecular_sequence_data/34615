Nucleotide sequence of cryptic plasmid pN30 from a Rhodococcus erythropolis 30 soil isolate was determined. Plasmid DNA consists of 5403 nucleotide pairs and contains about 62% GC pairs, which is typical of Rhodococcus DNA. No significant homology was determined between the pN30 DNA sequence and those of known plasmids. Computer-aided analysis of pN30 sequence revealed open reading frames that encode proteins strongly homologous to replicative proteins encoded by small cryptic plasmids of different actinomycetes.
