The molds Scytalidium dimidiatum (Nattrassia mangiferae synanamorph) and Scytalidium hyalinum are responsible for dermatomycosis in humans. We sequenced their 18S subunit ribosomal RNA gene to identify these species with molecular biology-based methods. The coding sequences differed by a single polymorphism (A in S. dimidiatum, G in S. hyalinum). Moreover, we found an insert at position 1199 in the 18S rRNA gene sequence of S. dimidiatum. Its potential secondary structure was characteristic of a group IE intron. Bioinformatic and phylogenic group IE intron analyses generated four main homogeneous clusters. The S. dimidiatum intron is original and not related with other known IE group introns.
