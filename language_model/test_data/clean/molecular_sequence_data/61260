Motifer is a software tool able to find directly in nucleotide databases very distant homologues to an amino acid query sequence. It focuses searches on a specific amino acid pattern, scoring the matching and intervening residues as specified by the user. The program has been developed for searching databases of expressed sequence tags (ESTs), but it is also well suited to search genomic sequences. The query sequence can be a variable pattern with alternative amino acids or gaps and the sequences searched can contain introns or sequencing errors with accompanying frame shifts. Other features include options to generate a searchable output, set the maximal sequencing error frequency, limit searches to given species, or exclude already known matches. Motifer can find sequence homologues that other search algorithms would deem unrelated or would not find because of sequencing errors or a too large number of other homologues. The ability of Motifer to find relatives to a given sequence is exemplified by searches for members of the transforming growth factor-beta family and for proteins containing a WW-domain. The functions aimed at enhancing EST searches are illustrated by the 'in silico' cloning of a novel cytochrome P450 enzyme.
