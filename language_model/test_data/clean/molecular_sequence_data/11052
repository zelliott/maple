A second laccase gene, CVLG1, was isolated from Coriolus versicolor. CVLGI encodes a precursor protein of 526 amino acids which contains a 23-amino acid signal sequence, and the coding region is interrupted by 11 introns. The number of potential N-glycosylation sites in this product is 12 and the greatest among that of polyporales laccases. Moreover, this protein shares about 70% homology with other polyporales laccases. Genomic Southern analysis showed that C. versicolor laccases are encoded by more than four genes including CVLG1 and a transposed allele of this gene.
