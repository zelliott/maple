Our recent analysis indicates that the cytoplasmic localization of tRNA-attached ribozymes (tRNA-Rz) is critical for its high-level intracellular activity, suggesting that mature mRNAs in the cytoplasm are more accessible to ribozymes than pre-mRNAs in the nucleus (Kato et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2001, 276, 15378-15385; Kuwabara et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001, 29, 2780-2788). Although studies in Xenopus oocytes led to the proposal that only correctly processed mature tRNAs are exported from nuclei in a RanGTP-dependent manner (Lund and Dahlberg Science 1998, 282, 2082-2085), our tRNA-Rz with an extended 3' end can also be exported to the cytoplasm in somatic cells. Xpo-t/RanGTP bound to tRNA-attached ribozymes in vitro and in somatic cells, with recognition basically resembling the recognition of mature tRNAs. In contrast, no binding to tRNA-attached ribozymes occurred in Xenopus oocytes. The injection of a nuclear extract of Xenopus oocytes together with tRNA-attached ribozymes inhibited the export of tRNA-attached ribozymes but not mature tRNAs in somatic cells, suggesting the existence of an inhibitor(s) of the Xpo-t-dependent export pathway. Moreover, the inhibitor(s) appears responsible for a proofreading mechanism that operates in oocytes.
