The inhibitory domains of calpastatin contain three highly conserved regions, A, B, and C, of which A and C bind calpain in a strictly Ca(2+)-dependent manner but have no inhibitory activity whereas region B inhibits calpain on its own. We synthesized the 19-mer oligopeptides corresponding to regions A and C of human calpastatin domain I and tested their effect on human erythrocyte mu-calpain and rat m-calpain. The two peptides significantly activate both calpains: the Ca(2+) concentration required for half-maximal activity is lowered from 4.3 to 2.4 microm for mu-calpain and from 250 to 140 microm for m-calpain. The EC(50) concentration of the peptides is 7.5 microm for mu-calpain and 25 microm for m-calpain. It is noteworthy that at low Ca(2+) concentrations (1-2 microm for mu-calpain and 70-110 microm for m-calpain) both enzymes are activated about 10-fold by the peptides. Based on these findings, it is suggested that calpastatin fragments may have a role in calpain activation in vivo. Furthermore, these activators open new avenues to cell biological studies of calpain function and eventually may alleviate pathological states caused by calpain malfunction.
