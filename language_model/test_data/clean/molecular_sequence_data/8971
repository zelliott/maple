A membrane alignment technique has been used to measure the distance between two TOAC nitroxide spin labels on the membrane-spanning M2δ, peptide of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), via CW-EPR spectroscopy. The TOAC-labeled M2δ peptides were mechanically aligned using DMPC lipids on a planar quartz support, and CW-EPR spectra were recorded at specific orientations. Global analysis in combination with rigorous spectral simulation was used to simultaneously analyze data from two different sample orientations for both single- and double-labeled peptides. We measured an internitroxide distance of 14.6 Å from a   dual TOAC-labeled AChR M2δ peptide at positions 7 and 13 that closely matches with the 14.5 Å distance obtained from a model of the labeled AChR M2δ peptide. In addition, the angles determining the relative orientation of the two nitroxides have been determined, and the results compare favorably with molecular modeling. The global analysis of the data from the aligned samples gives much more precise estimates of the parameters defining the geometry of the two labels than can be obtained from a randomly dispersed sample.
