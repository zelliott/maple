As a eukaryotic microbe, yeast remains an attractive host for the expression of a large variety of foreign proteins, including viral antigens, enzymes used as food additives and therapeutic agents. Important progress has been made in the understanding of the critical parameters influencing product yield, and a number of novel tools for the genetic engineering of powerful yeast expression systems have been developed. This review focuses on recent findings in foreign gene expression in the yeasts Saccharomyces, Pichia, Hansenula, and Kluyveromyces.
