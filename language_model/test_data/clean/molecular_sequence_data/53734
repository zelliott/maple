A ferredoxin (Fd) was purified from the extremely halophilic archaeon, Haloarcula japonica strain TR-1, to electrophoretic homogeneity. The apparent molecular weight (Mr) of the Fd was estimated to be 24,000 on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amino acid composition analysis revealed that the Fd composed of a number of acidic amino acids (uncorrected for amides). The N-terminal amino acid sequence (30 residues) was determined to be: PTVEYLNYEVVDDNGWDMYDDDVFAEASDM. The iron content was 3.42+/-0.04 mol/mol-Fd on the basis of the apparent Mr value. The absorption and ESR spectra of the Fd showed similarity to those of Fds from plant and Halobacterium halobium. These results led us to conclude that the H. japonica Fd contained a [2Fe-2S] cluster.
