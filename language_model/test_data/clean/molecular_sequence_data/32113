The amelogenin protein is considered as the major molecular marker of developing ectodermal enamel. Recent data suggest other roles for amelogenin beyond structural regulation of enamel mineral crystal growth. Here we describe our novel discovery of amelogenin expression in long bone cells, in cartilage cells, in cells of the epiphyseal growth plate, and in bone marrow stromal cells.
