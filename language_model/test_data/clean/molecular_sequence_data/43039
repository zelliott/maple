Although numerous genetic and anthropological markers are available for determining zygosity of twins, there is still a need for a more practical and informative method in zygosity diagnosis. Dinucleotide repeats or other short repeats (microsatellites) are highly variable between individuals and offer a simple, fast, cheap, and exact approach for zygosity determination. The feasibility of a set of microsatellites to be used for this purpose is demonstrated.
