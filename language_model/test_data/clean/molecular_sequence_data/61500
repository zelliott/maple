Germ cell-specific ATP-dependent RNA helicase, the product of the mouse vasa homolog (Mvh), has been shown to play an essential role in the development of the male germ cell. In male Mvh knockout mice, premeiotic germ cells arrest at the zygotene stage. To investigate the role of MVH protein in the progression of meiosis, we searched for genes encoding partners that interact with MVH in testicular germ cells. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found that MVH interacts with mouse RanBPM, a Ran-GTP binding protein involved in microtubule nucleation. RanBPM is predominantly expressed in the testis, especially in maturating spermatocytes. Within the cell, RanBPM and MVH are closely associated with perinuclear RNA-protein complexes and chromatoid bodies. The interaction of MVH with RanBPM points to a functional relationship between translational regulation and the microtubule nucleation during meiosis. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 66: 1-7, 2004.
