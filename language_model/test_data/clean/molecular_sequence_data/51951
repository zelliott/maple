A linkage map consisting of 21 dinucleotide repeat polymorphisms, 1 tetranucleotide repeat polymorphism, and 3 RFLPs was constructed for human chromosome 8. The map spanned most of the chromosome length from near pter to q23-q24 on the distal portion of the long arm. The total 186 cM length of the female map was over two times the 84 cM length of the male map. Cytogenetic mapping of the polymorphisms using a panel of hybrids containing rearranged chromosomes was completely consistent with the linkage map. Special effort was made to remove as many genotyping errors, including parental phase errors, as possible. Removal of errors, in agreement with recent theoretical predictions, led to reduction of the total length of the sex-equal map by 10% from 145 to 130 cM.
