Recombinant clones of the chicken transferrin receptor gene and cDNA have been isolated and sequenced. Two highly conserved regions have been identified in the 3' noncoding sequence of the human and chicken TR gene. The conserved regions include sequences that have been shown to be involved in the iron-dependent regulation of human TR mRNA stability. These sequences can be modeled as two different types of RNA secondary structures, one containing stem-loop structures that are similar to the iron-responsive elements found in ferritin mRNA and the other being a stable, duplex/stem-loop structure. Both forms show considerable similarity between chicken and human mRNA. The expression of TR is developmentally regulated during erythroid maturation, and immature erythroid cells express exceptionally high levels of TR mRNA.
