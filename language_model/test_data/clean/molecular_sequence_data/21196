Finding a series of archaeal 16S rRNA gene universal primer applied strategies to detect complex microbial diversity in environmental samples, especially with rapidly development of next generation sequencing technology challenge.

We used Oligocheck soft to simulate two pairs of archaeal 16S rRNA gene universal primers with RDP (Ribosomal database project) database 16S rRNA gene sequences matching percentage. In succession, the sediment sample was constructed for two clone libraries by using two pairs of archaeal 16S rRNA gene universal primers.

The soft simulation matched percentage result suggests that primer f109/r958 is better than primer f21/r958. This result is consistent with RFLP and diversity index analyses by two clone libraries.

Multi-primers and properly primer are used to recovery environmental microbiology diversity, which will be advanced in environmental microbial resolution.
