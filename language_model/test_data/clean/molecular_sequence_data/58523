A new rabbit calicivirus related to the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) was identified. The new virus contains significant differences from the previously characterized RHDV isolates in terms of pathogenicity, viral titer, tropism, and primary sequence of the structural protein. Cross-protection experiments, antigenic data, and sequence comparisons demonstrate that the new virus is more closely related to RHDV than to the European brown hare syndrome virus, another member of the caliciviruses of the lagomorph group. The existence of a nonpathogenic calicivirus, which we propose to name rabbit calicivirus (RCV), provides an explanation for the early discrepancies found in the course of serological surveys of the rabbit population in European countries.
