The analysis of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in the diagnosis of myocardial injury in domestic animals is gaining popularity. In this study, equine cTnI was sequenced and compared with previously characterized cTnI from other species. A 6-amino-acid N-terminal deletion unique to the horse was identified. This deletion was outside the epitope region of cTnI recognized by most commercial immunoassays and did not affect the ability of a commercial analyzer system to detect recombinant equine cTnI. No function could be ascribed to the deleted portion. These data support the use of commercial analyzers in measuring equine cTnI.
