Rotavirus (RV) is an important cause of gastrointestinal disease in animals and humans. In this study, we developed an RT-PCR to detect RV group B (RVB) and characterized the VP7 (G) gene segment detected in porcine samples. One hundred seventy three samples were tested for RV group A (RVA), RVB, and C (RVC) by RT-PCR and examined for RV-like lesion using histopathology. A majority (86.4%) of the samples had mixed RV infections and co-infections of RVA/RVB/RVC were detected at a higher rate (24.3%) than previously reported. RVB was identified in 46.8% of the 173 samples. An adapted VP7 classification was developed using previously published (n=57) and newly sequenced (n=68) RVB strains, resulting in 20 G genotypes based on an 80% nucleotide identity cutoff value. Our results revealed a broad genetic diversity of porcine RVB strains, suggesting RVB has been the cause of common/pre-existing, yet undiagnosed, disease in pigs.
