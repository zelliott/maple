We describe a novel human cDNA isolated by target site screening of a placental expression library, using as a probe, an essential element of a TATA box-less promoter corresponding to a pregnancy-specific glycoprotein gene. The cDNA encoded a predicted protein of 290 amino acids, designated core promoter-binding protein (CPBP), which has three zinc fingers (type Cys2-His2) at the end of its C-terminal domain, a serine/threonine-rich central region and an acidic domain lying within the N-terminal region. Additional sequence analysis and data base searches revealed that only the zinc finger domains are conserved (60-80% identity) in other transcription factors. In cotransfection assays, CPBP increased the transcription from a minimal promoter containing its natural DNA-binding site. Moreover, a chimeric protein between CPBP and Gal4 DNA binding domain also increased the activity of an heterologous reporter gene containing Gal4 DNA binding sites. The tissue distribution analysis of CPBP mRNA revealed that it is differentially expressed with an apparent enrichment in placental cells. The DNA binding and transcriptional activity of CPBP, in conjunction with its expression pattern, strongly suggests that this protein may participate in the regulation and/or maintenance of the basal expression of PSG and possibly other TATA box-less genes.
