The calcyclin gene is growth regulated in a number of cell types from different animal species. We have identified in the promoter region of the human calcyclin gene the sequences responsible for its growth regulation by serum. A number of deletion mutants and synthetic nucleotides, all driving the chloroamphenicol transferase (CAT) gene, were constructed for this purpose. Serum-responsive elements can be localized in the last 42 bp immediately upstream from the CAP site.
