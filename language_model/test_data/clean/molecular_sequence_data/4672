Amphibian eggs normally require meiotic maturation to be competent for fertilization. A necessary prerequisite for this event is sperm binding, and we show that under normal physiological conditions this property is acquired at, but not before, meiotic maturation. Immature oocytes do not bind sperm, but injection of total egg poly(A)+ mRNA into immature oocytes confers sperm binding in the absence of meiotic maturation. Using an expression cloning approach we have isolated a single cDNA from egg poly(A)+ mRNA that can induce sperm binding in immature oocytes. The cDNA was found to encode Xenopus Cdc6, a protein that previously has been shown to function in initiation of DNA replication and cell cycle control. This unanticipated finding provides evidence of a link between a regulator of the cell cycle and alterations in cell surface properties that affect gamete binding.
