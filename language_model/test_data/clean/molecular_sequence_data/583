A Gram-variable, spore-forming, motile rod, designated strain Y1T, was isolated from the hopper surface of equipment used for soy sauce production. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that Y1T is affiliated phylogenetically to the genus Sporosarcina, and the strain showed sequence similarities of 95.8-99.2% to those of Sporosarcina species with validly published names. The values of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain Y1T and related type strains of the genus Sporosarcina were below 27%. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C(15:0) and anteiso-C(15:0). The cell-wall peptidoglycan was of the A4alpha type (Lys-Glu) and the major isoprenoid quinone was MK-7. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylethanolamine. The genomic DNA G+C content of the strain was 43.6 mol%. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis and physiological and chemotaxonomic data, the isolate represents a novel species of the genus Sporosarcina, for which the name Sporosarcina luteola sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is strain Y1T (= JCM 15791T = NRRL B-59180T = NBRC 105378T = CIP 109917T = NCIMB 14541T).
