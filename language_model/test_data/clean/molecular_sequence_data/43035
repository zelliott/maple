A nested PCR method for quantification of HIV-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) which does not use radioactivity nor plasmids is described. Quantification was achieved by means of limiting dilutions and an ACH2 cell standard. The method was used to study 23 HIV-infected patients. A significant correlation was seen between the stage of HIV disease, as classified by CDC criteria, and the number of infected PBMC. Although the CD4+ cell count also correlated well with the stage of HIV disease, there was only weak correlation between the result obtained by the PCR method and the CD4+ cell count.
