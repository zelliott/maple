Incubation of human keratinocytes with gamma interferon (gamma-IFN) induces the synthesis of a 53-kDa protein of unknown nature and function. We report the identification of this protein through amino acid microsequencing. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the 53-kDa antigen demonstrated that this protein was tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (Frolova et al, Gene 109:291-296, 1991, Genbank accession number 61715). This result was validated by the sequencing of tryptic peptides. Identification of the 53-kDa gamma-IFN-induced protein was confirmed by immunoblotting with an antiserum directed against beef pancreas tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase. Northern blot analysis using a synthetic oligonucleotidic 32P-labeled probe evidenced a 3.1-kb transcript in gamma-IFN-treated cells indicating that the gene was regulated at the pre-translational level. These data show that gamma-IFN potently induces in keratinocytes the expression of an enzyme directly involved in protein biosynthesis. Elevated levels of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase in treated cultured keratinocytes might be involved in the cell-growth-inhibitory activity of gamma interferon.
