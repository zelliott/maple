NKp44 (NCR2) is a member of the natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) family that is expressed on activated human NK cells. We dissected structural attributes of NKp44 to determine their contributions to receptor function. Our results demonstrate that surface expression and NK cell activation by NKp44 is mediated through noncovalent association with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-containing protein, DAP12. Physical linkage to DAP12 requires lysine-183 in the NKp44 transmembrane domain. Intriguingly, the cytoplasmic domain of NKp44 also contains a sequence that matches the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) consensus. By expressing a chimeric receptor in an NK-like cell line, we found that this ITIM-like motif from NKp44 lacks inhibitory capacity in a redirected cytotoxicity assay. The NKp44 cytoplasmic tyrosine was efficiently phosphorylated in the chimeric receptor upon treating the cells with pervanadate, but it was unable to recruit ITIM-binding negative effector phosphatases. We also generated NK-like cell lines expressing epitope-tagged wild-type or tyrosine to phenylalanine mutant (Y238F) versions of NKp44 and compared their capacities to induce activation marker expression, promote IFN-gamma production, or stimulate target cell cytotoxicity. We did not detect any tyrosine-dependent reduction or enhancement of NK cell activation through wild-type vs. Y238F mutant NKp44. Finally, the cytoplasmic tyrosine-based sequence did not provide a docking site for the AP-2 clathrin adaptor, nor did it potentiate receptor internalization. In summary, all activating properties and surface expression of NKp44 are mediated through its association with DAP12, and the putative ITIM in the NKp44 cytoplasmic domain does not appear to attenuate activating function.
