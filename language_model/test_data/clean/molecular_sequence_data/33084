Various transcripts coding for proteins considered to be central to parasite-host interactions were identified previously as male-enriched in the hookworm Ancylostoma braziliense. Among these genes were an ASP-5-like homologue and a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor. The present study extends this previous work to investigate similar molecules in other hookworms (Ancylostomatidae). Specifically, partial cDNA sequences encoding three different ASP molecules and two different Kunitz-type protease inhibitors were isolated, and the differential transcription between adult male and female worms was compared by conventional and quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for three species, A. braziliense, Ancylostoma caninum and Ancylostoma ceylanicum. In accordance with previous findings, male-enriched transcription was observed for all molecules explored. Based on this information, it is hypothesized that adult males are responsible for producing proteins essential to the survival of hookworms inside the host and for supporting developmental and reproductive processes in female worms.
