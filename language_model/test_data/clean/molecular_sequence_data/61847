Extracts of the green-colored perivisceral fat body of newly ecdysed Manduca sexta pupae stimulate mitosis in midgut stem cells of Heliothis virescens cultured in vitro. Using a combination of cation- and anion-exchange chromatography, we have isolated a protein from these fat body extracts that accounts for the observed stem cell proliferation. SDS-PAGE analysis of the protein results in a single band of 77 kDa. Sequences of tryptic peptides from this protein are identical to internal sequences of the storage hexamer alpha-arylphorin. The alpha-arylphorin isolated by our procedure represents a small fraction of the total arylphorin present in the fat body extract. However, it alone seems responsible for the stimulation of mitotic activity in H. virescens midgut stem cells.
