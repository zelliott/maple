The population dynamics and prevalence of Fasciola hepatica in Galba truncatula were investigated on the Teagasc hill sheep farm in Country Mayo, Ireland from August 2006 until March 2008. Galba truncatula (n=974) were collected at fortnightly intervals in 4 snail habitats on the farm, their relative density and mean monthly rainfall and temperature were recorded. Snail abundance was associated with rainfall and temperature. G. truncatula abundance was generally low during winter 2006/2007 (December 2006-February 2007), mid spring and summer 2007 (April-July) and late autumn and winter 2007/2008 (October 2007-February 2008). Overall, two peaks in G. truncatula abundance were evident during the study period, an early spring (March) and late summer/autumn (late August-October) peak. Seasonal differences were observed in the prevalence of F. hepatica in G. truncatula, the greatest prevalence was evident in 2007 during the summer (25%) and autumn (16%). Two seasonal transmission peaks, as evident by the presence of mature infections in snails, one in summer/autumn and the other in late winter/early spring. Not unsurprising, cercariae (28%) and rediae (29%) were the predominant developmental stages observed in mature and pre-adult snails respectively. Worthy of note in this study, cercariae were also evident in pre-adult snails. The present study highlights the influence of milder temperatures and wetter conditions on both snail and fluke development. If the trend in mild and wet weather conditions continues, there is the potential for an increase in the number of G. truncatula habitats and ultimately the prevalence of fasciolosis in grazing livestock in Ireland.
