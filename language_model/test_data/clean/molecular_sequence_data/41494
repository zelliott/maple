Conversion of environmental signals into epigenetic information is thought to occur widely but has been poorly studied as yet. It is proposed that changes in the expression of molecules involved in chromatin modifications might play a role in this process. Here we study the expression of abundant satellite DNA TCAST that makes up 35% of genome of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum and is located within the constitutive pericentromeric heterochromatin. RNA polymerase II promotes the transcription of TCAST satellite DNA from both strands, and long primary transcripts are rapidly processed into 21-30 nt siRNAs. Expression of TCAST satellite DNA-associated siRNAs is developmentally regulated, the most intense being at specific stages of embryogenesis. Moreover, the expression is strongly induced following heat shock and is accompanied by increase in repressive epigenetic modifications of histones at TCAST regions. Upon recovery from heat stress, the expression of satellite DNA-associated siRNAs as well as histone modifications is quickly restored. Our results indicate that satellite DNA-associated siRNAs, transiently activated after heat shock, affect epigenetic state of constitutive heterochromatin in Tribolium. It can be hypothesized that transient remodeling of heterochromatin is part of a physiological gene expression program activated under stress conditions in insects.
