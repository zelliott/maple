The mitochondrial chaperonin system consists of chaperonin 60 (also termed hsp60), which is homologous to E. coli groEL, and chaperonin 10, which is homologous to E. coli groES. In yeast, chaperonin 60 function has been shown to be essential for viability. We report here that the same is true for chaperonin 10. We have cloned, sequenced and disrupted the nuclear chaperonin 10 gene CPN10 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This gene encodes a protein of 11,372 Da that is imported into the mitochondrial matrix without detectable cleavage. Haploid cells lacking a functional copy of CPN10 fail to grow at temperatures between 23 and 37 degrees C.
