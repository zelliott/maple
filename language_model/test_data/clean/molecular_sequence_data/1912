The 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of the genome of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus can functionally replace its counterpart in the prototype group 2 coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). By contrast, the 3' UTRs of representative group 1 or group 3 coronaviruses cannot operate as substitutes for the MHV 3' UTR.
