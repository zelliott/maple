Two 11mer peptide nucleic acid (PNA) beacons were synthesized and tested for the detection of full-matched or single mismatched DNA. Fluorescent measurements carried out in solution showed only partial discrimination of the mismatched sequence, while using anion-exchange HPLC, in combination with fluorimetric detection, allowed DNA analysis to be performed with high sensitivity and extremely high sequence selectivity. Up to >90 : 1 signal discrimination in the presence of one single mismatched base was observed. The analysis was tested on both short and long DNA oligomers. Detection of DNA obtained from PCR amplification was also performed allowing the selective detection of the target sequence in complex mixtures. Label free detection of the DNA with high sequence selectivity is therefore possible using the present approach.
