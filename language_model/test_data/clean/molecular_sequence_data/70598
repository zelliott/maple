Relationships of North American damselflies of the genus Ischnura (Odonata: Zygoptera: Coenagrionidae) were investigated using a total of 1205 bp from portions of three mitochondrial genes: cytochrome b, cytochrome oxidase II, and 12S ribosomal DNA. Parsimony and neighbor joining analyses reveal a monophyletic group consisting of I. damula, I. demorsa, I. perparva, I. posita posita, I. posita atezca, I. verticalis, and probably I. denticollis, likely reflecting a recent radiation in North America. Ischnura kellicotti, I. barberi, I. prognata, I. hastata, I. ramburii, and I. capreola appear to represent much earlier divergences in the group. Many previous hypotheses of relationships among North American species of Ischnura are not supported by the molecular-based analyses. However, there is agreement in many respects between the results of the molecular phylogenetic analyses and the morphologically based conclusions of Kennedy (1919, "The Phylogeny of the Zygoptera," Ph.D. Dissertation, Cornell University, Ithaca). Although results of single-gene phylogenetic analyses often differ, there are very few cases in which there is strong support for conflicting relationships using different partitions of the data. Combined analysis of all three genes yields trees with stronger support overall than the single-gene analyses, and the combined data trees that result from diverse data treatments are congruent with one another in most respects.
