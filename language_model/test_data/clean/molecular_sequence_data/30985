Two types of recombinant vaccinia viruses (VVs) expressing the env gene of the human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) were reported previously. One recombinant VV, WR-proenv1, synthesized the authentic env protein. In the other recombinant VV, WR-env17, the env gene was inserted within the signal sequence of the VV hemagglutinin (HA) gene, so that the reading frame for the env gene was in phase with that for the HA gene. Comparative studies were performed on the mode of expression and processing of the env proteins in relation to their immunogenicity. In WR-env17-infected cells, translation was initiated exclusively from the initiation methionine of the HA to produce nascently the chimeric env protein, including the altered HA signal peptide. Both this altered HA signal peptide and the internalized env signal peptide functioned as insertion signals for the endoplasmic reticulum. Although about half of the nascent chimeric protein was cleaved at the carboxyl terminus of the internalized env signal peptide to produce the authentic env protein, the other half was cleaved at the carboxyl terminus of the altered HA signal peptide alone to synthesize the chimeric protein. These events led to a less efficient transport of the env protein produced by WR-env17 from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus than that of the authentic env protein synthesized by WR-proenv1. The efficiency of the processing and transport of the env protein affected the immunogenicity of these two recombinant VVs.
