Beta-lactam antibiotics (BLAs) are the first-line agents used against group B streptococci (GBS) infection. A clonal set of four independent, invasive GBS isolates with elevated MICs to BLAs were identified that shared a pbp2x mutation (Q557E) corresponding to a resistance-conferring pneumococcal mutation. BLA sensitivity was restored through allelic replacement or complementation with the wild-type pbp2x.
