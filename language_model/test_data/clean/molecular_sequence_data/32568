A new and promising sequencing technology called sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) enables fast determination of DNA sequences. 2'-Deoxynucleotides containing the (2-cyanoethoxy)methyl (CEM) group at the 3'-O-position are potential reversible terminators for the SBS technology. Herein we describe the synthesis, the incorporation by several polymerases, and the cleavage of this 3'-O-blocking group using 3'-O-CEM-thymidinyl-5'-O-triphosphate 7 as an example.
