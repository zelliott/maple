Equine rhinitis B virus (ERBV) is the single species in the genus Erbovirus, family Picornaviridae. Equine rhinitis B viruses exist in three serotypes and are associated with respiratory disease in horses. Members of the species vary in stability at acid pH. To date there has been discordance in genotype, serotype and acid stability phenotype groupings. To identify capsid regions associated with acid stability, two viruses were serially treated at pH 3.3 to isolate acid-stable mutants. An acid-stable mutant of the prototype acid-labile serotype 1 virus contained a single amino acid change in the C-terminus of VP1. Similar treatment with a separate isolate identified a multiple ERBV serotype infection with acid-labile serotype 1 and acid-stable serotype 3. Dual infections were subsequently identified in original swabs taken from the infected horse and from two further cell culture passaged viruses originally isolated in Switzerland. Serotype specific rat antisera were produced and used to examine a collection of isolates from a range of genotypes, acid stability phenotypes and serotypes. In contrast to previous reports, we showed viruses previously classified as acid-stable serotype 1 are in fact serotype 3 and that there is a clear association of serotype with genotype and acid stability phenotype in ERBVs. Additionally, we have shown that ERBV capsids dissociate into pentamers in acidic conditions below their threshold of stability, similarly to closely related viruses in the same family.
