The expressed sequence tag (EST) dataset of Toxoplasma gondii provides a wealth of information towards gene discovery. The complete cDNA and genomic sequence of EST tgc050 locus shows that it contains five copies of the conserved thrombospondin (TSP)-like motif present in a number of molecules with adhesive properties. A conserved region implicated with the adhesive characteristic of another group of proteins including several integrins, is also present in this molecule. The protein encoded by this sequence (rc50) is strongly recognised by monoclonal antibodies to MIC2. Affinity purified anti-rc50 antisera specifically reacted with a single protein of identical molecular mass as MIC2 and exclusively labeled the micronemes of T. gondii by cryo-immunoelectron microscopy. These results demonstrate that c50 encodes for MIC2, a previously characterised microneme protein of T. gondii. The extensive sequence similarity across multiple protein domains provides evidence that the protein encoded by this locus is the homologue to the Etp100 microneme protein of Eimeria tenella.
