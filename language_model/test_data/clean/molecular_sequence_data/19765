Genetic diversity in malaria vaccine antigens may compromise malaria vaccine efficacy, so it is important to understand this diversity and the processes that generate it. By applying new high-throughput genotyping methods to a large sample of infections from Mali (N = 1369), seven new 19-kDa merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1(19)) haplotypes were identified. Herein we report the sequences of these new haplotypes and discuss their possible origins. Although they are present in < 1% of the samples examined, the existence of these rare haplotypes reveals a greater degree of diversity at this locus than previously reported and highlights the potential for Plasmodium to evolve under selective pressure from the immune system and from such interventions as vaccines and drugs.
