Asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of duck ovomucoid were released quantitatively from the protein by digestion with glycoamidase A (from almond), the reducing ends of the oligosaccharide chains thus obtained were aminated with a fluorescent reagent, 2-aminopyridine, and the mixture of pyridylamino derivatives of the oligosaccharides was separated using two different types of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a reversed phase column and an amide adsorption column. More than sixteen different oligosaccharides were separated and the structures were characterized by a combination of the 2-dimensional sugar mapping technique using HPLC, exoglycosidase digestion, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance measurements (1- and 2-dimensional). Furthermore, the HPLC profile of duck ovomucoid oligosaccharides was compared with previously reported profiles obtained from quail and chicken ovomucoids.
