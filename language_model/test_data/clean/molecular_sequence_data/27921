To study the predominant binding substance for the heat-labile enterotoxin (LTc) isolated from chicken enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, competitive binding assays were performed with neuraminidase-treated human type B erythrocytes and 125I-labeled B subunit of LTc (LTc-B). Of all inhibitors used, the ganglioside GM1 was the most effective in inhibiting the binding of 125I-labeled LTc-B to the erythrocytes. The other gangliosides used as inhibitors, gangliosides GD1b, GD1a, GM2, GT1b and GM3, were about 24, 166, 250, 440 and at least 440 times less reactive than ganglioside GM1, respectively. With glycoproteins as inhibitors, on the other hand, hog A + H, porcine thyroglobulin and bovine salivary mucin were over 10(4) times less potent. No inhibition was obtained by other mono-, di- and polysaccharides at the highest concentrations used. These findings suggest that the predominant binding substance on neuraminidase-treated human type B erythrocytes for the LTc-B is ganglioside GM1 and that the combining site of LTc-B may be specific for the terminal disaccharide (galactose-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine)-linked portion of ganglioside GM1.
