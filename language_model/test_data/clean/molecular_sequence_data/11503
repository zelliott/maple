The occurrence of the tnpA genes of the transposons Tn3, Tn21, and Tn501 was assessed in total bacterial community DNA isolated from different marine environments. The PCR technique was employed, together with most probable number statistics, to determine the abundance of the target tnpA genes. All three genes could be detected, and the Tn21 tnpA sequences predominated in all samples. The smallest amount of total community DNA in which the Tn21 tnpA sequence could be detected was 0.037 ng, and on the basis of our results, we estimated that this sequence was present in 1 of 1,000 to 10,000 bacteria. Hybridization of the PCR products with the respective tnpA probes verified the Tn21 and Tn501 tnpA sequences but only some of the Tn3 tnpA amplification products. The distribution and dissemination of transposons in natural bacterial communities are discussed.
