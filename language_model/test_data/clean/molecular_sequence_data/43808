A cDNA encoding a two-domain hemoglobin (Hb) chain of Daphnia magna was cloned and its nucleotide (nt) sequence of 1261 bp was determined. The nt sequence contained 74 bp of the leader sequence, 1047 bp of an open reading frame (ORF), and 119 bp of the 3'-untranslated region (UTR), excluding the polyadenylation tail. A sequence, AATACA, located 24 bp upstream from the polyA sequence was considered to be a polyadenylation signal. cDNA-derived amino acid (aa) sequence revealed that D. magna Hb chain is synthesized as a secretory precursor with a signal peptide of 18 aa. Mature D. magna Hb chain consists of 330-aa residues with a calculated molecular weight of 36227, which is composed of two large repeated domains, domain 1 and 2. Several key aa that are invariant in all or most of other Hb and required for functional heme-binding are conserved in each of the two domains. The N-terminal extension (pre-A segment) of domain 1 was unusually long and contained an unusual threonine-rich sequence. The homology between the aa sequences of the two domains (24% identity) was much lower than that observed in other two-domain Hb chains from clams or nematode. Hb mRNA level in D. magna reared under low oxygen concentration was more than 12 times higher than that in D. magna reared with sufficient aeration, indicating that the expression of Hb gene is regulated by mRNA level.
