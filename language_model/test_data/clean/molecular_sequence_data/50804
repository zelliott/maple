Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a potent angiogenic factor that has also been implicated in granulosa cell and oocyte maturation. We now report the expression of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) encoding bFGF in human granulosa and cumulus cells obtained at oocyte recovery in in vitro fertilisation patients. It was necessary to use the sensitive technique of a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after reverse transcription (RT) to detect transcripts. This finding in conjunction with a recent report showing the presence of transcripts for transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) in the same type of cells by PCR indicates that mechanisms are in place for controlling extracellular proteolysis and cell differentiation.
