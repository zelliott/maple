Depending on the pH of the growth medium, the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica secretes an acidic protease or an alkaline protease, the synthesis of which is also controlled by carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur availability, as well as by the presence of extracellular proteins. Previous results have indicated that the alkaline protease response to pH was dependent on YlRim101p, YlRim8p/YlPalF, and YlRim21p/YlPalH, three components of a conserved pH signaling pathway initially described in Aspergillus nidulans. To identify other partners of this response pathway, as well as pH-independent regulators of proteases, we searched for mutants that affect the expression of either or both acidic and alkaline proteases, using a YlmTn1-transposed genomic library. Four mutations affected only alkaline protease expression and identified the homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae SIN3. Eighty-nine mutations affected the expression of both proteases and identified 10 genes. Five of them define a conserved Rim pathway, which acts, as in other ascomycetes, by activating alkaline genes and repressing acidic genes at alkaline pH. Our results further suggest that in Y. lipolytica this pathway is active at acidic pH and is required for the expression of the acidic AXP1 gene. The five other genes are homologous to S. cerevisiae OPT1, SSY5, VPS28, NUP85, and MED4. YlOPT1 and YlSSY5 are not involved in pH sensing but define at least a second protease regulatory pathway.
