Nine polyomavirus (PyV) species are known to productively infect humans. The circular DNA genomes of PyVs are readily detectable using rolling circle amplification (RCA). RCA-based analysis of condyloma specimens from a patient with warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome demonstrated the presence of a tenth apparently human-tropic polyomavirus species, which we name HPyV10.
