Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) functions as a second messenger for many neurotransmitters, hormones and growth factors. It causes the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores by binding to specific receptors that are coupled to Ca2+ channels. Recent studies have shown that there is a family of IP3 receptors, and the complete sequences of two members of this family and partial sequences of two others have been reported. We have determined the complete sequence of a third IP3 receptor, designated IP3R-3, and characterized its pharmacological properties and sites of expression. Rat IP3R-3 is 2670 amino acids in size, has 62 and 64% identity with IP3R-1 and IP3R-2, and is predicted to have a similar structure including a region of eight potential membrane-spanning segments at its COOH terminus, which presumably functions as a Ca2+ channel. Expression of recombinant rat IP3R-3 in COS-7 cells showed that it bound IP3 as well as inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and inositol hexakisphosphate. Immunohistocytochemical studies of cells expressing recombinant IP3R-3 indicated that it has a preferential cellular distribution in the endoplasmic reticulum. RNA and protein blotting studies indicate that IP3R-3 is expressed in a number of different cultured cell lines including insulin-secreting RINm5F cells. The IP3R-3 is also expressed in adult pancreatic islets, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification of IP3R-1, -2, and -3 mRNAs in adult rat pancreatic islets indicated that IP3R-3 was the predominant subtype expressed in this tissue and thus may be responsible for mediating the effects of IP3 on insulin secretion.
