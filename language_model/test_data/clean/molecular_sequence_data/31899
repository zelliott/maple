As one of the major pathogens, hepatopancreatic parvovirus (HPV) can cause severe diseases in penaeid shrimp. We developed a TaqMan-based real-time PCR assay for the HPV detection in China. A pair of primers (HPVF and HPVR) and a TaqMan probe were designed according to the HPV genomic sequence of Chinese isolate (GenBank: GU371276). Our data showed that the primers and TaqMan probe were specific for HPV, and they exhibited no cross-reaction with infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV), white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) and specific pathogen free (SPF) shrimp DNA. The assay had a detection limit of four plasmid HPV DNA copies per reaction. Furthermore, HPV was detected in 16 of 21 Fenneropenaeus Chinensis, 3 of 52 Litopenaeus vannamei and 2 of 2 Marsupenaeus japonicus penaeid shrimp samples. In addition, HPV was also detected in crabs. Therefore, this assay could be successfully used as a sensitive and rapid molecular-based diagnostic method to screen HPV-free animals and survey the prevalence of HPV in cultured populations of penaeid shrimp in China.
