A novel Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-motile, yellow-pigmented and rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain WB5(T), was isolated from the intestinal tract of an abalone, Haliotis discus hannai, collected from the northern coast of Jeju in Korea. The isolate grew optimally at 30 °C, at pH 7 and in the presence of 0.5 % (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain WB5(T) was clustered in the genus Cloacibacterium and shared the highest sequence similarity with C. normanense (98.2 % similarity). The predominant fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0 and iso-C17 : 0 3-OH. Menaquinone-6 was the major respiratory quinone. The genomic DNA G+C content was 29.6 mol%. The DNA-DNA hybridization values indicated <22 % genomic relatedness with other members of the genus Cloacibacterium. The results of physiological, biochemical, chemotaxonomic and genotypic analyses showed that strain WB5(T) represents a novel species of the genus Cloacibacterium, for which the name Cloacibacterium haliotis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is WB5(T) ( = KACC 17210(T) = JCM 18869(T)).
