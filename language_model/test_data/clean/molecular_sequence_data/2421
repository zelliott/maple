Genes expressed in erythroid cells contain binding sites for a cell-specific factor believed to be an important regulator for this haematopoietic lineage. Using high-level transient expression in mammalian cells, we have identified complementary DNA encoding the murine protein. The factor, a new member of the zinc-finger family of DNA-binding proteins, is restricted to erythroid cells at the level of RNA expression and is closely homologous between mouse and man.
