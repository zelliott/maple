Differences observed in the virulence of two related leporipoxviruses are closely tied to a particular region of their genomes. For the virulent poxvirus of this pair, malignant rabbit fibroma virus (MV), this region is the BamHI "C" fragment, which is 10.7 kb. For the avirulent poxvirus, Shope fibroma virus, SFV, this region is the corresponding BamHI "D" fragment, which is 13.1 kb. As part of our attempt to understand the virulence of these two viruses, we sequenced these two DNA fragments. The sequence for the BamHI "C" fragment of MV is reported elsewhere (Strayer et al., 1991). We report here the sequence for SFV's BamHI "D" fragment and resultant open reading frames, and compare both DNA and open reading frame structures to those of MV and other known poxviruses. The BamHI "D" fragment of SFV contains 12 open reading frames of 100 amino acids or more, arranged similarly to orf's in MV and vaccinia. Striking similarities between SFV and MV are seen in certain parts of this restriction fragment, including substantial stretches of DNA in which the two viruses are identical. Clear homologies exist between these leporipox virus genomes and those of other related poxviruses. To understand the pathogenesis of virus infection, one must appreciate the structure of those viral genes that play important roles in infection.
