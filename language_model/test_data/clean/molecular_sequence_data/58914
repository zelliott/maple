To investigate the origin and pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphoma (ARL), we studied 14 cases in which Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection was not an etiologic factor. By histology, 8 of the specimens were of the small noncleaved cell type and 6 consisted of the large diffuse cell type. Southern analysis using a J(H) probe was consistent with a monoclonal B-cell tumor in 13 cases. To characterize the expressed Ig genes, we performed reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and direct sequencing of PCR products. Eight cases expressed IgM and 1 case expressed IgG. V(H)3 genes were found in 5 cases, V(H)4 genes in 3 cases, V(H)1 genes in 2 cases, and a V(H)7 gene in 1 case. The nucleotide homology to known germline V(H) genes ranged from 80% to 97%, suggesting significant somatic diversification of expressed V(H) genes. The large proportion of V(H)3-expressing lymphomas in this series corresponds to the frequency of V(H)3-expressing B cells in the peripheral blood from healthy and (recent) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositve individuals and contrasts with the V(H)3 clonal deficit observed in late stages of HIV infection. Similar to the Ig heavy chain genes, the corresponding Ig light chain genes showed significant deviation from known germline gene sequences. The large proportion of V(H)3-expressing lymphomas as well as the high degree of somatic deviation from germline suggest that these EBV-negative lymphomas might arise from antigen-selected expanded B-cell clones before transformation. Further support for this hypothesis is provided by sequential Ig sequence analysis in 1 patient with large-cell lymphoma. It was shown that 3 years before the diagnosis of axillary lymphoma, there existed several B-cell clones in this patient's bone marrow. One of these clones present in the bone marrow expressed the same rearranged V(H) gene as the axillary lymphoma. Taken together, the current findings from Ig gene analyses suggest that activation of B cells in the early phase of HIV infection may be a predisposing factor for subsequent B-cell transformation.
