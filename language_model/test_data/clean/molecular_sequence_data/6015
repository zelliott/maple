Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TF) are expressed in the developing nervous system and interact with nuclear hormone receptors to regulate expression of different genes. The role of COUP-TF orphan receptors in neurogenesis is virtually unknown. To study the possible function of COUP-TF I during neuronal differentiation, we generated COUP-TF I overexpressing teratocarcinoma PCC7 cell lines and analyzed retinoic acid (RA)-induced neuronal differentiation of these cells. COUP-TF I overexpression results in the blockade of morphological differentiation after induction to differentiate. COUP-TF I represses expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) gene and delays induction of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) gene expression. In contrast, expression of the neurofilament light subunit (NF-L) gene is not affected by COUP-TF I overexpression during neuronal differentiation. Also, cells overexpressing COUP-TF I do not stop proliferating after RA and dBcAMP treatment and possess suppressed transcriptional activation from different RA response elements. These results suggest that COUP-TF I plays an important role in regulating RA-induced neuronal differentiation.
