The possible generation of oxidative stress induced by aromatic hydrocarbon degradation suggests that ancillary enzyme activities could facilitate the utilization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as sole carbon source. To investigate the metabolic profiles of low molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading strains of Sphingobium chlorophenolicum, Rhodococcus aetherovorans, Rhodococcus opacus and Mycobacterium smegmatis, the determination of the activity of putative detoxifying enzymes (rhodanese-like and glutathione S-transferase proteins) was combined with genetic analyses. All the studied strains were able to utilize phenanthrene or naphthalene. Glutathione S-transferase activity was found in S. chlorophenolicum strains grown on phenanthrene and it was related to the presence of the bphK gene, since modulation of glutathione S-transferase activity by phenanthrene paralleled the induction of glutathione S-transferase transcript in the S. chlorophenolicum strains. No glutathione S-transferase activity was detectable in R. aetherovorans, R. opacus and in M. smegmatis strains. All strains showed 3-mercaptopyruvate:cyanide sulfurtransferase activity. A rhodanese-like SseA protein was immunodetected in R. aetherovorans, R. opacus and in M. smegmatis strains, where increase of 3-mercaptopyruvate:cyanide sulfurtransferase activity was significantly induced by growth on phenanthrene.
