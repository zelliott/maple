We have developed a tool for controlled expression of heterologous or ectopic genes in the chestnut pathogen Cryphonectria parasitica using the promoter region from a putative copper-regulated transporter gene. In addition, we have found that expression control via this system is not affected by the virulence-attenuating hypovirus CHV1-EP713.
