We cloned and determined the sequence of a DNA region of approximately 15-kb containing the cluster of genes required for O17 antigen expression in the Escherichia coli K-12 strain from the chromosome of Plesiomonas shigelloides serotype O17:H2 strain. The sequencing analysis revealed that the minimum essential region of the P. shigelloides O17 antigen gene cluster had a size of approximately 11.5-kb and contained 9 contiguous open reading frames (ORFs), which were almost identical to the corresponding ORFs of Shigella sonnei form I antigen gene region, except for IS630 sequence, at the DNA as well as amino acid levels. The putative function of most of the ORFs could be determined on the basis of amino acid sequence similarities and characteristics. In addition, the G+C content of the P. shigelloides O17 antigen genes was lower than that of the chromosomal DNA of P. shigelloides and S. sonnei, suggesting that both P. shigelloides O17 and S. sonnei form I antigen genes had been derived from the same origin with a low G+C content.
