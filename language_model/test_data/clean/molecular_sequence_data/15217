Patients with classical Rett show an apparently normal psychomotor development during the first 6-18 months of life. Thereafter, they enter a short period of developmental stagnation followed by a rapid regression in language and motor development. Purposeful hand use is often lost and replaced by repetitive, stereotypic movements. Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant disorder caused frequently by mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2). The aim of this study was to search for mutations in MECP2 gene in two Tunisian patients affected with RTT. The results of mutation analysis revealed mutations in exon 4 of MECP2 gene in the two patients. In one patient we identified a new mutation consisting of a deletion of four bases (c.810-813delAAAG), which led to a frame shift and generated a premature stop codon (p.Lys271Arg fs X15) in transcriptional repression domain-nuclear localization signal (TRD-NLS) domain of MeCP2 protein. With regard to the second patient, a previously described transition (c.916C>T) that changed an arginine to a cysteine residue (p.R306C) in TRD domain of MeCP2 protein was revealed. In conclusion, a new and a known de novo mutation in MECP2 gene were revealed in two Tunisian patients affected with RTT.
