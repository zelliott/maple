pMRB01 cloned from Pseudomonas K-62 plasmid pMR26 conferred bacterial hypersensitivity to organomercurials. DNA sequence analysis of a 2.3-kb SacI-Aor51HI fragment encompassing the whole region required for expression of the hypersensitive phenotype, revealed three open reading frames. The DNA sequence of these frames had 82.5%, 99.2% and 97.0% homology with the pDU1358 merR, merB and merD, respectively. The pMRB01 mer operon differs from the already known mer operon by the absence of the merT, merP and merA genes in this plasmid. An inverted repeat-like sequence upstream from the predicted merR was observed suggesting that this defective mer operon could be part of a transposon-like structure. Induction experiments and maxicell analysis of the mer-polypeptide showed that the lyase enzyme encoded by pMRB01 merB gene is mercurial-inducible and regulated by the transacting product of the merR gene. These results suggest that the hypersensitivity to organomercurials resulted from the expression of lyase activity encoded by the defective mer operon in the absence of reductase activity. The lyase enzyme encoded by pMRB01 merB catalyzes the protonolysis of the C-Hg bond of both arylmercury and alkylmercury compounds.
