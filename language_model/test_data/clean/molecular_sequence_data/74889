Cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H) is a key enzyme in the phenylpropanoid pathway, which is responsible for synthesizing a variety of secondary metabolites that participate in development and adaptation. In this study, we isolated a full-length cDNA of the C4H gene from the Korean black raspberry (Rubus sp.) and found that this gene existed as a single gene. By comparing the deduced amino acid sequence of Rubus sp. C4H with other sequences reported previously we determined that this sequence was highly conserved among widely divergent plant species. In addition, quantitative real time PCR studies indicated that the C4H gene had a differential expression pattern during fruit development, where gene expression was first detected in green fruit and was then remarkably reduced in yellow fruit, followed by an increase in red and black fruit. To investigate the two peaks in expression observed during fruit development and ripening, we measured the flavonoid content. The content of the major flavanol of Korean black raspberry fruits was determined to be highest at the beginning of fruit development, followed by a gradually decrease according to the developmental stages. In contrast, the content of anthocyanins during the progress of ripening was dramatically increased. Our results suggest that the C4H gene in Korean black raspberry plays a role during color development at the late stages of fruit ripening, whereas the expression of C4H gene during the early stages may be related to the accumulation of flavanols.
