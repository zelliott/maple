A model is proposed for the 3-dimensional structure of endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictor and pressor peptide from vascular endothelium. The model is derived through protein structure prediction and circular dichroism studies, and is based on the atomic coordinates for the bee-venom peptide apamin. The model derived shows the same turn-helix motif as observed for apamin and mast-cell degranulating peptide. On the basis of this model we suggest possible strategies for endothelin antagonist design, and note that this motif may be common in a number of peptides acting on channel proteins.
