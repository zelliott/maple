A Gram-positive, non-motile, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacterium, designated CAAS 251T, was isolated from paper-mill effluent in Wuhan, China. The organism grew optimally at 40-42 degrees C and at pH 9.0-10.0. The major menaquinones were MK-7, MK-8 and MK-9. The predominant cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0 (34.78 %), anteiso-C17:0 (25.24 %) and C16:0 (13.37 %). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 65.5 mol%. A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain CAAS 251T belongs to the genus Nesterenkonia, having sequence identities ranging from 96.0 to 97.0 % with respect to eight recognized species of the genus Nesterenkonia. Data from DNA-DNA hybridization and physiological and biochemical tests indicated that strain CAAS 251T represents a novel species of the genus Nesterenkonia, for which the name Nesterenkonia flava sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CAAS 251T (=CCTCC AB 207010T=JCM 14814T).
