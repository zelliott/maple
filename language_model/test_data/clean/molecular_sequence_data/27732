RNase P from Schizosaccharomyces pombe has been purified over 2000-fold. The apparent Km for two S. pombe tRNA precursors derived from the supS1 and sup3-e tRNA(Ser) genes is 20 nM; the apparent Vmax is 2.5 nM/min (supS1) and 1.1 nM/min (sup3-e). Processing studies with precursors of other mutants show that the structures of the acceptor stem and anticodon/intron loop of tRNA are crucial for S. pombe RNase P action.
