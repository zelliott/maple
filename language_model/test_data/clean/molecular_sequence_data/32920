The influence of monovalent cations on DNA conformation and readout is an open question. This NMR study of DNA with either Na(+) or K(+) at physiological concentrations shows that the nature of the cation affects the (31)P chemical shifts (deltaP) and the sequential distances H2'(i)-H6/8(i+1), H2"(i)-H6/8(i+1), and H6/8(i)-H6/8(i+1). The deltaP and distance variations ascertain that the nature of the cation affects the DNA overall structure, i.e. both the conformational equilibria between the backbone BI (epsilon-zeta <0 degrees ) and BII (epsilon-zeta >0 degrees ) states and the helical parameters, via their strong mechanical coupling. These results reveal that Na(+) and K(+) interactions with DNA are different and sequence-dependent. These ions modulate the overall intrinsic properties of DNA, and possibly its packaging and readout.
