Serum samples from 96 Spanish hemodialysis patients, as well as serial dilutions of RNA extracted from a reference strain of hepatitis G virus (HGV), were tested for HGV or GB virus C (GBV-C) RNA. Two different reverse transcription (RT)-PCR-based methods of detection were compared for the ability to detect RNA extracted from the samples: an RT-nested PCR assay with primers derived from the 5' noncoding region (5'NC) or nonstructural region 3 (NS3) sequences and a commercially available RT-PCR assay with primers derived from the 5'NC or NS5A sequences. When RT-nested PCR was performed on 10-fold serial dilutions of RNA from the HGV reference strain, the last positive dilution was 10(-7) to 10(-8). With the commercial RT-PCR assay, the last positive dilution was 10(-6) to 10(-7). When equal amounts of RNA extracted from serum samples from 96 hemodialysis patients were tested for HGV or GBV-C RNA, 25 patients (26%) were positive by the RT-nested PCR. However, only 21 (84%) of these 25 positive patients were positive for HGV or GBV-C by the commercial RT-PCR assay. Analysis of the 5'NC and NS3 sequences amplified by RT-nested PCR demonstrated that all but two positive patients had unique HGV or GBV-C sequences. In summary, RT-nested PCR and a commercially available RT-PCR assay for HGV or GBV-C gave concordant results for 96% of the patients tested.
