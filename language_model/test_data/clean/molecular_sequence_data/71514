The RPS5 and RFL1 disease resistance genes of Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 are oriented in tandem and are separated by 1.4 kb. The Ler-0 ecotype contains RFL1, but lacks RPS5. Sequence analysis of the RPS5 deletion region in Ler-0 revealed the presence of an Ac-like transposable element, which we have designated Tag2. Southern hybridization analysis of six Arabidopsis ecotypes revealed 4-11 Tag2-homologous sequences in each, indicating that this element is ubiquitous in Arabidopsis and has been active in recent evolutionary time. The Tag2 insertion adjacent to RFL1 was unique to the Ler-0 ecotype, however, and was not present in two other ecotypes that lack RPS5. DNA sequence from the latter ecotypes lacked a transposon footprint, suggesting that insertion of Tag2 occurred after the initial deletion of RPS5. The deletion breakpoint contained a 192-bp insertion that displayed hallmarks of a nonhomologous DNA end-joining event. We conclude that loss of RPS5 was caused by a double-strand break and subsequent repair, and cannot be attributed to unequal crossing over between resistance gene homologs.
