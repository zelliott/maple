It has been proposed that those plants which contain photosynthetic plastids surrounded by more than two membranes have arisen through secondary endosymbiotic events. Molecular evidence confirms this proposal, but the nature of the endosymbiont(s) and the number of endosymbioses remain unresolved. Whether plastids arose from one type of prokaryotic ancestor or multiple types is the subject of some controversy. In order to try to resolve this question, the plastid gene content and arrangement has been studied from a cryptomonad alga. Most of the gene clusters common to photosynthetic prokaryotes and plastids are preserved and seventeen genes which are not found on the plastid genomes of land plants have been found. Together with previously published phylogenetic analyses of plastid genes, the present data support the notion that the type of prokaryote involved in the initial endosymbiosis was from within the cyanobacterial assemblage and that an early divergence giving rise to the green plant lineage and the rhodophyte lineage resulted in the differences in plastid gene content and sequence between these two groups. Multiple secondary endosymbiotic events involving a eukaryotic (probably rhodophytic alga) and different hosts are hypothesized to have occurred subsequently, giving rise to the chromophyte, cryptophyte and euglenophyte lineages.
