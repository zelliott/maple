In May and August 2009, 14 highly pathogenic H5N1 isolates were obtained from migratory birds in central Mongolia. To trace the genetic lineage of the isolates, nucleotide sequences of all eight genes were determined and phylogenetically analyzed. Hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein genes were clustered in clade 2.3.2. The polymerase acidic gene was related to the isolates of South Korea and Japan obtained in 2003 and 2004 outbreaks, and a migratory duck isolate from Jiangxi, China. The neuraminidase and other internal genes were closely related to those of clade 2.3.4 viruses. The results indicate evolving genetic diversity of the hemagglutinin gene and acquisition of different polymerase acidic gene in the 2009 Mongolian isolates, likely via bird migration. Prevention of potentially wider outbreak in domestic poultry and accurate monitoring of H5N1 genetic mutation will require continuous monitoring for H5N1 in both domestic and wild birds, and will necessitate international cooperation with neighboring countries sharing migratory flyways.
