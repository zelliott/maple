The 106 methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated in Fukushima Medical College Hospital were examined for their properties and mecA gene. The strains produced four types of coagulase, of which type II was the most common, produced by 84 (79.2%). Beta-lactamase was produced by 58 (50%). Enterotoxins were produced by 45 (42.5%), most of which (39/106, 36.8%) were of type A. Thirty-four strains (32.1%) produced both enterotoxins and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. All strains were susceptible to vancomycin and arbekacin, although they were mostly resistant to many other antibiotics. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, the mecA gene was detected in 57 (91.9%) of the 62 strains used. In addition, one of the 42 methicillin-susceptible strains isolated had the mecA gene. These results indicate that detection of the mecA gene by the PCR technique is a rapid and accurate way to identify methicillin resistance.
