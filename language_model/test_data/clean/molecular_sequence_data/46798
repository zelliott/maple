Pooled human milk oligosaccharides were fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography on AG 1-X2 and by an improved gel filtration procedure that allowed the separation of large oligosaccharides on Toyopearl HW 40 (S) and Bio-Gel P-6 columns, respectively. The analysis of the resulting nonderivatizated fractions by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) revealed several neutral and acidic high-molecular-weight oligosaccharides. So far unknown acidic oligosaccharides containing up to 20 monomers were detected in a molecular mass range of 2094-3626 Da. Furthermore, neutral structures containing up to 35 monosaccharides were identified after fractionation on Toyopearl HW 40 (S) and subsequent P-6 fractionation, demonstrating the suitability of the applied method for the preparation of oligosaccharides in this high-molecular-mass range. The composition of the detected oligosaccharides was found to be the same as those previously identified in oligosaccharides of lower masses. However, an enormous structural heterogeneity was observed when acidic and neutral fractions were characterized by high-pH anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD). From our analysis we may conclude that each molecular mass identified by MALDI-MS corresponds to a variety of isomeric structures. The total number of oligosaccharides occurring in human milk may consequently be much higher than estimated before.
