Staphylococcus intermedius isolates from dogs (n = 44) and pigeons (n = 62) were categorized into 12 types by intergenic ribosomal DNA spacer polymorphism analysis. All isolates from pigeons were lukS positive and all isolates from dogs were lukS and lukF positive by dot blot analysis. The mean leukotoxicity titer for dog isolates was at least 129-fold higher than that for pigeon isolates.
