A novel acidic heteropolysaccharide (TAPA1) was purified from hot water extracts of Tremella aurantialba fruiting bodies by DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and Sephacryl S-500 High-Resolution Chromatography. The heteropolysaccharide had a molecular weight of ca. 1.35x10(6)Da, and a carbohydrate content estimated to be approximately 98.7% by the phenol-sulfuric acid method. It was composed mainly of d-mannose, d-xylose, and d-glucuronic acid in the ratio of ca. 5:4:1, along with trace amounts of d-galacturonic acid and d-glucose. Monosaccharide compositional analysis and GC-MS of methylated derivatives, combined with (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopies (including COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC spectra), revealed TAPA1 to consist of an alpha-(1-->3)-linked mannopyranosyl backbone, partially substituted at position 4 with xylose side chains, and at position 2 with side chains composed of either xylose, mannose, and glucuronic acid or of xylose and mannose. Bioactivity testing showed that TAPA1 stimulated the proliferation of mouse spleen lymphocytes in vitro.
