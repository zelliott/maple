The spoIIIC locus of Bacillus subtilis has been cloned from the lambda library of Ferrari et al. (E. Ferrari, D. J. HEnner, and J. A. Hoch, J. Bacteriol. 146:430-432, 1981) by using as an assay transformation of the mutant allele spoIIIC94 to the wild type. Regulation of the spoIIIC locus was studied by hybridization of cloned spoIIIC DNA to RNA pulse-labeled at various times during growth and sporulation. The relative rate of transcription of the spoIIIC locus was highest 3 h after the end of growth. The DNA sequence of the spoIIIC transcription unit indicated the coding capacity for a small protein (138 amino acids) having significant similarity with one domain of RNA polymerase sigma factors. Interruption of this coding sequence by an insertion mutation caused cells to become Spo-.
