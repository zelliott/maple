Aromatase cytochrome P450 (P450arom) is expressed in a variety of tissues. Pigs express P450arom as bilaminar blastocysts in utero, and thereafter in the gonads, adrenal glands and placenta. Our studies also demonstrate the existence of porcine isozymes of P450arom which differ substantially in their amino acid composition and function. The placental isoform, most similar to P450arom in other mammals, consists of 503 amino acids. The ovarian isoform, expressed in both theca and granulosa cells, is a 501 amino acid protein exhibiting less than 20% of the activity of the placental isozyme. Furthermore, it is inhibited not only by CGS16949A but also by etomidate which does not inhibit the placental P450arom. Partial sequences generated by the rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE) procedure indicate that the expression of a third isoform in the blastocyst is switched to the placental isozyme during differentiation of the fetal membranes. In addition, these transcripts, and others from the theca, granulosa, testes, adrenal glands and placenta demonstrate differences in the 5'-untranslated region (putative exon I) suggestive of tissue-specific alternative splicing. An identical 5'-untranslated sequence was obtained from transcripts expressed in the theca and granulosa. Testes and adrenal transcripts also have identical 5' ends, which differ substantially from the ovarian sequence. Blastocyst and placenta 5'-untranslated sequences differ from each other and from those expressed in the gonads and adrenals. Several tissue-specific transcripts thus encode porcine P450arom. Interestingly, distinct 5' sequences exist for ovarian and testes P450arom mRNAs, suggesting different promoters and therefore regulation in the male and female gonads. The molecular origins of the functional isoforms and the tissue-specific transcripts are uncertain, however partial genomic sequence and other genetic analyses suggest the existence of multiple genes. However, sequence alignment of the placental and ovarian isoforms indicates complete conservation of putative exon III, so that complex splicing remains a possibility. Clearly, the regulation of P450arom expression is more complex in the pig than in other vertebrates investigated to date.
