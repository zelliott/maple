The transcription factor EGR2 is expressed in Schwann cells, where it controls peripheral nerve myelination. Mutations of EGR2 have been found in patients with congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1D. In a patient with congenital amyelinating neuropathy, we observed pathological abnormalities recapitulating the peripheral nervous system phenotype of homozygous Egr2-null mice. This patient, born from consanguineous parents, showed no EGR2 immunoreactivity in Schwann cells and harbored a homozygous 10.7-kilobase-long deletion encompassing a myelin-specific enhancer of EGR2. This regulatory mutation is the first genetic abnormality associated with congenital amyelinating neuropathy in humans.
