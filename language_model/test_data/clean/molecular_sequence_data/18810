Bovine noroviruses are enteric pathogens that are detected in stool samples from cattle. Five genogroups are currently described in the genus Norovirus (family Caliciviridae), and within the genogroups, sequences are further divided into genotypes according to genetic homology and phylogenetic relationships. In this study, stool specimens from Belgian cattle were screened by RT-PCR. All of the sequences that were detected were phylogenetically related to genogroup III genotype 2 bovine noroviruses, confirming their higher prevalence in comparison with strains from genotype 1. When other sequences from around the world were introduced, phylogenetic inferences allowed neither the determination of phylogenetic lineages over time nor the deduction of topotypes for genotype 2 bovine noroviruses. Three complete genotype 2 bovine norovirus sequences were also compared genetically (Newbury2/1976 /UK, Dumfries/1994/UK and B309/2003/BE). Interestingly, the genetic divergence of the complete genomes of these three strains was relatively low, but a region of the N-terminal protein encoded by ORF1, the hypervariable region of the capsid gene encoded by ORF2, and a region of the minor structural protein encoded by ORF3 seem to be the most exposed to genetic evolution. Bayesian inference also showed that genetic evolution of genogroup III, genotype 2 bovine noroviruses over a 30-year period seemed to be lower than that already reported for noroviruses from the genotypes 3 and 4 in genogroup II.
