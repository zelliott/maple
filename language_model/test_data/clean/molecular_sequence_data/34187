The gene M94 of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) as well as its homologues UL16 in alphaherpesviruses is involved in viral morphogenesis. For a better understanding of its role in the viral life cycle, a library of random M94 mutants was generated by modified transposon-based linker scanning mutagenesis. A comprehensive set of M94 mutants was reinserted into the MCMV genome and tested for their capacity to complement the M94 null mutant. Thereby, 34 loss-of-function mutants of M94 were identified, which were tested in a second screen for their capacity to inhibit virus replication. This analysis identified two N-terminal insertion mutants of M94 with a dominant negative effect. We compared phenotypes induced by the conditional expression of these dominant negative M94 alleles with the null phenotype of the M94 deletion. The viral gene expression cascade and the nuclear morphogenesis steps were not affected in either setting. In both cases, however, secondary envelopment did not proceed in the absence of functional M94, and capsids subsequently accumulated in the center of the cytoplasmic assembly complex. In addition, deletion of M94 resulted in a block of cell-to-cell spread. Moreover, the dominant negative mutant of M94 demonstrated a defect in interacting with M99, the UL11 homologue of MCMV.
