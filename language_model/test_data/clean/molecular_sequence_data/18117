A DNA sequence between two legumin genes in Pisum is a member of the copia-like class of retrotransposons and represents one member of a polymorphic and heterogeneous dispersed repeated sequence family in Pisum. This sequence can be exploited in genetic studies either by RFLP analysis where several markers can be scored together, or the segregation of individual elements can be followed after PCR amplification of specific members.
