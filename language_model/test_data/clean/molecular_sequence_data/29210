Lipoamino acid-based synthetic peptides (lipid core peptides, LCP) derived from the type-specific and conserved region determinants of group A streptococci (GAS) were evaluated as potential candidate sequences in a vaccine to prevent GAS-associated diseases, including rheumatic heart disease and poststreptococcal acute glomerulonephritis. The LCP peptides had significantly enhanced immunogenicity as compared with the monomeric peptide epitopes. Furthermore, the peptides incorporated into the LCP system generated epitope-specific antibodies without the use of any conventional adjuvant.
