Blackcurrant reversion virus (BRV) belongs in the subgroup c of nepoviruses. The 3' NTRs of RNAs 1 and 2 of BRV are 1360 and 1363 nucleotides long, respectively, and highly similar (94.8%). In this study we have compared the sequences of the 3' NTRs of ten BRV isolates, originating from different geographic regions or hosts. All deduced sequences were 94.1-98.8% identical with each other, and with the previously deduced 3' NTR sequences of RNAsl and 2 of the type isolate. The proceeding 480 nucleotides of the CP coding region were 86.9-97.9% identical between the same isolates.
