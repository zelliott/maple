We characterized three d-galactosyl-beta1-->3-N-acetyl-d-hexosamine phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.211) homologs from Clostridium phytofermentans (Cphy0577, Cphy1920, and Cphy3030 proteins). Cphy0577 and Cphy3030 proteins exhibited similar activity on galacto-N-biose (GNB; d-Gal-beta1-->3-d-GalNAc) and lacto-N-biose I (LNB; d-Gal-beta1-->3-d-GlcNAc), thus indicating that they are d-galactosyl-beta1-->3-N-acetyl-d-hexosamine phosphorylases, subclassified as GNB/LNB phosphorylase. In contrast, Cphy1920 protein phosphorolyzed neither GNB nor LNB. It showed the highest activity with l-rhamnose as the acceptor in the reverse reaction using alpha-d-galactose 1-phosphate as the donor. The reaction product was d-galactosyl-beta1-->4-l-rhamnose. The enzyme also showed activity on l-mannose, l-lyxose, d-glucose, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, and d-galactose in this order. When d-glucose derivatives were used as acceptors, reaction products were beta-1,3-galactosides. Kinetic parameters of phosphorolytic activity on d-galactosyl-beta1-->4-l-rhamnose were k(cat) = 45 s(-1) and K(m) = 7.9 mm, thus indicating that these values are common among other phosphorylases. We propose d-galactosyl-beta1-->4-l-rhamnose phosphorylase as the name for Cphy1920 protein.
