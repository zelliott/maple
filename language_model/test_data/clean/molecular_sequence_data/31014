The structure of the O-specific polysaccharide chain of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci strain 223 (serogroup VII) lipopolysaccharide was established on the basis of one- and two-dimensional 1H NMR analysis, 13C NMR analysis and calculation of optical rotation. The structure determined by the non-destructive way was confirmed by acid hydrolysis and methylation. (Sequence: see text). O-Antigen of the strain studied is similar in structure and serological properties to O-antigens of Pseudomonas syringae strains belonging to serogroup I.
