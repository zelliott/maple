Guide RNAs (gRNAs) for the editing of sites 1-8 of COIII mRNA and an "unexpected" partially edited COIII mRNA are encoded in the variable regions of specific kinetoplast DNA minicircles. The gRNAs can form 37 and 44 nucleotide perfect hybrids (allowing for G-U base pairs) with edited mRNAs. The gRNAs were detected on Northern blots and shown to have unique 5' ends situated close to the beginning of the potential base pairing with the edited mRNAs. We suggest that kinetoplast DNA minicircle molecules in general may encode gRNAs for editing of cryptogene mRNAs by a mechanism similar to that previously proposed for editing by maxicircle-encoded gRNAs.
