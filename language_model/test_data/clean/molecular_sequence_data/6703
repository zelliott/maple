Several families of putative transposable elements (TrEs) in both solanaceous plants and Caenorhabditis elegans have been identified by screening the DNA data base for inverted repeated domains present in multiple copies in the genome. The elements are localized within intron and flanking regions of many genes. These elements consist of two inverted repeats flanking sequences ranging from 5 bp to > 500 bp. Identification of multiple elements in which sequence conservation includes both the flanking and internal regions implies that these TrEs are capable of duplicative transposition. Two of the elements were identified in promoter regions of the tomato (Lycoperiscon esculentum) polygalacturonase and potato (Solanum tuberosum) Win1 genes. The element in the polygalacturonase promoter spans a known regulatory region. In both cases, ancestral DNA sequences, which represent potential recombination target sequences prior to insertion of the elements, have been cloned from related species. The sequences of the inverted repeated domains in plants and C. elegans show a high degree of phylogenetic conservation. While frequency of the different elements is variable, some are present in very high copy number. A member of a single C. elegans TrE family is observed approximately once every 20 kb in the genome. The abundance of the described TrEs suggests utility in the genomic analysis of these and related organisms.
