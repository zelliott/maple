Significant progress has recently been achieved in the use of glycosidases and glycosyltransferases as synthetic tools. Glycosidases have been used to synthesize trisaccharides with a reasonable overall yield, as well as high-mannose neoglycoconjugates. Studies on glycosyltransferases have defined reaction mechanisms and demonstrated reasonable substrate tolerance of these enzymes. Effective methodology for the synthesis of defined glycoproteins has also been demonstrated.
