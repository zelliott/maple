The Staphylococcus aureus ileS gene, encoding isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS), contains a long mRNA leader region. This region exhibits many of the features of the gram-positive synthetase gene family, including the T box and leader region terminator and antiterminator. The terminator was shown to be functional in vivo, and readthrough increased during growth in the presence of mupirocin, an inhibitor of IleRS activity. The S. aureus ileS leader structure includes several critical differences from the other members of the T-box family, suggesting that regulation of this gene in S. aureus may exhibit unique features.
