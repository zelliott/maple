We have previously suggested that transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II can be blocked when the nascent RNA is folded into a stem-and-loop structure followed by polyuridines. As an approach to test this suggestion in vitro, several GC-rich deoxyoligonucleotides with dyad symmetries were chemically synthesized and inserted following the adenovirus 2 major late promoter. These constructs were transcribed in vitro using HeLa whole cell extract. The transcripts of the synthetic inserts can potentially form stem-and-loop structures with destabilization energy from 0 to -48 kcal followed by 3, 5, and 8 U residues. The results obtained show that transcription elongation is blocked by these synthetic inserts and that the extent of the elongation block is directly correlated to the stabilities of the potential stem-and-loop structure and the proceeding number of U residues. Three levels of elongation blocks were observed: a brief pause of the polymerase occurs when the RNA could be folded into a secondary structure or when there were 5-6 T residues on the sense DNA strand. An extended pause occurred when the number of T residues on the sense DNA strand was increased to 8. Transcription termination, with a partial release of the attenuated transcript occurred when a stable RNA secondary structure (delta G = -48 kcal) was followed by 8 U residues. The relevancy of these in vitro results to the in vivo mechanism of a transcription elongation block is discussed.
