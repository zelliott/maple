Two isoforms of an extracellular endonuclease, nuclease Sm1 and nuclease Sm2, were isolated from the culture filtrate of Serratia marcescens strain B10 M1 by the ligand-exchange chromatography on iminodiacetate-agarose in Cu2(+)-form, and chromatography on phosphocellulose and DEAE-Toyopearl 650S. The pI for nucleases Sm1 and Sm2 were found to be 7.1 and 6.7, respectively. The amino acid analysis and N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the proteins showed a significant degree of homology between the enzymes. The secondary structure of nuclease Sm2 was calculated. Crystals of nuclease Sm2 were obtained with the space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), a 69.0; b 106.7; c 74.8 A.
