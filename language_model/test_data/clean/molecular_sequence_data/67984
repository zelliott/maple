Infection of a human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32) with the JC polyomavirus (JCV) strain Mad-1 with subsequent serial passage results in the generation of a virus adapted to growth in IMR-32 (K. Akatani, M. Imai, M. Kimura, K. Nagashima, and N. Ikegami, J. Med. Virol., in press). To understand the basis of this adaptation, we molecularly cloned JCV DNAs from the adapted virus. The cloned JCV DNAs consisted of essentially three species (M1-IMRa, -IMRb, and -IMRc) with rearranged regulatory regions. Two TATA sequences are present in the regulatory region of the parental virus Mad-1, but one distal from the origin of replication was commonly deleted in M1-IMRa, -IMRb, and -IMRc. We showed that these regulatory regions were required for the efficient growth of JCV in IMR-32. Various JCV strains should be propagated in IMR-32, if their regulatory regions are replaced with those defined in this study. Since it is difficult to propagate JCV in cells other than primary human fetal glial cells, this system may be useful for structural and immunological studies of JCV.
