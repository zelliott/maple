Mutations in the connexin 26 (Cx26) gene (GJB2) are a common cause of hereditary hearing impairment which affects approximately 1 in 2000 newborn children. We report the identification of a novel Cx26 point mutation (439 G-->A) linked to familial, autosomal recessive, sensorineural hearing loss. This missense mutation (E147K) is located in the highly conserved, putative K(+) channel lining sequence of the third transmembrane domain (TM3) of Cx26. Hearing impairment associated with this mutation was congenital, moderate to profound and showed no signs of progressive deterioration.
