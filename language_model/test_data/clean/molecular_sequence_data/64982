We isolated a new family of satellite DNA sequences from HaeIII- and EcoRI-digested genomic DNA of the Blakiston's fish owl ( Ketupa blakistoni). The repetitive sequences were organized in tandem arrays of the 174 bp element, and localized to the centromeric regions of all macrochromosomes, including the Z and W chromosomes, and microchromosomes. This hybridization pattern was consistent with the distribution of C-band-positive centromeric heterochromatin, and the satellite DNA sequences occupied 10% of the total genome as a major component of centromeric heterochromatin. The sequences were homogenized between macro- and microchromosomes in this species, and therefore intraspecific divergence of the nucleotide sequences was low. The 174 bp element cross-hybridized to the genomic DNA of six other Strigidae species, but not to that of the Tytonidae, suggesting that the satellite DNA sequences are conserved in the same family but fairly divergent between the different families in the Strigiformes. Secondly, the centromeric satellite DNAs were cloned from eight Strigidae species, and the nucleotide sequences of 41 monomer fragments were compared within and between species. Molecular phylogenetic relationships of the nucleotide sequences were highly correlated with both the taxonomy based on morphological traits and the phylogenetic tree constructed by DNA-DNA hybridization. These results suggest that the satellite DNA sequence has evolved by concerted evolution in the Strigidae and that it is a good taxonomic and phylogenetic marker to examine genetic diversity between Strigiformes species.
