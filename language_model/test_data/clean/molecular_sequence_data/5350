Extracellular laccases from submerged cultures of Coriolus versicolor BKM F-116, Panus tigrinus 8/18, Phlebia radiata 79 (ATCC 64658), Phlebia tremellosa 77-51 and from cultures of Pa. tigrinus 8/18, Ph. radiata 79 and Agaricus bisporus D-649 grown on wheat straw (solid-state fermentation) were purified. All enzymes from submerged cultures had a blue colour and characteristic absorption and EPR spectra. Laccases from the solid-state cultures were yellow-brown and had no typical blue oxidase spectra and also showed atypical EPR spectra. Comparison of N-terminal amino acid sequences of purified laccases showed high homology between blue and yellow-brown laccase forms. Formation of yellow laccases as a result of binding of lignin-derived molecules by enzyme protein is proposed.
