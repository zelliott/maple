Two cDNA clones for the barley photosystem I polypeptide which migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 9.5 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels have been isolated using antibodies and an oligonucleotide probe. The determined N-terminal amino acid sequence for the mature polypeptide confirms the identification of the clones. The 644 base-pair sequence of one of the clones contains one large open reading frame coding for a 14,882 Da precursor polypeptide. The molecular mass of the mature polypeptide is 10 193 Da. The hydropathy plot of the polypeptide shows one membranespanning region with a predicted alpha-helix secondary structure. The gene for the 9.5 kDa polypeptide has been designated PsaH.
