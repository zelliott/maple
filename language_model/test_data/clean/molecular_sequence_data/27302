Recombination in human adenoviruses (HAdV) may confer virulence upon an otherwise nonvirulent strain. The genome sequence of species D HAdV type 22 (HAdV-D22) revealed evidence for recombination with HAdV-D19 and HAdV-D37 within the capsid penton base gene. Bootscan analysis demonstrated that recombination sites within the penton base gene frame the coding sequences for the two external hypervariable loops in the protein. A similar pattern of recombination was evident within other HAdV-D types but not other HAdV species. Further study of recombination among HAdVs is needed to better predict possible recombination events among wild-type viruses and adenoviral gene therapy vectors.
