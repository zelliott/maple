Nuclear migration plays a prominent role in a broad range of developmental processes. We have cloned a Drosophila gene, DnudC, encoding a protein that is evolutionarily conserved between humans and fungi. The Aspergillus homolog, nudC, is one of a group of genes required for nuclear migration. DnudC encodes a 38.5-kDa protein, and the carboxy terminal half of the protein shares 52% amino acid identity with Aspergillus nudC. We show that the structural homology between DnudC and nudC extends to the functional level since the Drosophila gene can rescue the nuclear migration defects seen in Aspergillus nudC mutants. Immunolocalization studies using antisera against DnudC reveal that the protein is localized to the cytoplasm in Drosophila ovaries and embryos. Our data suggest that the nudC genes may be components of a functionally conserved pathway involved in the regulation of nuclear motility.
