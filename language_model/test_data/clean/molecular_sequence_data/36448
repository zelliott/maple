Sphingomyelinase (sphingomyelin cholinephosphohydrolase) [EC 3.1.4.12] of Bacillus cereus was overproduced in a protein-hyperproducing strain, B. brevis 47, by cloning the gene into an expression vector pNU211, which has been developed to express a foreign gene utilizing a promoter and a signal sequence of an outer cell wall protein gene. From 1 liter of culture, about 10 mg of protein was purified to near-homogeneity by two steps of column chromatography; this is almost 500 times higher production compared to the conventional preparation from the original strain, B. cereus IAM 1208. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the secreted enzyme was identical to that of the authentic enzyme, indicating that the signal sequence for secretion of B. cereus was processed properly in B. brevis 47.
