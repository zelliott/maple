This work was performed to clarify the differences in glycan moieties between multiple molecular mass forms of bovine lactoferrins (bovine lactoferrins-a and -b). After digestion of both bovine lactoferrins with cyanogen bromide and V8 protease, glycopeptides were successively purified by concavalin A affinity chromatography and HPLC on an octadecylsilyl column. Four glycopeptides glycosylated at Asn-233, -368, -476, and -545 were obtained from both hydrolysates of bovine lactoferrins-a and -b. On the other hand, a glycopeptide glycosylated at Asn-281 was only detected in hydrolysate of bovine lactoferrin-a, indicating that bovine lactoferrin-a possessed five N-glycosylated sites. The glycan linked to Asn-281 of bovine lactoferrin-a was found to consist of fucose, galactose, and N-acetylgalactosamine in addition to mannose and N-acetylglucosamine. HPLC analysis of this glycan on a normal phase column showed that peaks of several glycans were detected. These glycans changed to one major glycan consisting of only mannose and N-acetylglucosamine on exoglycosidase digestion. From these results, this glycan seemed to be of the complex type and possess heterogeneous structure.
