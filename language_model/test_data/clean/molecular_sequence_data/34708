To study the molecular characteristics of YN92-4 strain isolated from mosquitoes in Yunnan Province and define its classification.

The S segment of YN92-4 strain was amplified and sequenced by 2 different sets of primers. The phylogenic tree of S fragment was constructed by Phylip bio-software. The amino acid sequences of N and NSs proteins were also studied.

YN92-4 strain could be amplified by 2 sets of primers respectively, S segment showed a highest homology with Batai virus (X73464), reached 96.4%, the homology of protein N and NSs amio-acid sequence with Batai virus was 99.1% and 98% respectively.

The YN92-4 strain belongs to Batai virus, this is the first report of molecular biological identification of Batai virus in China.
