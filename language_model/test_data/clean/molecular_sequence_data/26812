Following the successful production of recombinant 20K-GH, several studies investigating the physiology of this GH isoform have been undertaken. In this report, we review studies of its biological effect, measurement and secretion. To use serum 20K-GH level in detecting GH abuse, new method has been established and serum 22K-GH, 20K-GH were measured in normal subjects and athletes, and no abnormal results were found among athletes. Another study confirmed that serum 22K-GH increased remarkably and 20K-GH decreased following the exogenous administration of 22K-GH. The duration was relatively short, approximately 24-36h in our and other studies. The increase of the ratio, 22K-GH/20K-GH was the most suitable indicator of GH abuse. Studies supported by the WADA were undertaken in collaboration with an Australian Group. A new approach for the GH isoform assay by beads assay platform is being developed. It is concluded that the direct measurement of 20K-GH is a valid scientific approach, for detecting GH abuse, although the duration of the positive results is short. Our method will be useful in combination with the marker method, an out-of-competition test or test for target cases. Furthermore, its application for the doping test passport is considered to be a possible future strategy.
