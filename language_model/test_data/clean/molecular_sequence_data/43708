High and low catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity is significantly determined by thermostability, which is caused by a valine/methionine108 polymorphism associated with polymorphic G/A1947 bases, in exon 4 of the COMT gene. Our allelic association study on this polymorphism did not find any statistically significant difference between our Chinese Parkinson's disease and that of control subjects. These results show that this polymorphism and hence the thermostability of COMT enzyme are not related to a risk of developing Parkinson's disease.
