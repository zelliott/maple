The genetic defect in the p67phox-deficient form of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. When genomic DNA from normal individuals is digested with HindIII and probed with p67phox cDNA an allelic restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of 4.0 kb or 2.3 kb is detected. We cloned and characterized the p67phox gene using the cDNA and sequenced the exon/intron boundaries, mapping 16 exons on the 40-kb gene. The polymorphic region was then sequenced to identify the inheritance pattern of amniocentesis-derived fetal cells by genomic amplification. The proband, a 9-year-old female patient with p67phox-deficient CGD, and her phenotypically normal mother are homozygous for the RFLP marker, whereas the father and two brothers are heterozygous. The fetus was shown to be heterozygous as well, showing it had inherited at least one normal p67phox gene from the father and that it was predicted to have a normal phenotype. Cord blood samples at birth showed normal oxidative function. Amplification allows rapid detection of the inheritance pattern for fetal diagnosis in informative families. We report the genomic structure of p67phox and an amplification-based method for detection of the marker on chromosome 1q25, used here for prenatal diagnosis of CGD.
