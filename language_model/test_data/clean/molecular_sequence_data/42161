Lysosomal beta-hexosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.52) occurs as two major isozymes, Hex A (alpha beta) and Hex B (beta beta). The alpha and beta subunits are encoded by the HEXA and HEXB genes, respectively. Extensive homology in both the gene structures and deduced primary sequences demonstrate their common evolutionary origin. While undergoing similar proteolytic modifications in the lysosome, the pro beta polypeptide is additionally cleaved internally to produce the mature 24-30 kilodalton beta b and beta a chains. Previous data have suggested that this processing event occurs somewhere between residues Ser311 and Lys315. In this report we demonstrate that this area is located in a hydrophilic disulfide-loop structure (between Cys309 and Cys360). The cleavage event is prevented by the deletion through in vitro mutagenesis of the Arg312-Gln-Asn-Lys tetrapeptide or by its substitution with the aligned alpha residues (Gly-Ser-Glu-Pro). Reintroduction of either Arg312 or Lys315 reinstates the processing. Furthermore, we show that this area is not involved in lysosomal targeting of pro-Hex B, or in the increased stability or the variation in substrate specificity of the beta as compared with the alpha subunit. Our data suggest the presence of a novel lysosomal endoprotease. Like other endoproteases it is specific for basic amino acids; however, it cleaves on the amino-terminal side rather than the conventional carboxy-terminal side of such residues and then only if they are fully exposed to the lysosomal environment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
