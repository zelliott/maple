To construct an eukaryotic expression vector for RNA interference targeting activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) gene,  and explore its effect on proliferation and apoptosis of  HepG2 cells.

Two complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized based on ATF-2 mRNA sequence. The annealed fragment was inserted into the vector PBA-siU6. The recombinant plasmid PBA-siATF-2 was confirmed by DNA sequencing and transfected into HepG2 cells mediated by liposome. After transfection,  ATF-2 protein was detected by Western blotting. The cellular growth activity and apoptosis rate were measured by MTT assay and flow cytometry,  respectively.

Recombinant plasmid expressing siRNA targeting ATF-2 gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid transfection down-regulated the level of ATF-2 protein in HepG2 cells,   which blocked cellular growth and induced cell apoptosis.

The eukaryotic expression vector for RNA interference targeting ATF-2 gene was constructed successfully,  which inhibits HepG2 cell  proliferation and induces cell apoptosis.
