A physical map of the Clostridium beijerinckii (formerly Clostridium acetobutylicum) NCIMB 8052 chromosome has been constructed, encompassing about 90 rare restriction sites. The 14 rrn operons together with about 40 genes have been assigned positions on the map. Genetic analysis and gene transfer have been developed in this organism to enable in vivo analysis of the roles of cloned genes using marker replacement technology. Experiments using the available genetic tools have shown that spo0A plays a cardinal role in controlling several aspects of the transition from exponential growth to stationary phase in C. beijerinckii. These include initiation of sporulation, accumulation of the storage polysaccharide, granulose, and production of acetone and butanol. Several C. beijerinckii and C. acetobutylicum genes concerned with fermentative metabolism, whose expression is modulated at the onset of solventogenesis, contain sequence motifs resembling 0A boxes in their 5' regulatory regions. This invites the speculation that they are under the direct control of Spo0A, and additional data are now required to test this prediction.
