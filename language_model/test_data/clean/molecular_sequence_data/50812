Four monoclonal antibodies, M-T21, M-T32, M-T41 and UM4D4, which belong to the new CDw 60 cluster of antibodies specific for a subpopulation of human T-lymphocytes, were found to bind mainly to acetylated forms of ganglioside GD3. After O-deacetylation of the antigen, binding was reduced ("M-T"-antibodies) or abolished (UM4D4).
