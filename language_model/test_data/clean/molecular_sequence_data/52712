The gene encoding the insulin-like growth-factor type-2 receptor (Igf2r) is maternally expressed and imprinted. A CpG island in Igf2r intron 2 that carries a maternal-specific methylation imprint was shown in a transgenic model to be essential for Igf2r imprinting and for the production of an antisense RNA from the paternal allele. We report here that the endogenous region2 is the promoter for this antisense RNA (named Air, for antisense Igf2r RNA) and that the 3' end lies 107,796 bp distant in an intron of the flanking, but non-imprinted, gene Mas1.
