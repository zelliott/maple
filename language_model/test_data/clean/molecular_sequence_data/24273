Phosphoinositide 3-kinase C2alpha (PI3K-C2alpha) belongs to the class II phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, which are defined by their in vitro usage of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate as substrates. All type II phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases contain at their C terminus a C2-like domain. Here we demonstrate that Homo sapiens phosphoinositide 3-kinase C2alpha (HsPI3K-C2alpha) has dual cellular localization present in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. A distinct nuclear localization signal sequence was identified by expressing HsPI3K-C2alpha-green fluorescent protein fusion proteins in HeLa cells. The nuclear localization signal was mapped to a stretch of 11 amino acids (KRKTKISRKTR) located within C2-like domain of the kinase. In the cytoplasm and the nucleus HsPI3K-C2alpha associates with macromolecular complexes that are resistant to detergent extraction. Indirect immunofluorescence reveals that in the nucleus HsPI3K-C2alpha is enriched at distinct subnuclear domains known as nuclear speckles, which contain pre-mRNA processing factors and are functionally connected to RNA metabolism. Phosphorylation of HsPI3K-C2alpha is induced by inhibition of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription and coincides with enlargement and rounding up of the nuclear speckles. The results suggest that phosphorylation of HsPI3K-C2alpha is inversely linked to mRNA transcription and supports the importance of phosphoinositides for nuclear activity.
