Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a bottle-nosed dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) interleukin-4 (IL4) cDNA was cloned and sequenced. IL4 specific primers were based on the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of the human and murine IL4 gene. The dolphin IL4 cDNA is 528 base pairs in length and contains an open reading frame of 402 nucleotides coding an IL4 precursor of 133 amino acids, with the putative signal peptide of 24 amino acids. Analysis of the mature amino acid sequence shows three potential N-linked glycosylation sites and three disulfide bonds. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence shows that dolphin IL4 shares 77, 74, 58 and 41% identity with the bovine, ovine, human and mouse IL4s, respectively.
