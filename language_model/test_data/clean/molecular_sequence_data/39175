The Xenopus cDNA for interleukin-1beta (IL-1B) was cloned and sequenced. The gene contains 1,462 nucleotides that translate in a single reading frame to give a predicted 283-amino acid IL-1beta molecule. The translated molecule contains a single potential glycosylation site, a readily identifiable IL-1 family signature, and has highest homology to chicken IL-1beta by phylogenetic tree analysis and sequence similarity. It lacks a signal peptide in common with other known IL-1B genes, and lacks a clear ICE (caspase) cut site in common with other nonmammalian IL-1B genes sequenced to date. RT-PCR was used to study sites of IL-1B transcript expression, 24 h following injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Expression was detected in the brain, liver, kidney, and spleen, with expression weakest in the brain and strongest in the spleen. No transcript expression was detectable following injection of saline. Northern blot analysis was used to quantify the induction of IL-1B expression in splenocytes following in vivo or in vitro stimulation with LPS. The results are discussed in relation to the potential role of IL-1beta in amphibian immune responses.
