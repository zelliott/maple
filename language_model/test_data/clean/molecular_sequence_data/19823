OLE (ornate, large, and extremophilic) RNA is a noncoding RNA that is found in several extremophilic bacteria, including Bacillus halodurans. The function of OLE RNA has not been clarified. In this study, we found that RNase P cleaves OLE RNA and that the cleavage leads to a small reduction of expression of a downstream gene determined by analyses in vitro and in vivo. Under RNase P-deficient conditions, the amount of OLE RNA increased. Our results imply that RNase P could play a role in the regulation of gene expression in relation to conserved RNA motifs like OLE RNA as well as in riboswitches and operons.
