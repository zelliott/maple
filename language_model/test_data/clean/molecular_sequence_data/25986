The title trisaccharide glycoside, which is related to part of the core region of the lipopolysaccharide from Salmonella, and the disaccharide glycosides methyl 3-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-L-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptopyranoside and methyl 7-O-L-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptopyranosyl-L-glycero-alpha-D-manno- heptopyranoside have been synthesised. Methyl 2,3,4-tri-O-benzyl-L-glycero-alpha-D-manno- heptopyranoside, obtained via a one-carbon elongation at C-6 of methyl 2,3,4-tri-O-benzyl-alpha-D-manno- hexodialdo-1,5-pyranoside, was used as precursor both for the heptosyl donor and acceptor.
