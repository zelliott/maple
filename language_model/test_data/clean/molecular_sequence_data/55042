A novel NADPH-dependent reductase (CaCR) from Candida albicans was cloned for the first time. It catalyzed asymmetric reduction to produce ethyl (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate ((S)-CHBE). It contained an open reading frame of 843 bp encoding 281 amino acids. When co-expressed with a glucose dehydrogenase in Escherichia coli, recombinant CaCR exhibited an activity of 5.7 U/mg with ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (COBE) as substrate. In the biocatalysis of COBE to (S)-CHBE, 1320 mM (S)-CHBE was obtained without extra NADP+/NADPH in a water/butyl acetate system, and the optical purity of the (S)-isomer was higher than 99% enantiomeric excess.
