The identification of the new allele HLA-A*6813, which was found in a woman of Syrian origin and her son, is described. In the sequence analysis the new allele differs from A*68011 by positions 259 (A>G) and 261 (C>G) in exon 2. As the structure is thus identical to the HLA-A consensus sequence it is likely that the new allele originated by gene conversion. At the protein level, the new allele has one amino acid difference from A*6801 (Asn63Glu), which results in a distinct banding pattern in one dimensional-isoelectric focusing. Amino acid residue 63 contributes to the formation of pocket A and B and is thus important for peptide binding. A*6813 was serologically detectable only by two of six polyclonal, but by three monoclonal antisera. The restricted serological A68 activity may be explained by altered peptide binding as presented peptides can affect the serological recognition of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Moreover, our findings suggest that a possible mismatch with the other known A*68 variants may impair clinical outcome of bone marrow transplantation.
