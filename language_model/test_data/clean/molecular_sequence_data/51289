The gene encoding an alkaline serine protease from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. 221 was cloned in Escherichia coli and expressed in Bacillus subtilis. An open reading frame of 1,140 bases, identified as the protease gene was preceded by a putative Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGG) with a spacing of 7 bases. The deduced amino acid sequence had a pre-pro-peptide of 111 residues followed by the mature protease comprising 269 residues. The alkaline protease from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. 221 had higher homology to the protease from alkaliphilic bacilli (82.1% and 99.6%) than to those from neutrophilic bacilli (60.6-61.7%). Also Bacillus sp. 221 protease and other protease from alkaliphilic bacilli shared common amino acid changes and 4 amino acid deletions that seemed to be related to characteristics of the enzyme of alkaliphilic bacilli when compared to the proteases from neutrophilic bacilli.
