The human multiple drug resistance (MDR) gene has been used as a selectable marker to increase the proportion of bone marrow cells that contain and express this gene by drug selection. By constructing retroviral vectors containing and expressing the MDR gene and a nonselectable gene such as the beta-globin gene, enrichment for cells containing both of these genes can be achieved. A retroviral construct containing MDR cDNA in a Harvey virus-based vector has been used to transfect our ecotropic 3T3 retroviral packaging line GP+E86. Clones have been isolated by exposure of the retrovirally transfected cells (MDR producer cells) to colchicine (60 ng/ml), a selective agent that kills MDR-negative cells. Flow cytometry analysis (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) with an antibody to MDR demonstrates expression of human MDR protein on the surface of these colchicine-resistant producer clones. Untransfected GP+E86 cells are negative. Colchicine-resistant clones were titered using clone supernatants and the highest titer clone (4 x 10(4) viral particles per ml) was cocultured with 10(6) donor mouse bone marrow cells for 24-48 hr. The donor cells were then injected into congenic irradiated mice, and the presence of the MDR gene was assayed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using MDR-specific primers. In one experiment eight of nine transduced mice were positive for MDR by PCR of peripheral blood 14 and 50 days posttransplantation; after 240 days three of nine transduced mice were positive. Bone marrow obtained from one of these positive animals was stained with the MDR monoclonal antibody and the granulocyte population was analyzed by FACS. Approximately 14% of the total granulocyte pool contain increased levels of MDR protein. In addition, the bone marrow cells of several mice initially positive for MDR gene by PCR, and subsequently negative, were exposed to taxol, a drug whose detoxification depends on MDR gene expression; a positive signal was obtained in all of these mice, indicating drug selection of MDR-positive marrow cells. Cell sorting studies of these mice also show an increased number of high-MDR-expressing marrow cells, selected after exposure to taxol. Thus, in this live animal model MDR transduction is effective in selecting a human MDR-expressing population of marrow cells resistant to taxol chemotherapy. This strategy may, thus, be useful in humans to prevent the marrow toxicity induced by anticancer agents such as taxol and as a selectable marker to enrich for cells simultaneously transduced with a nonselectable gene.
