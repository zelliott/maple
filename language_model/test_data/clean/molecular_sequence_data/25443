A heat-shock-factor-binding activity was identified in Tetrahymena pyriformis whole-cell extracts and was further purified by sequential heparin-agarose and sequence-specific oligonucleotide affinity chromatography. Tetrahymena heat-shock factor (HSF) was able to bind to the heat-shock elements (HSE) both before and after thermal stress, although heat shock altered both the HSE-binding affinity and the protein.DNA-complex mobility on polyacrylamide gels. The mobility difference was significantly reduced by treatment of the proteins with phosphatase. The HSE-binding proteins, isolated by oligonucleotide-affinity chromatography, migrated on SDS/polyacrylamide gels as a closely spaced doublet to about 70 kDa. Polypeptides with similar molecular mass were recovered from preparative band-shift gels indicating that both are components of the protein.DNA complex.
