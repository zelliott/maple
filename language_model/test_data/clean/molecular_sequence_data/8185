A semi-nested polymerase chain reaction system with primers derived from the P1 adhesin gene of Mycoplasma pneumoniae was evaluated for sensitivity and specificity for detection of M. pneumoniae. The method used target DNA within samples of M. pneumoniae broth cultures and clinical material, without a formal extraction process. The sensitivity for detection of DNA was found to be to a level of one copy per sample and was specific to M. pneumoniae only, discriminating from the other human mycoplasma and ureaplasma species tested. The system offers the opportunity for a simple and highly specific laboratory method for diagnosis which may be compared to currently available serological methods, and may provide another method of studying mycoplasma-induced pathology.
