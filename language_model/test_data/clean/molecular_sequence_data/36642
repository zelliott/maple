The potential biological effects of electric and/or magnetic fields on cells and tissues must be addressed systematically within a context of perturbations in cell cycle control. Such studies should not be pursued in an isolated manner but as a component of the fundamental relationship between proliferation and differentiation, the multi-step process by which structural and functional properties of specialized cells, tissues, and organs progressively develop. It is necessary to quantitatively establish the influence of electric and magnetic fields on the integrated signalling mechanisms which transduce regulatory information for 1) control of the proliferative process and 2) down-regulation of proliferation associated with the initiation of gene expression that mediates the development and maintenance of phenotypic properties characteristic of differentiated cells. We will present an overview of our current understanding of regulatory mechanisms that control proliferation and cell specialization in normal diploid cells with emphasis on rate limiting steps that may be the basis for biological perturbations by electric and magnetic fields. Addressing such questions in normal diploid cells is essential since the loss of growth control in transformed and tumor cells is accompanied by an abrogation of developmental regulatory mechanisms that are functionally coupled to proliferation.
