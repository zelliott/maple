To investigate more closely the determinants of transmission and escape in HIV-1 internal proteins, we analyzed the characterization of putative N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGSs) and the variable loop of CRF07_BC recombinant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), isolated from intravenous drug users (IDUs). We studied the characterization of PNGSs and the variable loop in the C1-C5 and V1-V4 regions of the HIV-1 env gene in 12 intravenous drug users (IDUs) who were divided into two groups according to the length of infection time. In addition, two IDUs were longitudinally monitored from the time of seroconversion for 1.5 and 2.5 years. The longitudinal characterization within the individuals on PNGSs and the variable loop in the C1-C5 and V1-V4 region were also observed. Based on the above analysis, we found that PNGSs and the variable loop appeared to increase over time within IDU transmission of CRF07_BC recombinant HIV-1. We argue that limited PNGSs and the length of variable loops may be involved in selective transmission and escape.
