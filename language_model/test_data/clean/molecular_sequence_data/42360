Gastrin and CCK are believed to have a common ancestor. The gastrin structure has probably evolved from CCK-like peptides at a stage later than the amphibians. To trace the evolution of gastrin and CCK we have determined their structures in an Australian marsupial, the Eastern Grey kangaroo. The brain CCK was identical to CCK-8 of most mammals. The larger form of kangaroo gastrin was a 33mer with the sequence pELHPQDLPHLMTDLSKKKGPWQEEDAAY(SO3)GWMDF-NH2. The 11 italic residues indicate differences from human gastrin. Gastrin-15 and gastrin-16 comprised about 70% of the total immunoreactivity and resulted from cleavage after the second and third residue, respectively, of the unusual tribasic cleavage site. The smaller forms of kangaroo gastrin differ from most other mammalian gastrins in that the N-termini are not blocked with a pyroGlu moiety. Unlike other gastrins, kangaroo gastrin is more than 95% sulfated. The present study indicates that the gastrin structure, as defined by having a Tyr at position 6 from the C-terminus, evolved before the marsupials diverged from the other mammals 130 million years ago.
