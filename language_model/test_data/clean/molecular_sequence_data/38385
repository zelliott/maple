Here we describe novel members of a gene family which have similarity to strictosidine synthase (SS), one of the key enzymes in the production of monoterpene indole alkaloids. In addition to the first animal member of the family described previously (Drosophila hemomucin), a second Drosophila member has been identified, which appears to differ in subcellular distribution from hemomucin. In Arabidopsis, SS-like genes form a multigene family, compatible with a possible function as antifeedants and antibacterial compounds. In Caenorhabditis, two members have been identified and one member each in mouse and human. Interestingly, the human SS-like gene is strongly expressed in the brain, the very organ many of the indole alkaloids act upon.
