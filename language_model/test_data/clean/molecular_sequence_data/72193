GCAP1 and GCAP2 are related Ca(2+)-binding proteins that activate photoreceptor guanylate cyclase(s). We showed previously that the human GCAP1 gene, consisting of four exons, is located at 6p21.1 (locus designation GUCA). To identify the chromosomal location of the GCAP2 gene, we first cloned its cDNA and determined its intron-exon distribution by PCR analysis. The results show that the introns of the GCAP2 gene are positioned exactly as in the GCAP1 gene and are nearly double in size. Sequence similarity between the two genes, however, is limited to portions of exons 1 and 2. The GCAP1 and GCAP2 genes are transcribed into single mRNA species (1.7 and 2.2 kb, respectively) and are detectable only in the retina by Northern blotting. The GCAP2 gene was found by somatic human-hamster hybrid panel analysis and FISH to reside at GUCA in a region indistinguishable from that of GCAP1. PCR analysis with exon 4-specific primers showed that the genes are in a tail-to-tail array less than 5 kb apart and altogether span less than 20 kb of genomic DNA. The identical gene structures and loci of GCAP1 and GCAP2, and the identical function of the gene products, are consistent with gene duplication event.
