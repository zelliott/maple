We report on the case of a healthy young boy who developed a fulminant myocarditis due to acute coinfection with erythrovirus (parvovirus B19) and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) in the absence of an antiviral immune response. We suggest that the HHV-6-induced immunosuppression enhanced dissemination of parvovirus B19, which led to fatal myocarditis.
