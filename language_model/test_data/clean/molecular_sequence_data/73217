Hepatitis-causing viral agents other than those designated A to E are being reported. Their epidemiology, modes of transmission, and infectivity are not yet clear, although they may be transmitted by transfusion.

Thirty five patients underwent open-heart surgery, receiving an average of 10.2 +/- 10.8 (range 1 to 35) units of blood. The patients were investigated postoperatively for the RNA of the putative non-A-to-E hepatitis virus designated as GB virus C (GBV-C).

Four patients (12%) acquired GBV-C RNA in the serum within 2 to 4 weeks after the operation. GBV-C RNA was detected in at least one of the blood units received by three patients, all of whose units were available for testing, with a sequence in the nonstructural 3 region identical to that from the corresponding patient. Three patients developed elevated alanine aminotransferase levels which persisted for two weeks or longer in two of them.

GBV-C is transmissible by transfusion and can induce elevated transaminase levels.
