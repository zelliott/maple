Human ciliary neurotrophic factor (hCNTF), which promotes the cell survival and differentiation of motor and other neurons, is a protein belonging structurally to the alpha-helical cytokine family. hCNTF was subjected to three-dimensional structure modeling and site-directed mutagenesis to analyze its structure-function relationship. The replacement of Lys-155 with any other amino acid residue resulted in abolishment of neural cell survival activity, and some of the Glu-153 mutant proteins had 5- to 10-fold higher biological activity. The D1 cap region (around the boundary between the CD loop and helix D) of hCNTF, including both Glu-153 and Lys-155, was shown to play a key role in the biological activity of hCNTF as one of the putative receptor-recognition sites. In this article, the D1 cap region of the 4-helix-bundle proteins is proposed to be important in receptor recognition and biological activity common to alpha-helical cytokine proteins reactive with gp130, a component protein of the receptors.
