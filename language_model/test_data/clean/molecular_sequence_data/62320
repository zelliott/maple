Using a combination of serology and polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primer (PCR-SSP), we have identified in a volunteer bone marrow donor a new HLA class I antigen within the B44 serotype. This human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B44 variant was typed as 'blank' by microlymphocytotoxicity, whereas the B*44020101 allele was identified by PCR-SSP. A family study confirmed the Mendelian segregation of this blank antigen identified on one of the maternal haplotype transmitted to her child. The DNA sequence of B*44new, now referred to as B*44020102S, performed from the promoter region to the 3' untranslated region revealed a single nucleotide difference (A/G) compared to B*44020101 at the end of intron 4 in the acceptor-splicing site. This mutation leads to an incorrect splicing characterized by the deletion of exon 5 that encodes the transmembrane domain of the HLA antigen. Indeed, full-length complementary DNA sequencing revealed a complete absence of exon 5. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis confirmed the absence of expression of HLA-B44 on the cell surface in the donor, compared to the HLA-B44 positive control. The isoelectric focusing analysis failed to reveal the presence of an HLA-B44 antigen in the donor, showing that no normal HLA-B*44020101 allele was synthesized. The new B*440201010102S allele is a soluble form of B44 without any detectable cell-surface expression. It can thus be considered as a soluble antigen, a form apparently inactive and unfit for antigen presentation.
