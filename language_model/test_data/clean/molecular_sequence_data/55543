Both Bacillus licheniformis strains 10-1-A and 5-2-D are efficient producers of 2,3-butanediol. Here we present 4.3-Mb and 4.2-Mb assemblies of their genomes. The key genes for the regulation and metabolism of 2,3-butanediol production were annotated, which may provide further insights into the molecular mechanism for the production of 2,3-butanediol with high yield and productivity.
