Plants live in intimate relationships with numerous microorganisms present inside or outside plant tissues. The plant exterior provides two distinct ecosystems, the rhizosphere (below ground) and the phyllosphere (above ground), both populated by microbial communities. Most studies on plant microbiota deal with pathogens or mutualists. This review focuses on plant commensal bacteria, which could represent a rich source of bacteria beneficial to plants, alternatively termed plant probiotics. Plant commensal bacteria have been addressed only recently with culture-independent studies. These use next-generation sequencing, DNA microarray technologies and proteomics to decipher microbial community composition and function. Diverse bacterial populations are described in both rhizosphere and phyllosphere of different plants. The microorganisms can emerge from neighboring environmental ecosystems at random; however their survival is regulated by the plant. Influences from the environment, such as pesticides, farming practice and atmosphere, also affect the composition of microbial communities. Apart from community composition studies, some functional studies have also been performed. These include identification of broad-substrate surface receptors and methanol utilization enzymes by the proteomic approach, as well as identification of bacterial species that are important mediators of disease-suppressive soil phenomenon. Experience from more advanced human microbial studies could provide useful information and is discussed in the context of methodology and common trends. Administration of microbial mixtures of whole communities, rather than individual species, is highlighted and should be considered in future agricultural applications.
