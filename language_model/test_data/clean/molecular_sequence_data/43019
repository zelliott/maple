The pattern of expression of two distal transcripts initiated in the 62nd intron of the dystrophin gene was investigated under different circumstances; (i) during the development of different rat tissues these transcripts and Dp71, a protein encoded by one of them, increased with brain development and decreased with muscle development; (ii) in cultured glial and neuronal cells, the distal promoter was coactivated with tissue-specific upstream promoters, the muscle-type promoter in glial cells and the brain-type promoter in neuronal cells, which suggests that activity of the upstream promoter does not interfere with activity of the distal promoter; (iii) in lymphoblasts of DMD patients with various deletions of the dystrophin gene, the most distal of which included the 56th intron, the production of the distal transcript was not perturbed.
