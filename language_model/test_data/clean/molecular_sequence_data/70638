Nucleotide sugar transporters form a family of distantly related membrane proteins of the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum. The first transporter sequences have been identified within the last 2 years. However, information about the secondary and tertiary structure for these molecules has been limited to theoretical considerations. In the present study, an epitope-insertion approach was used to investigate the membrane topology of the CMP-sialic acid transporter. Immunofluorescence studies were carried out to analyze the orientation of the introduced epitopes in semipermeabilized cells. Both an amino-terminally introduced FLAG sequence and a carboxyl-terminal hemagglutinin tag were found to be oriented toward the cytosol. Results obtained with CMP-sialic acid transporter variants that contained the hemagglutinin epitope in potential intermembrane loop structures were in good correlation with the presence of 10 transmembrane regions. This building concept seems to be preserved also in other mammalian and nonmammalian nucleotide sugar transporters. Moreover, the functional analysis of the generated mutants demonstrated that insertions in or very close to membrane-spanning regions inactivate the transport process, whereas those in hydrophilic loop structures have no detectable effect on the activity. This study points the way toward understanding structure-function relationships of nucleotide sugar transporters.
