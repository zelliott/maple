It remains unclear whether allergens are the same among the sibling species of Anisakis simplex sensu lato. This study was carried out to compare the amino acid sequences of three major (Ani s 1, 2 and 12) and one minor (Ani s 9) Anisakis allergens between A. simplex s.s. and Anisakis pegreffii. We found 2 (out of 163), 1 (out of 869), and 29 (out of 266) amino acid variable sites for Ani s 1, 2, and 12, respectively. However, as both intra- and inter-species variations were present at the same amino acid positions, no amino acid variations clearly distinguished the two sibling species. IgE-binding epitopes (Ani s 1) and a binding motif of human leukocyte antigen (Ani s 2 and 9) demonstrated by previous studies were conserved. The similarities of the amino acid sequences of the allergens indicate possible similar allergy-associated health risks in humans infected with or accidentally ingesting either Anisakis species.
