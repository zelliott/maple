The gene encoding the extracellular metallo (Zn) DD-peptidase of Streptomyces albus G has been cloned in Escherichia coli DH5 alpha MCR via pBR322 or 325, and then transferred into Streptomyces lividans TK24 via pIJ486, with substantial amplification of the expressed DD-peptidase. The gene has the information for the synthesis of a 255 amino acid precursor, the amino terminal region of which has the characteristic features of a signal peptide. The primary structure as deduced from nucleotide sequencing confirms that previously determined by chemical methods except for the occurrence of an Asp instead of Asn at position 1 and an additional Ala immediately downstream of Pro67.
