Association between bacteria Photorhabdus and their nematode hosts Heterorhabditis represents one of the emerging models in symbiosis studies. In this study, we isolated the bacterial symbionts of the nematode Heterorhabditis georgiana. Using gyrB sequences for phylogenetic analysis, these strains were shown to be part of the species of Photorhbdus luminescens but with clear separation from currently recognized subspecies. Physiological properties and DNA-DNA hybridization profiles also supported the phylogenetic relationship of these strains. Therefore, a new subspecies, Photorhabdus luminescens subsp. kleinii subsp. nov., is proposed with the type strain KMD37(T) (=DSM 23513 =ATCC =NRRL B-59419).
