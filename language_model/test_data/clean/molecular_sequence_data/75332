The primary sequences of five monoclonal antibodies (mAbs A-E) which bind with various affinities (Kd = 4-810 nM) to the D-2 dopaminergic antagonist, haloperidol, have been determined. Immunoglobulin light and heavy chain mRNA was isolated and gene sequence determined by primer extension in the presence of dideoxynucleotides. The pattern of insertions and deletions found within the hypervariable regions produce loops which differ in length from one antibody to another, and are directly responsible for establishing the gross architecture of the combining site. Two of the anti-haloperidol mAbs have long hypervariable loops which form a pocket-shaped combining site. Three other mAbs have deletions of 3 or 4 amino acids in the third heavy chain complementarity producing region which result in a groove-like combining site as determined by computer based molecular modeling. A discussion of the probable mechanism by which the given sequences were generated from various gene segments is also presented.
