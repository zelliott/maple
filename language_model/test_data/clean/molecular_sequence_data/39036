Physiological scrotal hypothermia is necessary for normal spermatogenesis and fertility in mammals. Human RNA binding motif protein 3 (RBM3) is structurally highly similar to the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (Cirp), and both mRNAs are induced in human cells at the scrotal temperature (32 degrees C). We report here the cloning of mouse Rbm3 cDNA, which encoded an 18-kd protein with 94% identity in amino acid sequence to that of human RBM3. In the testis of adult mice, Rbm3 mRNA and protein were detected in Sertoli cells, but not germ cells, of seminiferous tubules at all stages. The expression was not observed in Sertoli cells of fetuses, but was observed in newborn and older mice. In the TAMA26 mouse Sertoli cell line, the Rbm3 expression level was increased or decreased within 12 hours after temperature shift from 37 degrees C to 32 degrees C or 39 degrees C, respectively. In contrast to Cirp, the cold-induced growth suppression of TAMA26 cells was not affected by suppression of the Rbm3 expression. When mouse testis was exposed to heat stress by experimental cryptorchidism, the level of Rbm3 was decreased in Sertoli cells. Rbm3 may play important roles distinct from those played by Cirp in spermatogenesis and cryptorchidism by regulating the gene expression in Sertoli cells.
