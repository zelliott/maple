The gene encoding ribosomal protein L25, a primary rRNA-binding protein, was isolated from the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Hybridization studies indicate that multiple copies of the gene are present per T. brucei haploid genome. The C-terminal domain of L25 protein from T. brucei is strikingly similar to L23a protein from rat, L25 proteins from fungal species, and L23 proteins from eubacteria, archaebacteria, and chloroplasts. A phylogenetic analysis of L23/25 proteins and the putative binding sites on their respective LSU-rRNAs (large subunit rRNAs) provides a rare opportunity to study molecular co-evolution between an RNA molecule and the protein that binds to it.
