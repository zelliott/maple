Seventy-five Norwegian patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) were studied for class-specific antibody response against synthetic peptide, P81, representing the sequence of plasmid-coded outer membrane protein of Yersinia (YOP1) containing four amino acid homology (TDRE) with HLA-B27 sequence. Ten (16.7%), five (8.3%) and seven (11.2%) of 60 male AS patients showed elevated anti-YOP1 P81 antibody of IgA, IgG, and IgM class, respectively, whereas for each isotype only one (4%) of 25 healthy male controls was positive. Differences were not observed between female patients and controls. In all isotypes, antibody-positive patients were more frequently found in patients with active disease. The anti-YOP1 P81 antibody levels of the patients were generally not correlated with the antibody levels against the peptide representing the hypervariable region of HLA-B27 (B27 peptide). However, in one patient the antibody was shown to react with both peptides by cross-inhibition analysis. Overall, it appears that any causal relationship between YOP1 and pathogenesis of AS is not strong. Immunogenicity and cross-reactivity of the YOP1 region encompassing the TDRE sequence particularly at the T cell level require further study.
