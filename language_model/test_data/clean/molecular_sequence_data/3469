We report the cloning and expression analysis of a mouse gene encoding a novel transmembrane protein. Expression of Sef is similar to that of Fgf8 and Spry2 during early embryogenesis, being prominent in the forebrain, mid-hindbrain boundary, branchial arches, somites, limb bud and tailbud of mouse embryos. These expression profiles indicate that Fgf8, Spry2 and Sef belong to a synexpression group and suggest that these genes may functionally interact during embryonic development. From E12.5 onwards, partially distinct patterns of expression of these genes are observed in the neuroepithelium, sense organs and endodermal-derived organs, that are known sites of expression of other Fgfs.
