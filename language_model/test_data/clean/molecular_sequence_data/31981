To sequence and analyze the complete mitochondrial DNA of Chinese moccasin.

The circular 17 541 bp sequence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of Chinese moccasin was determined by Ex-Taq PCR, TA-cloning and primer-walking methods.

This mitogenome contained 37 coding genes (including 22 tRNA, 2 rRNA and 13 protein-coding genes) and two control regions (CR and psiCR). The gene content and arrangement of Chinese moccasin mtDNA was similar to those of other vipers reported so far.

The characteristics of the replication origin and the tRNA arrangement of snake mitochondrial genomes can be used for identification of medicinal snakes.
