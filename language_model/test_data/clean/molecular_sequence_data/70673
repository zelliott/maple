From a rabbit reticulocyte library a full length cDNA was isolated which predicted a novel lipoxygenase (LOX) sharing 99% identical amino acids with the rabbit 15-lipoxygenase. HPLC product analysis of the bacterially expressed protein identified it as a leukocyte-type 12-lipoxygenase (1.12-LOX). This proves the co-expression of a 15-lipoxygenase and a 1.12-lipoxygenase in one mammalian species. Among the six amino acids that are different to rabbit 15-lipoxygenase, leucine 353 is shown to be the primary determinant for 12-positional specificity. In the 3'-untranslated region of the 12-LOX-mRNA a CU-rich, 20-fold repetitive element has been found, closely related to the differentiation control element (DICE) of the rabbit 15-LOX-mRNA which is organized by ten repeats of 19 bases. By genomic PCR the 3'-terminal part of the gene for the novel 12-lipoxygenase containing the introns 10-13 has been amplified and sequenced. The introns were very similar in length to the corresponding 15-lipoxygenase introns with 89% to 95% identical nucleotide sequences. By screening a rabbit reticulocyte library an alternative 15-lipoxygenase transcript of 3.6 kb has been detected containing a 1019 nucleotides longer 3'-untranslated region (UTR2) than the main 2.6 kb mRNA. The determination of the tissue distribution by Northern blotting showed that the 3.6 kb mRNA2 was only expressed in non-erythroid tissues, whereas the 2.6 kb mRNA1 was exclusively expressed in reticulocytes. The only cell type which has been found to express the 1.12-lipoxygenase abundantly are monocytes. The results indicate that the expression of 1.12-lipoxygenase and 15-lipoxygenase is highly regulated. The UTR2 of the 15-LOX-mRNA2 contained a novel eight-fold repetitive CU-rich motif of 23 bases length which is related but not identical to the DICE of 19 bases in the UTR1. The analysis of a genomic recombinant of the complete 9.0 kb Alox15 gene confirmed that UTR1 and UTR2 are not interrupted by an additional intron.
