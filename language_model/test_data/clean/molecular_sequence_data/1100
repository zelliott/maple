Poplar has become a model system for functional genomics in woody plants. Here, we report the sequencing and annotation of the first large contiguous stretch of genomic sequence (95 kb) of poplar, corresponding to a bacterial artificial chromosome clone mapped 0.6 centiMorgan from the Melampsora larici-populina resistance locus. The annotation revealed 15 putative genetic objects, of which five were classified as hypothetical genes that were similar only with expressed sequence tags from poplar. Ten putative objects showed similarity with known genes, of which one was similar to a kinase. Three other objects corresponded to the toll/interleukin-1 receptor/nucleotide-binding site/leucine-rich repeat class of plant disease resistance genes, of which two were predicted to encode an amino terminal nuclear localization signal. Four objects were homologous to the Ty1/ copia family of class I transposable elements, one of which was designated Retropop and interrupted one of the disease resistance genes. Two other objects constituted a novel Spm-like class II transposable element, which we designated Magali.
