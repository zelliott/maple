The cystic fibrosis (CF) gene has been observed to have the highest frequency of mutations in the Caucasian population. Prenatal diagnosis can now be performed with a high degree of accuracy since the identification of most of the gene's mutations, as well as the characterization of intragenic markers. However, the observation of a distribution of clinical phenotypes increases the need to identify a mild phenotype and avoid false-negative diagnosis. By screening most of the exons of the CFTR gene, we showed that a supposed obligate carrier of CF was in fact an asymptomatic affected woman.
