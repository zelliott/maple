Occludin is a protein component of the membrane domain of tight junctions, and has been shown to be phosphorylated in vivo in cultured cells and Xenopus laevis embryos. However, nothing is known about the identity of specific occludin kinase(s) and occludin phosphorylation site(s). Furthermore, nothing is known about the interaction of occludin with cingulin, a cytoplasmic plaque component of tight junctions. Here we report the isolation and sequencing of a complete X. laevis occludin cDNA, and experiments aimed at mapping X. laevis occludin in vitro phosphorylation site(s) and characterizing occludin interaction with cingulin. The sequence of Xenopus occludin is homologous to that of occludins from other species, with identities ranging from 41% to 58%. Bacterially expressed domain E of Xenopus occludin (amino acids 247-493) was a good substrate for protein kinase CK2 (stoichiometry 10.8%, Km 8.4 microM) but not for CK1 kinase, protein kinase A, cdc2 kinase, MAP kinase or syk kinase. Residues Thr375 and Ser379 were identified as potential CK2 phosphorylation sites in this region based on sequence analysis. Mutation of Ser379 to aspartic acid or alanine reduced phosphorylation by CK2 by approximately 50%, and double mutation of Ser379 into aspartic acid and Thr375 into aspartic acid essentially abolished phosphorylation. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down experiments using extracts of Xenopus A6 epithelial cells showed that constructs of GST fused to wild-type and mutant forms of the C-terminal region of X. laevis occludin associate with several polypeptides, and immunoblot analysis showed that one of these polypeptides is cingulin. GST pull-down experiments using in vitro translated, full-length Xenopus cingulin indicated that cingulin interacts directly with the C-terminal region of occludin.
