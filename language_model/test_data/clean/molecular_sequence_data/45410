The conjugative rolling circle replication (RCR) type plasmid pSVH1 from the chloramphenicol producer Streptomyces venezuelae was characterized by DNA sequence analysis and insertion/deletion analysis. Nucleotide sequence of the 12,652 bp pSVH1 revealed 11 open reading frames with high coding probability for which putative functions could be assigned. Beside the replication initiator gene rep for RCR, pSVH1 contained only genes involved in conjugative transfer. The transfer gene traB encoding the septal DNA translocator TraB is regulated by the GntR-type transcriptional regulator TraR. Six spd genes involved in intra-mycelial plasmid spreading are organized in two operons, consisting of two and three translationally coupled genes. Subcloning experiments demonstrated that the transfer gene traB represents a kill function and localized the pSVH1 minimal replicon consisting of rep and the dso origin to a 2072-bp fragment. Plasmid pSVH1 showed a modular architecture. Its replication region resembled that of the Streptomyces natalensis plasmid pSNA1, while the transfer and spread regions involved in conjugative plasmid transfer were highly similar to the corresponding regions of the Streptomyces ghanaensis plasmid pSG5.
