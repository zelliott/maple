This study was undertaken for the purpose of determining the primary structure of the 3' end gene of RNA polymerase of foot-and-mouth disease virus A22 550. Reported are isolation and purification of the virus, isolation of RNA, synthesis of cDNA, experience obtained from cloning as well as analysis of hybridisation and isolation of plasmid DNA. Nucleotide sequences, characterised by specific clones, were tested for potential needle structures. Also described are homology comparisons among FMD virus types A12, A10, O1, and C1.
