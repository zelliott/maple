The complete amino acid sequence of 'avian thymic hormone' (ATH), a protein from thymus tissue that appears to promote immune maturation in chicken bone marrow cells in culture, is presented. The sequence was obtained from sequences of ATH peptides isolated by HPLC after tryptic, chymotryptic, peptic or S aureus V8 protease digestions. The protein is a parvalbumin consisting of 108 residues with a blocked amino terminus, a single cysteine, tyrosine, proline and arginine and no histidine, methionine or tryptophan. This is the first amino acid sequence of a parvalbumin which is not derived from muscle tissue.
