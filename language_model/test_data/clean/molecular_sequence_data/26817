This study investigated the prevalence of group A, B, and C rotavirus (RAV, RBV, RCV) and adenovirus (AdV) infections in infants and children with acute gastroenteritis in Japan from July 2006 to June 2007. A total of 628 fecal specimens collected from infants and children with acute gastroenteritis in five different places (Maizuru, Tokyo, Sapporo, Saga and Osaka) in Japan during the period of July 2006-June 2007 were examined for RAV, RBV, RCV and AdV by RT-multiplex PCR. RAV was further characterized to G-typing and P-typing by RT-multiplex PCR and sequencing method. It was found that 123 (19.6%) fecal specimens were positive for RAV followed by AdV of 4.5%. RBV and RCV could not be detected in this study. Serotype G1 (58.5%) was identified at high levels followed by G9 (20.3%), G2 (11.4%), and G3 (7.3%). P genotyping revealed P[8] as predominant (84.6%) followed by P[4] (13.8%) and P[6] (1.6%). During the 2006/2007 rotavirus season, G1P[8] strains were most common with G9P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G1P[4] and G9P[6] also detected. It is clear from this study that RAV is still the cause of diseases in Japan. To our knowledge, this is the first report of RV P[6] strain in humans in Japan.
