Synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences contained within residues 173-204 of the alpha-subunit in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) of Torpedo californica bind the competitive antagonist alpha-bungarotoxin (BGTX) with relative high affinity. Since the synthetic peptide fragments of the receptor and BGTX each contain a small number of aromatic residues, intrinsic fluorescence studies were used to investigate their interaction. We examined a number of receptor-derived peptide fragments of increasing length (4-32 amino acids). Changes in the lambda max and quantum yield with increasing polypeptide chain length suggest an increase in the hydrophobicity of the tryptophan environment. When selective excitation and subtraction were used to reveal the tyrosine fluorescence of the peptides, a significant red shift in emission was observed and was found to be due to an excited-state tyrosinate. The binding of BGTX to the receptor-derived peptide fragments resulted in a large increase in fluorescence. In addition, at equilibrium, the lambda max of tryptophan fluorescence was shifted to shorter wavelengths. The. fluorescence enhancement, which was saturable with either peptide or BGTX, was used to determine the dissociation constants for the complexes. At pH 7.4, the apparent Kd for a dodecameric peptide (alpha 185-196), consisting of residues 185-196 in the alpha-subunit of the nAChR from Torpedo californica, was 1.4 microM. The Kd for an 18-mer (alpha 181-198), consisting of residues 181-198 of the Torpedo alpha-subunit, was 0.3 microM. No binding or enhanced fluorescence was observed with an irrelevant synthetic peptide of comparable composition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
