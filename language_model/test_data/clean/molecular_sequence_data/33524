Insect bite hypersensitivity (IBH) is an IgE-mediated allergic dermatitis of horses caused by bites of insects such as Culicoides or Simulium spp. The aim of the present study was to compare the IgE-binding pattern of sera of IBH-affected horses to Culicoides nubeculosus and Simulium vittatum salivary gland extracts (SGE). Individual IgE responses to proteins of S. vittatum and C. nubeculosus SGEs were evaluated in 15 IBH-affected and three healthy horses on immunoblots. Fourteen out of the 15 IBH-affected but none of the healthy horses showed individual IgE binding patterns to seven and six main protein bands in C. nubeculosus and S. vittatum SGE, respectively. These 14 sera showed IgE-binding to proteins from SGE of both C. nubeculosus and S. vittatum, but they reacted with fewer protein bands derived from S. vittatum than from C. nubeculosus SGE. Sera showing IgE-binding to a 32 kDa band from C. nubeculosus always bound to a 32 kDa band from S. vittatum. Similarly, all sera binding to a 70 kDa band from C. nubeculosus reacted with a corresponding band in S. vittatum SGE. The 70 kDa bands from S. vittatum and C. nubeculosus were identified by mass spectrometry as heat shock protein-70-cognate-3.
