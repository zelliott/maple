IL-16 is a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma and other conditions characterized by recruitment of CD4+ T cells to sites of disease. It is postulated that CD4 is an IL-16 receptor, although other receptors or coreceptors may exist. Among several known functions, IL-16 is a chemoattractant factor for CD4+ T cells and it inhibits MLR. We previously reported that an oligopeptide corresponding to the 16 C-terminal residues of human IL-16 inhibits chemoattractant activity. To identify functional domains with greater precision, shorter oligonucleotides containing native or mutated C-terminal IL-16 sequences were tested for IL-16 inhibition. Within the 16 C-terminal residues, the minimal peptide RRKS (corresponding to Arg106 to Ser109) was shown to mediate inhibition of IL-16 chemoattractant activity. Inhibition was lost when either arginine was substituted with alanine. Point mutations in IL-16 revealed that Arg107 is critical for chemoattractant activity, but MLR inhibition was unaffected by mutation of Arg107 or even deletion of the C-terminal tail through Arg106. Deletion of 12 or 22 N-terminal residues of IL-16 had no impact on chemoattractant activity, but MLR inhibition was reduced. Deletion of 16 C-terminal plus 12 N-terminal residues abolished both chemoattractant and MLR-inhibitory activity of IL-16. These data indicate that receptor interactions with IL-16 that activate T cell migration are not identical with those required for MLR inhibition, and suggest that both N-terminal and C-terminal domains in IL-16 participate in receptor binding or activation.
