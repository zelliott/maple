The nucleotide sequence of maranhar, a senescence-inducing linear mitochondrial plasmid of Neurospora crassa, was determined. The termini of the 7-kb plasmid are 349-bp inverted repeats (TIRs). Each DNA strand contains a long open reading frame (ORF) which begins within the TIR and extends toward the centre of the plasmid. ORF-1 codes for a single-subunit RNA polymerase that is not closely related to that encoded by another Neurospora plasmid, kalilo. The ORF-2 product may be a B-type DNA polymerase resembling those encoded by terminal protein-linked linear genetic elements, including linear mitochondrial plasmids and linear bacteriophages. A separate coding sequence for the terminal protein could not be identified; however, the DNA polymerase of maranhar has an amino-terminal extension with features that are also present in the terminal proteins of linear bacteriophages. The N-terminal extensions of the DNA polymerases of other linear mitochondrial plasmids contain similar features, suggesting that the terminal proteins of linear plasmids may be comprised, at least in part, of these cryptic domains. The terminal protein-DNA bond of maranhar is resistant to mild alkaline hydrolysis, indicating that it might involve a tyrosine or a lysine residue. Although maranhar and the senescence-inducing kalilo plasmid of N. intermedia are structurally similar, and integrate into mitochondrial DNA by a mechanism thus far unique to these two plasmids, they are not closely related to each other and they do not have any nucleotide sequence features, or ORFs, that distinguish them clearly from mitochondrial plasmids which are not associated with senescence and most of which are apparently non-integrative.
