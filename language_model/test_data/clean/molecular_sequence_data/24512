We identified two cDNAs coding for the novel human actin-related proteins (Arps) hArpM1 and hArpM2. Both of them show remarkable similarity to conventional actin, and the ATP-binding motif and nuclear-export signals of actin are highly conserved. Their mRNAs are expressed in all tested human tissues, but in smaller amounts than that of actin. These features suggest that hArpM1 and M2 are involved in cytoskeletal organization like other cytoplasmic Arp subfamilies.
