The effects of antipsychotic administration (1-32 days, twice per day) on the levels of mRNA coding for dopa decarboxylase (DDC) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in rat brain has been assessed by a procedure utilising solution hybridisation with oligonucleotides. Saline and sulpiride (20 mg/kg/day) had no apparent effect on DDC mRNA levels. Haloperidol (3 mg/kg/day) elicited increases in DDC mRNA levels of 240% after 32 days and loxapine (4 mg/kg/day) elicited increases of 180% in DDC mRNA levels. None of the drugs affected TH mRNA levels. These results indicate that DDC may be more important than TH in the long term regulation of dopamine production.
