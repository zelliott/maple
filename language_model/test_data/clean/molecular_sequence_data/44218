The 2.3-kb erythromycin resistance (EmR) plasmid pPV141 of Staphylococcus chromogenes 3688 was isolated and characterized. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified ORF1 and ORF2 separated by a 445-bp spacing, encoding a 158-residue replication protein (Rep141) and a 244-residue erythromycin resistance protein (Erm, rRNA adenine N-6-methyltransferase), respectively. Structural analysis and Southern hybridization showed that the rep and ermM genes in pPV141 shared homology with other known EmR plasmids. Based on sequence analysis, pPV141 was classified as a unique member of the pSN2 family of EmR plasmids.
