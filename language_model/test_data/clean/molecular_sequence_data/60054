A novel, asaccharolytic, amino-acid-degrading bacterium, designated strain GLU-3T, was isolated from an anaerobic lagoon of a dairy wastewater treatment plant. Strain GLU-3T stained Gram-negative and was an obligately anaerobic, non-spore-forming, slightly curved, rod-shaped bacterium (0.3 x 4.0-6.0 microns) which existed singly or in pairs. The DNA G+C content was 43 mol%. Optimum growth occurred at 35 degrees C and pH 7.5 on arginine with a generation time of 16 h. Good growth was obtained on arginine, histidine, threonine and glycine. Acetate was the end-product formed from all these substrates, but in addition, a trace of formate was detected from arginine and histidine, and ornithine was produced from arginine. Strain GLU-3T grew slowly on glutamate and produced acetate, carbon dioxide, formate, hydrogen and traces of propionate as the end-products. In syntrophic association with Methanobacterium formicicum, strain GLU-3T oxidized arginine, histidine and glutamate to give propionate as the major product; acetate, carbon dioxide and methane were also produced. Strain GLU-3T did not degrade alanine and the branched-chain amino acids valine, leucine and isoleucine either in pure culture or in association with M. formicicum. The nearest phylogenetic relative of strain GLU-3T was the thermophile Selenomonas acidaminovorans (similarity value of 89.5%). As strain GLU-3T is phylogenetically, physiologically and genotypically different from other amino-acid-degrading genera, it is proposed that it should be designated a new species of a new genus Aminomonas paucivorans gen. nov., sp. nov. (DSM 12260T).
