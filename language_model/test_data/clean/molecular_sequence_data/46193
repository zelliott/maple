We examined the effect of amino acids 222 and 254 on antigenicity of the variant Del-E strain of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Using molecular epidemiology, we identified a virus designated as Del-E-222 that was identical to Del-E except for alanine at position 222. A second virus was generated using reverse genetics of the Del-E backbone to create Del-E-254 that contained an asparagine at amino acid 254. The Del-E-222 and Del-E-254 viruses were tested for their ability to escape neutralizing immunity provided by parenteral vaccination. The bursas from birds vaccinated with parental Del-E and challenged with Del-E-222 or Del-E-254 had macroscopic lesions typical of an IBDV infection, and their B-BW ratios were significantly smaller than the controls. Microscopic lesions included lymphocyte depletion and confirmed the ability of Del-E-222 and Del-E-254 to break through the immunity induced by the parental Del-E virus vaccination. Both mutations appear to be contributing to antigenic drift.
