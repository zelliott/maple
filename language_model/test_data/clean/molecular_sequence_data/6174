We have investigated the role of an open reading frame upstream of and overlapping that coding for rabbit cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase in the post-transcriptional regulation of enzyme expression. Elimination of the AUG codon initiating translation of the upstream open reading frame by site-directed mutagenesis (to an AUC codon) was assessed by a transfection assay in COS-1 cells. The mutation relieves translational repression with a 100-fold increase in expressed serine hydroxymethyltransferase activity compared to control-transfected cells and in the absence of any increase in the level of serine hydroxymethyltransferase mRNA. The upstream open reading frame may play a regulatory role in changing levels of expression of serine hydroxymethyltransferase through a translational control mechanism.
