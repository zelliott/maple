The SPO12 gene, which is required for meiosis I chromosome division during sporulation of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been isolated. DNA sequencing has identified an open reading frame of 173 codons that encodes the putative SPO12 protein and has no significant sequence similarities to known genes. The last 15 amino acids of this putative protein have a high negative charge, which appears to be required for function. A second sporulation-specific gene, designated SPO16, was found adjacent to SPO12 and shown to be necessary for efficient spore formation. The two genes are encoded on opposite DNA strands with only 103 nucleotides between the termination codons. Up to 700 nucleotides of the SPO12 and SPO16 transcripts are complementary, and the 3' untranslated region of the longest SPO16 transcript is complementary to all or nearly all of the SPO12 mRNA. A strain homozygous for an insertion which removes the complementarity between the SPO12 and SPO16 mRNAs has an efficiency of sporulation, number of spores per ascus, and spore viability identical to those of a wild-type strain. The complementarity therefore has either no function or only a subtle function in meiosis and sporulation.
