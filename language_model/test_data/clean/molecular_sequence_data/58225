To study macrophage genes activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) we have constructed a cDNA library using the mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. By differential screening, a gene, designated LRG-21, was identified that showed nucleic acid sequence homology to rat liver regenerating factor-1 (LRF-1) and human activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3). Both LRG-21 and LRF-1 are transcribed within an hour following stimulation and in the absence of protein synthesis. The predicted protein sequence of LRG-21 consists of 181 amino acids with a molecular weight of 20.7 kDa. All three sequences contain basic and leucine zipper regions characteristic of the c-Fos and c-Jun family of transcription factors, but the remainder of the sequences are unrelated to this family. Recombinant LRG-21 has been shown to bind to a phorbol ester promoter element. Additional experiments have shown that LRG-21 is also induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and by interleukin-4 (IL-4) in both RAW264.7 cells and murine peritoneal macrophages. Based on these observations, it is likely that LRG-21 plays an important role in macrophage activation.
