A new beta-lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP-I) from Streptomyces exfoliatus SMF19 was purified and characterized. The molecular mass of BLIP-I was estimated to be 17.5 kDa by gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography. The N-terminal sequence was NH(2)-Asn-Ser-Gly-Phe-Ser-Ala-Glu-Lys-Tyr-Glu-Gln-Ile-Gln-Phe-Gly. BLIP-I inhibited Bacto(R) Penase (Difco), and plasmid encoded TEM-1 beta-lactamase, whereas it did not inhibit Enterobacter cloacae beta-lactamases. The K(i) value of BLIP-I against TEM-1 beta-lactamase was determined to be 0.047 nm. The gene (bliA) encoding BLIP-I protein was identified by screening a genomic library using an oligonucleotide probe with a sequence based on the N-terminal sequence of BLIP-I. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed that the gene was 558 base pairs in length and encoded a mature protein of 157 amino acid residues preceded by a 29-amino acid signal sequence. Pairwise comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence showed 38% identity with BLIP of Streptomyces clavuligerus. Furthermore, the 49th amino acid residue of BLIP-I was identical to Asp-49 of BLIP that was characterized to be an important residue for the inhibitory activity of BLIP. A modified BLIP-I in which Asp-49 was replaced by alanine (D49A) was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. The inhibitory activities of recombinant (r) BLIP-I and its D49A mutant derivative, expressed in Escherichia coli, were compared. The K(i) value of rBLIP-I against TEM-1 beta-lactamase was similar to that of wild-type BLIP-I, but the D49A mutation increased the K(i) of rBLIP-I inhibition approximately 200-fold. A disruption mutant of the bliA gene in S. exfoliatus SMF19 was obtained by replacing the wild-type bliA gene with a copy inactivated by inserting a hygromycin resistance gene. The disruption mutant showed a bald phenotype, indicating that the bliA gene plays a role in morphological differentiation.
