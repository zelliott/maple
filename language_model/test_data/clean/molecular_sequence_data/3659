To analyze the interrelationships between the amino acid sequences of the proteins of hepatitis C virus and the functional characteristics of different variants of this virus, a database of protein functional mapping of hepatitis C virus was developed. The database contains amino acid sequences (both full-size and fragmentary) retrieved from accessible databases and experimental data published in literature. The database also contains the results of comparison and treatment of primary data, including alignments and functional regions. On the basis of these data, variable and conservative regions of envelope proteins of hepatitis C virus were revealed. Antigenic and functional maps of structural and nonstructural proteins of the virus were constructed. The most variable region of the envelope protein E2 (HVR1) was analysed. It is assumed that the conservatism of some amino acid positions of HVR1 is related to the functions of this region.
