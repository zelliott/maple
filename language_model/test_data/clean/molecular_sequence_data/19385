Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a major protein component of cholesterol-transporting lipoprotein particles in the central nervous system and in plasma. Polymorphisms of apoE are associated with cardiovascular disease and with a predisposition to Alzheimer's disease and other forms of neurodegeneration. For full biological activity, apoE must be bound to a lipoprotein particle. Complexes of apoE and phospholipid mimic many of these activities. In contrast to a widely accepted discoidal model of apoA-I bound to dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, which is based on solution studies, an X-ray diffraction study of apoE bound to dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) indicated that apoE*DPPC particles are quasi-spheroidal and that the packing of the phospholipid core is similar to a micelle. Using small-angle X-ray scattering, we show that apoE*DPPC particles in solution are ellipsoidal and that the shape of the phospholipid core is compatible with a twisted-bilayer model. The proposed model is consistent with the results of mass spectrometric analysis of products of limited proteolysis. These revealed that the nonlipid-bound regions of apoE in the particle are consistent with an alpha-helical hairpin.
