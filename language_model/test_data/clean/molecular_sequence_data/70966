Rab4, a Ras-related small guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein, has been suggested to participate in exocytosis. The function of Rab4 in regulated exocytosis of pancreatic acini was examined in this study.

Subcellular localization of Rab4 was determined by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The Rab4 function in regulated exocytosis was examined by introducing Rab4 hypervariable carboxy-terminal domain peptide (Rab4 peptide) and anti-Rab4 antibody into streptolysin O-permeabilized acini. The regulation of Rab4 by cholecystokinin (CCK) and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) was investigated by examining their effects on [32P]GTP binding rate into the Rab4 immunoprecipitates. The participation of protein kinase C in the Rab4 regulation by CCK was confirmed by calphostin C pretreatment of acini.

Rab4 was localized on zymogen granule membranes. Both Rab4 peptide and anti-Rab4 antibody enhanced calcium-stimulated amylase release from streptolysin O-permeabilized acini, suggesting the inhibitory role of Rab4 in exocytosis. CCK and TPA increased GTP binding to Rab4. Calphostin C attenuated the stimulatory effect of CCK on GTP binding to Rab4.

Rab4 negatively modulates regulated exocytosis of pancreatic acini and is controlled by CCK through a protein kinase C pathway.
