Escherichia coli DNA photolyase mediates photorepair of pyrimidine dimers occurring in UV-damaged DNA. The enzyme contains two chromophores, 1,5-dihydroflavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2) and 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolylpolyglutamate (MTHF). To define the roles of the two chromophores in the photochemical reaction(s) resulting in DNA repair and the effect of DNA structure on the photocatalytic step, we determined the absolute action spectra of the enzyme containing only FADH2 (E-FADH2) or both chromophores (E-FADH2-MTHF), with double- and single-stranded substrates and with substrates of different sequences in the immediate vicinity of the thymine dimer. We found that the shape of the action spectrum of E-FADH2 matches that of the absorption spectrum with a quantum yield phi (FADH2) = 0.69. The action spectrum of E-FADH2-MTHF is also in a fairly good agreement with the absorption spectrum with phi (FADH2-MTHF) = 0.59. From these values and from the previously established properties of the two chromophores, we propose that MTHF transfers energy to FADH2 with a quantum yield of phi epsilon T = 0.8 and that 1FADH2 singlet transfers an electron to or from the dimer with a quantum yield phi ET = 0.69. The chemical nature of the chromophores did not change after several catalytic cycles. The enzyme repaired a thymine dimer in five different sequence contexts with the same efficiency. Similarly, single- and double-stranded DNAs were repaired with the same overall quantum yield.
