Sj√∂gren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic disease that affects salivary glands directly, and is therefore expected to influence the composition of human whole saliva (WS) fluid. The aim of this study was to characterize the WS proteins of pSS patients using a proteomic approach to assess a valid procedure to examine the global changes of the salivary protein profiles in connective tissue disorders. The WS proteins expressed in patients affected by pSS and healthy volunteers were analyzed using the 2-DE technique. The WS protein pattern was altered in pSS patients compared to controls, with a decrease in some of the typical salivary proteins. Particularly, a remarkable alteration of carbonic anhydrase VI was observed. Moreover, a comparison of WS protein profile of pSS patients with the one obtained from controls revealed a set of differentially expressed proteins. These proteins were related to acute and chronic inflammation while some others were involved in oxidative stress injury. These findings are in line with the systemic immuno-inflammatory aspects of pSS and open the possibility for a systematic search of diagnostic biomarkers and targets for therapeutic intervention in pSS.
