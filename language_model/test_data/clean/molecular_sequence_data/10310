The ability to display heterologous proteins and peptides on the surface of different types of bacteriophage has proven extremely useful in protein structure/function studies. To display such proteins in a eucaryotic environment, we have produced a vector allowing for fusion of proteins to the amino-terminus of the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) major envelope glycoprotein, gp64. Such fusion proteins incorporate into the baculoviral virion and display the FLAG epitope tag. We have further produced recombinant baculoviruses displaying the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the rubella virus envelope proteins, E1 and E2. The incorporation of the GFPgp64, E1gp64, and E2gp64 fusion proteins into the baculovirus particle was demonstrated by western blot analysis of purified budded virus. This is the first report of the display of the GFP protein or the individual rubella virus spike proteins on the surface of an enveloped virus. Such a eucaryotic viral display system may be useful for the display of proteins dependent on glycosylation for activity and for targeting of recombinant baculoviruses to novel host cell types as a gene transfer vehicle.
