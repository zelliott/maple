The structural and functional characterization of proteins is frequently hampered by lack of stability or by insufficient assembly of oligomeric proteins in over-expression systems. Using F(1)-ATPase as a case study, we tackled this problem by introducing function-determining domains from a difficult-to-handle variety of an enzyme into a stable homologue.
