beta-Catenin is a central effector of Wnt signaling in embryonic and stem cell development and in tumorigenesis. Here, through a mass spectrometric analysis of a beta-catenin protein complex, we identified 12 proteins as putative beta-catenin interactors. We show that one of them, 14-3-3zeta, enhances beta-catenin-dependent transcription by maintaining a high level of beta-catenin protein in the cytoplasm. More importantly, 14-3-3zeta facilitates activation of beta-catenin by the survival kinase Akt and colocalizes with activated Akt in intestinal stem cells. We propose that Akt phosphorylates beta-catenin, which results in 14-3-3zeta binding and stabilization of beta-catenin, and these interactions may be involved in stem cell development.
