A 9.8-kb DNA region from the oleandomycin gene cluster in Streptomyces antibioticus was cloned. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of 8 open reading frames encoding different enzyme activities involved in the biosynthesis of one of the two 2, 6-deoxysugars attached to the oleandomycin aglycone: L-oleandrose (the oleW, oleV, oleL, and oleU genes) and D-desosamine (the oleNI and oleT genes), or of both (the oleS and oleE genes). A Streptomyces albus strain harboring the oleG2 glycosyltransferase gene integrated into the chromosome was constructed. This strain was transformed with two different plasmid constructs (pOLV and pOLE) containing a set of genes proposed to be required for the biosynthesis of dTDP-L-olivose and dTDP-L-oleandrose, respectively. Incubation of these recombinant strains with the erythromycin aglycon (erythronolide B) gave rise to two new glycosylated compounds, identified as L-3-O-olivosyl- and L-3-O-oleandrosyl-erythronolide B, indicating that pOLV and pOLE encode all enzyme activities required for the biosynthesis of these two 2,6-dideoxysugars. A pathway is proposed for the biosynthesis of these two deoxysugars in S. antibioticus.
