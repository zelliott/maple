Functional N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors NMDARs are thought to be heteromeric receptor complexes consisting of NR1 and NR2 subunits. However, recombinant NR1 subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes assemble functional ion channels even without exogenous NR2 subunits and with a different pharmacology, suggesting a homomeric subunit stoichiometry. To explain this phenomenon, we screened oocytes for Xenopus NR2 subunits and found all four subunit-encoding mRNAs (XenNR2A-XenNR2D) to be present endogenously, with those encoding the XenNR2B subunit being particularly abundant. We cloned the full-length XenNR2B cDNA and co-expressed it with NR1 in oocytes. A detailed electrophysiological characterization revealed that the pharmacology of NR1/XenNR2B was identical with that of the presumed homomeric NMDARs expressed from NR1 subunits. By contrast, heteromeric receptors containing the rat NR2B subunit showed significant pharmacological differences compared with NR1/XenNR2B receptors. These results demonstrate that recombinant NR1 subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes interact with an endogenously expressed NR2B subunit and form hybrid heteromeric NMDARs. These findings confirm the current views that NMDARs are obligatory heteromeric complexes and that functional homomeric NMDARs do not exist.
