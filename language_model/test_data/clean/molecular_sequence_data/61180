Human polydeoxyribonucleotide kinase is an enzyme that has the capacity to phosphorylate DNA at 5'-hydroxyl termini and dephosphorylate 3'-phosphate termini and, therefore, can be considered a putative DNA repair enzyme. The enzyme was purified from HeLa cells. Amino acid sequence was obtained for several tryptic fragments by mass spectrometry. The sequences were matched through the dbEST data base with an incomplete human cDNA clone, which was used as a probe to retrieve the 5'-end of the cDNA sequence from a separate cDNA library. The complete cDNA, which codes for a 521-amino acid protein (57.1 kDa), was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein was shown to possess the kinase and phosphatase activities. Comparison with other sequenced proteins identified a P-loop motif, indicative of an ATP-binding domain, and a second motif associated with several different phosphatases. There is reasonable sequence similarity to putative open reading frames in the genomes of Caenorhabditis elegans and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, but similarity to bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase is limited to the kinase and phosphatase domains noted above. Northern hybridization revealed a major transcript of approximately 2.3 kilobases and a minor transcript of approximately 7 kilobases. Pancreas, heart, and kidney appear to have higher levels of mRNA than brain, lung, or liver. Confocal microscopy of human A549 cells indicated that the kinase resides predominantly in the nucleus. The gene encoding the enzyme was mapped to chromosome band 19q13.4.
