A chemoenzymatic method was developed for the synthesis of macrocyclic peptides and glycopeptides. Sortase A was found to mediate either head to tail cyclization or oligomerization and then head to tail cyclization of peptides and glycopeptides, depending on the peptide length, to produce 15-mer or higher cyclic peptides and glycopeptides.
