The blocked-N-terminal structure of hog kidney aldose 1-epimerase (mutarotase, EC 5.1.3.3) was determined to be Ac-Val-Ser-Val-Thr-Arg-Ser-Val-Phe-Gly-Asp... by a coupling of conventional methods (enzymatic digestion, amino acid analysis, and Edman sequencing) and tandem mass spectrometry. The side-chain fragmentations observed in the high-energy product ion spectra gave unambiguous sequence information about the arginine-containing N-terminal structure.
