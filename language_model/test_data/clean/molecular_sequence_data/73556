Two dopamine D1-like receptors have been cloned from mammals, the D1 and D5 receptors, also known as D1A and D1B receptors, respectively, in rodents. Although D1-like receptors are known to stimulate renin release, the receptor subtype mediating this action has not been determined. We investigated D1 receptor subtype expression in rat juxtaglomerular cells obtained after enzymatic dispersion of kidney cortex and differential centrifugation. Juxtaglomerular cells in primary culture were immunocytochemically 85% to 95% renin positive. These cells expressed the D1A but not the D1B receptor (mRNA and protein). D1-like receptor function was demonstrated by a concentration-dependent stimulation of cAMP production by dopamine (n = 5-9 per group). Fenoldopam, a D1-like receptor agonist, also caused a concentration-dependent increase in cAMP production and renin secretion that was blocked by the selective D1-like receptor antagonist SCH23390 (n = 4-13 per group). Although the D1 ligands do not distinguish between the cloned D1-like receptors, the actions of fenoldopam were due to occupancy of the D1A receptor: (1) the D1B receptor, the only other mammalian D1-like receptor, is not expressed in juxtaglomerular cells; (2) antisense but not sense D1A oligonucleotides completely blocked the stimulatory effect of fenoldopam on cAMP production and renin secretion. We conclude that there is selective dopamine receptor gene expression in juxtaglomerular cells; the dopamine receptor subtype linked to the stimulation of cAMP and renin secretion in juxtaglomerular cells is the D1A subtype.
