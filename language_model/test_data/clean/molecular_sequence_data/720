We have cloned and characterized a second member of the Xenopus CAP (cyclase associated protein) gene family. xCAP2 demonstrates greater restriction of expression than its homolog, xCAP1, and is differentially expressed throughout early embryogenesis. Although present as a maternal transcript, CAP2 comes to be expressed in the anterior-most mesoderm/endoderm during late gastrulation, in paraxial mesoderm during late neurula stages, and later expresses in lens, cardiac primordia, somites, otic vesicles, retina, and in the optic and craniofacial musculature. The gene is also expressed in the leading edge of myotome.
