The expression of a castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) phospholipase D (PLD; EC 3.1.4.4) gene has been studied by examining its promoter activity in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) carrying a PLD promoter-glucuronidase transgene and by monitoring the levels of PLD mRNA in castor bean. Sequence and the 5' truncation analyses revealed that the 5' flanking region from nucleotide -1200 to -730 is required for the regulation and basal function of the PLD promoter. The PLD promoter in vegetative tissues is highly active in the rapidly growing regions such as the shoot apex and the secondary meristem producing axillary buds and vascular tissues of young leaves and stems. The PLD promoter activity in floral tissues was high in stigma, ovary, and pollen grains, but low in petals, sepals, the epidermis of anthers, styles, and filaments. The PLD promoter activity was enhanced by abscisic acid. Northern-blot analysis of PLD in castor bean showed that the PLD mRNA levels were high in young and metabolically more active tissues such as expanding leaves, hypocotyl hooks, developing seeds, and young seedlings, and they decreased in mature tissues such as fully expanded leaves and developed seeds. These patterns of expression suggest a role of PLD in rapid cell growth, proliferation, and reproduction.
