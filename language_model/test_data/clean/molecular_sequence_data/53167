Twenty (8.5%) of 234 nonrepetitive clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae from southern Taiwan were found to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs): 10 strains produced SHV-12, 4 produced SHV-5, 2 produced a non-TEM non-SHV ESBL with a pI of 8.3, 3 produced a novel AmpC beta-lactamase designated CMY-8 with a pI of 8.25, and 1 produced SHV-12 and an unidentified AmpC enzyme with a pI of 8.2. The CMY-8 enzyme confers a resistance phenotype similar to CMY-1 and MOX-1, and sequence comparisons showed high homologies (>95%) of nucleotide and amino acid sequences among these three enzymes. Plasmid and pulse-field gel electrophoresis analyses revealed that all isolates harboring an SHV-derived ESBL were genetically unrelated, indicating that dissemination of resistance plasmids is responsible for the spread of SHV ESBLs among K. pneumoniae in this area. All three isolates carrying CMY-8 had identical genotypic patterns, suggesting the presence of an epidemic strain.
