Four monoepitopic MAPs (MAP A, B, C and E) and one bis-diepitopic MAP B-E derived fromthe primary sequence of Schistosoma mansoni glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, previously tested in BALB/c mice, were examined for their immunogenicity and protective capacity in C57BL/6 mice. Despite multimerization into MAPs, MAP Aand MAP C were poorly immunogenic. In contrast toBALB/c mice, MAP E was non-immunogenic in C57BL/6 mice. Peptide B in the form of MAP B orbis-diepitopic MAPB-E elicited immune responses in C57BL/6 mice that were associated with a significant decrease in worm burden. The MAPs were prepared by the stepwise solid-phase peptide synthesis using Boc/Bzl chemistry, successfully purified on the RP-HPLC column and characterized by RP-HPLC, HPCE and MALDI-TOF MS techniques. A general strategy for MAPs purification is discussed here and the purification of MAP Band MAP E is documented in detail.
