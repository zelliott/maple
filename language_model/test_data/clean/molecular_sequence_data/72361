Levels of specific antibodies (Ab) against mycobacterial and human heat shock protein (hsp) 65/60 are increased in the sera of patients with atherosclerotic lesions and have been demonstrated to be capable of mediating endothelial cytotoxicity. To clarify the antigen epitopes recognized by these serum Abs, Ab binding to hsp65 deletion mutants (Dms), as well as to overlapping 15-mer and 8-mer hsp65 peptides, was assessed. Western blotting of hsp65 Dms indicated the presence of at least one epitope between amino acid (aa) residues 171 and 276, recognized by both high-titer sera and affinity-purified anti-hsp65/60 Ab. Fluorescence immunoassays using 53 15-mer peptides and Pin ELISA using 526 7-mer peptides demonstrated three distinct, conserved sequences with high affinity to high-titer sera and purified anti-hsp65/60 Ab. Two N-terminal sequences, aa 97-109 and aa 179-187, and one C-terminal sequence, aa 504-512, were identified. These three epitopes recognized by anti-hsp65/60 Ab may serve as autoantigens in certain circumstances in vivo. This phenomenon could contribute to the initiation of atherosclerosis by an autoimmune reaction.
