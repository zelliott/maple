The nucleotide (nt) sequence of the entire coding region of the syn gene of Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is reported. The amino acid (aa) sequence deduced from the nt sequence has been compared to analogous Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) syn gene that causes cell fusion. The aa sequences are 82.8% homologous and contain a highly conserved region of 90 aa. These results identify some of the conserved regions in the coding sequences between the two types.
