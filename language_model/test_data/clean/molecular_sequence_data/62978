A total of 10 SULT genes are presently known to be expressed in human tissues. We performed a comprehensive genome-wide search for novel SULT genes using two different but complementary approaches, and developed a novel graphical display to aid in the annotation of the hits. Seven novel human SULT genes were identified, five of which were predicted to be pseudogenes, including two processed pseudogenes and three pseudogenes that contained introns. Those five pseudogenes represent the first unambiguous SULT pseudogenes described in any species. Expression-profiling studies were conducted for one novel gene, SULT6B1, and a series of alternatively spliced transcripts were identified in the human testis. SULT6B1 was also present in chimpanzee and gorilla, differing at only seven encoded amino-acid residues among the three species. The results of these database mining studies will aid in studies of the regulation of these SULT genes, provide insights into the evolution of this gene family in humans, and serve as a starting point for comparative genomic studies of SULT genes.
