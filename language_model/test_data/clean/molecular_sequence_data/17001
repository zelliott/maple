Uteroferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein, which is abundantly synthesized in porcine uterine glandular endometrium and believed to be involved in maternal/fetal iron transport. In the present study, uteroferrin has been cloned and functionally expressed using baculovirus-infected insect host cells Spodoptera frugiperda. The work also addresses the possible role of proteolytic cleavage to facilitate the release of uteroferrin-bound iron. The enzyme secreted in culture medium exhibits a molecular mass and catalytic properties similar to native porcine uteroferrin. The specific activity was estimated at 233 U/mg using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. Partial cleavage of the enzyme with trypsin resulted in a 1.7-fold enhancement in specific activity and a two-subunit polypeptide as observed in preparations of most mammalian purple acid phosphatases. Digestion with the aspartic protease pepsin resulted in a 2.5-fold enzyme inactivation correlated with the appearance of low molecular weight polypeptide fragments and the release of enzyme-bound iron.
