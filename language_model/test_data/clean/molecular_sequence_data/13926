It is generally believed that loop regions in globular proteins, and particularly hypervariable loops in immunoglobulins, can accommodate a wide variety of sequence changes without jeopardizing protein structure or stability. We show here, however, that novel sequences introduced within complementarity determining regions (CDRs) 1 and 3 of the immunoglobulin variable domain REI VL can significantly diminish the stability of the native state of this protein. Besides their implications for the general role of loops in the stability of globular proteins, these results suggest previously unrecognized stability constraints on the variability of CDRs that may impact efforts to engineer new and improved activities into antibodies.
