A yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig has been constructed in 16p12.1-p11.2 that encompasses three loci (D16S288, D16S299, and D16S298) closely linked to the gene causing Batten disease or juvenile-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN3). The physical map has been ordered using 42 sequence tagged sites. Four genes, interleukin-4 receptor (IL4R), phenol-preferring phenol sulfotransferase (STP), monoamine-preferring phenol sulfotransferase (STM), and sialophorin (SPN), have been mapped to the YAC contig. A partial genomic restriction map has been constructed to confirm the order and distances between D16S298, predicted to be the locus closest to CLN3. The overlapping genomic clones are a valuable resource for cloning the Batten gene (CLN3) and other genes in the region.
