Rod/cone dysplasia type one (rcd-1) is an early onset inherited retinal dystrophy segregating in the Irish setter breed. It is classed as one of the autosomal recessive canine generalised Progressive Retinal Atrophies (PRA). The disease results in complete loss of photoreceptors by approximately one year of age. Levels of retinal cGMP are markedly elevated and of abnormal distribution in rod photoreceptors. Rod phosphodiesterase activity is absent and mRNA encoding the beta subunit (PDE beta) of the holoenzyme is uniquely reduced in predegenerate retinae. Using retinae from normal, unrelated adult dogs we have PCR-amplified and sequenced the cDNA for PDE beta. The cDNA is almost identical to that recently described for the Irish setter in the USA apart from two translationally silent single nucleotide changes. Using carrier and affected setters from a UK breeding colony we have screened genomic DNA and can confirm the G to A transition in rcd-1 affected dogs at position 2420, creating an amber mutation in codon 807. However, PRA-affected Tibetan terriers and miniature longhaired dachshunds are normal at this locus, underlining the genetic heterogeneity of this disease group. In addition we have developed a rapid, PCR-based diagnostic test for this mutation that will differentiate normal dogs from asymptomatic carriers.
