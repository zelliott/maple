Mice with a heterozygous null mutation in myelin protein zero (P0(+/-)) develop late-onset clinical paralysis associated with inflammatory pathology in the peripheral nerves. Although the development of this illness is known to require T cells and macrophages, little is understood regarding the immunological defect in the mice. Here we report that young P0(+/-) mice, free from clinical manifestations, have a defect in central tolerance to P0, and are more prone to induction of experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) by sensitization against P0(180-199 )peptide. Notably, we found that the P0 gene is transcribed in the thymus of wild-type and the P0(+/-) mice in an amount proportional to the gene dosage. We then replaced the thymus of wild-type mice with that of the P0-deficient mice and vice versa. Immunization of these mice with P0(180-199 )revealed that a lower thymic P0 transcript would be associated with the higher recall T cell response to P0(180-199), thus accounting for the higher susceptibility of the P0(+/-) mice to P0-induced EAN. These results imply that a heterozygous mutation in an autoantigen could cause defective central tolerance to the autoantigen. As such, autoimmune T cells may play some role in "genetic" diseases caused by a heterozygous gene defect.
