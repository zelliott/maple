To study the molecular biology of the halophilic archaebacterium Halobacterium halobium, the introduction of DNA engineered in vitro is desirable. As a first step in developing a cloning vector, the complete 1736 base pair nucleotide sequence of the natural, high copy number, Halobacterium plasmid pHSB1 has been determined. The plasmid was found to show homology to the small plasmids of Halobacterium strains GRB and GN101. Plasmid pHSB1 encodes a 317 amino acid protein of unknown function. The related halophile, H. halobium, could be transformed by pHSB1, demonstrating its utility as the basis of a cloning vector.
