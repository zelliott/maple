The analysis of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization post-source decay (MALDI-PSD) mass spectra of peptides by using the cross-correlation method for database searching is illustrated. MALDI-PSD mass spectra are shown to contain sufficient fragmentation information to uniquely identify the correct amino acid sequence from large protein databases (approximately 160,000 entries). A search employing the MALDI-PSD mass spectrum of a phosphorylated peptide that correctly identifies the amino acid sequence and the site of phosphorylation is also illustrated.
