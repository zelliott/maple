To investigate the correlation between RARbeta gene promoter methylation and P53 gene mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Promoter methylation of RARbeta and P53 mutations of exons 5 through 9 in 198 resected primary NSCLC tissues were determined by methylation-specific PCR and direct sequencing.

RARbeta gene promoter methylation and P53 mutation were detected in 58.1% and 36.4% of tumors, respectively. Both were higher in males than in females and in smokers than in nonsmokers. A higher prevalence of RARbeta promoter methylation was found in patients with advanced stage tumors than those with TNM stage I. P53 gene mutations were more frequent in squamous cell carcinoma and adeno-squamous carcinoma than adenocarcinoma. All such differences were statistically significant (P< 0.05). Frequencies of P53 mutations, including G:C>T:A mutations, transversions and missense mutations were significantly higher in tumors with RARbeta methylation than in those without (P< 0.05). A significantly higher prevalence of RARbeta methylation was found in tumors with only G:C>T:A mutation in P53 gene than those without P53 mutations (P< 0.05). This difference (OR=3.737, 95%CI: 1.414-9.873) was still statistically significant (P< 0.05) in smokers (OR=4.020, 95%CI: 1.263-12.800), squamous cell carcinomas (OR=5.480, 95%CI: 1.400-21.446) or patients with advanced tumors (OR=3.446, 95%CI: 1.054-11.267) after adjusting for age and sex.

RARbeta methylation is associated with G:C>T:A mutations in P53 gene in NSCLC.
