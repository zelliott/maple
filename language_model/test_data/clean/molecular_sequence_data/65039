A sequenced allelic ladder marker that contains 32 alleles consisting of alleles 13-44 was developed for D1S80 ( MCT118) typing. Each allele, after amplification with D1S80 primers, was cloned to the pT7Blue T-Vector. The plasmid DNAs of these clones were mixed and amplified with D1S80 primers to construct the allelic ladder marker. All the alleles prepared in this study were sequenced in both directions, using two types of forward primers and one reverse primer. The sequencing results revealed that all the alleles in our allelic ladder marker had the correct length corresponding to the allele number. This marker can be used for more effectively typing D1S80.
