In addition to ganglioside GM1b, an unusual and extremely minor ganglioside, GD1 alpha, was efficiently isolated from bovine brain by combination of Q-Sepharose and Iatrobeads column chromatographies. In the course of purification steps, the presence of the sialidase-labile ganglioside was proved by a highly sensitive TLC/enzyme-immunostaining method. The structure was characterized by gas-liquid chromatography, permethylation study, sialidase degradation, immunostaining with specific antibodies, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, and proton magnetic resonance spectrometry. The content of the ganglioside was very small (0.016%) in the total gangliosides. This finding suggests that a synthetic pathway of asialo GM1----GM1b----GD1 alpha may exist in mammalian brains. A monoclonal antibody NA-6 that was obtained by immunizing mice with purified GM1b reacted specifically with GM1b but showed no cross-reactivity with other structurally related gangliosides such as GM1a, GD1a, and so on. Using the method of TLC/immunostaining with NA-6, GM1b was found to be strongly expressed during embryonic days 14-17 in chick brains. Thus, it is assumed that extremely minor gangliosides like GM1b and GD1 alpha found in adult brains are characterized as embryonic molecules.
