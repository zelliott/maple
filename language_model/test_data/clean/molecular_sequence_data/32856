We reported previously that the human factor B precursor is a 215-amino acid polypeptide, the first 40 amino acid residues of which function as a mitochondrial targeting presequence [G.I. Belogrudov, Y. Hatefi, J. Biol. Chem. 277 (2002) 6097-6103]. Confocal microscopy of live HEK293 cells, transiently transfected with factor B constructs tagged at the C-terminus with green fluorescent protein (GFP) revealed that either a 40- or 25-residue presequence localized factor B to mitochondria. Indirect immunofluorescent labeling of fixed, permeabilized HEK293 cells that were transiently transfected with a construct lacking a presequence, showed diffuse, intracellular staining that was consistent with targeting of ectopically expressed factor B to cellular compartments distinct from the mitochondria. Mutants in which either Met(-25) or both Met(-25)/Met(-24) residues of the presequence were deleted exhibited decreased or undetectable levels, respectively, of the GFP-tagged factor B. The factor B presequence alone was shown to target a reporter polypeptide GFP to mitochondria. Our studies, therefore, demonstrate that a 24-residue presequence is sufficient to localize factor B to mitochondria, and suggest that the human factor B precursor is a 199-amino acid polypeptide.
