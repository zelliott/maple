Using a differential screening strategy, we have cloned a novel Xenopus gene, fugacin, related to the transforming growth factor beta superfamily. Transcripts were detected primarily in the dorsal marginal zone of late blastula. Thereafter, they became highly localized to the blastopore lip of early gastrula and were not observed at later stages. This gene, which is most homologous to the mouse gene nodal, displays a new pattern of cysteine residues. These findings highlight the potential role of these growth factors during early vertebrate development.
