The amino acid sequences of the trypsin inhibitors from taro Colocasia esculenta var. esculenta and giant swamp taro Cyrtosperma chamissonis have been determined and are compared with the protein sequence of the trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibitor from giant taro Alocasia macrorrhiza. Both inhibitors display polymorphism and there is evidence of two components in the giant swamp taro. The positional identity between the proteins is highest at 73-75% for the comparison of the giant taro (GT) with the polymorphic forms of the taro (T) inhibitors and lowest at 56-58% for the pairs of taro and giant swamp taro (GST) proteins. The comparisons show that the inhibitors from T and GT are more related to each other than to GST, which supports their taxonomic classification into different tribes. Location of the P1 site for the trypsin inhibitors of aroids is different from that of other Kunitz-type inhibitors and could be at Leu56.
