We determined the nucleotide sequence of a 3.5-kb region of the bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) genome which contained the complete BHV-1 homologs of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) UL26 and UL26.5 genes. In HSV-1, the UL26 and UL26.5 open reading frames encode scaffold proteins upon which viral capsids are assembled. The UL26-encoded protein is also a proteinase and specifically cleaves both itself and the UL26.5-encoded protein. The overall BHV-1-encoded amino acid sequence showed only 41% identity to the HSV-1 sequences and was most divergent in the regions defined to be involved in the scaffolding function. We substituted the proteins encoded by the BHV-1 homologs of the UL26 and UL26.5 open reading frames, expressed in baculovirus, for the corresponding HSV-1 proteins in an in vitro HSV-1 capsid assembly system. The proteins expressed from the BHV-1 UL26 and UL26.5 homologs facilitated the formation of hybrid type B capsids indistinguishable from those formed entirely with HSV-1-encoded proteins.
