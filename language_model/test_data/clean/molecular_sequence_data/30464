Three families with abnormal insulinemia have been reported in Japan and sequencing analysis revealed that they had the same point mutation in one allele of the insulin genes causing [Leu A3]insulin. To estimate whether or not this same mutation came from a common ancestor we determined the sequence of the hypervariable region 5'-flanking the third [Leu A3]insulin allele (insulin Tochigi). This region is composed of 42 tandem repeating oligonucleotides, is 599 base pairs long and the sequence is 5' cdi jfa faa aba baa aaa fab aaa caa aac aca cba aaf ccb 3' (abbreviated as a = ACAGGGGTGTGGGG; b = ACAGGGGTCTGGGG; c = ACAGGGGTCCTGGGG; d = ACAGGGGTCCGGGG; f = ACAGGGGTCCCGGGG; i = ACAGGGTCCTGGGG; j = ACAGGGGTGTGAGG). The length of this region is different from those of the first and second [Leu A3]insulin alleles (insulin Wakayama I,II). This difference suggests either that insulin Tochigi and insulin Wakayama I,II are not of the same origin, or that three cases of [Leu A3]insulin in Japan have the same ancestor but recombination has occurred in this region at some point in the past.
