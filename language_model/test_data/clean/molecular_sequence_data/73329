Specificity of two different types of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitory proteins from the blood plasma of venomous snakes was investigated. Two Crotalidae inhibitors, having a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) in their sequences, inhibited specifically the group-II acidic PLA2s of their own snake venom. On the other hand, Elapidae inhibitor, having two tandem patterns of cysteine residues found in proteins of the Ly-6 superfamily, inhibited not only the group-I PLA2 from its own snake venom but also the group-I, -II, and -III PLA2s from other snake venom. Amino acid sequences of PLA2s that were specifically inhibited by the inhibitors were compared with those of the other PLA2s. A unique aromatic patch structure appeared on the group-II acidic PLA2s was suggested to be involved in the binding to the Crotalidae inhibitors; and residues located in or close to the Ca2+ binding loop of PLA2, in the binding to the Elapidae inhibitor.
