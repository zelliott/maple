About 40 kilobases (kb) downstream of the rat growth hormone gene, a gene was found to be expressed in the liver and placenta as 1.5 kb poly(A)-rich RNA. Using the genomic DNA fragment as a probe, the corresponding cDNA clone containing a 1.3 kb insert was isolated from the rat liver cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequence having 406 residues was identical with that of the mouse transcription factor, SUG and human proteasome subunit, p45. The gene was thus identified as the rat SUG/p45 (rSUG/p45) gene. The 5' end of the gene was determined by the primer-extension analysis and the exon was noted to comprise 1409 bases. The rSUG/p45 gene, 6.0 kb in length and possessing 12 exons, started at 42.8 and ended at 36.8 kb downstream from the transcription start site of the GH gene. From exon 2 to 11, the size of each rSUG/p45 exon was identical with the corresponding exon of the 4.4 kb pig gene. Rat SUG/p45 mRNA was similarly expressed in seven different tissues and one cell line.
