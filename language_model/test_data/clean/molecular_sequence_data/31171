The basis of the specificity of interaction of U1 and U2 small nuclear (sn)RNAs and their cognate binding proteins, U1A and U2B'', has been examined. The U1A protein recognizes U1 snRNA on its own, whereas U2B'' binds specifically to U2 snRNA only in the presence of a second protein, U2A'. Exchange of two nucleotides between the two RNAs or of eight amino acids between the two proteins reverses binding specificity.
