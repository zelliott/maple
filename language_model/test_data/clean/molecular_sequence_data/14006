DNA sequences encoding the 24 kDa flagellar calcium binding protein (FCaBP) of two strains of Trypanosoma cruzi were found to differ at fourteen positions, six of which result in amino acid differences. Four of the amino acid differences are located within the calcium-binding domains of FCaBP; however, none is predicted to affect the calcium-binding ability of the protein. Chromosomes harboring the FCaBP gene clusters differ in size among T. cruzi strains.
