To augment the chemical potential of the immunological repertoire, a metal ion-binding light chain has been introduced into the murine genome. Mice containing the transgene were subsequently immunized with a fluorescein conjugate. The transgenic light chain was found at a high frequency in the anti-fluorescein memory B-cell compartment. This general method should be applicable to other cofactors and small molecules and should lead to generation of antibodies with unique catalytic activities.
