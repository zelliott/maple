The production of large-scale peptides in solution has some advantages and some disadvantages. Advantages. (i) The layout of the synthesis can be planned in advance in respect of: main- and side-chain protection; fragment selection and methods of fragment coupling to minimize racemization. (ii) In production: purification, at best crystallization, of the intermediates; scale-up potential; analysis can be performed at each step and analytical criteria defined and different fragments can be produced at the same time. Disadvantages. There are a number of problems: solubility of the intermediates; limited scale-up potential; introduction of processes into production in an immature state; process-streamlining over several years; long-time requirement for the synthesis, which depends on the reactors that are available and the most time-consuming path of the synthesis and the demands of the market cannot be met on short notice.
