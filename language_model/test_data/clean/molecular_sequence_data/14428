Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) plays an important role in fish growth. This study investigated the IGF1 response to various nutritional conditions in yellowtail. First, we cloned 1,075 bp of yellowtail IGF1 cDNA, which codes for a protein of 185 amino acids (aa). This is composed of 44 aa for the signal peptide; 68 aa for the mature peptide comprising the B, C, A, and D domains; and 73 aa for the E domain. The mature yellowtail IGF1 showed high identity to IGF1 of other teleosts. Insulin-like growth factor 1 mRNA expression in the liver and white muscle was measured to observe the IGF1 response to various nutritional conditions, because the liver has the highest IGF1 expression and white muscle comprises the largest fraction of the fish body. Only white muscle IGF1 mRNA expression decreased significantly by 3 wk of fasting and recovered by refeeding. In subsequent feeding ratio (1%, 2%, and 3%/BW/d) experiments, significant correlations to growth were observed in white muscle IGF1 mRNA expression at 2- and 6-wk points and in hepatic IGF1 mRNA expression at 4 wk point. These data suggest that IGF1 expression both in hepatic and white muscle is important for somatic growth in yellowtail. Furthermore, white muscle IGF1 mRNA expression showed better responses to somatic growth and nutrition status in our two experiments than hepatic IGF1 mRNA expression.
