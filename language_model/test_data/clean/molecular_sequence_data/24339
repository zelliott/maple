The Pichia anomala LEU2 gene (PaLEU2) was isolated by complementation of a leu2 Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant. The cloned gene also allowed growth of a Escherichia coli leuB mutant in leucine-lacking medium, indicating that it encodes a product able to complement the beta-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase deficiency of the mutants. The sequenced DNA fragment contains a complete ORF of 1092 bp, and the deduced polypeptide shares significant homologies with the products of the LEU2 genes from S. cerevisiae (84% identity) and other yeast species. A sequence resembling the GC-rich palindrome motif identified in the 5' region of S. cerevisiae LEU2 gene as the binding site for the transcription activating factor encoded by the LEU3 gene was found at the promoter region. In addition, upstream of the PaLEU2 the 3'-terminal half of a gene of the same orientation, encoding a homologue of the S. cerevisiae NFS1/SPL1 gene that encodes a mitochondrial cysteine desulphurase involved in both tRNA processing and mitochondrial metabolism, was found. The genomic organization of the PaNFS1-PaLEU2 gene pair is similar to that found in several other yeast species, including S. cerevisiae and Candida albicans, except that in some of them the LEU2 gene appears in the reverse orientation.
