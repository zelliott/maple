Clp protease is a highly selective protease in E. coli, which consists of two types of subunits, the regulatory subunit with ATPase activity, ClpA, and the catalytic subunit, ClpP. In order to examine the possible association of plant Clp protease with the degradation of protein in senescing chloroplasts, we isolated a cDNA clone for ClpC which is a plant homologue of ClpA from Arabidopsis thaliana in addition to ERD1 which we had isolated earlier [Kiyosue et al. (1993) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 196: 1214]. We also isolated a clone for the plastidic gene, clpP (pclpP) and cDNA clones for putative nuclear clpP genes (nclpP1-6). We analyzed the expression of these clp genes in Arabidopsis leaves after various dark periods and during natural senescence. The expression of erd1 was increased by dark-induced and by natural senescence, as reported earlier [Nakashima et al. (1997) Plant J. 12: 851], while that of AtclpC was decreased. Two catalytic subunits nclpPs (nclpP3 and nclpP5) showed high expression in naturally senescing leaves, but the expression of pclpP and the other nclpPs was not changed. Immunoblot analysis of chloroplast protein and in vitro import analysis demonstrated that both nucleus-encoded regulatory subunits as well as nClpP5 were localized in the chloroplast stroma. These observations suggest that chloroplast Clp protease is composed of very complicated combinations of subunits, and that ERD1, nClpP5 and pClpP have a role in the concerted degradation of protein in senescing chloroplasts.
