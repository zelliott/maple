The natriuretic peptide system is composed of at least three distinct endogenous peptides: atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), and three receptors: ANP-A receptor/GC-A, ANP-B receptor/GC-B and the clearance receptor. This system influences the control of body fluid and blood pressure as cardiac hormones and local regulators. Recent advances in molecular biology have unravel the molecular mechanism of the natriuretic peptide system and have facilitated our understanding of it. The present review gives the current knowledge of the molecular biology of the natriuretic peptide system.
