C-terminal binding proteins (CtBPs) are transcriptional corepressors of mediators of Notch, Wnt, and other signalling pathways. Thus, they are potential players in the control of several developmentally important processes, including segmentation, somitogenesis, and neural tube and limb patterning. We have cloned the avian orthologues of Ctbp1 and Ctbp2 and examined their expression pattern by whole-mount in situ hybridization between Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) stages 3 and 24. Both Ctbp genes show similar expression patterns during embryonic development, and both are detected from HH stage 3 in the developing central nervous system, by HH stage 7 in the paraxial mesoderm and later in the limb bud. In most places, Ctbp1 and Ctbp2 are expressed in overlapping domains. However, there are interesting domains and/or temporal expression patterns that are specific to each Ctbp gene. For instance, Ctbp1 is predominantly expressed in the epiblast, whereas Ctbp2 is in the primitive streak at HH stage 3. However, by HH stage 4, both genes are found in the primitive streak and in the ectoderm. Similarly, although both genes display similar expression patterns in early somitogenesis, in mature somites, Ctbp1 transcripts are located in myotomal cells, whereas Ctbp2 transcripts are observed in dermomyotomal cells. Finally, we found that emigrating neural crest cells express Ctbp2, whereas dorsal root ganglia express Ctbp1. These data suggest that Ctbp1 and Ctbp2 may be functionally redundant in some tissues and have unique functions in other tissues.
