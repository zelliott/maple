The cDNA encoding D-aspartate oxidase (DASPO) was cloned from mouse kidney RNA by RT-PCR. Sequence analysis showed that it contained a 1023-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 341 amino acid residues. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli with or without an N-terminal His-tag and had functional DASPO activity that was highly specific for D-aspartate and N-methyl-D-aspartate. To investigate the roles of the Arg-216 and Arg-237 residues of the mouse DASPO (mDASPO), we generated clones with several single amino acid substitutions of these residues in an N-terminally His-tagged mDASPO. These substitutions significantly reduced the activity of the recombinant enzyme against acidic D-amino acids and did not confer any additional specificity to other amino acids. These results suggest that the Arg-216 and Arg-237 residues of mDASPO are catalytically important for full enzyme activity.
