Distribution of messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) type 2 receptor (IGF2R) is investigated in the rat lower brainstem by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Cells with IGF2R mRNA are distributed widely in a region-specific manner. It is expressed in: (1) motor nuclei such as the oculomotor nucleus, trochlear nucleus, motor trigeminal nucleus, abducens nucleus, facial nucleus, ambiguus nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus and hypoglossal nucleus; (2) several sensory-related nuclei like the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, lateral and spinal vestibular nuclei, ventral and dorsal cochlear nuclei and nucleus of the trapezoid body; and (3) other regions such as the red nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, pontine nuclei, three cerebellar nuclei (medial, interposed and lateral), Purkinje cells, cells in the granular layer of the cerebellum, locus coeruleus, several areas of the reticular nucleus and area postrema.
