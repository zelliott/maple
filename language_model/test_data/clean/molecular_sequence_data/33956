The nitrophorins (NP) of the adult blood-sucking insect Rhodnius prolixus fall into two pairs based on sequence identity (NP1,4 (90%) and NP2,3 (79%)), which differ significantly in the size of side chains of residues which contact the heme. These residues include those in the distal pocket of NP2 (I120) and NP1 (T121) and the "belt" that surrounds the heme of NP2 (S40, F42), and NP1(A42, L44). To determine the importance of these residues and others conserved or very similar for the two pairs, including L122(123), L132(133), appropriate mutants of NP2 and NP1 have been prepared and studied by (1)H NMR spectroscopy. Wild-type NP2 has heme orientation ratio (A:B) of 1:8 at equilibrium, while wild-type NP1 has A:B ~1:1 at equilibrium. Another difference between NP2 and NP1 is in the heme seating with regard to His57(59). It is found that among the distal pocket residues investigated, the residue most responsible for heme orientation and seating is I120(T121). F42(L44) and L106(F107) may also be important, but must be investigated in greater detail.
