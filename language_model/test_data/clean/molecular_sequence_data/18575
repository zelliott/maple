The concept of rationally designing MALDI matrices has been extended to the next "whole sample" level. These studies have revealed some unexpected and exploitable insights in improving MALDI sensitivity. It is shown that (i) additives which only provide additional laser energy absorption are best to be avoided; (ii) the addition of proton donors in the form of protonated weak bases can be highly beneficial; (iii) the addition of glycerol for coating crystalline samples is highly recommended. Overall, analytical sensitivity has been significantly increased compared to the current "gold" standards in MALDI MS, and new insights into the mechanisms and processes of MALDI have been gained.
