Ovarian-specific promoter (OSP) is a tissue-specific promoter only expressed in the ovary to regulate its development. To investigate the activity of OSP in diverse dairy goat cells, OSP was cloned from dairy goat genome and used to construct the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-OSP to examine the transcriptional activity of OSP. Consequently, a 461-bp OSP fragment was obtained. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the fragment contained multiple transcription factor binding sites, such as SRY, HSF, AP-1, C/EBP, CAAT, TATA, and so on, and the nucleotide sequence of OSP shared 99% and 97% similarity with those of OSP-1 and OSP-2 in rat. In addition, two variants were identified in the OSP (g.164T was deletion and g.375T<C). In diverse cells, the expression of luciferase in ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) and stromal cells of ovarian cortex was extremely significantly higher than that in fetal fibroblasts and oviduct epithelial cells. Meanwhile, the expression of luciferase in ovarian GCs was extremely significantly higher than that in the stromal cells of ovarian cortex. In summary, we successfully extracted dairy goat OSP and identified its transcriptional activity, which in part shed light on the study of ovarian-specific transcription and provided further insights into the development and regulation of dairy goat's ovary as well.
