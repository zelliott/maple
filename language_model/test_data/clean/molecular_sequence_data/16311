A gene containing a transposon-like human repeat element, called THE 1, has been isolated and characterized. The gene, termed T+, encodes a polypeptide resembling known calcium-binding proteins. The THE 1 element is present in the 3'-untranslated region of its message. The cDNA clone corresponding to the gene's mRNA product led to the identification of this gene. A processed RNA pseudogene related to the authentic gene has also been isolated. In addition to intron processing, this pseudogene differs from the gene in that it contains an interspersed Alu repeat instead of a THE 1 element in the 3'-untranslated region. Thus, we compare a site containing a THE 1 element to an ancestrally related transposon-less target site. The comparison suggests a retroviral-related mechanism of THE 1 insertion. This system is unusual in that the parent gene is associated with three distinct retrotransposition events: the parent gene was converted to a processed RNA pseudogene, an Alu repeat inserted into the pseudogene, and a THE 1 element inserted into the parent gene.
