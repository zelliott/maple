Receptor-G protein interaction is characterized by cycles of association and dissociation. We present evidence which indicates that during receptor-G protein interaction, the C-terminal tail of the G protein gamma subunit, which is masked in the beta gamma complex, is exposed and establishes high-affinity contact with the receptor. This potential conformational switch provides a mechanism to regulate receptor-G protein coupling. This switch may also be significant for the role of the beta gamma complex in regulation of effector function.
