The mechanism of hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl 3-deoxy-D-glycero-alpha-D-galacto-2-nonulopyranosidonic acid (KDN alpha 2MeUmb, 4) by KDN-sialidase isolated from the hepatopancreas of the oyster Crassostrea virginica has been monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The results of these experiments reveal that KDN-sialidase catalyses the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate KDN alpha 2MeUmb, with initial release of alpha-D-KDN. This is consistent with an overall mechanism for the hydrolysis which proceeds with retention of anomeric configuration. These results agree with earlier NMR studies of other N-acetylneuraminic acid-recognising sialidases from both viral and bacterial sources.
