We have characterized a novel type of non-coding RNA which consists of tandem repeats of similar sequences, approximately 0.9 kb in size. This RNA, termed Bsr (brain specific repetitive) RNA, is encoded at a single locus (6 q31-->q32) in the rat genome, where 100 to 150 copies of the 0.9 kb sequences are repeated in tandem. Bsr RNA is preferentially expressed in the rat central nervous system (CNS), especially in phylogenetically old structures, such as the pareo- and archicortex, amygdala, thalamus and hypothalamus. In the developing brains, Bsr RNA is expressed in the subsets of differentiating cells but not in proliferating cells. Despite the finding that Bsr RNA appears to be conserved only among the Rattus species, the specific expression pattern of Bsr RNA suggests that it might have some role in the rat CNS.
