A novel actinomycete, strain SST-8(T), was isolated from sand sediment of Samyang Beach in Jeju, Korea, and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. The organism, which produced opaque, circular, yellow colonies, with a coryneform morphology, showed the following chemotaxonomic characteristics: meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diamino acid in the peptidoglycan, MK-8(H(2)) as the major menaquinone, phosphatidylglycerol as the only polar lipid, anteiso-C(15 : 0) and anteiso-C(17 : 0) as major fatty acids and a DNA G+C content of 70.7 mol%. The combination of morphological and chemotaxonomic features supported its classification in the genus Brevibacterium. Phylogenetic analyses, based on 16S rRNA gene sequence studies, showed that strain SST-8(T) formed an intermediate branch between the Brevibacterium luteolum/Brevibacterium otitidis and Brevibacterium mcbrellneri/Brevibacterium paucivorans clusters. Sequence similarity calculations based on a neighbour-joining analysis revealed that the closest relatives of strain SST-8(T) were the type strains of B. paucivorans (96.6 %), B. luteolum (96.5 %), B. mcbrellneri (96.3 %), Brevibacterium avium (96.0 %) and B. otitidis (95.9 %). Based on a broad set of phenotypic and genetic data, it was evident that the strain represents a novel species of the genus Brevibacterium. The name Brevibacterium samyangense sp. nov. is proposed, with SST-8(T) (=NRRL B-41420(T)=KCCM 42316(T)) as the type strain.
