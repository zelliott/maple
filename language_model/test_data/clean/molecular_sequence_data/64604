N(OMe)-linked disaccharide analogues, isosteric to the corresponding natural disaccharides, have been synthesized by chemoselective assembly of unprotected natural monosaccharides with methyl 6-deoxy-6-methoxyamino-alpha-D-glucopyranoside in an aqueous environment. The coupling reactions were found to be chemo- and stereoselective affording beta-(1-->6) disaccharide mimics when using Glc and GlcNAc; in the case of Gal, the beta-anomer was prevalent (beta:alpha=7:1). An iterative method for the synthesis of linear N(OMe) oligosaccharide analogues was demonstrated, based on the use of an unprotected monosaccharide building block in which an oxime functionality at C-6 is converted during the synthesis into the corresponding methoxyamino group. The conformational analysis of these compounds was carried out by using NMR spectroscopy, ab initio, molecular mechanics, and molecular dynamics methods. Optimized geometries and energies of fourteen conformers for each compound have been calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. Predicted conformational equilibria were compared with the results based on NMR experiments and good agreement was found. It appears that N(OMe)-linked disaccharide analogues exhibit a slightly different conformational behavior to their parent natural disaccharides.
