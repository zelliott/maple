Two new lycopene Î²-cyclases (LCYBs) were cloned and characterized from grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macf.). During fruit ripening, CpLCYB1 expression did not show significant differences between 'Flame' (red flesh) and 'Marsh' (white flesh), and was much lower than CpLCYB2 and nearly constant; however, CpLCYB2 expression dramatically changed in a similar tendency in the pulp of both grapefruit cultivars, but the relative abundance of mRNA in 'Flame' was significantly lower than in 'Marsh'. Phylogenetically and structurally, CpLCYB1 was a chloroplast-specific member and CpLCYB2 a chromoplast-specific member, the two subfamilies of all the LCYB genes. An intron was found in the 5'-untranslated region of CpLCYB1 and in two other Citrus LCYB1 genes (CcLCYB1 and CsLCYB1-2), resulting in an extra 20 amino acids, compared with all the other LCYB1s. It suggested that a different genomic event, in addition to gene duplication, has contributed to the evolution of these LCYB genes, and likewise, the change of their functions.
