A new fungal immunomodulatory protein (Fip) has been purified from the edible mushroom, Volvariella volvacea, and designated Fip-vvo. Analysis of the purified protein by SDS/PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining demonstrated that Fip-vvo is a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 15 kDa. Periodic acid/Schiff staining showed that this single polypeptide lacks carbohydrates. Using an in vitro bioassay measuring blast-formation stimulatory activity, Fip-vvo was shown to stimulate the maximum proliferation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes at a concentration of 5 microg/ml. Fip-vvo was capable of agglutinating rat red blood cells. Neither haemagglutination nor mitogenic activities were inhibited by mono- or dimeric sugars. In vivo, repeat administration of Fip-vvo greatly reduced the production of BSA-induced Arthus reaction in mice, whereas little effect was observed on the prevention of systemic anaphylaxis reactions. The selectively enhanced transcriptional expression of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, interferon-gamma, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, lymphotoxin and IL-2 receptor by Fip-vvo was also demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-PCR. This finding suggests that Fip-vvo exerts its immunomodulatory effects via cytokine regulation. In addition, the complete amino acid sequence of Fip-vvo was obtained by direct protein sequencing. This protein consists of 112 amino acid residues with a blocked N-terminal end and has a calculated molecular mass of 12667 Da not including the N-terminal blocking group. By gel filtration analysis, Fip-vvo exhibited a molecular mass of 26 kDa for the native molecules in PBS. This result indicates that native Fip-vvo is most likely a non-covalently associated homodimeric molecule.
