We have developed a simple procedure to incorporate an EDTA-metal complex at a rationally selected site within a full-length protein. Our procedure has two steps: In step 1, we use site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a unique solvent-accessible cysteine residue at the site of interest. In step 2, we derivatize the resulting protein with S-(2-pyridylthio)cysteaminyl-EDTA-metal, a novel aromatic disulfide derivative of EDTA-metal. We have used this procedure to incorporate an EDTA-iron complex at amino acid 2 of the helix-turn-helix motif of each of two helix-turn-helix motif sequence-specific DNA binding proteins, catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) and Cro, and we have analyzed EDTA-iron-mediated DNA affinity cleavage by the resulting protein derivatives. The CAP derivative cleaves DNA at base pair 2 of the DNA half-site in the protein-DNA complex, and the Cro derivative cleaves DNA at base pairs -3 to 5 of the DNA half-site in the protein-DNA complex. We infer that amino acid 2 of the helix-turn-helix motif of CAP is close to base pair 2 of the DNA half-site in the CAP-DNA complex in solution and that amino acid 2 of the helix-turn-helix motif of Cro is close to base pairs -3 to 5 of the DNA half-site in the Cro-DNA complex in solution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
