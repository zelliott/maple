A taxonomic study was carried out on strain 22II14-10F7(T), which was isolated from the deep-sea water of the Atlantic Ocean with oil-degrading enrichment. The bacterium was Gram-stain-negative, oxidase- and catalase-positive and rod-shaped. Growth was observed at salinities from 0.5 to 15 % and at temperatures from 4 to 37 °C; it was unable to hydrolyse Tween 40, 80 or gelatin. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain 22II14-10F7(T) represented a member of the genus Zunongwangia, with highest sequence similarity of 97.3 % to Zunongwangia profunda SM-A87(T), while the similarities to other species were all below 94.0 %. The DNA-DNA hybridization estimate of the similarity between strain 22II14-10F7(T) and Z. profunda SM-A87(T) was 27.20±2.43 % according to their genome sequences. The principal fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0, anteiso-C15 : 0 , iso-C15 : 1 G, iso-C17 : 0 3-OH, summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω7c/ω6c) and summed feature 9 (iso-C17 : 1ω9c or C16 : 0 10-methyl). The G+C content of the chromosomal DNA was 35.5 mol%. The major respiratory quinone was determined to be MK-6. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), two aminolipids (AL1 and AL2) and five unknown lipids (L1-L5) were present. The combined genotypic and phenotypic data show that strain 22II14-10F7(T) represents a novel species of the genus Zunongwangia, for which the name Zunongwangia atlantica sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain 22II14-10F7(T) ( = CGMCC1.12470(T) = LMG 27421(T) = MCCC 1A06481(T)).
