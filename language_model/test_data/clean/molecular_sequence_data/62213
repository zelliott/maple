Glycosphingolipids are widely viewed as integral components of the Golgi-based machinery by which membrane proteins are targeted to compartments of the endosomal/lysosomal system and to the surface domains of polarized cells. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae creates glycosphingolipids by transferring mannose to the head group of inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC), yielding mannosyl-IPC (MIPC). Addition of an extra phosphoinositol group onto MIPC generates mannosyldi-IPC (M(IP)2C), the final and most abundant sphingolipid in yeast. Mannosylation of IPC is partially dependent on CSG1, a gene encoding a putative sphingolipidmannosyltransferase. Here we show that open reading frame YBR161w, renamed CSH1, is functionally homologous to CSG1 and that deletion of both genes abolishes MIPC and M(IP)2C synthesis without affecting protein mannosylation. Csg1p and Csh1p are closely related polytopic membrane proteins that co-localize with IPC synthase in the medial-Golgi. Loss of Csg1p and Csh1p has no effect on clathrin- or AP-3 adaptor-mediated protein transport from the Golgi to the vacuole. Moreover, segregation of the periplasmic enzyme invertase, the plasma membrane ATPase Pma1p and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein Gas1p into distinct classes of secretory vesicles occurs independently of Csg1p and Csh1p. Our results indicate that protein sorting in the late Golgi of yeast does not require production of mannosylated sphingolipids.
