The nuclear internalization of biomolecules by Tat peptide provides a mechanism to deliver drugs to cells. However, translocation of molecular imaging probes to the nucleus may induce undesirable mutagenesis. To assess the feasibility of retaining its cell permeating effect without nuclear translocation, Tat-peptide was conjugated with a somatostatin receptor (STR)-avid ligand (Oct) and labeled with fluorescent dyes. The results show that Tat-Oct-5-FAM (fluorescein 5'-carboxylic acid) remained in the cytoplasm of STR-positive AR42J cells. Co-incubation of Tat-Oct-5-FAM with ATP induced nuclear translocation. These data suggest that both dye and Oct-STR endocytosis complex could modulate nuclear internalization of Tat peptides.
