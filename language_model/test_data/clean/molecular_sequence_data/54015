The murine B-lymphocyte hybridoma cell line, CC9C10, was grown in serum-free continuous culture at steady-state dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations of 10%, 50%, and 100% of air saturation in both LH Series 210 (LH) and New Brunswick Scientific (NBS) CelliGen bioreactors. All culture parameters were monitored and controlled and were nominally identical at steady state in the two bioreactors. The secreted monoclonal antibody (mAb), an immunoglobulin G(1), was purified and subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation using peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F). Asparagine-linked (N-linked) oligosaccharide pools released from mAb samples cultured in each bioreactor at each of the three DO setpoints were analyzed by high-pH anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD). The predominant N-linked structures were core-fucosylated asialo biantennary chains with varying galactosylation. There were also minor amounts of monosialyl oligosaccharides and trace amounts of afucosyl oligosaccharides. The level of DO affects the glycosylation of this mAb. A definite reduction in the level of galactosylation of N-glycan chains was observed at lower DO in both bioreactors, as evidenced by prominent increases in the relative amounts of agalactosyl chains and decreases in the relative amounts of digalactosyl chains-with the relative amounts of monogalactosyl chains being comparatively constant. However, the quantitative results are not precise matches between the two bioreactors. The effect of DO on galactosylation is less pronounced in the NBS bioreactor than in the LH bioreactor, particularly the shift between the relative amounts of agalactosyl and digalactosyl chains in 10% and 50% DO. There are also perceptibly higher levels of sialylation of the mAb glycans in the NBS bioreactor than in the LH bioreactor at all three DO setpoints. The results indicate that the DO effect is not bioreactor specific and that nominally identical steady-state conditions in different chemostat bioreactors may still lead to some incongruities in glycosylation, possibly due to the particular architectures of the bioreactors and the design of their respective monitoring and control systems. The observed differences in N-linked glycosylation of the mAb secreted by the hybridoma grown in the LH and NBS bioreactors may be explained by the differences in oxygen supply and control strategies between the two bioreactors.
