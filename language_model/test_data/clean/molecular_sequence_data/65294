A Gram-negative, microaerophilic slender rod, measuring approximately 10 mum long and approximately 1 microm wide, isolated from the gastric mucosa of a cat and designated strain M50(T), was subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Despite its apparent lack of helical coils, the organism showed a corkscrew-like motion by means of multiple sheathed flagella located at both ends of the cell and by a periplasmic fibril coiled around the body. Strain M50(T) grew preferably on biphasic culture plates or on very moist agar. Coccoid forms predominated in cultures older than 4 days as well as in growth obtained on dry agar plates. The strain grew at 37 degrees C, but not at 25 or 42 degrees C and exhibited urease, oxidase and catalase activities. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the novel isolate was identified as a member of the genus Helicobacter and showed about 98 to 99 % sequence similarity to Helicobacter felis, Helicobacter bizzozeronii, Helicobacter salomonis, Helicobacter cynogastricus and 'Candidatus Helicobacter heilmannii', five highly related species previously detected in the feline or canine gastric mucosa. Protein profiling of strain M50(T) using SDS-PAGE revealed a pattern different from those of other Helicobacter species of mammalian gastric origin. Additionally, the urease and HSP60 gene sequences of strain M50(T) were different from those of H. felis, H. bizzozeronii, H. salomonis, H. cynogastricus and 'Ca. H. heilmannii'. It is thus proposed that strain M50(T) (=LMG 23839(T)=CCUG 53816(T)) represents a novel species within this genus, for which the name Helicobacter baculiformis sp. nov. is proposed.
