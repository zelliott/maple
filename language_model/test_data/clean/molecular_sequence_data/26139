A deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) probe which specifically distinguishes Plasmodium vivax from P. falciparum malaria has been derived from a P. vivax genomic DNA library. This probe, VPL101, consists of 3.2 kilobase pairs and does not hybridize with up to 6 micrograms of human or P. falciparum DNA. VPL101 contains at least two copies of a 205 base pair repeat sequence. The subcloned repeat probe, VPL101/5, reacted with 73 of 76 microscopically diagnosed P. vivax samples but not with any of 17 human DNA samples or any of 8 P. falciparum DNA samples from cultured parasites. It was possible to detect P. vivax in mixed infections in which only P. falciparum parasites were identifiable by microscopy. This P. vivax DNA probe provides a useful epidemiological tool for malaria control programmes.
