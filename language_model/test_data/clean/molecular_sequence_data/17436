The polychaete Capitella capitata sp.I has a high capacity to metabolize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which are among the most hazardous environmental pollutants with significant biological effects. In the present study, two novel cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes were identified in this species. One was named CYP331A1, the first member of a new family of CYP331, and the other CYP4AT1 is the first member of a new subfamily CYP4AT. Both of these genes are constitutively expressed in the worms and detectable by RT-PCR. The expression of CYP331A1 mRNA was observed to be more sensitive to PAH exposure than CYP4AT1, which indicated that CYP331A1 should play a more important role than CYP4AT1 in PAH metabolism in this species. Considering the importance of C. capitata sp.I in taking up PAH and other organic pollutants from contaminated marine sediments with the potential for subsequent food-chain transfer, our results are important for understanding the molecular basis of biotransformation and detoxification in this invertebrate, and also have evolutionary significance for understanding the diversity and history of the CYP superfamily.
