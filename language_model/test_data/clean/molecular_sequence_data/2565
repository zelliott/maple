The nucleotide sequence of two repeated sequences (RS) in opposite orientations flanking the 125-kDa toxin gene of Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (C. Bourgouin et al., J. Bacteriol. 170, 3575-3583, 1988) is reported in this paper. The analysis of these sequences indicates that these two RS display characteristic features of bacterial insertion sequences (IS) and are therefore referred to as IS240. IS240 B is 865 bp long and has two perfect terminal-inverted repeats of 16 bp; IS240 A is 99% identical to IS240 B. A long open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 235 amino acids spans almost the entire sequence of both IS240 elements. Both the sequence of the inverted repeats and the putative transposases are homologous to IS26 of Proteus vulgaris, IS15-delta of Salmonella panama, IS431 of Staphylococcus aureus, and ISS1 of Streptococcus lactis.
