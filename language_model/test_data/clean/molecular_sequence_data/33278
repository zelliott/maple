H(+)-translocating pyrophosphatase converts energy from hydrolysis of pyrophosphate to active H(+) transport across biomembranes. Mutational analysis of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) enzyme revealed that amino acid substitution of Phe-388 and Ala-514 altered the enzyme activity. Both residues are located at the interface between the transmembrane domains and cytosolic loops, in which the catalytic domain exists. Systematic amino acid substitution was carried out using the Escherichia coli heterologous expression system. Two of the 38 mutant enzymes, F388Y and A514S, showed a high ratio of H(+)-pump to substrate hydrolysis without decrease in the substrate hydrolysis activity, indicating high energy-coupling efficiency.
