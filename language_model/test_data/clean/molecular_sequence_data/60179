The streptococcal plasmid pMV158 is not auto-transferable, but it can be mobilised between bacteria by the use of functions supplied by plasmids of the pIP501/pAM beta 1 family. Plasmid pMV158 encodes a protein, MobM, which is involved in its mobilisation. This process initiates when MobM specifically cleaves supercoiled pMV158 plasmid DNA at the origin of transfer, oriT. Plasmid pMV158 has been transferred to Lactococcus lactis by conjugation aided by plasmid pAM beta 1. In the lactococcal host, MobM-mediated specific pMV158-relaxed molecules were detected. The intracellular amount of MobM has been quantified by immunoblot analyses and shown to be about 3500 molecules per cell. In the same host, we have mapped the initiation point of transcription of mobM. Transcription of this gene is directed from a promoter with an extended--10 region which overlaps with the pMV158-oriT.
