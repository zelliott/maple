Extracellular protein profiles from wild-type and regulatory or secretory isogenic mutants of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoenzyme S regulon were compared to identify proteins coordinately secreted with ExoS. Data from amino-terminal sequence analysis of purified extracellular proteins were combined with data from nucleotide sequence analysis of loci linked to exoenzyme S production. We report the identification of P. aeruginosa homologs to proteins of Yersinia spp. that function as regulators of the low calcium response, regulators of secretion, and mediators of the type III translocation mechanism.
