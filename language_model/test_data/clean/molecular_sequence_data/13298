Trypsin inhibitors from winter pea seeds (c.v. Frilene) have been purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and anion and cation exchange chromatography and shown to consist of six protease inhibitors (PSTI I, II, III, IVa, IVb, and V). Their molecular weights were determined by electrospray mass spectrometry as 6916, 6807, 7676, 7944, 7848 and 7844 D, respectively, and the sequences of the first 20 N-terminal amino acid residues of these six inhibitors were found to be identical. The complete amino acid sequence of PSTI IVa was determined. This protein comprises a total of 72 residues and has 14 cysteines, all involved in disulfide bridges. Comparison of the sequence of PSTI IVa with those of other leguminous Bowman-Birk type inhibitors revealed that PSTI could be classified as a group III inhibitor, closely related to Vicia faba and Vicia angustifolia inhibitors.
