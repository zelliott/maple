Complementary DNA for a rabbit PMN-derived lymphocyte proliferation potentiating factor (PMN factor) was cloned from a cDNA library constructed from poly(A)+RNA of early inflammatory exudate PMN. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides as probes for cloning were synthesized according to the previously reported amino acid sequence of the purified PMN factor. This cDNA encodes a 268-residue protein which is homologous to the established structures of human IL 1 beta (74%0 or murine IL 1 beta (71%). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the endogenously produced PMN factor indicates that the mature molecule is made up of carboxy terminal 152 amino acids of the precursor molecule. Taking into consideration the previous studies on biological activities, this cloned PMN factor is therefore considered to be rabbit IL 1 beta.
