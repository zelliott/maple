For successful parasitization, the female Campoletis sonorensis endoparasitic wasp injects a polydnavirus into its host, Heliothis virescens, during oviposition. Viral gene expression induces immunosuppression and alters development of the host. We report here that three abundantly expressed genes, VHv1.1, WHv1.0, and WHv1.6, describes a polydnavirus "cysteine-rich" gene family which may be important in inducing these host manifestations. These genes have a similar primary gene structure and their proteins contain cysteine motifs characteristic of snail ion-channel ligands, the omega-conotoxins. Like the omega-conotoxins, the intercysteine amino acid residues are hypervariable with only three identical amino acids in all motifs. The conservation of this domain in the three viral genes may reflect an important functional role for these viral proteins in the parasitization of H. virescens. The three genes also contain introns similar in sequence at comparable positions in their 5' untranslated leaders and coding sequences. VHv1.1 contains two cysteine motifs, and each motif is interrupted by an intron at the same position as in the cysteine motifs of WHv1.0 and WHv1.6. Intron 2 sequences of WHv1.0 and WHv1.6 are 92% identical, while the immediately flanking exon sequences encoding the cysteine motifs are only 76% identical. This provides an example of nuclear pre-mRNA introns which are more conserved than flanking exons among members of a gene family.
