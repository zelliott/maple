A promoter sequence, PAN, was isolated from Mycobacterium paratuberculosis and characterized. This promoter lies adjacent to, and outside, the 3' end of an IS900 insertion element. IS900 contains an open reading frame, ORF2, on the complementary strand which codes for the putative transposase of this insertion sequence. A DNA fragment containing PAN and part of ORF2 was fused to the lacZ gene and inserted into the replicative shuttle vector pRR3. Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG (BCG) transformed with this plasmid exhibited beta-galactosidase activity. However, lacZ was only expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of PAN, when ORF2 was deleted. Immunization of mice with the recombinant M. bovis BCG expressing lacZ resulted in the induction of a high humoral and cellular response directed against beta-galactosidase. The PAN-ORF2 expression system may prove to be particularly useful for cloning and expression of heterologous genes in the BCG vaccine strain.
