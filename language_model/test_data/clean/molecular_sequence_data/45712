During a study of MICA frequency in a healthy population and a cohort of patients suffering with inflammatory bowel disease, three DNA samples produced unusual reactivity patterns using polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP). These samples were subsequently characterized by sequence-based typing (SBT). Here, we report the sequence of these three novel MICA alleles.
