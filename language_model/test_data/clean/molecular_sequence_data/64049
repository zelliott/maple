Heterosigma akashiwo (Rhaphidophyceae) is a unicellular, flagellated, bloom-forming, toxic alga of ecological and economic importance. Here, we report the results of sequencing and analyzing the genome of an 8.6-kb single-stranded RNA virus (HaRNAV-SOG263) that infects H. akashiwo. Our results show that HaRNAV is related to picorna-like viruses, but does not belong within any currently defined virus family. This is based on the genome organization and sequence comparisons of putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, and capsid protein sequences. The genome sequence predicts a single open reading frame (orf) encoding a polyprotein that contains conserved picorna-like protein domains, with putative nonstructural protein domains present in the N-terminus and the structural proteins in the C-terminus of the polyprotein. We have analyzed and compared the virus structural proteins from infectious and noninfectious particles. In this way, we identified structural protein cleavage sites as well as protein processing events that are presumably important for maturation of virus particles. The combination of genome structure and sequence relationships to other viruses suggests that HaRNAV is the first member of a proposed new virus family (Marnaviridae), related to picorna-like viruses.
