Previously, we have shown that primary afferent sensory neurons are necessary for disease activity in T cell-mediated immune hepatitis in mice. In the present study, we analyzed the possible role of substance P (SP), an important proinflammatory neuropeptide of these nerve fibers, in an in vivo mouse model of liver inflammation. Liver injury was induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in D-galactosamine (GalN)-sensitized mice. Depletion of primary afferent nerve fibers by neonatal capsaicin treatment down-regulated circulating levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) and protected mice from GalN/LPS-induced liver injury. Likewise, pretreatment of mice with antagonists of the SP-specific neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), i.e., (2S,3S)-cis-2-(diphenylmethyl)-N-((2-methoxyphenyl)-methyl)-1-azabicyclo(2.2.2.)-octan-3-amine (CP-96,345) and (2S,3S)3-([3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methoxy)-2-phenylpiperidine (L-733,060), dose dependently protected mice from GalN/LPS-induced liver injury. The presence of the NK-1R in the murine liver was demonstrated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, sequence analysis, and immunocytochemistry. NK-1R blockade reduced inflammatory liver damage, i.e., edema formation, neutrophil infiltration, hepatocyte apoptosis, and necrosis. To get further insight into the mechanism by which receptor blockade attenuated GalN/LPS-induced liver damage, we analyzed plasma levels and intrahepatic expression of TNFalpha, IFNgamma, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10. NK-1R blockade clearly inhibited GalN/LPS-induced production of TNFalpha and IFNgamma, whereas synthesis of the hepatoprotective cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 was increased. NK-1 receptor antagonists might be potent drugs for treatment of inflammatory liver disease, most likely by inhibiting SP effects.
