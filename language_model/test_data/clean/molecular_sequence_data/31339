A tetrasaccharide possessing a biosynthetically permissible structural variability in and adjacent to the antithrombin III (ATIII) binding site has been isolated from heparin lyase depolymerized bovine lung heparin by using strong anion-exchange high-pressure liquid chromatography (SAX-HPLC). On the basis of two-dimensional 500-MHz 1H NMR experiments, including phase-sensitive correlated spectroscopy (COSY) and rotating frame nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (ROESY), and fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS), the primary structure of this tetrasaccharide was unambiguously established as delta UAp2S (1----4)-alpha-D-GlcNp2S6S(1----4)-beta-D-GlcAp(1----4)-alph a-D-GlcNp2S3S6S (where delta UA represents 4-deoxy-alpha-L-threo-hex-4-enopyranosyluronic acid). The 1H NMR ROESY experiment proved to be particularly valuable in offering sequence information. Heparins from a variety of species and tissue sources were examined by oligosaccharide mapping using SAX-HPLC and gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two of these heparins are used as anticoagulants; they are porcine intestinal mucosal heparin and bovine lung heparin. The predominant ATIII-binding site in porcine heparin contained an N-acetylated glucosamine residue. We now report the structure of the predominant ATIII-binding site in bovine heparin as----4)-alpha-D-GlcNp2S6S(1----4)-beta-D-GlcAp(1----4)-alph a-D- GlcNp2S3S6S(1----4)-alpha-L-IdoAp2S(1----4)-alpha-D-GlcNp 2S6S(1----. This study shows the presence of one or both types of ATIII-binding-site variants in all of the heparins that were examined.
