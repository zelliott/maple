Inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) is an enzyme that catalyzes the production of the reactive nitrogen intermediate nitric oxide (NO). NO is an important signalling molecule, released by numerous cells, that acts in many tissues to regulate a diverse range of physiological and biological processes, including neurotransmission, immune defence and the regulation of cell death (apoptosis). NO plays a major role in the killing of intracellular pathogens as part of the innate immune response. iNOS is known to be induced by a number of stimuli including cytokines as well as pathogens and their components. As yet, a full-length bovine iNOS sequence has only been predicted from the genome, although partial sequences from cDNA are available. Here, we have identified a 3471bp transcript for bovine iNOS, isolated from RNA from bovine alveolar macrophages stimulated with the intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium bovis. When translated this gives a protein of 1156 amino acids. Bovine iNOS shows a high degree of similarity to iNOS from other species, and also shares a common protein domain structure.
