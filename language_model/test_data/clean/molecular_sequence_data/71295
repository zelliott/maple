Tissue transglutaminase is a multifunctional enzyme which has been involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Recently, nuclear localization of tTG has been reported indicating the potential of active nuclear transport. In this study we use the yeast two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation to show that tTG interacts with the nuclear transport protein importin-alpha3. Using electron microscopy we demonstrate that nuclear expression of tTG in a non-small cell lung cancer cell line is induced by retinoic acid (RA). These data suggest that importin-alpha3 could mediate active nuclear transport of tTG which may be important for the regulation of critical cellular processes.
