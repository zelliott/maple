Anginex, a designed peptide 33mer, is known to function both as an antiangiogenic and bactericidal agent. Solving the NMR solution structure of the peptide is key to understand better its structure-activity relationships and to design more bioactive peptides and peptide mimetics. However, structure elucidation of anginex has been elusive due to subunit exchange-induced resonance broadening. Here, we found that performing NMR structural studies in a micellar environment abolishes exchange broadening and allows the structure of anginex to be determined. Anginex folds in an amphipathic, three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet conformation with functionally key hydrophobic residues lying on one face of the beta-sheet and positively charged, mostly lysine residues, lying on the opposite face. Structural comparison is made with a homologous, yet relatively inactive peptide, betapep-28. These results contribute to the design of peptidomimetics of anginex for therapeutic use against angiogenically-related diseases like cancer, as well as infectious diseases.
