Two MADS-box genes, MdMADS3 and MdMADS4, were isolated from the apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.) cultivar Fuji, and their spatial and temporal expression patterns were studied during morphological differentiation of the flower buds and the fruits. Both MdMADS3 and MdMADS4 showed high sequence similarities to FBP2 from petunia, TM5 from tomato, and AGL2, AGL4 from Arabidopsis. Although MdMADS3 was expressed in the inner three whorls of the floral primordium, its expression was hardly detectable in developing fruit. The second gene, MdMADS4, was ubiquitously expressed in the inflorescence meristem, floral meristem, all four floral organs, and fruit. Moreover, MdMADS4 expression was high in the vascular bundles assigned to the floral tube and the carpellary vascular bundles in fruit at early developmental stages. The MdMADS4 transcript also accumulated in embryos of the developing seeds. These results suggest that MdMADS3 and MdMADS4 are involved in different functions, and that MdMADS4 may function in the important events controlling flower and fruit development.
