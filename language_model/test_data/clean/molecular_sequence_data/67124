Although the role of Mycoplasma wenyonii in disease is still subject to some debate, infections have been reported to result in parasitaemia, anaemia, scrotal and hind limb oedema, tachycardia, pyrexia, infertility, swollen teats, prefemoral lymphadenopathy and decreased milk production. Previously, diagnosis of M. wenyonii has been based on blood smears but is not specific for M. wenyonii and can be difficult to interpret. We have previously described the use of PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) for the detection and differentiation of Mycoplasma species. DGGE enables the rapid and specific identification of Mycoplasma species and is ideally suited to detecting both mixed infections and new and unusual species. In this study, we have used DGGE with universal primers to detect M. wenyonii DNA from blood samples. DGGE can be used on blood samples as a rapid and specific test for M. wenyonii and can also be used as a screening test for other blood borne pathogens.
