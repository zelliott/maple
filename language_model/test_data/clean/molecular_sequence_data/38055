1H-(13)C one-bond dipolar coupling values were measured for natural abundance samples of the human milk oligosaccharides "lacto-N-fucopentaose" (LNF-1 LNF-2, and LNF-3), "lacto-N-difucohexaose" (LND-1), "lacto-N-tetraose" (LNT), and "lacto-N-neo-tetraose" (LNnT), four of which have Lewis blood group epitopes. Each oligosaccharide was dissolved in a 7.5% solution of 1, 2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1, 2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC/DHPC) bicelle liquid crystals oriented in the NMR magnetic field. The dipolar coupling data and NOE were fitted to conformational models with calculations of an optimum orientation tensor which best represents the dipolar coupling values for a fragment hypothesized to adopt a single conformation. In the case of LNF-1, LNF-2, LNF-3, and LND-1, the models confirm previous conformational models for the Lewis epitopes based on NOE and molecular dynamics simulations. Extensions of the model provided new structural data for the remaining residues. In all cases, upper limits for the errors in the glycosidic angles of the models were estimated. Since residual dipolar coupling provides information on long-range order, it is a valuable complement to other types of NMR data such as NOE and scalar coupling for exploring conformations of complex oligosaccharides.
