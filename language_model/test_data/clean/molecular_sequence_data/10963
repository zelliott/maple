The complete amino acid sequence of the unusual diheme split-Soret cytochrome c from the sulphate-reducing Desulfovibrio desulfuricans strain ATCC 27774 has been determined using classical chemical sequencing techniques and mass spectrometry. The 247-residue sequence shows almost no similarity with any other known diheme cytochrome c, but the heme-binding site of the protein is similar to that of the cytochromes c3 from the sulphate reducers. The cytochrome-c-like domain of the protein covers only the C-terminal part of the molecule, and there is evidence for at least one more domain containing four cysteine residues, which might bind another cofactor, possibly a non-heme iron-containing cluster. This domain is similar to a sequence fragment of the genome of Archaeoglobus fulgidus, which confirms the high conservation of the genes involved in sulfate reduction.
