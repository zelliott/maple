We converted the small homodimeric four-helix bundle repressor of primer protein (Rop) into a monomeric four-helix bundle by introduction of connecting loops. Both left- and right-handed four-helix bundles were produced. The left-handed bundles were more stable and were used to introduce biologically interesting peptides in one of the loops.
