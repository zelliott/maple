Some of the early genes of Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SPO1 were hypothesized to function in the shutoff of host biosyntheses. Two of these genes, e3 and e22, were cloned and sequenced. E22 showed no similarity to any known protein, while E3, a highly acidic protein, showed significant similarity only to other similarly acidic proteins. Each gene was immediately downstream of a very active early promoter. Each was expressed actively during the first few minutes of infection and was then rapidly shut off and its RNA rapidly degraded. An e3 nonsense mutation severely retarded the degradation of e3 RNA. Expression of a plasmid-borne e3 gene, in either B. subtilis or Escherichia coli, resulted in the inhibition of host DNA, RNA, and protein syntheses and prevented colony formation. However, the e3 nonsense mutation caused no measurable decrease in either burst size or host shutoff during infection and, in fact, caused an increased burst size at high multiplicities of infection. We suggest that e3 is one of several genes involved in host shutoff, that its function is dispensable both for host shutoff and for phage multiplication, and that its shutoff function is not entirely specific to host activities.
