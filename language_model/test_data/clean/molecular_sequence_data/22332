RNA molecules and in particular the nuclear SSU RNA play an important role in molecular systematics. With the advent of increasingly parameterized substitution models in systematic research, the incorporation of secondary-structure information became a realistic option compensating interdependence of character variation. As a prerequisite, consensus structures of eukaryotic SSU RNA molecules have become available through extensive comparative analyses and crystallographic studies. Despite extensive research in hexapod phylogenetics, consensus SSU RNA secondary structures focusing on hexapods have not yet been explored. In this study, we compiled a representative hexapod SSU data set of 261 sequences and inferred a specific consensus SSU secondary-structure model. Our search for conserved structural motives relied on a combined approach of thermodynamic and covariation analyses. The hexapod consensus-structure model deviates from the canonical eukaryotic model in a number of helices. Additionally, in several helices the hexapod sequences did not support a single consensus structure. We provide consensus structures of these sections of single less-inclusive taxa, thus facilitating the adaptation of the consensus hexapod model to less-inclusive phylogenetic questions. The secondary-structure catalog will foster the application of RNA structure models in phylogenetic analyses using the SSU rRNA molecule, and it will improve the realism of substitution models and the reliability of reconstructions based on rRNA sequences.
