The histone H4 multigene family of Physarum polycephalum consists of two genes, H41 and H42. Both genes have an unusual structure in that they are interrupted by a small intron. The structure of the P. polycephalum H4 genes is discussed and compared to the structure of histone genes of other organisms. S1 nuclease analysis was used to map the 5' and 3' ends of the histone H4 messengers. We show that the histone H4 genes have a hybrid structure; they are interrupted by an intervening sequence, as in replacement variant histone genes of higher eukaryotes, but their 5' and 3' noncoding regions have the properties of replication-dependent histone genes: the 5' and 3' leader and trailer sequences are short, possess a 3'-hyphenated dyad symmetry element, and a CAGA sequence is found 3' to the hyphenated hairpin structure. This report also provides evidence that both genes are expressed in late G2 phase as well as in S phase and that their expression is temporally coordinated and quantitatively similar during the cell cycle.
