Carbohydrate binding proteins, or lectins, are engendered with the ability to bind specific carbohydrate structures, thereby mediating cell-cell and cell-pathogen interactions. Lectins are distinct from carbohydrate modifying enzymes and antibodies, respectively, as they do not carry out glycosidase or glycosyl transferase reactions, and they are of nonimmune origin. Cyanobacterial and algal lectins have become prominent in recent years due to their unique biophysical traits, such as exhibiting novel protein folds and unusually high carbohydrate affinity, and ability to potently inhibit HIV-1 entry through high affinity carbohydrate-mediated interactions with the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120. The antiviral cyanobacterial lectin Microcystis viridis lectin (MVL), which contains two high affinity oligomannose binding sites, is one such example. Here we used glycan microarray profiling, NMR spectroscopy, and mutagenesis to show that one of the two oligomannose binding sites of MVL can catalyze the cleavage of chitin fragments (such as chitotriose) to GlcNAc, to determine the mode of MVL binding to and cleavage of chitotriose, to identify Asp75 as the primary catalytic residue involved in this cleavage, and to solve the solution structure of an inactive mutant of MVL in complex with this unexpected substrate. These studies represent the first demonstration of dual catalytic activity and carbohydrate recognition for discrete oligosaccharides at the same carbohydrate-binding site in a lectin. Sequence comparisons between the N- and C-domains of MVL, together with the sequences of new MVL homologues identified through bioinformatics, provide insight into the evolving roles of carbohydrate recognition.
