The Mycobacterium bovis bacilli Calmette-Guerin (BCG) pcp gene that encodes the pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase (Pcp) was cloned from a lambdagtll genomic library and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence contains a 669 bp open reading frame coding for a protein of 222 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 23,209 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence is highly homologous to the Pcps from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. A multiple sequence alignment revealed highly conserved domains. The BCG pcp gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The Pcp was purified to homogeneity. The recombinant protein was further confirmed by an enzymatic assay.
