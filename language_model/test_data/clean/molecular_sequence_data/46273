An amber-pigmented, Gram-negative, rod-shaped and aerobic bacterial strain devoid of flagella, designated strain JC2131(T) , was isolated from tidal flat sediment of Dongmak in Ganghwa island, South Korea. Identification was carried out on the basis of polyphasic taxonomy. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the isolate belonged to the family Flavobacteriaceae and showed the highest sequence similarity of 94.5% with Lutibacter litoralis KCCM 42118(T). The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C(15:0) (25.9%), iso-C(15:0) 3-OH (20.0%) and iso-C(13:0) (12.7%). Flexirubin-type pigments were absent. The major isoprenoid quinone was MK-6. The DNA G+C content was 43.7 mol%. Several phenotypic and chemotaxonomic properties including growth at pH 6, sea salts requirement, aesculin hydrolysis, carbon utilization, DNA G+C content and fatty acid profiles also differentiated the strain from the related members of the family. Therefore, results from the polyphasic taxonomy study suggested that strain JC2131(T) represents a novel genus and species in the family Flavobacteriaceae for which the name Marinitalea sucinacia gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed (type strain JC2131(T)=KCTC 12705(T)=JCM 14003(T)).
