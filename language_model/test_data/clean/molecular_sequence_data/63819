Phytochemical investigation of the fruits of Cucurbita pepo cv dayangua led to the isolation of cucurbitaglycosides A (1) and B (2). This is the first report of cucurbitane triterpenoids with a purine unit. Their structures were elucidated mainly based on interpretation of HRESIMS results, as well as 1D and 2D NMR spectra. Cucurbitaglycosides A and B showed cytotoxic activity against the human epithelial carcinoma cell line HeLa with IC50 of 17.2 and 28.4 microg/mL, respectively.
