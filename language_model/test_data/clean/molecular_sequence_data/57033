The human CRF-binding protein gene has been cloned and mapped to the distal region of chromosome 13 and loci 5q in the mouse and human genomes, respectively. The gene consists of 7 exons and 6 introns. The mature protein has 10 cysteines and 5 tandem disulfide bridges 4 of which are contained within exons 3, 5, 6, and 7. One bridge is shared by exons 3 and 4. The signal peptide and the first 3 amino acids of the mature protein were coded for by an extreme 5' exon. Primer extension analyses revealed the transcriptional initiation site to be located 32 bp downstream from a consensus TATA box. The promoter sequence contained a number of putative promoter elements including an AP-1 site, three ER-half sites, the immunoglobulin enhancer elements NF-kappa B and INF-1, and the liver-specific enhancers LFA1 and LFB1.
