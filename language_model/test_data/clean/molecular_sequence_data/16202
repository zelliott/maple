Two anti-phenyloxazolone (phOx3) and one anti-GAT MAbs from C57BL mice are shown to be coded by VH gene 186.2. This gene has been found earlier to code for several anti-NP (NNP) antibodies (Bothwell et al., 1981) and anti-GT antibodies (Rocca-Serra et al., 1983; Carmack and Pincus, 1986). The L chain partner of the VH 186.2 gene is different in anti-NP and anti-GAT antibodies (Bothwell et al., 1981; Rocca-Serra et al., 1983; Carmack and Pincus, 1986); in anti-phOx antibodies two new unrelated kappa chain V regions were found. Both of the new VK genes involved code frequently for anti-phOx antibodies in BALB/c mice but then with different VH genes. We tested five 186.2-coded antibodies for cross-reactions. Four antibodies were specific, one bound only to NNP, one only to phOx and two only to GT (GAT). The fifth antibody (anti-phOx) bound also to NNP, GAT and ABA-HOP though probably with a low affinity. This is the first demonstration that one V gene can code for three different antibody specificities. It emphasizes the role of the combinatorial element in antibody diversity.
