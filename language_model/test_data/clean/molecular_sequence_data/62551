Tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) is transmitted by aphids in a non-persistent manner with the assistance of a virus-encoded protein known as helper component (HC-Pro). To produce a biologically active form of recombinant TEV HC-Pro protein, heterologous expression in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris was used. A cDNA encoding the TEV HC-Pro region, fused to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-mating factor secretory peptide coding region, was inserted into the P. pastoris genome using a modified version of the pPIC9 vector. The expressed TEV HC-Pro protein was obtained directly from culture medium of recombinant yeast colonies; it was able to interact with TEV particles in a protein overlay binding assay, and also to assist aphid transmission of purified TEV particles to plants using the aphid Myzus persicae as vector. Our results indicate that P. pastoris provides a rapid and low-cost heterologous expression system that can be used to obtain biologically active potyvirus HC-Pro protein for in vitro transmission assays.
