A method has been developed for the extraction from transformed Escherichia coli cells of methionyl bovine PRL (met-bPRL) in a relatively pure form. While the extracted met-bPRL was as reactive as the native hormone with respect to polyclonal anti-bPRL antibodies, its bioactivity, as measured by the Nb2 lactogen in vitro bioassay, was relatively low. The bioactivity of the met-bPRL could be increased to the same order as that of the native hormone by treatment with a mixture of oxidized and reduced thioredoxin. A number of variant met-bPRLs containing specific amino acid changes have been generated by site-specific mutagenesis. The changes involved the substitution (or deletion) of some of the conserved amino acids in bPRL by the different amino acids present at the corresponding positions in the related, but nonlactogenic bovine GH. Nine mutants containing single amino acid changes had bio- and immunoactivities of the same order as those of met-bPRL. One mutant, which incorporated two of the single amino acid changes (serine 62 to threonine and threonine 65 to alanine), had immunoactivity approximating that of met-bPRL but much lower bioactivity (45%). A further mutant, generated by the deletion of tyrosine 28, had essentially no bioactivity although it could not be distinguished immunologically from met-bPRL or bPRL. The findings are discussed in the light of the putative three-dimensional PRL structure and current hypotheses which seek to relate specific regions of PRL to lactogenic activity. It appears that the first putative alpha-helix of bPRL is important for the binding and mitogenic activity of the hormone.
