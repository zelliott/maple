We investigated the molecular forms of endothelin (ET) related peptides in porcine spinal cord by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with radioimmunoassays using three antisera raised against ET-1 and C-terminal fragments of ET-1 and big ET-1. ET-1 and its oxidized form were isolated as major immunoreactive peptides and sequenced. Furthermore, immunoreactivities like ET-3 and big ET-1(22-39) (contents: less than 8% and less than 1% of ET-1, respectively) were detected based on their chromatographic retention times and characteristics of immunoreactivity to the antisera. Big ET-1 was only scarcely detected. Immunohistochemical study showed the presence of ET-1-like immunoreactivity in motoneurons, dorsal horn neurons and dot- and fiber-like structures in the dorsal horn of lumbar spinal cord. These results indicate that ET-1 is present not only in endothelial cells but also in spinal cord, and that big ET-1 is converted into ET-1 in spinal cord by specific processing between Trp21-Val22. The data also indicate that ET-1 may act as a neuropeptide in the central nervous system.
