Gene tagging can be achieved by homologous recombination in yeast. The kan(r) marker gene plays an important role in PCR-mediated gene disruption and PCR-mediated epitope tagging experiments. In this paper, new modules containing a tag-loxP-kanMX-loxP cassette are described that allow tagging of different genes by using the kan(r) marker repeatedly.
