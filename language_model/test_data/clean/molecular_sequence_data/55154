A novel bacterial strain, designated T-Y1(T), capable of degrading a variety of polysaccharides was isolated from seawater of an oyster farm in the South Sea, Korea. It was found to be aerobic, Gram-negative, non-flagellated, non-gliding and rod-shaped. Strain T-Y1(T) grew optimally at 25 Â°C, at pH 7.0-7.5 and in the presence of 2 % (w/v) NaCl. A neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain T-Y1(T) belonged to the genus Winogradskyella. Strain T-Y1(T) exhibited 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of 95.0-96.8 % to the type strains of recognized Winogradskyella species and less than 94.5 % to other validly named species. The chemotaxonomic data concurred with the phylogenetic inference. Strain T-Y1(T) contained MK-6 as the predominant menaquinone and anteiso-C(15:0), iso-C(15:0), iso-C(15:1) G and iso-C(16:0) 3-OH as the major fatty acids. The major polar lipids of strain T-Y1(T) were phosphatidylethanolamine and two unidentified lipids. The DNA G+C content was 36.2 mol%. Differential phenotypic properties, together with its phylogenetic distinctiveness, enabled strain T-Y1(T) to be differentiated from the recognized Winogradskyella species. On the basis of the data presented here, strain T-Y1(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Winogradskyella, for which the name Winogradskyella multivorans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is T-Y1(T) (=KCTC 23891(T) = CCUG 62216(T)).
