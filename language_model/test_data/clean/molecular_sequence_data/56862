The data on the structure and properties of outer membrane lipopolysaccharides of gram-negative bacteria are reviewed with special reference to the general organization of the lipopolysaccharide molecule and the structure of the lipid moiety (lipid A). The correlation between the structure of the lipopolysaccharides and lipid A and their biological properties and functions are discussed.
