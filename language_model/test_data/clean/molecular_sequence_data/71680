A cDNA clone encoding a protein (CuCOR19), the sequence of which is similar to Poncirus COR19, of the dehydrin family was isolated from the epicarp of Citrus unshiu. The molecular mass of the predicted protein was 18,980 daltons. CuCOR19 was highly hydrophilic and contained three repeating elements including Lys-rich motifs. The gene expression in leaves increased by cold stress.
