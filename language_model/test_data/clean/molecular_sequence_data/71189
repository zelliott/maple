To identify genes induced by transient forebrain ischemia, we used the mRNA differential display technique in the four-vessel occlusion model in rats. Some genes were identified as candidates that encode ischemia-responsive protein, and one of them was cloned as ischemia-responsive protein 94 kDa (irp94) from the rat hippocampal cDNA library. Sequence analysis suggested that rat irp94 was a transcriptional variant or a homologue of mouse apg-2 and human heat shock protein (hsp) 70RY and a member of the HSP110 family, because IRP94 was >90% identical to APG-2 and HSP70RY and approximately 60% identical to the other members of the HSP110 family. Although irp94 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the normal hippocampus, it was clearly enhanced 4-24 h after ischemia for 10 (1.9-fold increase) and 15 min (3.4-fold increase). These changes mainly occurred in neuronal cells, as judged by the localization of irp94 mRNA using in situ hybridization histochemistry. On the other hand, hyperthermic stress did not enhance irp94 mRNA expression, suggesting that irp94 expression was enhanced under ischemic stress and not related to the heat shock signaling mechanism. Our study suggested that irp94, a novel member of the HSP110 family, might play an important role in the environment altering neuronal functions, especially after transient forebrain ischemia.
