Seminal vesicle proteins (SVPs) are made by male rodents, and form the copulatory plug following mating. Here we report a partial nucleotide sequence of a mouse clone homologous to rat SVP F. Unexpectedly, we found that SVP F-related transcripts are expressed at high levels in mouse skeletal muscle. We mapped mouse SVP F to mouse chromosome 15 using somatic cell hybrid lines.
