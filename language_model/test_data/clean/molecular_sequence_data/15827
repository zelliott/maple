Human saliva contains at least three molecular species of cystatin S-type cysteine proteinase inhibitor (cystatin S, cystatin SN and cystatin SA), which have similar but distinct amino-acid sequences. The nucleotide sequences of the CST 1 gene for cystatin SN and the CST 2 gene for cystatin SA are highly homologous to each other and to the corresponding regions of the cDNA for cystatin C and the EcoRI-PstI fragment from the cystatin C gene. Three cystatin-like domains in the kininogen gene and the salivary cystatin genes share the same gene organizations. These data demonstrate that family II cystatin genes are evolutionarily related to family III cystatin genes.
