A Gram-positive, non-motile, rod-shaped bacterium strain NIO-1018(T) isolated from a mangrove sediment sample of the Chorao Island, Goa, India, was subjected to a detailed polyphasic taxonomic study. The strain designated as NIO-1018(T) matched with most of the phenotypic and chemotaxonomic properties of the genus Agromyces and represents a novel species. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain NIO-1018(T) fell within the cluster comprising species of the genus Agromyces, clustering with Agromyces soli (98.1 %), Agromyces flavus (97.9 %), Agromyces aurantiacus (97.7 %) and Agromyces ulmi (97.3 %). The predominant menaquinone was MK-12, and the major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C(15:0), iso-C(16:0), anteiso-C(17:0) and iso-C(15:0). The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain NIO-1018(T) was 71.8 mol%. The combination of phylogenetic analysis, DNA-DNA relatedness, phenotypic characteristics and chemotaxonomic data supported the view that strain NIO-1018(T) represents a novel species of the genus Agromyces, for which the name Agromyces indicus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NIO-1018 (=JCM 17573(T) = CCTCC AB2011122(T)).
