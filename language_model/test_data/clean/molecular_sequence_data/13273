The DNA fragment (3.3 kb) containing the erythromycin resistance determinant was cloned from Escherichia coli Tf481A and sequenced. Deletion and complementation analyses indicated that the expression of high-level resistance to erythromycin requires two genes, mphA and mrx, which encode macrolide 2'-phosphotransferase I and an unidentified hydrophobic protein, respectively.
