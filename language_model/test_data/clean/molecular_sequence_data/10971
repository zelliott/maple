Bothrojaracin is a potent and selective thrombin inhibitor that has been isolated from the venom of Bothrops jararaca. It does not interact with the catalytic site of the enzyme but binds to both anion-binding exosites 1 and 2 resulting in a potent inhibition of thrombin activity towards fibrinogen and platelets [Zingali, R. B., Jandrot-Perrus, M., Guillin, M. C. & Bon, C. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 10794-108021. Bothrojaracin is a 27-kDa protein composed of two disulfide-linked polypeptide chains, A and B, of 15 kDa and 13 kDa, respectively. The sequences of A and B chains determined by molecular cloning exhibit a high degree of identity with other snake venom lectin-like proteins. In contrast to other ligands that interact with thrombin exosite 1, the amino acid sequence of bothrojaracin does not contain an acidic sequence similar to the C-terminal tail of hirudin. Expression of functional bothrojaracin was achieved in COS cells upon transfection with two pcDNA3 vectors containing the complete cDNAs. Recombinant bothrojaracin, which was secreted into the medium, was able to bind to and inhibit thrombin. When expressed alone, the B chain formed inactive dimers that were secreted into the culture medium. In contrast, no bothrojaracin-related protein was detected in conditioned media from cells transfected with the A chain.
