Mutations in the SPT3, SPT7, SPT8 and SPT15 genes define one class of trans-acting mutations that are strong suppressors of insertion mutations caused by Ty elements or by the Ty long terminal repeat sequence, delta. These SPT genes are required for normal transcription of Ty elements, and their gene products are believed to be involved in initiation of Ty transcription from delta sequences. We have isolated and analyzed extragenic suppressors of spt3 mutations. These new mutations, named rsp, partially suppress the requirement for SPT3, SPT7, SPT8 and SPT15 functions. In addition, rsp mutations cause changes in transcription of some delta insertions in an SPT+ genetic background. Interactions between mutations in the four identified RSP genes show a number of interesting genetic properties, including the failure of unlinked rsp mutations to complement for recessive phenotypes. Cloning and sequencing of one rsp mutant gene, rsp4-27, showed that it encodes a frameshift suppressor glycine tRNA. Our results indicate that the other three RSP genes also encode frameshift suppressor glycine tRNAs. In addition, other types of frameshift suppressor glycine tRNAs can confer some Rsp- phenotypes.
