Two regions in the gene coding for 16S rRNA in Rhodococcus equi were selected as species-specific primer sequences for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR using these primers was tested against 10 strains of R. equi (including the type strain) and gave positive results for all but was negative for all other tested species of Rhodococcus; representatives of the most closely related genera and a number of other bacterial species. This method could therefore be used to identify this species which can infect the lungs or other organs of horses, pigs, humans and other animals.
