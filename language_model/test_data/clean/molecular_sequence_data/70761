In fission yeast protein kinase C homologues (Pck1 and Pck2) are essential for cell morphogenesis. We have isolated mok1(+) in a genetic screen to identify downstream effectors for Pck1/2. mok1(+) is essential for viability and encodes a protein that has several membrane-spanning domains and regions homologous to glucan metabolic enzymes. mok1 mutant shows abnormal cell shape, randomization of F-actin and weak cell wall. Biochemical analysis shows that Mok1 appears to have alpha-glucan synthase activity. Mok1 localization undergoes dramatic alteration during the cell cycle. It localizes to the growing tips in interphase, the medial ring upon mitosis, a double ring before and dense dot during cytokinesis. Double immunofluorescence staining shows that Mok1 exists in close proximity to actin. The subcellular localization of Mok1 is dependent upon the integrity of the F-actin cytoskeleton. Conversely, overexpression of mok1(+) blocks the translocation of cortical actin from one end of the cell to the other. pck2 mutant is synthetically lethal with mok1 mutant, delocalizes Mok1 and shows a lower level of alpha-glucan. These results indicate that Mok1 plays a crucial role in cell morphogenesis interdependently of the actin cytoskeleton and works as one of downstream effectors for Pck1/2.
