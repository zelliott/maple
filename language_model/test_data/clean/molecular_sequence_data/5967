Consensus degenerate primers specific for the L1 and E1 regions were used to amplify anogenital HPV-DNA fragments. The mixture of the viral fragments was then directly sequenced with HPV-6, -11, -16, -18 and -33 type-specific computer-designed oligonucleotides as sequencing primers. The linking of a consensus primer-generated PCR amplification with type-specific primer-mediated direct sequencing and computer data bank analysis provided precise, more objective viral detection in the simultaneous presence of different HPV types. The method was successfully adapted for viral typing in clinical lesions which simultaneously contained different anogenital HPV sequences.
