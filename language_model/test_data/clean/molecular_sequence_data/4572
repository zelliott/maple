pp125 focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase transducing signals initiated by integrin engagement and G protein-coupled receptors, is highly expressed in brain. FAK from brain had a higher molecular weight and an increased autophosphorylation activity, than from other tissues. In addition to a 9-base insertion in the 3'-coding region, which defines FAK+, rat striatal FAK mRNAs contained several additional short exons, coding for peptides of 28, 6, and 7 residues, respectively (termed boxes 28, 6, and 7), surrounding the autophosphorylated Tyr-397. In transfected COS 7 cells, the presence of boxes 6 and 7 conferred an increased overall tyrosine phosphorylation, a higher phosphorylation of Tyr-397 assessed with a phosphorylation state-specific antibody, and a more active autophosphorylation in immune precipitates. The presence of box 28 did not alter further these parameters. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps of hippocampal FAK were identical to those of FAK+6,7. The presence of the various exons did not alter the interaction of FAK with c-Src, n-Src, or Fyn. Thus, several splice isoforms of FAK are preferentially expressed in rat brain, some of which have an increased autophosphorylation activity, suggesting that FAK may have specific properties in neurons.
