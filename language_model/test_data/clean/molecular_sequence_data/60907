The SM30a gene encodes a protein in the embryonic endoskeleton of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and is specifically expressed in the skeletogenic primary mesenchyme cell lineage. To clarify the mechanism for the differentiation of this cell lineage, which proceeds rather autonomously in the embryo, regulation of the SM30alpha gene was investigated previously and it was shown that the distal DNA region upstream of this gene from - 1.6 to - 1.0 kb contained numerous negative regulatory elements that suppressed the ectopic expression of the gene in the gut. Here we study the influence of the proximal region from - 303 to + 104 bp. Analysis of the expression of reporter constructs indicated that a strong positive enhancer element existed in the region from -142 to -105bp. This element worked both in forward and reverse orientations and additively when placed tandemly upstream to the reporter gene. In addition, other weaker positive and negative regulatory sites were also detected throughout the proximal region. Electrophoretic gel mobility shift analyses showed that multiple nuclear proteins were bound to the putative strong enhancer region. One of the proteins binding to this region was present in ear y blastulae, a time when the SM30 gene was still silent, but it was not in prism embryos actively expressing the gene. The binding region for this blastula-specific protein was narrowed down to the region from - 132 to -122 bp, which included the consensus binding site for the mammalian proto-oncogene product, Ets. Two possible SpGCF1 binding sites were identified in the vicinity of the enhancer region. This information was used to make a comparison of the general regulatory architecture of genes that contribute to the formation of the skeletal spicule.
