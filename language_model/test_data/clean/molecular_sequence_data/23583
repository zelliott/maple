The nuclear envelope (NE) acts as a selective barrier to macromolecule trafficking between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and undergoes a complex reorganization during mitosis. Different eukaryotic kingdoms show specializations in NE function and composition. In contrast with vertebrates, the protein composition of the NE and the function of NE proteins are barely understood in plants. MFP1 attachment factor 1 (MAF1) is a plant-specific NE-associated protein first identified in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). Here, we demonstrate that two Arabidopsis thaliana MAF1 homologs, WPP1 and WPP2, are associated with the NE specifically in undifferentiated cells of the root tip. Reentry into cell cycle after callus induction from differentiated root segments reprograms their NE association. Based on green fluorescent protein fusions and immunogold labeling data, the proteins are associated with the outer NE and the nuclear pores in interphase cells and with the immature cell plate during cytokinesis. RNA interference-based suppression of the Arabidopsis WPP family causes shorter primary roots, a reduced number of lateral roots, and reduced mitotic activity of the root meristem. Together, these data demonstrate the existence of regulated NE targeting in plants and identify a class of plant-specific NE proteins involved in mitotic activity.
