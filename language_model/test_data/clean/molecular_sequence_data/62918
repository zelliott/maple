We report here the existence of interactions between a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Rad6, from rice, Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare (OsRad6), and Sgt1 (OsSgt1), a novel subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. Rad6 is not only related to post-replicational repair but also to the proteasome system, while Sgt1 has a function in kinetochore assembly. The relationship between the two is unexpected, but of great interest. The open reading frames of OsRad6 and OsSgt1 encode predicted products of 152 and 367 amino acid residues, respectively, with molecular weights of 17.3 and 40.9kDa. Two-hybrid and pull-down analyses indicated that OsRad6 binds to OsSgt1, and transcripts of both OsRad6 and OsSgt1 were found to be strongly expressed only in the proliferating tissues such as the shoot apical meristem, suggesting that their expression is cell cycle-dependent. The amount of the Rad6 mRNA in cultured cells increased rapidly after division was halted, and mRNA levels of Rad6 and Sgt1 were induced by UV- and DNA-damaging agents such as MMS or H(2)O(2). The Rad6 pathway for repair or the proteasome system may thus require Sgt1 as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme.
