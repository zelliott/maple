A new type of alkylating derivatives of oligonucleotides with 4(N-methyl-N-2-chloroethylamino)benzyl (RCl) group at C-5 of deoxyuridine with a high extent of the target modification was prepared. The synthesized reagents d(ULNHRClCCACTT), where L = CH2 (Ia), CH2OCH2CH2 (Ib) and CH2NHCOCH2CH2 (Ic), proved to effectively (80-90%) modify the oligonucleotide d(TAAGTGGAGTTTGGC). The reagents (Ia) and (Ib) alkylate G6, G7 and G9 positions, while the reagent (Ic) modifies predominantly G9.
