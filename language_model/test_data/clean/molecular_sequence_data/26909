The gene product of open reading frame AFE_1293 from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 is annotated as encoding a sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase, an enzyme that catalyses electron transfer from sulfide to quinone. Following overexpression in Escherichia coli, the enzyme was purified and crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The native crystals belonged to the tetragonal space group P4(2)2(1)2, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 131.7, c = 208.8 A, and diffracted to 2.3 A resolution. Preliminary crystallographic analysis indicated the presence of a dimer in the asymmetric unit, with an extreme value of the Matthews coefficient (V(M)) of 4.53 A(3) Da(-1) and a solvent content of 72.9%.
