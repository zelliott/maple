In Bacillus subtilis, expression of the rocG gene, encoding glutamate dehydrogenase, and the rocABC operon, involved in arginine catabolism, requires SigL (sigma(54))-containing RNA polymerase as well as RocR, a positive regulator of the NtrC/NifA family. The RocR protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the intergenic region located between rocG and the rocABC operon. DNaseI footprinting experiments were used to define the RocR-binding site as an 8 bp inverted repeat, separated by one base pair, forming an imperfect palindrome which is present twice within the rocG-rocABC intergenic region, acting as both a downstream activating sequence (DAS) and an upstream activating sequence (UAS). Point mutations in either of these two sequences significantly lowered expression of both rocG and rocABC. This bidirectional enhancer element retained partial activity even when moved 9 kb downstream of the rocA promoter. Electron microscopy experiments indicated that an intrinsically curved region is located between the UAS/DAS region and the promoter of the rocABC operon. This curvature could facilitate interaction of RocR with sigma(54)-RNA polymerase at the rocABC promoter.
