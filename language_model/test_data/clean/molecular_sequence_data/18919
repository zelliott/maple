Cytokinins play important roles in legume-rhizobia symbiosis. Here we report isolation of six genes encoding isopentenyl transferase (IPT) from Lotus japonicus, which catalyze the rate-limiting step of cytokinin biosynthesis. The LjIPT3 gene was found to be up-regulated in infected roots and mature nodules. Histochemical analysis demonstrated expression of Pro(LjIPT3):GUS (Î²-glucuronidase) in vegetative and reproductive organs, and was especially high in the vascular bundles of roots. When inoculated with Mesorhizobium loti MAFF303099, LjIPT3 was undetectable in the nodule primordia and developing nodules, and later it was expressed only in the vascular bundles of mature nodules. In addition, knockdown of LjIPT3 (LjIPT3i) by RNA interference reduced levels of endogenous cytokinins, affected plant development and accelerated Chl degradation during dark-induced leaf senescence. Compared with the wild type, LjIPT3i plants produced fewer infection threads and nodules. In addition, expression of downstream nodulation-related transcription factor genes LjNSP1, LjNSP2 and LjNIN decreased dramatically in LjIPT3i plants. These results suggest that LjIPT3 regulates the CRE1-dependent cytokinin pathway, affecting nodule initiation and thereby influencing the number of infection threads and nodules. Detection of nitrogenase activity and observation of nodule structure showed that endogenous cytokinins are required for full development of the infected cells in mature nodules by preventing early senescence. Therefore, our results indicate that the LjIPT3 gene product is required for nodule initiation and development, and does not appear to be involved in early infection events.
