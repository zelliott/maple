An efficient method for mapping mutations is described in which hybrid genes, derived partly from mutant and partly from wild-type DNA, are obtained in vivo by homologous recombination of multiple fragments. The recombinants are formed in a strain in which their phenotypes are immediately apparent. This method was developed to identify changes that disrupt protein-protein interactions demonstrable by the two-hybrid system in yeast. However, it can be extended to any system where recombination is possible, provided an assay is available to distinguish between mutant and wild-type phenotypes.
