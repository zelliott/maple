Analysis of a DNA beta satellite associated with a recently identified cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD) strain indicated it to be recombinant, with most of the molecule originating from CLCuD DNA beta but with some sequence from a satellite isolated from tomato. Analysis of both archival (pre 2001) and recent cotton samples, shows the recombinant satellite is confined to a small area but was not present in cotton prior to 2001. This indicates that the recombinant DNA beta was recently mobilized into cotton, likely from tomato, and that recombination plays a role in the evolution of these satellites.
