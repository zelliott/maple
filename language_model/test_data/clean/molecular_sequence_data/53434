To study genetic variation and molecular epidemiology of the G protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 253 strains from a children's hospital in Korea over 9 consecutive epidemics were analyzed. Restriction analysis of the entire G protein gene demonstrated 24 genotypes among 188 subgroup A and 6 among 65 subgroup B isolates. Two to 4 dominant genotypes of subgroup A cocirculated, and different genotypes predominated in each epidemic. Predominant genotypes were replaced with new genotypes during consecutive epidemics. One of 2 dominant genotypes among subgroup B predominated alternately or concurrently. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that there were multiple lineages, with clustering related to their location and time of isolation among strains from Korea and worldwide. Geographic and temporal distinction have been shown more clearly for subgroup B than subgroup A. These results suggest that the G protein of RSV is continuously evolving, with a distinct pattern presumably due to immune selection in a localized region over time.
