A new family of Pneumocystis carinii genes (called MSR for MSG-related) that encodes peptides related to the major surface glycoprotein (MSG) is described. Members of the MSR sequence family are linked to MSG genes and are located near the ends of at least 13 chromosomes. Transcripts encoding different MSR isoforms were present in a single population of P. carinii f. sp. carinii, showing that multiple MSR genes were expressed. Two size classes of MSR mRNA, 2.4 and 3.5 kb, were detected. Both sizes of MSR mRNA lacked the upstream conserved sequence (UCS), which is found on the 5' end of MSG mRNAs because MSG genes must be linked to the UCS to be transcribed. The absence of the UCS from MSR mRNAs suggests that expression of MSR genes does not require linkage to the UCS locus.
