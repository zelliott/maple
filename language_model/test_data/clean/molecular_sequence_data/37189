Current cyclosporin (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506) monitoring methods are based on blood concentrations determination, but the optimal sampling times are not clearly defined. An alternative pharmacodynamic approach has recently been introduced, based on assaying lymphocytes activity of calcineurin (PP2B), a phosphatase that is partially inhibited by CsA and FK506. However, the princeps method uses large amounts of radioactive [32P]substrate, raising a number of safety issues. Here we describe an alternative method for PP2B activity determination, based on HPLC coupled with spectrophotometric detection. A 19-amino-acid peptide is phosphorylated by a protein kinase, and further dephosphorylated by lymphocyte PP2B in the presence of okadaic acid. The two peptides are separated by using reverse-phase chromatography with a detection wavelength of 205 nm. After lymphocyte isolation by density-gradient centrifugation, PP2B activity is derived from the dephosphorylated peptide concentration measured during the first 6 min of the enzymatic reaction. This technique gives reproducible results and good analytical sensitivity with 10(6) lymphocytes. With an average isolation rate of 59.6%, only 7 ml of blood is required, making the method suitable for lymphopenic patients. Moreover, PP2B activity is stable in blood samples kept for 24h at room temperature and in isolated lymphocytes stored for 48 h at -20 degrees C. We validated the method by comparing median PP2B activity in 10 healthy volunteers (285.0+/-46.5 pmol/min/10(6)lymphocytes) and in 10 liver transplant patients (147.8+/-71.0 pmol/min/10(6)lymphocytes) (p<0.001). The relation between calcineurin activity and tacrolimus blood concentrations was also studied.
