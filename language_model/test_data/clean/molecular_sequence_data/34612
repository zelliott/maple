Penicillium dravuni is a new monoverticillate, sclerotium-forming species that was isolated from the alga Dictyosphaeria versluyii collected in Dravuni, Fiji. This species morphologically is similar to P. turbatum in the P. turbatum subseries of the P. thomii series of the Monoverticillata. The nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region exhibited 97% sequence similarity to known Penicillium spp. in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that P. dravuni is related most closely to Eupenicillium brefeldianum, E. levitum, E. reticulosporum, E. javanicum, E. ehrlichii and PF simplicissimum. However this new species shares only a distant ancestor with this clade because it branches by itself early in the lineage. P. dravuni also is known to produce the secondary metabolites dictyosphaeric acids A and B and carviolin.
