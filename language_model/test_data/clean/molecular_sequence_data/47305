The complete nucleotide sequences of both RNAs of oat golden stripe virus (OGSV) and a wheat-infecting furovirus isolate from France, previously thought to be soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV), have been determined. Both viruses had a similar genomic organisation to SBWMV and Chinese wheat mosaic virus, the two other furoviruses previously sequenced but had <70% nucleotides identical to them. The French isolate has been named European wheat mosaic virus (EWMV). Phylogenetic analyses supported the recognition of these isolates as distinct viruses in the genus Furovirus. Analysis of the coat protein readthrough domain on RNA2 of all furoviruses strongly predicts two mutually compatible conserved transmembrane domains that may be significant for fungus transmission. The second of these regions is eliminated by a deletion in the isolate of OGSV studied. Leaky opal (UGA) stop codons occur on both RNAs of all four furoviruses characterised and, in common with most other leaky opal codons identified in plant viruses, they are followed by a CGG codon.
