Parallel simultaneous synthesis of fifty linear peptides has been carried out in order to compare in detail two promising methodologies of simultaneous multiple peptide synthesis (SMPS): the "T bag" method, utilizing 4-methyl-benzhydrylamine resin (MeBHA), and synthesis on derivatized Fmoc-Gly-O-cotton fabric strips. The basic set of experiments, which utilizes identical Fmoc/Bu(t) strategy for both approaches, shows that the peptides synthesized on cotton are superior in purity to those synthesized using T bags. In experiments utilizing Boc/Bzl strategy in T bags, the purities of peptides were higher than in the case of peptides synthesized in T bags by Fmoc/Bu(t) strategy, and comparable with the purities achieved in synthesis performed on cotton. The lower yields on cotton are caused by mechanical losses in the given experimental arrangement.
