Activator of G-protein signaling 3 (AGS3) and LGN have a similar domain structure and contain four G-protein regulatory motifs that serve as anchors for the binding of the GDP-bound conformation of specific G-protein alpha subunits. As an initial approach to define further the different functional roles of AGS3 and LGN, we determined their expression profile and subcellular distribution. AGS3- and LGN-specific antisera indicated a widespread tissue distribution of LGN, whereas AGS3 is primarily enriched in brain. Brain punch biopsies of 13 discrete brain regions indicated that both AGS3 and LGN are expressed in all areas tested but are differentially regulated during development. LGN is expressed in neuronal, astroglial, and microglial cultures, whereas AGS3 expression is restricted to neurons. In primary neuronal cultures as well as in dividing cultures of PC12 cells, immunocytochemistry indicated distinct subcellular locations of AGS3 and LGN. The subcellular locations of the two proteins were differentially regulated by external stimuli and the cell cycle. In PC12 and COS7 cells, LGN moves from the nucleus to the midbody structure separating daughter cells during the later stages of mitosis, suggesting a role for G-proteins in cytokinesis. Thus, although AGS3 and LGN share a similar overall motif structure and both bind G-proteins, nature has endowed these proteins with different regulatory elements that allow functional diversity by virtue of tissue-specific expression and subcellular positioning.
