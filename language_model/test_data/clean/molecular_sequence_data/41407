Centrioles are duplicated during S-phase to generate the two centrosomes that serve as mitotic spindle poles during mitosis. The centrosomal pool of the Mps1 kinase is important for centriole assembly, but how Mps1 is delivered to centrosomes is unknown. Here we have identified a centrosome localization domain within Mps1 and identified the mitochondrial porin VDAC3 as a protein that binds to this region of Mps1. Moreover, we show that VDAC3 is present at the mother centriole and modulates centriole assembly by recruiting Mps1 to centrosomes.
