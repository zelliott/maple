The diversity of archaebacteria associated with anaerobic rumen protozoan Entodinium caudatum in long term in vitro culture was investigated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of hypervariable V3 region of archaebacterial 16S rRNA gene. PCR was accomplished directly from DNA extracted from a single protozoal cell and from total community genomic DNA and the obtained fingerprints were compared. The analysis indicated the presence of a solitary intensive band present in Entodinium caudatum single cell DNA, which had no counterparts in the profile from total DNA. The identity of archaebacterium represented by this band was determined by sequence analysis which showed that the sequence fell to the cluster of ciliate symbiotic methanogens identified recently by 16S gene library approach.
