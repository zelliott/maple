Protein profiles of Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR-1 grown in the presence of high-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (HMW PAHs) were examined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Cultures of M. vanbaalenii PYR-1 were incubated with pyrene, pyrene-4,5-quinone (PQ), phenanthrene, anthracene, and fluoranthene. Soluble cellular protein fractions were analyzed and compared, using immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips. More than 1000 gel-separated proteins were detected using a 2-DE analysis program within the window of isoelectric point (pI) 4-7 and a molecular mass range of 10-100 kDa. We observed variations in the protein composition showing the upregulation of multiple proteins for the five PAH treatments compared with the uninduced control sample. By N-terminal sequencing or mass spectrometry, we further analyzed the proteins separated by 2-DE. Due to the lack of genome sequence information for this species, protein identification provided an analytical challenge. Several PAH-induced proteins were identified including a catalase-peroxidase, a putative monooxygenase, a dioxygenase small subunit, a small subunit of naphthalene-inducible dioxygenase, and aldehyde dehydrogenase. We also identified proteins related to carbohydrate metabolism (enolase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase, and fumarase), DNA translation (probable elongation factor Tsf), heat shock proteins, and energy production (ATP synthase). Many proteins from M. vanbaalenii PYR-1 showed similarity with protein sequences from M. tuberculosis and M. leprae. Some proteins were detected uniquely upon exposure to a specific PAH whereas others were common to more than one PAH, which indicates that induction triggers not only specific responses but a common response in this strain.
