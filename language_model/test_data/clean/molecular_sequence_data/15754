Structural properties of the amino acid sequences from 22 signal peptides have been analyzed and compared with peptides known to interact with biological membranes and liposomes, melittin, a lytic peptide of bee venom, and the non-polar C-terminal segment of cytochrome b5. All these peptides evidence a double amphipatic structure with an hydrophobic core of 9 to 24 amino acid residues and two charged polar ends. They all exhibit a high potential for making alpha-helix and, to a lesser degree, extended or beta-sheet conformation with low or negative potentials for making reverse turns or aperiodic conformation. A model of spontaneous insertion of these peptides into the lipid bilayer without specific surface receptor protein is proposed, where the two polar ends interact with each polar face of the lipid bilayer and the hydrophobic core inserts into the non-hydrogen bonding environment of the fatty acid side chains. This insertion could be the molecular trigger for ribophorin assembly around the signal peptide and subsequent attachment to the ribosome prior to the transfer of the polypeptide chain through the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
