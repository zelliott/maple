We describe a case report of a 21-year-old male with fatal Epstein-Barr virus-associated haemophagocytic syndrome. Virus is detected in multiple organs by polymerase chain reaction and in the tissue-specific cells of those organs by in situ hybridisation. It is suggested that organ failure may be a direct response to infection.
