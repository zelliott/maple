Properties of an unusual atp9-rpl16 cotranscript preferentially found in the maternal distorted leaf mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, which had arisen from a genetic cross between chloroplast mutator and wild-type plants, were examined. Analysis of RNA editing of this cotranscript showed that one editing event in the rpl16 coding region created a UGA stop codon. This raises a possibility that a downstream GUG codon can serve as an initiation codon for rpl16.
