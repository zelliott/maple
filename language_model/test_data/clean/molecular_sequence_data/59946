The salivary antimicrobial peptide histatin-5 is able to aggregate and fuse negatively charged small unilamellar vesicles, and this fusogenic activity is selectively induced by the presence of zinc ions. Circular dichroism spectroscopy shows that histatin-5, in the presence of negatively charged vesicles and zinc ions, undergoes a conformational change leading to the stabilization of an alpha-helical secondary structure. We attribute the specific action of the zinc ions to the presence of a consensus sequence, HEXXH, located in the C-terminal functional domain of histatin-5, a recognized zinc-binding motif in many proteins. Two-dimensional proton NMR spectroscopy of histatin-5 in a trifluoroethanol/water mixture (a membrane mimetic environment) has been performed and the results analyzed by means of distance geometry and restrained molecular dynamics simulations. Our results reveal that the peptide chain, including the Zn-binding consensus sequence corresponding to residues 15-19, is in a helicoidal conformation. Comparison of the chemical shifts of the individual amino acids in histatin-5 with those recently reported in other solvents indicates that trifluoroethanol/water has a structuring capability somewhere between water and dimethyl sulfoxide. The mechanism of action of this antimicrobial peptide is discussed on the basis of its structural characteristics with particular attention to the Zn-binding motif.
