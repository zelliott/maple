Leukocyte Ig-like receptors (LILRs) are a family of receptors that have inhibitory and activating functions and widely expressed by lymphoid and myeloid cells. Here we report the identification of the rhesus monkey LILRs by screening of rhesus spleen and decidua cDNA libraries and RT-PCR cloning. We obtained eight different full-length clones with structural and functional diversity similar to human LILRs, including LILRs with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, LILRs with truncated cytoplasmic tails containing positively charged arginine residues in the transmembrane domain, and putative soluble receptors lacking transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains. Characterization of rhesus LILRs will facilitate use of this non-human primate model for the study of the functional role(s) of LILRs, including immune regulation through interaction with non-classical MHC class I molecules.
