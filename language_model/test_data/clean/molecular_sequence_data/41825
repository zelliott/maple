Type III homologies of human fibronectin are generally encoded by two exons, with the exception of the ED-A and ED-B repeats which are encoded by a single exon undergoing alternative splicing. We report that also the type III-9 homology is encoded by a single exon. Further more, RT-PCR analysis, performed on mRNA purified from fetal and adult tissues and from normal and tumor-derived cell types, showed that the III-9 region is not undergoing alternative splicing in all samples tested.
