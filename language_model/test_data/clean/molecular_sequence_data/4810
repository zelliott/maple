Tissue factor (TF) is the cellular receptor for an activated form of clotting factor VII (VIIa) and the binding of factor VII(a) to TF initiates the coagulation cascade. Sequence and structural patterns extracted from a global alignment of TF confers homology with interferon receptors of the cytokine receptor super family. Several recent studies suggested that TF could function as a genuine signal transducing receptor. However, it is unknown which biological function(s) of cells are altered upon the ligand, VIIa, binding to TF. In the present study, we examined the effect of VIIa binding to cell surface TF on cellular gene expression in fibroblasts. Differential mRNA display PCR technique was used to identify transcriptional changes in fibroblasts upon VIIa binding to TF. The display showed that VIIa binding to TF either up or down-regulated several mRNA species. The differential expression of one such transcript, VIIa-induced up-regulation, was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Isolation of a full-length cDNA corresponding to the differentially expressed transcript revealed that VIIa-up-regulated gene was poly(A) polymerase. Northern blot analysis of various carcinomas and normal human tissues revealed an over expression of PAP in cancer tissues. Enhanced expression of PAP upon VIIa binding to tumor cell TF may potentially play an important role in tumor metastasis.
