The photolyase gene from Thermus thermophilus was cloned and sequenced. The characteristic absorption and fluorescence spectra of the purified T. thermophilus photolyase suggested that the protein has flavin adenine dinucleotide as a chromophore. The second chromophore binding site was not conserved in T. thermophilus photolyase. The purified enzyme showed light-dependent photoreactivation activity in vitro at 35 and 65 degrees C and was stable when subjected to heat and acidic pH.
