We document human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) bZIP factor (HBZ)-specific CD4 T cell responses in an adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) patient after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) and identified a novel HLA-DRB1*15:01-restricted HBZ-derived naturally presented minimum epitope sequence, RRRAEKKAADVA (HBZ114-125). This peptide was also presented on HLA-DRB1*15:02, recognized by CD4 T cells. Notably, HBZ-specific CD4 T cell responses were only observed in ATL patients after allogeneic HCT (4 of 9 patients) and not in nontransplanted ATL patients (0 of 10 patients) or in asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (0 of 10 carriers). In addition, in one acute-type patient, HBZ-specific CD4 T cell responses were absent in complete remission before HCT, but they became detectable after allogeneic HCT. We surmise that HTLV-1 transmission from mothers to infants through breast milk in early life induces tolerance to HBZ and results in insufficient HBZ-specific T cell responses in HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers or ATL patients. In contrast, after allogeneic HCT, the reconstituted immune system from donor-derived cells can recognize virus protein HBZ as foreign, and HBZ-specific immune responses are provoked that contribute to the graft-versus-HTLV-1 effect.
