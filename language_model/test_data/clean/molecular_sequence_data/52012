Malignant melanoma is frequently characterized by the deletion of the long arm of chromosome 6 (usually encompassing 6q16-q21). In an effort to saturate this region with DNA markers, microdissection and molecular cloning of DNA from banded human metaphases recent development of a novel chromosome microdissection scheme that omits microchemical manipulation of DNA. Microdissection was targeted on band 6q21. Direct PCR amplification of dissected DNA was first used as a probe in chromosomal in situ hybridization of normal metaphases to confirm the specificity of material excised for cloning. A genomic library of 20,000 clones, which is highly enriched for sequences encompassing 6q21, was then constructed. Clones from this library have been mapped against a human-rodent somatic cell hybrid mapping panel that divides chromosome 6 into seven regions, confirming the localization of probes within the target region. Direct PCR amplification of DNA excised by microdissection greatly simplifies and facilitates this chromosome band-specific cloning strategy. The isolation of microclones from this region of chromosome 6 should assist in establishing a physical map of the melanoma deletion region.
