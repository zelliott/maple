In a gene chip analysis of common pituitary tumor types, one of the genes with the most impressive tissue-specific expression regulation was delta-like 1 (DLK1), which was strongly expressed in GH-secreting (GH-S) pituitary tumors. In addition to pituitary adenomas, various endocrine tumors were subjected to real-time-quantitative PCR revealing high expression of DLK1 in normal pituitary tissue, in GH-S-, in one prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma and in pheochromocytomas. Additionally, three DLK1 gene-derived subvariants were identified. The first, lacking 204 bp--coding for epidermal growth factor-like domain 6 and parts of the juxtamembrane region--was named Secredeltin. In the other two splice variants (named Brevideltin and Brevideltinin), a stop codon is introduced due to a frame-shift, leading to truncated proteins of 204 and 213 aas, respectively.
