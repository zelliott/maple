The objective of study was to investigate the combined effect of tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (imatinib) and p15 gene on the proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis of chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562. p15 gene was amplified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by RT-PCR, and confirmed by DNA sequencing, then the recombinant p15-pcDNA3.1 vector was constructed and transfected into K562 cell line by Lipofectine. After screening with G418, p15-pcDNA3.1-K562 cell clone stably expressing P15 was isolated. P15 protein was identified by Western blot. The cell survival rate was determined by MTT, cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. The results showed that partial deletion of p15 gene in K562 cells was verified by DNA sequencing, leading to the function of P15 protein to be lost. The expression of P15 protein can be detected by Western blot in p15-pcDNa3.1-K562 cells. A strong inhibition of cell proliferation was observed in p15-pcDNA3.1-K562 cells as compared with that of the control K562 cell. The cells of G(0)/G(1) phase in p15-pcDNA3.1-K562 cells increased apparently, and S phase cells declined signifcantly. Cell cycle was arrested in G(0)/G(1) phase. The percentage of apoptotic cells greatly increased after transfection with p15-pcDNA3.1-K562 cells combined with imatinib, and cell survival rate notably declined. It is concluded that the imatinib in combination with the expression of p15 gene has a synergistic effect on the inhibition of K562 cell proliferation and promotion of its apoptosis.
