The FOG family of transcriptional co-factors is composed of two members in mammals: FOG-1 and FOG-2. Both have been shown to bind to GATA factors and function as transcriptional co-repressors in specific cell and promoter contexts. We have previously defined a novel repression domain localized to the N-terminus of each FOG family member, the FOG repression motif, which is necessary for FOG-mediated transcriptional repression. In this report, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel isoform of FOG-2 lacking the FOG repression motif. In contrast to full-length FOG-2, this isoform is expressed predominately in the embryonic and adult heart. It can bind GATA4 avidly, but is unable to repress GATA4-mediated activation of cardiac-restricted gene promoters. Together, these results suggest that FOG-2 repressive activity may be modulated by the generation of isoforms of FOG-2 lacking the FOG repression motif.
