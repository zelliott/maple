The anti-CD4 mAb W3/25 inhibits experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in Lewis rats by blocking Th cell responses to encephalitogenic determinants of myelin basic protein (MBP). However, it has yet to be resolved how W3/25 modulates CD4 to inhibit EAE-associated T cell responses. This study revealed that W3/25 profoundly inhibited MBP-stimulated proliferation by sensitized lymph node cells but only partially inhibited the respective response of uncloned and cloned lines of MBP-specific T cells. That is, low concentrations of W3/25 blocked 30 to 60% of MBP-stimulated proliferation, but 100-fold higher concentrations did not result in additional inhibition. W3/25 also inhibited MBP-induced acquisition of EAE transfer activity, but only in cultures of freshly isolated lymph node cells and not in cultures of continuously propagated T cells. Studies focusing on the GP2.E5 T cell line revealed that the lack of sensitivity to W3/25 in encephalitogenic and proliferative assays was nevertheless associated with an effective blockage of MBP-stimulated IL-2 production. Importantly, W3/25 specifically inhibited antigenic but not mitogenic stimulation of IL-2 production. Reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that MBP-activated GP2.E5 T cells produced mRNA for both IL-2 and IL-4, and that W3/25 selectively inhibited accumulation of IL-2 as compared to IL-4 mRNA. Thus, GP2.E5 T cells apparently express a IL-4-dependent pathway that confers resistance to the inhibitory activity of W3/25. Studies focusing on two CD4+ T cell hybridomas revealed that W3/25 profoundly inhibited MBP-stimulated IL-2 production but did not affect the alternative response of MBP-induced growth inhibition. Several other hybrids also mediated MBP-stimulated IL-2 production but did not express CD4 and were not affected by W3/25. These results indicate that: 1) interactions of W3/25 with CD4 do not necessarily block class II MHC-restricted recognition of MBP; and 2) expression of CD4 is not necessary for Ag recognition by several clonotypes of MBP-reactive T cells. Rather, the results of this study are consistent with the concept that W3/25 inhibits transduction of costimulatory signals that are required specifically for initiation of IL-2 production. These findings may have important implications for understanding the therapeutic potential of anti-CD4 mAb in autoimmune disease.
