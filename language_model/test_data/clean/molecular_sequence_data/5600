Compared with the published DNA sequence (M. S. Chee, et al. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 154:125-170, 1990), most isolates of human cytomegalovirus strain AD169 contain an additional 929 bp after nucleotide 54612. This results in a changed reading frame for the 5'-terminal 50 codons of gene UL42 and expansion of gene UL43 (a US22 family member) from 187 (3'-truncated) to 423 (full-length) codons. The UL42 and UL43 gene products are nonessential for growth in culture.
