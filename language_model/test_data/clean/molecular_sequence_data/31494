A Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, rod-like, motile by peritrichous flagella and moderately halophilic bacterium, designated strain B6(T), was isolated a deep-sea sediment collected from the South Atlantic Ocean. The isolate grew with 0.5-15 % (w/v) NaCl, at 4-37 °C and pH 5.0-8.5 and showed a high tolerance to zinc, manganese, cobalt and copper ions. The major fatty acids were C16 : 0, C19 : 0 cyclo ω8c, C12 : 0 3-OH and C12 : 0. The predominant ubiquinone was Q-9. The genomic DNA G+C content was 61.1 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene comparisons indicated that strain B6(T) belonged to the genus Halomonas, and the closest relative was Halomonas xinjiangensis TRM 0175(T) (96.1 %). Based upon the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genetic data, strain B6(T) represents a novel species from the genus Halomonas, for which the name Halomonas zincidurans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is B6(T) ( = CGMCC 1.12450(T) = JCM 18472(T)).
