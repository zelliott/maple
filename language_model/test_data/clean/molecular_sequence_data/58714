To examine hammerhead ribozyme structure and vulnerability to cellular nucleases, ribozymes were incubated with soluble extracts from Escherichia coli, and cleavage sites were identified by primer extension analysis. Mapping of endonuclease-sensitive sites revealed that the most sensitive were in the 3'-substrate-binding region of the ribozyme. The catalytic domain was much less susceptible, although some cleavage preference was seen at two positions known to be twisted out of parallel stacking in a ribozyme-substrate analogue complex. Changes in substrate-binding domain nucleotide sequence had no effect on cleavage patterns of catalytic domains. Hammerhead ribozymes, in solution and free from substrate, appear to have structurally independent, asymmetrically arranged domains.
