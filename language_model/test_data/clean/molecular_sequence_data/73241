The peripheral membrane protein gephyrin is essential for the postsynaptic localization of the inhibitory glycine receptor and is thought to anchor the receptor complex to the subsynaptic cytoskeleton. Since gephyrin transcripts are also found in non-neuronal tissues, we analyzed the 5'-flanking region of the gephyrin gene to identify its promoter region. This region contains several SP1 consensus sites, which may account for the widespread expression of gephyrin mRNA. Indeed, reporter gene constructs encompassing at least the two SP1 consensus sites upstream from the transcription start site were efficiently transcribed in both a fibroblast and a neuronal cell line. Our data are consistent with the widespread expression of the gephyrin gene in most mammalian tissues.
