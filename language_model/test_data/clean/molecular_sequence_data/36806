In this study, we present a model compound for antiparallel beta-sheet-DNA interaction. Tachyplesin I, cationic antimicrobial peptide, interacts through contacts with the minor groove. Secondary structure of tachyplesin I, antiparallel beta-sheet constrained by two disulfide bridges and connected by beta-turn, contributes significantly to its DNA binding. The present results give valuable information for design of sequence-specific DNA binding peptide based on antiparallel beta-sheet.
