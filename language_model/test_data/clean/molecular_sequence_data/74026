Two novel human beta-chemokines, Ck beta-8 or myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 1 (MPIF-1), and Ck beta-6 or MPIF-2, were discovered as part of a large scale cDNA sequencing effort. The MPIF-1 and MPIF-2 cDNAs were isolated from aortic endothelium and activated monocyte libraries, respectively. Both of the cDNAs were cloned into a baculovirus vector and expressed in insect cells. The mature recombinant MPIF-1 protein consists of 99 amino acids and is most homologous to macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, showing 51% identity. It displays chemotactic activity on resting T lymphocytes and monocytes, a minimal but significant activity on neutrophils, and is negative on activated T lymphocytes. MPIF-1 is also a potent suppressor of bone marrow low proliferative potential colony-forming cells, a committed progenitor that gives rise to granulocyte and monocyte lineages. The mature recombinant MPIF-2 has 93 amino acid residues and shows 39 and 42% identity with monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-3 and MIP-1alpha, respectively. It displays chemotactic activity on resting T lymphocytes, a minimal activity on neutrophils, and is negative on monocytes and activated T lymphocytes. On eosinophils, MPIF-2 produces a transient rise of cytosolic Ca2+ and uses the receptor for eotaxin and MCP-4. In hematopoietic assays, MPIF-2 strongly suppressed the colony formation by the high proliferative potential colony-forming cell (HPP-CFC), which represents a multipotential hematopoietic progenitor.
