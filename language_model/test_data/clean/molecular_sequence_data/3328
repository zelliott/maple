We observed in vitro transcription of nodA, an inducible nod gene. Primer extension analysis of the transcripts showed there always existed a transcription product identical to that of its in vivo transcription, when 10 mumol/L naringening and NodD protein was added in the in vitro transcription system. Induced in vitro transcription of nodA gene suggests that in its in vivo transcription there may also exist a kind of physical interaction among NodD protein, inducer naringening and promoter of nodA gene.
