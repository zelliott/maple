An actinomycete with well-branched mycelia, designated strain YIM 120521(T), was isolated from soil collected from the banks of the Nujiang River, Yunnan Province, south-west China. Both aerial and substrate mycelia were white and non-pigmented. Growth was observed at 4-40 °C (optimum 28 °C), pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum 7.0) and in 0-4 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 0 %). Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain YIM 120521(T) belongs to the genus Allokutzneria with the highest sequence similarity to Allokutzneria albata DSM 44149(T) (98.4 %). However, the mean DNA-DNA relatedness value between the two strains was below 70 %. Chemotaxonomic characteristics supported the inclusion of strain YIM 120521(T) in the genus Allokutzneria, with rhamnose, arabinose, glucose, galactose and mannose as the whole-cell sugars, meso-diaminopimelic acid as the cell-wall diamino acid and MK-9(H4) as the predominant menaquinone. On the basis of physiological, biochemical and chemotaxonomic characteristics, strain YIM 120521(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Allokutzneria, for which the name Allokutzneria multivorans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 120521(T) ( = JCM 17342(T) = DSM 45532(T)).
