We have studied the phosphorylation of the Bcl-2 family of proteins by different mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Purified Bcl-2 was found to be phosphorylated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) p54-SAPKbeta, and this is specific insofar as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and p38/RK/CSBP (p38) catalyzed only weak modification. Bcl-2 undergoes similar phosphorylation in COS-7 when coexpressed together with p54-SAPKbeta and the constitutive Rac1 mutant G12V. This is seen by both 32PO4 labeling and the appearance of five discrete Bcl-2 bands with reduced gel mobility. As anticipated, both intracellular p54-SAPKbeta activation and Bcl-2 phosphorylation are blocked by co-transfection with the MAP kinase specific phosphatase MKP3/PYST1. MAP kinase specificity is also seen in COS-7 cells as Bcl-2 undergoes only weak phosphorylation when co-expressed with enzymatically activated ERK1 or p38. Four critical residues undergoing phosphorylation in COS-7 cells were identified by expression of the quadruple Bcl-2 point mutant T56A,S70A,T74A, S87A. Sequencing phosphopeptides derived from tryptic digests of Bcl-2 indicates that purified GST-p54-SAPKbeta phosphorylates identical sites in vitro. This is the first report of Bcl-2 phosphorylation by the JNK/SAPK class of MAP kinases and could indicate a key modification allowing control of Bcl-2 function by cell surface receptors, Rho family GTPases, and/or cellular stresses.
