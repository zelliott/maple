Previous studies have shown that the satellite DNAs in Hymenoptera account for 1-25% of the genome. They mainly correspond to a single family, or to several subfamilies having the same evolutionary origin. We have now showed that the satellite DNAs in the genomes of the hymenopterans Diadromus pulchellus, Diadromus collaris, Eupelmus vuilletti and Eupelmus orientalis are transcribed in both males and females. Satellite DNA transcripts could only be extracted with NP40/Urea, indicating that they are strongly associated with proteins. The satellite DNA in D. pulchellus was transcribed on the two DNA strands. The satellite DNA transcripts were single-stranded and not polyadenylated in vivo. The transcripts were found in embryos, larvae and imagos stages. The transcripts detected included one major transcript (1.9 kb) and several discrete smaller transcripts. The in vivo synthesis of these satellite DNA transcripts was explored by identifying their putative initiation sites.
