We cloned and sequenced a new cytolysin gene from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. medellin. Three IS240-like insertion sequence elements and the previously cloned cyt1Ab and p21 genes were found in the vicinity of the cytolysin gene. The cytolysin gene encodes a protein 29.7 kDa in size that is 91.5% identical to Cyt2Ba from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis and has been designated Cyt2Bc. Inclusions containing Cyt2Bc were purified from the crystal-negative strain SPL407 of B. thuringiensis. Cyt2Bc reacted weakly with antibodies directed against Cyt2Ba and was not recognized by an antiserum directed against the reference cytolysin Cyt1Aa. Cyt2Bc was hemolytic only upon activation with trypsin and had only one-third to one-fifth of the activity of Cyt2Ba, depending on the activation time. Cyt2Bc was also mosquitocidal against Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi, and Culex quinquefasciatus, including strains resistant to the Bacillus sphaericus binary toxin. Its toxicity was half of that of Cyt2Ba on all mosquito species except resistant C. quinquefasciatus.
