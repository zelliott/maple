Over the past 10 years, resources have been established for the genetic analysis of pearl millet, Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br., an important staple crop of the semi-arid regions of India and Africa. Among these resources are detailed genetic maps containing both homologous and heterologous restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers, and simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Genetic maps produced in four different crosses have been integrated to develop a consensus map of 353 RFLP and 65 SSR markers. Some 85% of the markers are clustered and occupy less than a third of the total map length. This phenomenon is independent of the cross. Our data suggest that extreme localization of recombination toward the chromosome ends, resulting in gaps on the genetic map of 30 cM or more in the distal regions, is typical for pearl millet. The unequal distribution of recombination has consequences for the transfer of genes controlling important agronomic traits from donor to elite pearl millet germplasm. The paper also describes the generation of 44 SSR markers from a (CA)n-enriched small-insert genomic library. Previously, pearl millet SSRs had been generated from BAC clones, and the relative merits of both methodologies are discussed.
