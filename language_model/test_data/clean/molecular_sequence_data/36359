All the cells of the immuno-haemopoietic system derive ultimately from a single pluripotent stem cell through processes of commitment and differentiation. The stem cell is also likely to be capable of extensive self renewal. Many factors which potentially control these processes have been identified and characterised both in vitro and in vivo. We discuss the nature of the haemopoietic stem cell and also the factors which have been identified as potential stem cell regulators. We also draw parallels from embryonal stem cell differentiation to derive a model of intrinsic determination of the haemopoietic stem cell. The possible role of developmental regulators, such as homeobox containing genes, are discussed in the context of differentiation commitment of the haemopoietic stem cell.
