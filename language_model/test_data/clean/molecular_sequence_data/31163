From a Plasmodium falciparum cDNA expression library derived from mRNA of the asexual blood stages, we isolated and sequenced five different cDNA clones whose predicted protein products were unusually rich in asparagine (Asn). Two of the clones, R5 and G5, contain tandem imperfectly repeated sequences based on Asn-Asn-Thr (NNT) and Asn-Asn-Met (NNM) respectively. The other three, E4, C5 and R13, as well as G5, contain stretches of polyasparagine varying in length from 2 to 26 residues. Results of DNA blotting experiments with the individual cDNA sequences as probes suggest that each of the five clones corresponds to a different P. falciparum gene. The fragments of P. falciparum proteins expressed by the cDNA clones shared cross-reactive antigenic determinants which were present on multiple P. falciparum proteins. In immunoblotting experiments, owl monkey antibodies selected for binding to the polypeptide expressed by clone E4, C5 or G5 reacted with the expressed proteins from all 5 clones, and with at least 10 proteins from schizont infected erythrocytes. The cross-reactive epitopes could be modeled by two Asn-rich peptide structures: (1) (NNT)8, whose sequence was based on the R5 repeat; and (2) (NPNA)6, whose sequence was based on the Asn-rich repeat of the P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP). Antibodies that bound to each peptide were selected from sera of immune monkeys that had never been exposed to sporozoites. The selected antibodies bound all 5 expressed proteins in immunoblotting assays and also bound to several proteins from parasitized erythrocytes. Such cross reactivity between the CSP repeating unit and several blood-stage antigens has not been previously reported.
