Three immunoreactive peptide histidine isoleucinamide (PHI) forms (I, II, and III) from a rat small intestinal extract were separated on a Fractogel column, using a specific RIA. Peak III was identified as rat PHI-(1-27)-NH2 based on its coelution with a synthetic standard and its amino acid sequence. Peak I was tentatively considered as PHI extended with the connecting peptide preexisting between PHI and vasoactive intestinal peptide in their common precursor, based on its apparent mol wt. Peak II was the most abundant form (based on immunoassay) and has not been described previously. It was purified to homogeneity by using a RIA throughout the first three chromatographic steps, then a fast RRA (on rat liver membranes) during the last three purification steps. This new PHI variant was identified as rat PHI-(1-27)-Gly, as judged by full sequencing amino acid analysis after C-terminal digestion by carboxypeptidase-Y and by coelution with synthetic rat PHI-(1-27)-Gly.
