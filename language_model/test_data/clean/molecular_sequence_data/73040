Ubiquinone (coenzyme Q or Q) is a lipophilic metabolite that functions in the electron transport chain in the plasma membrane of prokaryotes and in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes. Q-deficient mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fall into eight complementation groups (coq1-coq8). Yeast mutants from the coq5 complementation group lack Q and as a result are respiration-defective and fail to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources. A nuclear gene, designated COQ5 was isolated from a yeast genomic library based on its ability to restore growth of a representative coq5 mutant on media containing glycerol as the sole carbon source. The DNA segment responsible for the complementation contained an open reading frame (GenBankTM accession number Z49210Z49210) with 44% sequence identity over 262 amino acids to UbiE, which is required for a C-methyltransferase step in the Q and menaquinone biosynthetic pathways in Escherichia coli. Both the ubiE and COQ5 coding sequences contain sequence motifs common to a wide variety of S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases. A gene fusion expressing a biotinylated form of Coq5p retains function, as assayed by the complementation of the coq5 mutant. This Coq5-biotinylated fusion protein is located in mitochondria. The synthesis of two farnesylated analogs of intermediates in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway is reported. These reagents have been used to develop in vitro C-methylation assays with isolated yeast mitochondria. These studies show that Coq5p is required for the C-methyltransferase step that converts 2-methoxy-6-polyprenyl-1, 4-benzoquinone to 2-methoxy-5-methyl-6-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinone.
