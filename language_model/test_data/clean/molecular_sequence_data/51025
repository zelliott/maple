Defined biochemical stimuli regulating neonatal ventricular myocyte (cardiomyocyte) development have not been established. Since cardiomyocytes stop proliferating during the first 3-5 days of age in the rodent, locally generated 'anti-proliferative' and/or differentiation signals can be hypothesized. The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family of peptides are multifunctional regulators of proliferation and differentiation of many different cell types. We have determined in neonatal and maturing rat hearts that TGF-beta 1 gene expression occurs in pups of both normotensive (Wistar Kyoto, WKY) and hypertrophy-prone rats (spontaneously hypertensive, SHR). TGF-beta 1 transcript levels were readily apparent in total ventricular RNA from SHR pups within 1 day of age and elevated in 3-7 day old WKY and SHR hearts when cardiomyocyte proliferation indices are diminished. TGF-beta 1 transcript levels remain at a 'relatively' high level throughout maturation and into adulthood in both strains. Further, TGF-beta 1 transcripts were localized to cardiomyocytes of neonatal rat ventricular tissue sections by in situ hybridization. Immunoreactive TGF-beta was co-localized to the intracellular compartment of neonatal cardiomyocytes at the light and electron microscopic level. In vitro analysis using primary cultures of fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes indicated that TGF-beta s inhibit mitogen stimulated DNA synthesis and thymidine incorporation. From these data, we propose that locally generated TGF-beta s may act as autocrine and/or paracrine regulators of cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation as intrinsic components of a multifaceted biochemical regulatory process governing heart development.
