This paper describes a novel method for creating exact DNA fusions between any two points in a plasmid carried in Bacillus subtilis. It exploits the homologous in vivo recombination between directly repeated sequences that can be established by insertion of a synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide. The method was used to enhance the productivity in B. subtilis of a cloned alpha-amylase (Amy)-encoding gene originating from Bacillus stearothermophilus. Thus, an exact fusion between nucleotide sequences encoding the expression signals, including the signal peptide, of a Bacillus licheniformis Amy-encoding gene and the mature Amy of B. stearothermophilus, was created. The resulting hybrid translational product was processed correctly in B. subtilis during secretion, giving rise to an Amy identical to the mature Amy secreted by B. stearothermophilus.
