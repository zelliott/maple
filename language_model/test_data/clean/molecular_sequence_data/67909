Forty-three out of 120 (35.8%) Clarias garipenus fish were found to be naturally infected with Henneguya suprabanchiae. The infection appeared as clusters of ovoid to ellipsoidal plasmodia being embedded within the hyaline cartilage of the suprabranchial organ of the fish. Histological studies indicate tissue distortion at the sites of infection. The continuous growth of the plasmodium led to deformation of the filament structure as well as disorganization and displacement of the gill lamellae. Also, a severe atrophy occurred in the hyaline cartilage of the gills and also in the gill lamellae. Based on the structure and measurements of fresh spores by light microscopy, this parasite was identified as H. suprabranchiae. Spores are oval in shape, and they measure 13 (11-14) × 3 (2-5) μm length by width. It has two polar capsules inside, each measures 3 (2.5-5) × 1 (1.5-4) μm length by width. Each polar capsule has a spirally coiled (7-9 turns) polar filament. The ultrastructural analysis showed that the plasmodia were surrounded by single-unit membrane. The generative cells and the early developmental stages were arranged at the periphery of the plasmodia, while immature and mature spores were centrally arranged. The developmental stages characterizing sporogenesis, capsulogenisis, and valvogenesis of the present parasite were ultrastructurally studied. The small subunit 18 S rDNA (SSU rDNA) gene sequences from different isolates was sequenced and compared with the sequence of the same gene from the Henneguya sp. isolated from GenBank. The phylogenetic position of the present Henneguya sp. within the genus was determined using sequence analysis of all related taxa available in GenBank, and the phylogenetic tree derived from this study is elucidated and compared with the current taxonomy of the available myxosporeans. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences and divergence showed that the SSU rDNA gene of this Henneguya species revealed 92.2% sequence identity with Henneguya exilis (acc. no. AF021881) differing in 30 nucleotides with lower divergence value.
