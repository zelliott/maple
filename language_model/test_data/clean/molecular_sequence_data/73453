Coronavirus gene expression involves proteolytic processing of the gene 1-encoded polyprotein(s), and a key enzyme in this process is the viral 3C-like proteinase. In this report, we describe the biosynthesis of the human coronavirus 229E 3C-like proteinase in Escherichia coli and the enzymatic properties, inhibitor profile, and substrate specificity of the purified protein. Furthermore, we have introduced single amino acid substitutions and carboxyl-terminal deletions into the recombinant protein and determined the ability of these mutant 3C-like proteinases to catalyze the cleavage of a peptide substrate. Using this approach, we have identified the residues Cys-3109 and His-3006 as being indispensable for catalytic activity. Our results also support the involvement of His-3127 in substrate recognition, and they confirm the requirement of the carboxyl-terminal extension found in coronavirus 3C-like proteinases for enzymatic activity. These data provide experimental evidence for the relationship of coronavirus 3C-like proteinases to other viral chymotrypsin-like enzymes, but they also show that the coronavirus proteinase has additional, unique properties.
