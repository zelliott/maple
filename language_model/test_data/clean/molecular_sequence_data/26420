A 2.2 kb cDNA clone which presumably includes the complete human B-raf coding sequence was isolated from a human testes cDNA library. Sequence analysis showed the presence of all three conserved regions CR1, CR2 and CR3 previously identified in raf protein kinases. The cDNA was expressed in E. coli yielding a B-raf fusion protein which reacts with antibodies specific for B-raf raised against the C-terminal peptide as well as with monoclonal antibodies which map into the kinase domain.
