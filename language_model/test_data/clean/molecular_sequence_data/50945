The globulin of the seed endosperms of rice has an isoelectric point of 6.4 and a M(r) of 26,000. There is one intra-disulphide bond, but no N-linked oligosaccharide chain. The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal and internal regions of the globulin was determined and found to be homologous with that of glutenin, the storage protein in the seed endosperms of wheat. Rice globulin and wheat glutenin were rich in glycine, and glutamic acid or glutamine, and in addition, wheat glutenin cross-reacted with antibody raised against rice globulin. These results suggest that rice seed globulin represents a protein similar to wheat seed glutenin.
