Two new multiheme cytochromes were isolated from the anaerobic sulfur reducing bacterium Desulfuromonas acetoxidans. They have monomeric molecular masses of 50 and 65 kDa and contain six and eight hemes, respectively. Visible and EPR spectroscopies, in the as-isolated (oxidised) cytochromes, show the presence of only low-spin hemes in the 50-kDa cytochrome, and of high-spin and low-spin hemes in the 65-kDa cytochrome. The EPR spectra of the native 65-kDa cytochrome indicate multiple heme-heme interactions, including integer-spin systems as judged by parallel-mode EPR. The 50-kDa cytochrome has a complex redox pattern, as shown by EPR redox titrations, and contains one heme with unusual characteristics. Both cytochromes cover an extremely wide range of reduction potentials, which go from +100 mV to -375 mV for the 50-kDa cytochrome, and +185 mV to -235 mV for the 65-kDa cytochrome. The two cytochromes were tested for hydroxylamine oxidoreductase activity and polysulfide reductase activity, but neither displayed any activity. In contrast, it was found for the first time that the previously characterised cytochrome c551.5, from the same bacterium is very active in the reduction of polysulfide, which suggests that it acts as a terminal reductase in D. acetoxidans.
