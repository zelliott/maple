Since Yersinia frederiksenii was first described in 1980, it has been recognized genotypically as a heterogeneous species, comprising three phenotypically indistinguishable genospecies. In this study, the sequence of the 16S rRNA gene and the concatenated sequences of six housekeeping genes (glnA, gyrB, hsp60, recA, rpoB and sodA) of all the currently known species of the genus Yersinia were used to determine the phylogenetic position of Y. frederiksenii genospecies 2 in the genus Yersinia. The phylogenetic analyses grouped the Y. frederiksenii genospecies 2 strains in a monophyletic group together with representative strains of Yersinia massiliensis. Moreover, the Y. frederiksenii genospecies 2 strains were also grouped apart from the other species of the genus Yersinia and far from the other two genospecies of Y. frederiksenii. All of the observations made in this study support the conclusion that Y. frederiksenii genospecies 2 should be reclassified as Y. massiliensis.
