DNA fragments containing the sequence CG(AT)nCG have been used in footprinting experiments to assess the effect of echinomycin, which binds to CG steps, on the structure of the central AT region. DNAase I normally cuts ApT much better than TpA; in the presence of the drug this preference is retained but cleavage at TpA is enhanced. Changes in cleavage by micrococcal nuclease have also been observed. Echinomycin renders alternate adenines hyperreactive to diethylpyrocarbonate. The results suggest that echinomycin induces structural changes in regions surrounding its binding site and that these can be cooperatively propagated over several turns of the DNA helix.
