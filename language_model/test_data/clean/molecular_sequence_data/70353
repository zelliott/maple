An O-acetylated trisialoganglioside that is converted to GT2 on mild base treatment was found in cod brain. This alkali-labile ganglioside was isolated using high-performance liquid chromatography, and its chemical structure was characterized. This novel ganglioside was identified as a GT2 derivative having an acetyl group at the C-9 position of the external sialic acid. Its chemical structure is as follows.
