Thiocyanate hydrolase (SCNase) is a cobalt-containing enzyme with a post-translationally modified cysteine ligand, gammaCys131-SO(2)H. When the SCNase alpha, beta and gamma subunits were expressed in Escherichia coli, the subunits assembled to form a hetero-dodecamer, (alphabetagamma)(4), like native SCNase but exhibited no catalytic activity. Metal analysis indicated that SCNase was expressed as an apo-form irrespective of the presence of cobalt in the medium. On the contrary, SCNase co-expressed with P15K, encoded just downstream of SCNase genes, in cobalt-enriched medium under the optimized condition (SCNase((+P15K))) possessed 0.86 Co atom/alphabetagamma trimer and exhibited 78% of the activity of native SCNase. SCNase((+P15K)) showed a UV-Vis absorption peak characteristic of the SCNase cobalt center. About 70% of SCNase((+P15K)) had the gammaCys131-SO(2)H modification. These results indicate that SCNase((+P15K)) is the active holo-SCNase. P15K is likely to promote the functional expression of SCNase probably by assisting the incorporation of cobalt ion.
