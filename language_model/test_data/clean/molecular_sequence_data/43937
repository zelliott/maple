DNA was amplified from lung samples from three piglets infected with Pneumocystis carinii, using oligonucleotide primers designed to the P. carinii mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA gene. The nucleotide sequence of the amplification product was determined and indicated lack of sequence variation among these pig-derived P. carinii samples at this locus. The data showed that porcine P. carinii was genetically distinct from P. carinii isolated from other mammalian host species.
