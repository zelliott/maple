Mitochondrial genomes from yeasts in the Dekkera/Brettanomyces/Eeniella group vary in size from 28 to 101 kb. Mapping of genes has shown that the three smallest genomes, of 28-42 kb, have the same gene order, whereas the three larger mitochondrial DNAs of 57-101 kb are rearranged relative to the smaller molecules and between themselves. To examine the relationships between these genomes, a phylogenetic tree has been constructed by sequence comparison of the mitochondrial-encoded cytochrome oxidase subunit gene (COX2) from the six species. Contrary to expectation, the tree shows that the larger rearranged genomes are more closely related than the smaller mtDNAs. This result indicates that the gene order of the smaller mtDNAs (28-42 kb) is ancestral and that larger mtDNA molecules (57-101 kb) are more prone to rearrangement than smaller forms.
