Preeclapsia (PE) is a severe disorder that occurs during pregnancy, leading to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. PE affects about 3-8% of all pregnancies. In this study, we conducted liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to analyze serum samples depleted of the six most abundant proteins from normal and PE-affected pregnancies to profile serum proteins. A total of 237 proteins were confidently identified with <1% false discovery rate from the two groups of duplicate analysis. The expression levels of those identified proteins were compared semiquantitatively by spectral counting. To further validate the candidate proteins with a quantitative mass spectrometric method, selective reaction monitoring (SRM) and enzyme linked immune assay (ELISA) of serum samples collected from pregnant women with severe PE (n = 8) or normal pregnant women (n = 5) was conducted. α2- HS-glycoprotein (AHSG), retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) and α-1-microglobulin/bikunin (AMBP) and Insulin like growth factor binding protein, acid labile subunit (IGFBP-ALS) were confirmed to be differentially expressed in PE using SRM (P<0.05). Among these proteins, AHSG was verified by ELISA and showed a statistically significant increase in PE samples when compared to controls.
