Gram-positive, non-spore-forming rods, strain 5401308T, were isolated from a human ankle discharge. Based on cellular morphology and the results of biochemical testing, this strain was tentatively identified as an undescribed member of the genus Brevibacterium. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0 (45.3%), anteiso-C17:0 (19.2%) and iso-C15:0 (18.3%). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison showed that the bacterium was closely related to the type strains of Brevibacterium mcbrellneri (96.3% similarity) and Brevibacterium paucivorans (95.8%). On the basis of phenotypic data and phylogenetic inference, it is proposed that this strain represents a novel species, designated Brevibacterium massiliense sp. nov.; the type strain is 5401308T (=CSUR P26T=CIP 109422T=CCUG 53855T).
