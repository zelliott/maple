Hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-3 alpha, -3 beta, and -3 gamma are liver transcription factors that mediate the coordinate expression of a number of hepatocyte-specific genes. The HNF-3 proteins share DNA-binding-domain homology among themselves and with the Drosophila homeotic protein forkhead (fkh). The HNF-3/fkh DNA-binding domain constitutes an uncharacterized protein motif that recognizes its cognate DNA binding site as a monomer. Additional HNF-3/fkh-related proteins are known to be required for determination events during embryogenesis in Drosophila and Xenopus. In this report, we describe the isolation of nine additional HNF-3/fkh homologue (HFH) clones from rodent tissue cDNAs by using both low-stringency hybridization and a polymerase chain reaction protocol. Many of the HFH genes exhibit a tissue-restricted expression pattern and are transcribed in tissues other than liver, including brain, kidney, lung, and intestine. The HNF-3/fkh motif therefore comprises a large gene family of transcription factors that play a role in tissue-specific gene regulation and development.
