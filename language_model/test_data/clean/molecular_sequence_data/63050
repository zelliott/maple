An endoparasitoid wasp, Cotesia plutellae, induces immunosuppression of the host diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. To identify an immunosuppressive factor, the parasitized hemolymph of P. xylostella was separated into plasma and hemocyte fractions. When nonparasitized hemocytes were overlaid with parasitized plasma, they showed significant reduction in bacterial binding efficacy. Here, we considered a viral lectin previously known in other Cotesia species as a humoral immunosuppressive candidate in C. plutellae parasitization. Based on consensus regions of the viral lectins, the corresponding lectin gene was cloned from P. xylostella parasitized by C. plutellae. Its cDNA is 674 bp long and encodes 157 amino acid residues containing a signal peptide (15 residues) and one carbohydrate recognition domain. Open reading frame is divided by one intron (156 bp) in its genomic DNA. Amino acid sequence shares 80% homology with that of C. ruficrus bracovirus lectin and is classified into C-type lectin. Southern hybridization analysis indicated that the cloned lectin gene was located at C. plutellae bracovirus (CpBV) genome. Both real-time quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting assays indicated that CpBV-lectin showed early expression during the parasitization. A recombinant CpBV-lectin was expressed in a bacterial system and the purified protein significantly inhibited the association between bacteria and hemocytes of nonparasitized P. xylostella. In the parasitized P. xylostella, CpBV-lectin was detected on the surface of parasitoid eggs after 24 h parasitization by its specific immunostaining. The 24 h old eggs were not encapsulated in vitro by hemocytes of P. xylostella, compared to newly laid parasitoid eggs showing no CpBV-lectin detectable and easily encapsulated. These results support an existence of a polydnaviral lectin family among Cotesia-associated bracovirus and propose its immunosuppressive function.
