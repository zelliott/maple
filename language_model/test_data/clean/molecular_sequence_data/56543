The Vb6 subfamily is the largest reported subfamily of human T-cell receptor (Tcr) genes, with as many as 14 possible members based on variation in reported DNA sequences. A study of the genomic organization of four distinct Vb6 genes indicated that they contained within their introns the uninterrupted dinucleotide repeat (GT)n, with n > 8. DNA amplification primers and conditions were determined which amplified the intron of these four different Vb6 gene segments. All four Vb6 genes tested showed length polymorphism when examined in a group of unrelated individuals. Careful sizing and DNA sequencing showed that the alleles of each gene differed in size by multiples of two base pairs (bp), due to different repeat numbers of the dinucleotide (GT)n. These four microsatellite polymorphisms had from three to ten alleles, and individual heterozygosities of 26% to 83%. The large number of alleles and the high heterozygosity make these polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based polymorphisms very attractive genetic markers for segregation studies which postulate the presence of autoimmune susceptibility genes within the Tcrb region. Vb6 hybridization to genomic DNA confirmed the relatively large size of the Vb6 subfamily in several hominoid species. Nucleotide sequencing of an intron of the Vb6 genes from other primates revealed the presence of dinucleotide repeats similar to those found in human Vb6 genes. Thus, the (GT)n microsatellite was not only present in the Vb6 intron before Vb6 gene duplication, but was present before speciation of the hominoids.
