Phenol- and p-cresol-degrading pseudomonads isolated from phenol-polluted water were analysed by the sequences of a large subunit of multicomponent phenol hydroxylase (LmPH) and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O), as well as according to the structure of the plasmid-borne pheBA operon encoding catechol 1,2-dioxygenase and single component phenol hydoxylase. Comparison of the carA gene sequences (encodes the small subunit of carbamoylphosphate synthase) between the strains showed species- and biotype-specific phylogenetic grouping. LmPHs and C23Os clustered similarly in P. fluorescens biotype B, whereas in P. mendocina strains strong genetic heterogeneity became evident. P. fluorescens strains from biotypes C and F were shown to possess the pheBA operon, which was also detected in the majority of P. putida biotype B strains which use the ortho pathway for phenol degradation. Six strains forming a separate LmPH cluster were described as the first pseudomonads possessing the Mop type LmPHs. Two strains of this cluster possessed the genes for both single and multicomponent PHs, and two had genetic rearrangements in the pheBA operon leading to the deletion of the pheA gene. Our data suggest that few central routes for the degradation of phenolic compounds may emerge in bacteria as a result of the combination of genetically diverse catabolic genes.
