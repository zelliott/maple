Two novel catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (C 1,2-O) genes have been isolated from an Acinetobacter radioresistens strain that grows on phenol or benzoate as sole carbon and energy source. Designated as catA(A) and catA(B), they encode proteins composed of 314 and 306 amino acids, whose deduced sequences indicate that they have approximately 53% identity, whereas their NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal regions have no sequences in common. This may explain their different thermal and pH stability. Polyclonal antibodies raised against an amino-terminal CatA(A) peptide or the whole CatA(B) protein were used to establish their inducible and differential expression patterns upon bacterial growth in phenol or benzoate. The CatA(A) protein (IsoA) was induced by both phenol and benzoate though with different kinetics, whereas the catA(B) product (IsoB) was constitutively produced at low levels that increased only during growth in the presence of benzoate.
