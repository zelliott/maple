The Escherichia coli flagellar master regulator, FlhD(4)C(2), binds to the promoter regions of flagellar class II genes, yet, despite extensive analysis of the FlhD(4)C(2)-regulated promoter region, a detailed consensus sequence has not emerged. We used in vitro and in vivo experimental approaches to determine the nucleotides in the class II promoter, fliAp, required for the binding and function of FlhD(4)C(2). FlhD(4)C(2) protects 48 bp (positions -76 to -29 relative to the Ïƒ(70)-dependent transcriptional start site) in the fliA promoter. We divided the 48-bp footprint region into 5 sections to determine the requirement of each DNA segment for the binding and function of FlhD(4)C(2). Results from an in vitro binding competition assay between the wild-type FlhD(4)C(2)-protected fragment and DNA fragments possessing mutations in one section of the 48-bp protected region showed that only one-third of the 48 bp protected by FlhD(4)C(2) is required for FlhD(4)C(2) binding and fliA promoter activity. This in vitro binding result was also seen in vivo with fliA promoter-lacZ fusions carrying the same mutations. Only seven bases (A(12), A(15), T(34), A(36), T(37), A(44), and T(45)) are absolutely required for the promoter activity. Moreover, A(12), A(15), T(34), T(37), and T(45) within the 7 bases are highly specific to fliA promoter activity, and those bases form an asymmetric recognition site for FlhD(4)C(2). The implications of the asymmetry of the FlhD(4)C(2) binding site and its potential impact on FlhD(4)C(2) are discussed.
