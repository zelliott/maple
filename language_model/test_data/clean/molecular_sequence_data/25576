The excision-junction sites of a mtDNA rearrangement of a long-lived strain of Podospora anserina, Mn19, were cloned and sequenced. Analysis of sequence and hybridization data lead to the conclusion that the Mn19 mtDNA consists of two nonoverlapping circular molecules. Three plasmids, LMt-2, LMt-3, and LMt-4, cloned from long-lived progeny of crosses between the Mn19 strain and wild type were cloned and sequenced. These plasmids share features and excision-junction sites with previously described longevity and senescence plasmids. The Mn19 mtDNA rearrangement and plasmids LMt-2, LMt-3, and LMt-4 are described. The possible significance of similarities to previously described plasmids is discussed.
