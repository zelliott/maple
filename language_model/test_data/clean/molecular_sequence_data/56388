With the aid of recA-lacZ fusion strains, the in vivo regulation of the Pseudomonas stutzeri recA gene has been studied. It is shown that expression of this gene can be induced with a variety of DNA damaging agents, as well as with agents that interfere with DNA replication. For this induction, the presence of an active RecA protein is essential. Sequence analysis of the promoter region of the P. stutzeri recA gene showed that its open reading frame is preceded by an SOS-box, suggesting a regulation of its expression, similar to the regulation of recA expression in Escherichia coli.
