Phytophthora infestans is a devastating phytopathogenic oomycete that causes late blight on tomato and potato. Recent genome sequencing efforts of P. infestans and other Phytophthora species are generating vast amounts of sequence data providing opportunities to unlock the complex nature of pathogenesis. However, accurate annotation of Phytophthora genomes will be a significant challenge. Most of the information about gene structure in these species was gathered from a handful of genes resulting in significant limitations for development of ab initio gene-calling programs. In this study, we collected a total of 150 bioinformatically determined near full-length cDNA (FLcDNA) sequences of P. infestans that were predicted to contain full open reading frame sequences. We performed detailed computational analyses of these FLcDNA sequences to obtain a snapshot of P. infestans gene structure, gauge the degree of sequence conservation between P. infestans genes and those of Phytophthora sojae and Phytophthora ramorum, and identify patterns of gene conservation between P. infestans and various eukaryotes, particularly fungi, for which genome-wide translated protein sequences are available. These analyses helped us to define the structural characteristics of P. infestans genes using a validated data set. We also determined the degree of sequence conservation within the genus Phytophthora and identified a set of fast evolving genes. Finally, we identified a set of genes that are shared between Phytophthora and fungal phytopathogens but absent in animal fungal pathogens. These results confirm that plant pathogenic oomycetes and fungi share virulence components, and suggest that eukaryotic microbial pathogens that share similar lifestyles also share a similar set of genes independently of their phylogenetic relatedness.
