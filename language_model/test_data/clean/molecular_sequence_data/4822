Antibodies (Ab) to thyroid peroxidase (TPO) are common in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease and may play a role in disease pathogenesis. We have prepared immunoglobulin G kappa (IgG kappa) and IgG lambda phage display combinatorial libraries from the cervical (thyroid-draining) lymph nodes of 2 Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients and from the thyroid of 1 patient. After selection with purified recombinant human TPO, up to 10 high affinity IgG kappa clones from each tissue source were analyzed further. No IgG lambda Fab were detected in the patient with the highest TPO Ab titer. Sequence analysis of the clones showed restricted heavy and light chain usage, similar to that in previously published TPO-reactive Fabs. This was despite the substantially larger sizes of the initial libraries, the use of lymph node tissue to generate libraries, and the analysis of the repertoire in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis rather than Graves' disease. There was overall similarity in sequences obtained from lymph node and thyroid libraries, with higher levels of somatic hypermutation in the former. The Fab inhibited binding of serum TPO Ab from five patients by 55-95%. These data together with those from previous reports indicate that although there is no unique Ab gene usage, there is the recurrent presence of certain variable regions in the high affinity TPO Ab response.
