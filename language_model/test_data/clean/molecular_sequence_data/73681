Oligonucleotide probes covering three phylogenetically defined groups of Butyrivibrio spp. were successfully designed and tested. The specificity of each probe was examined by hybridization to rRNAs from an assortment of B. fibrisolvens isolates as well as additional ruminal and nonruminal bacteria. The sensitivity of the hybridization method was determined by using one of the probes (probe 156). When RNA was extracted from a culture of OB156, the probe was able to detect target cells at densities as low as 10(4) cells/ml. When 10(4) or more target cells/ml were added to cattle rumen samples, detectable hybridization signals were obtained with 1,000 ng of total RNA loaded onto the nylon membrane. In contrast, the sensitivity was reduced to 10(6) target cells/ml at 100 ng of RNA per slot. The probes were used to type 19 novel Butyrivibrio isolates. The phylogenetic placement was confirmed by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The use of the probes in community-based studies indicated that the Butyrivibrio groups examined in this paper did not represent a significant portion of the bacterial 16S rRNA pool in the rumen of the cattle, sheep, and deer examined.
