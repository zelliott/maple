A molecular screen for a mouse homologue of a Drosophila carbohydrate binding protein, called Gliolectin, yielded a cDNA encoding mST3GalV/GM3 synthase (CMP-NeuAc: lactosylceramide alpha2, 3-sialyltransferase). By in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, mST3GalV exhibits differential expression in neural and non-neural tissues. Although expressed by all neurons in the central nervous system, neuronal populations that contribute their axons to myelinated efferent projections, such as cerebellar Purkinje cells and spinal motorneurons, demonstrate the highest ST3GalV expression. When stained with anti-mST3GalV antiserum (designated CS2), subpopulations of neurons display an elaborate Golgi apparatus, frequently extending into one or more dendritic processes. The extended spatial distribution of the neuronal Golgi apparatus, particularly in spinal motorneurons, allowed the confocal immunohistochemical colocalization of mST3GalV with markers for medial/trans-Golgi but not the cis-Golgi or trans-Golgi network, consistent with previous observations suggesting that ganglioside glycosyltransferases are enriched in late Golgi compartments. Among non-neural tissues, liver and testes demonstrate cell-type specific CS2 staining. In liver, endothelial cells lining a ring of sinusoids, concentric with the central vein, express mST3GalV. Kupffer cells are also stained with CS2 antiserum but hepatocyte expression is undetectable. In the seminiferous tubules of the testes, ST3GalV is found in somatic (Leydig, Sertoli) and early germline cells (spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes); the epididymal epithelium exhibits intense ST3GalV expression. Since GM3 is a precursor for the synthesis of a- and b-series gangliosides, the range of mST3GalV/GM3 synthase expression among various cell populations indicates that certain cell types possess greater reliance on ganglioside function than others.
