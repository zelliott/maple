A strictly anaerobic, halotolerant, spindle-shaped rod, designated strain SEBR 4211T, was isolated from an African saline oil-producing well. Cells stain Gram-positive, which was confirmed by electron microscopy observations. Strain SEBR 4211T was motile by means of one to four peritrichous flagella, had a G+C content of 43 mol% and grew optimally at 37 degrees C, pH 7.3, with 0 to 3% (w/v) NaCl. It utilized a limited number of carbohydrates (cellobiose, glucose, fructose, mannitol and ribose) and produced acetate, butyrate, CO2 and H2 as end products from glucose fermentation. It reduced thiosulfate to sulfide. In the presence of thiosulfate, a decrease in butyrate and an increase in acetate production was observed. Phylogenetically, strain SEBR 4211T was related to members of the low G+C Clostridiales order with Clostridium halophilum as the closest relative (16S rDNA sequence similarity of 90%). On the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics of the isolate, it is proposed to designate it as a new species of a new genus, Fusibacter gen. nov., as Fusibacter paucivorans sp. nov. The type strain is SEBR 4211T (= DSM 12116T).
