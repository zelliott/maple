A subtracted cDNA library from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Epinephelus awoara spleen was constructed using the suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH). Random clones (209) were selected and sequenced. After assembling, 36 contigs and 56 singlets (accession numbers: EB410743-EB410834) were finally obtained, some of which were immune-related genes. A reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of the expression patterns of eight transcripts showed that seven of them were up-regulated after 24 h of LPS stimulation. Furthermore, full-length cDNAs of homologues of defender against cell death 1 (DAD1) and allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1) were obtained by RACE-PCR.
