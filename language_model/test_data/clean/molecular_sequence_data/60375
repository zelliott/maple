A variant form of mouse Chromosome (Chr) 17, the t-haplotype, contains several loci responsible for transmission ratio distortion in males. Sperm carrying the responder locus (Tcr) have a high probability of fertilizing eggs at the expense of wild-type sperm, provided that distorter loci (Tcd-1 to Tcd-5) are expressed during spermatogenesis. Tcr has been mapped to the Leh66b region within a maximum of 155 kb. In the search for genes in the genomic region Leh66EI, we have identified the mouse homolog of human ribosome S6 kinase 3 (RSK3) on cosmid DNA. The complete mouse Rsk3 gene is encoded in the region Leh66a of t-haplotypes and Leh66EI of the wild-type chromosome. It consists of at least 13 exons spanning over more than 120 kb. Rsk3 is expressed in embryos and in several adult organs including testis. Cosmids covering 100 kb of the Leh66b region or 120 kb of the Leh66a region were isolated. Rsk3 covers about 65 kb of the Leh66b region and appears to be incomplete at its 5'-end. A correlation of the physical map provided here with the genetic mapping of Tcr reported previously suggests that Tcr is most likely encoded within a fragment of 30 kb upstream or 20 kb downstream of Rsk3. These data will facilitate the isolation of Tcr, a prerequisite for understanding transmission ratio distortion in mouse.
