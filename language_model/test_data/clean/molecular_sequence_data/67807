We report progressive necrotizing fungal cellulitis and myositis in the leg of a patient with glioblastoma multiforme treated with temozolomide and corticosteroids. While the morphologic appearance of the isolate and its ability to grow at temperatures greater than 32Â°C were suggestive of Mycoleptodiscus indicus, some of the conidia were atypical for this species in that they had single septa and occasional lateral appendages. Furthermore, the isolate was different from M. indicus based on the sequencing analysis of two rDNA regions. This is the first case of Mycoleptodiscus invasive fungal disease in which the causative agent could not be resolved at the species level because of inconsistencies between morphological and molecular data.
