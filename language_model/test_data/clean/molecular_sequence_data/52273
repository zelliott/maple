Site-directed mutagenesis was used to examine the catalytic importance of 2 histidine and 4 arginine residues in Escherichia coli periplasmic acid phosphatase (EcAP). The residues that were selected as targets for mutagenesis were those that were also conserved in a number of high molecular weight acid phosphatases from eukaryotic organisms, including human prostatic and lysosomal acid phosphatases. Both wild type EcAP and mutant proteins were overproduced in E. coli using an expression system based on the T7 RNA polymerase promoter, and the proteins were purified to homogeneity. Examination of the purified mutant proteins by circular dichroism and proton NMR spectroscopy revealed no significant conformational changes. The replacement of Arg16 and His17 residues that were localized in a conserved N-terminal RHGXRXP motif resulted in the complete elimination of EcAP enzymatic activity. Critical roles for Arg20, Arg92, and His303 were also established because the corresponding mutant proteins exhibited residual activities that were not higher than 0.4% of that of wild type enzyme. In contrast, the replacement of Arg63 did not cause a significant alteration of the kinetic parameters. The results are in agreement with a previously postulated distant relationship between acid phosphatases, phosphoglycerate mutases, and fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase. These and earlier results are also consistent with the conclusion that 2 histidine residues participate in the catalytic mechanism of acid phosphatases, with His17 playing the role of a nucleophilic acceptor of the phospho group, whereas His303 may act as a proton donor to the alcohol or phenol.
