A major 26 kDa protein was identified in the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of axolotl thymocytes. A polyclonal antiserum was produced against the denatured form of this protein. High levels of 26 kDa were expressed by hydrocortisone-sensitive lymphocytes which represent a major thymocyte subpopulation in young animals. However, no further expression of the 26 kDa protein was observed in involuted thymus of adult animals nor in thymus of young artificially metamorphosed axolotls. The 26 kDa was never expressed by splenic and blood peripheral lymphocytes at any stage of development. Partial N-terminal amino acid sequence and amino acid composition demonstrate that the 26 kDa polypeptide is strongly homologous to HMG1-2 proteins, the most abundant members of the high mobility group (HMG) non-histone chromosomal proteins. HMG1-2 are thought to be involved in the organization of chromatin structure, as well as in the stability, replication and transcription of DNA. It was confirmed that the 26 kDa axolotl polypeptide is recognized by a well characterized rabbit antiserum to rat HMG1-2 proteins.
