Mycobacterium marinum is a major causative agent of mycobacteriosis in fish that has a broad range of hosts, including in human isolates. So far, genomic analyses have focused on the human isolate. Here, we compared the draft genome sequences of two strains of M. marinum isolated from fish (MB2 and Europe) with the M. marinum M isolated from humans. M. marinum MB2 and Europe have single, circular chromosomes of 6,134,389 and 6,029,340 bp, and average G + C contents of 65.7 and 65.5 %, respectively. A total of 5,464 coding DNA sequences were annotated in both M. marinum MB2 and Europe genome. Dot plot analyses showed that M. marinum MB2 and Europe were closer to M. marinum M when compared to three other Mycobacterium species. The insertion/deletion gene analysis showed that M. marinum MB2 and Europe contained 342 and 487 genes that were not found in M. marinum M, and lacked 625 and 776 genes found in M. marinum M, respectively. Most of the inserted and deleted genes were classified in the fatty acid, lipid, and isoprenoid subsystem and the virulence, disease, and defense subsystem. Therefore, these results provide insights into the genomic diversity associated with variable hosts and pathogens.
