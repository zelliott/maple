The gene for an essential protein subunit of nuclear RNase P from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been cloned. The gene for this protein, RPP1, was identified by virtue of its homology with a human scleroderma autoimmune antigen, Rpp30, which copurifies with human RNase P. Epitope-tagged Rpp1 can be found in association with both RNase P RNA and a related endoribonuclease, RNase MRP RNA, in immunoprecipitates from crude extracts of cells. Depletion of Rpp1 in vivo leads to the accumulation of precursor tRNAs with unprocessed 5' and 3' termini and reveals rRNA processing defects that have not been described previously for proteins associated with RNase P or RNase MRP. Immunoprecipitated complexes cleave both yeast precursor tRNAs and precursor rRNAs.
