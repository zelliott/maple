By analysing mRNAs with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and by studying in vitro generated mutants we have identified an intron in the genome of wheat dwarf virus (WDV), a geminivirus of cereals. Polypeptides whose expression is essential for the replication of the viral DNA have been defined. They are encoded by two distinct overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). The joining of these two ORFs by deletion of the intron as well as the introduction of a frameshift mutation within the intron do not prevent replication of the viral genome in suspension culture cells. In contrast to WDV, the geminiviruses of dicotyledonous plants possess a single continuous ORF, highly homologous to the two individual ones of WDV. We propose that mRNA splicing is a common feature of all geminiviruses of the Gramineae and might contribute to their host class specificity. The existence of a functional intron is a novel finding for the plant viruses.
