Phosphatidylserine-specific phospholipase A1 (PS-PLA1), which acts specifically on phosphatidylserine (PS) and 1-acyl-2-lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS) to hydrolyze fatty acids at the sn-1 position of these phospholipids, was first identified in rat platelets (Sato, T., Aoki, J., Nagai, Y., Dohmae, N., Takio, K., Doi, T., Arai, H., and Inoue, K. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 2192-2198). In this study we isolated and sequenced cDNA clones encoding human PS-PLA1, which showed 80% homology with rat PS-PLA1 at the amino acid level. In addition to an mRNA encoding a 456-amino acid product (PS-PLA1), an mRNA with four extra bases inserted at the boundary of the exon-intron junction was detected in human tissues and various human cell lines. This mRNA is most probably produced via an alternative use of the 5'-splicing site (two consensus sequences for RNA splicing occur at the boundary of the exon-intron junction) and encodes a 376-amino acid product (PS-PLA1DeltaC) that lacks two-thirds of the C-terminal domain of PS-PLA1. Unlike PS-PLA1, PS-PLA1DeltaC hydrolyzed exclusively lyso-PS but not PS appreciably. Any other phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidic acid (PA), and their lyso derivatives were not hydrolyzed at all. These data demonstrated that PS-PLA1DeltaC exhibits lyso-PS-specific lysophospholipase activity and that the C-terminal domain of PS-PLA1 is responsible for recognizing diacylphospholipids. In addition, human PS-PLA1 gene was mapped to chromosome 3q13.13-13.2 and was unexpectedly identical to the nmd gene, which is highly expressed in nonmetastatic melanoma cell lines but poorly expressed in metastatic cell lines (van Groningen, J. J., Bloemers, H. P., and Swart, G. W. (1995) Cancer Res. 55, 6237-6243).
