A new mathematical model is presented for the analysis of the substituent distribution in the polymer chain of polysaccharide derivatives. For the first time, the influence of substitution on the reactivity of neighbored monomer units is taken into account. The model was applied to various cellulose and amylose ethers and esters and excellently fits the experimental data.
