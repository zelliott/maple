With the intensive application of carbendazim in greenhouse production of vegetables and the production of medicinal herbs, there is an increasing need to find a way to remediate carbendazim-contaminated soil. A bacterial stain capable of utilizing carbendazim as the sole source of carbon and energy was isolated from soil. The isolate was designated CBW and identified as a member of Pseudomonas sp. based on its colony morphology, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and Biolog analysis. About 87.1 and 99.1% of carbendazim at concentrations of 1.0 and 10.0 mg l(-1) in mineral salts medium were removed by the isolate CBW after incubation for 3 days, respectively. The optimal pH value for the isolate CBW to degrade carbendazim was 7.0. The degradation rate of carbendazim by the isolate CBW was found to increase slightly with temperature. According to the metabolites detected and identified in the present study, it was proposed that carbendazim was first converted to 2-aminobenzimidazole, which was then transformed to 2-hydroxybenzimidazole, 1,2-diaminobenzene, catechol, and finally to carbon dioxide. The results indicate that the isolate CBW is a new bacterial resource for biodegrading carbendazim and might be used for bioremediation of sites heavily contaminated by carbendazim and its derivatives.
