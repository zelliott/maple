We have analyzed a murine plasmacytoma minus highly differentiated B lymphoma subtractive cDNA library and identified eight genes that are expressed in most plasmacytomas but at a much lower level, or not at all, in most B lymphomas. Four of the genes are markers of the terminal differentiation of B lymphocytes into plasma cells: placental alkaline phosphatase, also expressed in pre-B lymphomas xlr-3, a new X-linked member of the xlr multi-gene family EGP314, a pan-epithelial glycoprotein with sequence features of an adhesion molecule PC315, a gene that is up-regulated by IL6, but without obvious sequence homologies. Two of the genes are not clearly related to normal B cell differentiation, appearing to be associated with malignant transformation of plasma cells: PC326 is a new member of the beta-transducin mosaic protein gene family. It is an X-linked gene, expressed at a very low level in testis, but in no other normal tissue, including LPS- or IL6-induced plasma cells. It has a high level of expression (apparently dysregulated) in most (> 85%) mineral oil induced plasmacytomas. However the likelihood that PC326 is expressed decreases as the tumor latency decreases when different retroviral agents are used to accelerate mineral oil induced plasmacytomagenesis. This suggests that PC326 expression may be a late event in a multi-step process of tumorigenesis. PC251 a new member of the hematopoietic growth factor receptor family, most homologous to IL5R alpha.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
