The biological properties and amino acid sequences of the third variable domain (V3 loop and flanking regions) of the env region of 34 HIV-1 isolates obtained from Romanian children were analyzed. Unambiguous nucleic acid sequences were obtained from 31 isolates. The derived V3 amino acid sequences were highly homologous (93-100%) and clustered with the HIV-1 subtype F Romanian consensus. Five of the 31 isolates presented a syncytium-inducing phenotype in MT-2 cells and established continuous viral replication in various CD4+ cell lines (rapid/high phenotype). The V3 sequence from one of these isolates showed a slightly lesser degree of homology with the consensus sequence. The presence of positively charged amino acids at positions 306 and 320 has been strongly associated with the ability to induce syncytia in MT-2 cells, whereas negatively or uncharged amino acids at these positions are present in non-syncytium-inducing isolates (slow/low phenotype). There was, however, no correlation between phenotype and amino acid sequence in the five syncytium-inducing isolates; negatively or uncharged amino acids were conserved at positions 306 and 320 for all 31 isolates in sequences obtained from PBMCs. A tendency toward a more positive net charge in the V3 loop of syncytium-inducing isolates was noted. These data confirm the recent observations that HIV-1 isolates from Romania not only cluster in subtype F, but also show a high degree of interpatient homogeneity in the V3 region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
