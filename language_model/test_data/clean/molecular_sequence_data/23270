The eosinophil-associated ribonucleases (Ears) are rapidly evolving proteins found in multigene clusters that are unique to each rodent species. Of the 15 independent genes in the Mus musculus cluster, only mEars 1 and 2 are expressed at significant levels at homeostasis. Here we characterize the expression of mEar 6 in the liver and spleen in mice in response to infection with the helminthic parasite, Schistosoma mansoni. Interestingly, expression of mEar 6 is not directly related to the elevated levels of serum IL-5 or tissue eosinophilia characteristic of this disease, as no mEar 6 transcripts were detected in the liver or the spleen from uninfected IL-5-transgenic mice. The coding sequence of mEar 6 has diverged under positive selection pressure (K(a)/K(s) > 1.0) and has a unique unpaired cysteine near the carboxy-terminus of the protein. The high catalytic efficiency of recombinant mEar 6 (k(cat)/K(m) = 0.9 x 10(6)/M/s) is similar to that of the cluster's closest human ortholog, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN/RNase 2). In summary, we have identified mEar 6 as one of only two RNase A superfamily ribonucleases known to be expressed specifically in response to pathophysiologic stress in vivo.
