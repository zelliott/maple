Self-incompatibility (SI) has been well studied in the genera Brassica and Arabidopsis, which have become models for investigation into the SI system. To understand the evolution of the SI system in the Brassicaceae, comparative analyses of the S-locus in genera other than Brassica and Arabidopsis are necessary. We report the identification of six putative S-locus receptor kinase genes (SRK) in natural populations of Capsella grandiflora, an SI species from a genus which is closely related to Arabidopsis. These S-alleles display striking similarities to the Arabidopsis lyrata SRK alleles in sequence and structure. Our phylogenetic analysis supports the scenario of differing SI evolution along the two lineages (The Brassica lineage and Arabidopsis/Capsella lineage). Our results also argue that the ancestral S-locus lacked the SLG gene (S-locus glycoprotein) and that the diversification of S-alleles predates the separation of Arabidopsis and Capsella.
