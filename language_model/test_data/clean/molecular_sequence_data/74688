Muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins are a family of RNA-binding proteins that participate in the regulation of tissue-specific alternative splicing. Misregulation of MBNL activity in humans leads to pathogenesis. Here, we report upon the identification and characterization of three muscleblind-like genes in zebrafish (zmbnl1, zmbnl2 and zmbnl3). Alternative splicing of the three zmbnl primary transcripts gives rise to at least four protein isoforms for zmbnl1, four for zmbnl2 and five for zmbnl3, respectively. All of the zmbnl proteins contain the characteristic CCCH zinc fingers required for RNA binding. In addition, several structural motifs, including a C-terminal Ser/Thr-rich region, are conserved among Mbnl orthologs in vertebrates, but not invertebrates. These genes are broadly expressed in most adult tissues. However, the relative expression levels of specific spliceforms vary across different tissues. During embryogenesis, zmbnl1 and zmbnl2 are both maternally and zygotically expressed. In contrast, zmbnl3 transcripts are not detected until the late pharyngula stage. Our results reveal the expression pattern of various mbnl spliceforms for the first time and suggest that they may play specific roles during fish development.
