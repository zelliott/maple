Reverse transcriptase PCR designed to amplify the N1 to N9 neuraminidase (NA) genes of avian influenza viruses detected 118 of the 119 NA genes tested (99.2%) in a subtype-specific manner. This technique successfully subtyped all 167 recent avian influenza viruses isolated from birds. Subtype specificity was confirmed by sequence analyses of all 285 PCR products.
