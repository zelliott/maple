We describe a nonpeptide mimetic analog of an invertebrate peptide receptor. Benzethonium chloride (Bztc) is an agonist of the SchistoFLRFamide (PDVDHVFLRFamide) receptors found on locust oviducts. Bztc competitively displaces [125I-labeled Y1]SchistoFLRFamide binding to both high- and low-affinity receptors of membrane preparations. Bztc mimics the physiological effects of SchistoFLRFamide on locust oviduct, by inhibiting myogenic and induced contractions in a dose-dependent manner. Bztc is therefore recognized by the binding and activation regions of the SchistoFLRFamide receptors. This discovery provides a unique opportunity within insects to finally target a peptide receptor for the development of future pest management strategies.
