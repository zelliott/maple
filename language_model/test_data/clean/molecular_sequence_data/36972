HLA class II typing by RFLP and PCR-SSOP has been performed on HLA-DR2-positive individuals as a part of a study on MHC in a Spanish Caucasoid population. The results of this study reveal that HLA-DR15 (DRB1*1501 DRB5*0101) and DQ5 (DQA1*0102 DQB1*0501/0502) are not uncommonly associated in such a population. Family segregation has been assessed and allogeneic reactivity against some classic DR2 haplotypes has been tested; a stimulatory capability of DQ6 antigen in this situation is shown. It is suggested that the reported association is not uncommon in European Caucasoids as well as in other populations and it should be considered in matching for transplantation and in DR2-associated diseases.
