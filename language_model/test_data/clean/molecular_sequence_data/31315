Chicken aldolase B (liver-type) and C (brain-type) cDNAs were isolated and their nucleotide sequences determined. Southern blot analysis of chicken genomic DNA using the fragments of aldolase C cDNA suggested that the aldolase C gene is a single-copy gene. The quantification by Northern blot analysis of aldolase B and C mRNAs in the chicken liver and brain during development showed that in the liver, the B gene was progressively activated, while C gene expression was extinguished reciprocally. In the brain, the B gene was silent throughout the development, while the C gene was activated progressively, reaching a product level of more than 20-fold that of the 7-day-old embryo.
