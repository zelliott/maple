In order to provide important information about early diagnosis and treatment of tumor metastasis, a study on the biological regulation of metastasis at the molecular level was carried out by isolating and identifying human metastatic suppressor gene or related DNA sequences from a pair of cell clones with different metastatic phenotypes.

Suppression subtractive hybridization technique (SSH), gene cloning and analysis by bioinformatics were applied to this study. Two cell clones of pulmonary giant cell carcinoma originating from the same patient were used. The PLA-801C cell clone which shows lower metastatic potentiality was used as tester and the PLA-801D as a driver.

Five cDNA clones so obtained were expressed on much higher levels in the poorly metastatic cancer cell clone than the highly metastatic one. Homology analysis of all five cDNA fragments by BLASTN through GenBank showed high homology with the known human genes.

Through using SSH, we have identified five cDNA fragments which are expressed at much higher levels in the poorly metastatic cancer cell clone than the highly metastatic variety. Therefore, it is supposed that they might play an important role in the suppression of metastatic tumor cells and may very well have potential application in the diagnosis and treatment of metastasis.
