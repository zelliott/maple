Severe combined immunodeficient (scid) C.B-17 mice are deficient in variable (diversity) joining region recombination, the process of assembling the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes from gene segments, thereby creating much of the enormous diversity of antigen-binding capacity, scid mice are also sensitive to ionizing radiation, as a result of their deficiency in double-strand break repair. Here we report the complementation of the radiation-sensitive scid phenotype by transferring human chromosome 8 into scid cells. Somatic cell hybrids were generated by fusing scid cells with human HT-1080 cells, resulting in radioresistant hybrids with several human chromosomes. One of the identified human chromosomes in the radioresistant scid cell line 4.61, which retains only two human chromosomes, is a rearranged 8/21 translocation. Proof that chromosome 8 confers the complementation was achieved by transferring only human chromosome 8 into scid cells by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (scid/hu8 cell line). The presence of chromosome 8 in our scid/hu8 cell line was monitored by fluorescence in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. We demonstrated the radioresistance of this hybrid not only to high dose rate but also to low dose rate radiation. We also showed that transference of human chromosome 8 to scid cells fully complements the DNA double-strand break repair deficiency and the high sensitivity of scid cells to radiation-induced chromosome aberrations. Mapping the scid gene to human chromosome 8 is an important first step in cloning the scid gene, which will enhance our understanding of double-strand break repair pathways in humans.
