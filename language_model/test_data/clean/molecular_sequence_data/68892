Structures of the Asn linked oligosaccharides of quail egg-yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) were determined in this study. Asn linked oligosaccharides were cleaved from IgY by hydrazinolysis and labelled with p-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (ABEE) after N-acetylation. The ABEE labelled oligosaccharides were then fractionated by a combination of Concanavalin A-agarose column chromatography and anion exchange, normal phase and reversed phase HPLC before their structures were determined by sequential exoglycosidase digestion, methylation analysis, HPLC, and 500 MHz 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Quail IgY contained only neutral oligosaccharides of the following categories: the glucosylated oligomannose type (0.6% Glc alpha 1-3Glc alpha 1-3Man9GlcNAc2; 35.6%, Glc alpha 1-3Man7-9GlcNAc2). oligomannose type (15.0%, with the structure Man5-9GlcNAc2) and biantennary complex type with core structures of -Man alpha 1-3(-Man alpha 1-6)Man beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-4GlcNAc (9.9%), -Man alpha 1-3 (GlcNAc beta 1-4)(-Man alpha 1-6)Man beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-4GlcNAc (25.1%) and -Man alpha 1-3(GlcNAc beta 1-4)(-Man alpha 1-6)Man beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-6)GlcNAc (11.4%). Although never found in mammalian proteins, glucosylated oligosaccharides (Glc1Man7-9GlcNAc2) have been located previously in hen IgY.
