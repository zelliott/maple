Plasmids with whole genes for ribonucleases from B. intermedius (binase) and B. pumilis (RNase Bp) assembled with the whole gene of barstar, a specific intracellular inhibitor, are constructed. The resultant plasmids pMZ55 and pMZ56 effectively express binase and RNase Bp genes in B. subtilis cells. A medium for maximum expression of RNase genes by recombinant strains is developed. The expression of binase and RNase Bp genes in B. subtilis cells is negatively regulated by exogenic inorganic phosphate.
