We describe a novel syntaxin family member, syntaxin 9 (Syn 9), which does not possess a typical C-terminal hydrophobic tail anchor. Syn 9 has, however, a Q-SNARE domain and an overall homology to syntaxins (with the highest overall homology with mammalian syntaxin 11). Syn 9 is enriched in some epithelial cells, particularly that of the stomach lining and the skin. At the skin, it is found in the epidermal layers as well as structures associated with hair follicles. A biochemical interaction screen revealed that Syn 9 interacts specifically with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. Overexpression of Syn 9 perturbed EGF receptor endocytosis but does not appear to affect the internalization of the transferrin receptor. Syn 9 may therefore have a role in EGF receptor transport and signaling in certain epithelial cell types.
