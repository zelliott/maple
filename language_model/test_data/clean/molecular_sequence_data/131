Partial atlE sequencing (atlE nucleotides 2782 to 3114 [atlE(2782-3114)]) was performed in 41 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates from prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) and 44 isolates from skin as controls. The atlE(2782-3114) allele 1 (type strain sequence) was significantly more frequent in PJI strains (38/41 versus 29/44 in controls; P = 0.0023). Most PJI strains were positive for mecA, icaA/icaD, and IS256, and most belonged to the sequence type 27 subgroup, suggesting the involvement of few related clones.
