A codon optimized mature human beta-defensin-3 gene (smHBD3) was synthesized and fused with TrxA to construct pET32-smHBD3 vector, which was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) and cultured in MBL medium. The volumetric productivity of fusion protein reached 0.99 g fusion protein l(-1), i.e. 0.21 g mature HBD3 l(-1). Ninety-six percentage of the fusion protein was in a soluble form and constituted about 45% of the total soluble protein. After cell disruption, the soluble fusion protein was separated by affinity chromatography and cleaved by enterokinase, and then the mature HBD3 was purified by cationic ion exchange chromatography. The overall recovery ratio of HBD3 was 43%. The purified mature HBD3 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against E. coli.
