An artificial gene comprising 183 base pairs has been assembled by template-directed condensation of 35- to 53-membered oligodeoxyribonucleotides with cyanogen bromide as a condensing agent. The reaction is complete within several minutes at 0 degree C in buffer. The resulting gene was cloned into M13mp11 and sequenced using the Sanger sequencing procedure.
