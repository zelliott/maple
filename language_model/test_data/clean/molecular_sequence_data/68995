Cytosine methylation has been implicated in epigenetic control of gene expression in animals, plants, and fungi. It has been assumed that all methylation in eukaryotes is at symmetrical sequences such as CpG/GpC, because this can explain perpetuation of methylation states. Here the bisulfite genomic sequencing method was used to examine methylation in DNA from a Neurospora gene exposed to repeat-induced point mutation. 5-Methylcytosine was not limited to symmetrical sites and individual molecules showed different patterns and amounts of modification. The methylation extended beyond the mutated region and even beyond the edge of the duplicated segment.
