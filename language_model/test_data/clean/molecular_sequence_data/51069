The 39-kDa DNA polymerase beta (beta-Pol) molecule can be readily converted into two constituent domains by mild proteolysis; these domains are represented in an 8-kDa N-terminal fragment and a 31-kDa C-terminal fragment [Kumar et al. (1990a) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 2124-2131]. Intact beta-Pol is a sequence-nonspecific nucleic acid-interactive protein that binds both double-stranded (ds) and single-stranded (ss) polynucleotides. These two activities appear to be contributed by separate portions of the enzyme, since the 31-kDa domain binds ds DNA but not ss DNA, and conversely, the 8-kDa domain binds ss DNA but not ds DNA [Casas-Finet et al. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19618-19625]. Truncation of the 31-kDa domain at the N-terminus with chymotrypsin, to produce a 27-kDa fragment (residues 140-334), eliminated all DNA-binding activity. This suggested that the ds DNA-binding capacity of the 31-kDa domain may be carried in the N-terminal segment of the 31-kDa domain. We used CNBr to prepare a 16-kDa fragment (residues 18-154) that spans the ss DNA-binding region of the 8-kDa domain along with the N-terminal portion of the 31-kDa domain. The purified 16-kDa fragment was found to have both ss and ds polynucleotide-binding capacity. Thermodynamic binding properties for these activities are similar to those of the intact enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
