The antibody response of HIV-infected individuals to the 581-609 amino acid (aa) region of HIV-1 gp41 containing the putative immunosuppressive and immunodominant sequences was examined. Sera collected every 5 to 6 months over a period of 5 years from 50 HIV-1-infected homosexual and bisexual men, 25 of whom progressed to AIDS during the collection period, were monitored for changes in ELISA reactivity against synthetic peptides encompassing aa581-609 of gp41. The data obtained in this blinded, historical prospective study were analyzed with respect to changes in mean ELISA absorbance over time and differences in absorbance between patient groups (those who progressed to AIDS and those who did not). No correlation was found between time or disease state and the presence of antibodies to the aa581-597 immunosuppressive sequence. In contrast, ELISA absorbance against the aa598-609 immunodominant sequence continued to increase over time in both the AIDS and non-AIDS groups. The rate of increase in absorbance was similar for both groups; however, the AIDS group had a significantly higher mean absorbance level at the outset of the study and maintained this difference throughout the study. This region of gp41 has been proposed to play a role in complement-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement of infection.
