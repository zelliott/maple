We have characterized the promoter of the human gene coding for the apoferritin L subunit. Transient transfections of 5' and 3' deletion mutants indicate that the efficiency of the L promoter depends on both negative and positive cis-elements, located upstream and downstream of the transcription start point. DNaseI footprinting analysis of this DNA region revealed the presence of five protected segments. The most upstream one (element 1) corresponds to the negative cis-element and is recognized by factor(s) sharing a GC-sequence specificity. Three positive elements are in the region upstream of the start of transcription; a fifth positive cis-element (element 5) is localized in the first exon of the L gene.
