A better understanding of vertebrate sexual differentiation could be provided by a study of models in which genetic sex determination (GSD) of gonads can be reversed by temperature. In the newt Pleurodeles waltl, a P450 aromatase cDNA was isolated from adult gonads, and the nucleotide or deduced amino acid sequences showed a high level of identity with various vertebrate species. In adults, aromatase expression was found in gonads and brain. In developing gonads, the expression was found to fit with the thermo-sensitive period (TSP) and was detected in both ZZ and ZW larvae, as well as in ZW submitted during the whole TSP to a masculinizing temperature. In the latter individuals, in situ hybridization and semi quantitative RT-PCR showed that, at the end of TSP, aromatase expression was at the same level than in normal ZZ larvae and was significantly lower than in normal ZW ones. Furthermore, temperature-induced down regulation did not occur when heating was performed at the end of TSP. Our results confirm the importance of aromatase regulation in female versus male differentiation and demonstrate that a down regulation of aromatase expression is involved in the process of sex reversal.
