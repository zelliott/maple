To gain insight into the role of the general transcription factor, Sp1, in the expression of nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, we investigated Sp1 activation of the adenine nucleotide translocator 2, cytochrome c1, F1-ATPase beta subunit, and the mitochondria transcription factor (mtTFA) promoters transfected into Drosophila cell lines. The numbers and organization of GC elements vary in the four promoters, but the magnitude of activation by coexpressed human Sp1 was similar. A feature common to the four promoters is the presence of multiple, proximal Sp1-activating elements that account for 50% or more of the transcription activation by Sp1. The distribution and function of individual distal Sp1 elements is less defined and appear to be more promoter-specific. Finally, data from transfected Drosophila cells provide the first direct proof for the involvement of Sp1 in the negative regulation of the ANT2 promoter and as a possible participant in repression of the beta-subunit promoter. The role of Sp1 in both the positive and negative regulation of OXPHOS promoters is unique.
