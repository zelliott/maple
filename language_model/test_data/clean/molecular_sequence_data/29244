Current methods for detection of mutations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence analysis frequently are not able to detect heterozygous large deletions. We report the successful use of a novel approach to identify such deletions, based on detection of apparent homozygosity of contiguous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The sequence analysis of genomic DNA PCR products containing all coding exons and flanking introns identified only a single heterozygous mutation (IVS18+2t-->a) in a patient with classic infantile-onset autosomal recessive glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII). Apparent homozygosity for multiple contiguous SNPs detected by this sequencing suggested presence of a large deletion as the second mutation; primers flanking the region of homozygous SNPs permitted identification and characterization by PCR of a large genomic deletion (8.26 kb) extending from IVS7 to IVS15. The data clearly demonstrate the utility of SNPs as markers for large deletions in autosomal recessive diseases when only a single mutation is found, thus complementing currently standard DNA PCR sequence methods for identifying the molecular basis of disease.
