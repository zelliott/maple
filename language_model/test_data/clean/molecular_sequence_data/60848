The newly discovered gamma-PKC-related-protein of human leukocytes (gamma-rp) crossreacts with a polyclonal antibody preparation originally designed to be specific for PKC-gamma (gammaMb-Ab). As this antibody is currently the only suitable probe for gamma-rp, we sought to characterize the binding of the two proteins. We determined that the gamma Mg-Ab does not recognize the native form of gamma-rp. However, with denaturing immunoblots of gamma-rp, we found that 1) the crossreactive gamma-rp epitope differs somewhat from that of classic rat brain PKC-gamma, but probably only to the degree of the rat/human PKC species difference; 2) the previously reported doublet bands of gamma-rp represent a single protein with cell-stimulus inducible modifications; 3) antibodies present in the gammaMg-Ab pool bind to two separate sites within the gamma-rp epitope; 4) access to one binding site is conformationally restricted, even after protein denaturation; 5) agonist-induced modification of gamma-rp does not significantly affect the total amount of gamma Mg-Ab that it can bind, but 6) does significantly affect the rate of antibody binding to one site. This investigation defines the appropriate experimental use of our antibody, and the significance of these findings for the future study and cloning of gamma-rp is discussed.
