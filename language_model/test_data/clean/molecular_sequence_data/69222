The Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast orf712 is a previously described open reading frame that lacks a detectable transcript but potentially encodes a polypeptide with sequence similarities to ribosomal protein Rps3 only at its N- and C-termini. Here we report that orf712 is an essential gene, as demonstrated through gene disruption by particle gun-mediated chloroplast transformation. We also show that an orf712 is present and structurally conserved in all of the two or three major Chlamydomonas lineages. Our results suggest that orf712 is an unusual rps3 gene that contains a large translated intervening sequence.
