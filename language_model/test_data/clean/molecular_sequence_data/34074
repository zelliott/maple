Hedyotide B1, a novel cyclotide isolated from the medicinal plant Hedyotis biflora, contains a cystine knot commonly found in toxins and plant defense peptides. The optimal oxidative folding of a cystine knot encased in the circular peptide backbone of a cyclotide poses a challenge. Here we report a systematic study of optimization of the oxidative folding of hedyotide B1, a 30-amino acid cyclic peptide with a net charge of +3. The linear precursor of hedyotide B1, synthesized as a thioester by solid phase synthesis, was cyclized quantitatively by a thia-zip cyclization to form the circular backbone and then subjected to oxidative folding in a thiol-disulfide redox system under 38 different conditions. Of the oxidative conditions examined, the nature of the organic cosolvent appeared to be critical, with the use of 70% 2-propanol affording the highest yield (48%). The disulfide connectivity of the folded hedyotide was identical to that of the native form as determined by partial acid hydrolysis. The use of such a high alcohol concentration suggests that a partial denaturation may be necessary for the oxidative folding of a cyclotide with the inverse orientation of hydrophobic side chains that are externalized to the solvent face to permit the formation of the interior cystine core in the circularized backbone. We also show that synthetic hedyotide B1 is an antimicrobial, exhibiting minimal inhibitory concentrations in the micromolar range against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
