The detergent-soluble fraction from Trichostrongylus colubriformis third-stage larvae contained a simple set of antigens, one of which (molecular weight 41,000) induced 43-51% protection in guinea pigs following immunization. Isolation and partial amino acid sequence analysis of this protective antigen showed it was parasite tropomyosin.
