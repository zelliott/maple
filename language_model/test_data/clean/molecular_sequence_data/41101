The majority of proteins are unable to translocate into the cell interior. Hence for peptide- and protein-based therapeutics a direct intracytoplasmic delivery with the aid of transducing agents is an attractive approach. We wanted to deliver to the cell interior a putatively cytotoxic protein VPg. Protein transduction was achieved in vitro with three different commercial products. However, in our hands, delivery of various control proteins without known deleterious effects, as well as of protein VPg, always induced cell death. Finally, we used a novel transducing peptide Wr-T, which was not toxic to cultured cells, even in a quite large range of concentrations. Most importantly, control protein delivered to cells in culture did not display any toxicity while VPg protein exerted a strong cytotoxic effect. These data show that results obtained with cell-penetrating agents should be interpreted with caution.
