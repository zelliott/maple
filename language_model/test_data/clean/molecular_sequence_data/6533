We have previously identified a testicular phosphoprotein that binds to highly conserved sequences (Y and H elements) in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of testicular mRNAs and suppresses in vitro translation of mRNA constructs that contain these sequences. This protein, testis/brain RNA-binding protein (TB-RBP) also is abundant in brain and binds to brain mRNAs whose 3' UTRs contain similar sequences. Here we show that TB-RBP binds specific mRNAs to microtubules (MTs) in vitro. When TB-RBP is added to MTs reassembled from either crude brain extracts or from purified tubulin, most of the TB-RBP binds to MTs. The association of TB-RBP with MTs requires the assembly of MTs and is diminished by colcemid, cytochalasin D, and high levels of salt. Transcripts from the 3' UTRs of three mRNAs that contain the conserved sequence elements (transcripts for protamine 2, tau protein, and myelin basic protein) are linked by TB-RBP to MTs, whereas transcripts that lack the conserved sequences do not bind TB-RBP. We conclude that TB-RBP serves as an attachment protein for the MT association of specific mRNAs. Considering its ability to arrest translation in vitro, we propose that TB-RBP functions in the storage and transportation of mRNAs to specific intracellular sites where they are translated.
