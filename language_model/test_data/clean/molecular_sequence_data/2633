A general method to directly obtain the DNA sequence of the variable regions of any immunoglobulin chain using a mixture of oligomer primers and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is described. Mixed oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5' signal peptide and a conserved 3' constant region primer were used for enzymatic amplification of each of the heavy and light chain variable regions of a human hybridoma producing a monoclonal antibody recognizing an epitope of gp120 of the human immunodeficiency virus 1. The amplified DNA segments were cloned and the sequence was determined for the heavy chain variable region. This method will greatly facilitate structural and functional studies of immunoglobulins by reducing the effort to clone and sequence the members of the immunoglobulin as well as other multigene families.
