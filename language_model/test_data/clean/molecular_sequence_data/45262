In anural (tailless) ascidian species, functional embryonic muscle is not formed. In urodele (tailed) ascidians, macho-1 functions as a maternally supplied factor for embryonic muscle formation. The failure of embryonic muscle development in anural ascidians may be due to the suppression of macho-1 expression. In this paper, however, we report the expression of macho-1 in embryos of an anural ascidian, Molgula tectiformis. Although M. tectiformis has lost the developmental potential to form functional embryonic muscle, macho-1 was expressed in a very similar manner as in urodele ascidians. This result, together with those of previous studies, strongly suggests that in M. tectiformis the upstream genetic cascade responsible for muscle formation is intact, while the downstream cascade including the expression of muscle structural genes is severely affected.
