A random primed lambda gt11-cDNA library was constructed from donors plasma presumably infected by blood-borne non-A, non-B hepatitis (hepatitis C:HC) agent and immunoscreened with serum pooled from patients with acute or chronic HC. Twelve lambda gt11-cDNA clones encoding antigens associated with HC infection in Japan as well as in the USA were isolated. Of these one clone consisting of 114 nucleotides and showing a discrete band on an immunoblot analysis, was extensively studied. The clone is not derived from the host DNA encoding one polypeptide specific and highly sensitive for serum from patients with HC and has no homology to the nucleotide sequences of known human viruses including hepatitis A,B and D viruses, Ebstein-Barr virus, coxsackievirus, immunodeficiency virus type 1 or Japanese encephalitis virus. These results suggest that this clone is derived from the genome of HC agent.
