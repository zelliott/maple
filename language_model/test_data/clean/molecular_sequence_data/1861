A new member of the tandem-pore K+ (K(2P)) channel family has been isolated from mouse testis complementary DNA. The new K(2P) channel was named TRESK-2, as its amino acid sequence shares 65% identity with that of TRESK-1. Mouse TRESK-2 is a 394-amino acid protein and possesses four putative transmembrane segments and two pore-forming domains. TRESK-2 has a long cytoplasmic domain joining the second and third transmembrane segments and a short carboxyl terminus. In the rat, TRESK-2 mRNA transcripts were expressed abundantly in the thymus and spleen and at low levels in many other tissues, including heart, small intestine, skeletal muscle, uterus, testis, and placenta, as judged by Northern blot analysis. TRESK-2 mRNA was also expressed in mouse and human tissues. In COS-7 cells transfected with TRESK-2 DNA, a time-independent and noninactivating K+-selective current was recorded. TRESK-2 was insensitive to 1 mm tetraethylammonium, 100 nm apamin, 1 mm 4-aminopyridine, and 10 microm glybenclamide. TRESK-2 was inhibited by 10 microm quinidine, 20 microm arachidonate and acid (pH 6.3) at 49, 43, and 23%, respectively. Single channel openings of TRESK-2 showed marked open channel noise. In symmetrical 150 mm KCl, the current-voltage relationship of TRESK-2 was slightly inwardly rectifying, with the single channel conductance 13 picosiemens (pS) at +60 mV and 16 pS at -60 mV. In inside-out patches, TRESK-2 was unaffected by the intracellular application of 10 microm guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate). These results show that TRESK-2 is a functional member of the K(2P) channel family and contributes to the background K+ conductance in many types of cells.
