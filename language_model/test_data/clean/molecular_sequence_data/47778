The presence of lactate oxidase was examined in eight Streptococcus species and some related species of bacteria. A clone (pGR002) was isolated from a genomic library of Streptococcus iniae generated in Escherichia coli, containing a DNA fragment spanning two genes designated lctO and lctP. We show that these genes are likely to be involved in the L-lactic acid aerobic metabolism of this organism. This DNA fragment has been sequenced and characterized. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of LctP protein demonstrated that the protein had significant homology with the L-lactate permeases of other bacteria. The amino acid sequence of the LctO protein of S. iniae also showed a strong homology to L-lactate oxidase from Aerococcus viridans and some NAD-independent lactate dehydrogenases, all belonging to the family of flavin mononucleotide-dependent alpha-hydroxyacid-oxidizing enzymes. Biochemical assays of the gene products confirm the identity of the genes from the isolated DNA fragment and reveal a possible role for the lactate oxidase from S. iniae. This lactate oxidase is discussed in relation to the growth of the organism in response to carbon source availability.
