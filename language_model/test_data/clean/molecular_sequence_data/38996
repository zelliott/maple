The molecular epidemiology of small round structured viruses (SRSVs) in Germany was studied using fecal specimens from 16 SRSV-associated gastroenteritis outbreaks in different parts of Germany during 1997/1998 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and by sequencing of the ORF1 and ORF3 amplicons. The majority of the isolates clustered in one subtype and were closely related to published SRSV sequences of genogroup II.
