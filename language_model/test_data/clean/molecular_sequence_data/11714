The molecular weights of trypsin and chymotrypsin purified from anchovy viscera were estimated to be 25.6 and 26.1 Kda, respectively, by SDS-PAGE. Both enzymes had their maximal activity at pH 9.0 and 45 degrees C for casein and at pH 8.0 and 45 degrees C for synthetic substrates. Trypsin hydrolyzed at the position of Arg22 and Lys29, and chymotrypsin did at the position of Phe1, Tyr16, Phe24, Phe25, and Tyr26 of insulin beta-chain. The K'm and kcat of trypsin were 50 microM and 1.84 microM-1 min-1 toward N-benzoyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide (BAPNA) and those of chymotrypsin were 89 microM and 10.0 microM-1min-1 toward N-succinyl-(Ala)2-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide. The activation energy of trypsin and chymotrypsin were estimated to be 14 Kcal/mol toward N-benzoyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide and 6.5 Kcal/mol toward benzoyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester.
