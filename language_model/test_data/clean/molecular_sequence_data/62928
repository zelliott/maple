Multiple chitinases as well as lectins closely related to them have been characterized previously from many insect species and the corresponding genes/cDNAs have been cloned. However, the identification of the entire assortment of genes for chitinase family proteins and their differences in biochemical properties have not been carried out in any individual insect species. The completion of the entire DNA sequence of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) genome and identification of open reading frames presents an opportunity to study the structures and functions of chitinase-like proteins, and also to identify new members of this family in Drosophila. We are, therefore, interested in studying the functional genomics of chitinase-like gene families in insects.

We searched the Drosophila protein sequences database using fully characterized insect chitinase sequences and BLASTP software, identified all the putative chitinase-like proteins encoded in Drosophila genome, and predicted their structures using domain analysis tools. A phylogenetic analysis of the chitinase-like proteins from Drosophila and several other insect species was carried out. The structures of these chitinases were modeled using homology modeling software.

Our analysis revealed the presence of 18 chitinase-like proteins in the Drosophila protein database. Among these are seven novel chitinase-like proteins that contain four signature amino acid sequences of chitinases belonging to family 18 glycosylhydrolases, including both acidic and hydrophobic amino acid residues critical for enzyme activity. All the proteins contain at least one catalytic domain with one having four catalytic domains. Phylogenetic analysis of chitinase-like proteins from Drosophila and other insects revealed an evolutionary relationship among all these proteins, which indicated gene duplication and domain shuffling to generate the observed diversity in the encoded proteins. Homology modeling showed that all the Drosophila chitinase-like proteins contain one or more catalytic domains with a (alpha/beta)8 barrel-like structure. Our results suggest that insects utilize multiple family 18 chitinolytic enzymes and also non-enzymatic chitinase-like proteins for degrading/remodeling/binding to chitin in different insect anatomical extracellular structures, such as the cuticle, peritrophic membrane, trachea and mouth parts during insect development, and possibly for other roles including chitin synthesis.
