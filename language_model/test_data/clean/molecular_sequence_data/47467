The identification of human tumor-associated antigens has opened new avenues for immune intervention in cancer. Clinical trials using synthetic peptides that match segments of known tumor-associated proteins are ongoing. Alternatively, naturally processed peptides, obtained by acid treatment of tumor cells can be used. Here, Matteo Bellone and colleagues discuss the advantages and disadvantages of synthetic versus natural tumor peptides in cancer immunotherapy.
