The Bartha strain of pseudorabies virus has several recognized mutations, including a deletion in the unique short region encompassing the glycoprotein I (gI), gE, Us9, and Us2 genes and point mutations in the gC, gM, and UL21 genes. We have determined that Bartha has mutations in the serine/threonine kinase encoded by the Us3 gene relative to the wild-type Becker strain. Our analysis revealed that Becker virions contain the Us3 protein, whereas Bartha virions do not. To test whether the mutations in the Bartha Us3 protein were responsible for this observation, we constructed a recombinant Bartha strain, PRV632, which expresses the Becker Us3 protein. PRV632 failed to package Us3 into the tegument, indicating that mutations other than those in the Us3 primary amino acid sequence were responsible for the failure of Bartha to package its Us3 protein. A recombinant Becker strain, PRV634, which expresses the Bartha Us3 protein, was constructed to test whether it was capable of being packaged into virions. The Bartha Us3 protein was not incorporated into PRV634 virions efficiently, suggesting that the primary sequence of the Bartha Us3 protein affects packaging into the tegument. To determine whether the packaging of other tegument proteins was affected in the Bartha strain, we examined VP22. Whereas Becker packaged VP22 into virions, Bartha had a severe deficiency in VP22 incorporation. Analysis of VP22 expression in Bartha-infected cells revealed that Bartha VP22 had a slower mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, indicating either primary sequence differences and/or different posttranslational modifications relative to Becker VP22. Taken together, these data indicate that, while the primary sequence of the Us3 protein does affect its incorporation into the tegument, other factors are involved. Furthermore, our data suggest that one or more of the gI, gE, Us9, or Us2 genes influences the localization of the Us3 protein in infected cells, and this effect may be important for the proper incorporation of Us3 into virions.
