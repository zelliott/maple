Gram-negative bacteria harboring KPC-2, a class A β-lactamase, are resistant to all β-lactam antibiotics and pose a major public health threat. Arg-164 is a conserved residue in all class A β-lactamases and is located in the solvent-exposed Ω-loop of KPC-2. To probe the role of this amino acid in KPC-2, we performed site-saturation mutagenesis. When compared with wild type, 11 of 19 variants at position Arg-164 in KPC-2 conferred increased resistance to the oxyimino-cephalosporin, ceftazidime (minimum inhibitory concentration; 32→128 mg/liter) when expressed in Escherichia coli. Using the R164S variant of KPC-2 as a representative β-lactamase for more detailed analysis, we observed only a modest 25% increase in k(cat)/K(m) for ceftazidime (0.015→0.019 μm(-1) s(-1)). Employing pre-steady-state kinetics and mass spectrometry, we determined that acylation is rate-limiting for ceftazidime hydrolysis by KPC-2, whereas deacylation is rate-limiting in the R164S variant, leading to accumulation of acyl-enzyme at steady-state. CD spectroscopy revealed that a conformational change occurred in the turnover of ceftazidime by KPC-2, but not the R164S variant, providing evidence for a different form of the enzyme at steady state. Molecular models constructed to explain these findings suggest that ceftazidime adopts a unique conformation, despite preservation of Ω-loop structure. We propose that the R164S substitution in KPC-2 enhances ceftazidime resistance by proceeding through "covalent trapping" of the substrate by a deacylation impaired enzyme with a lower K(m). Future antibiotic design must consider the distinctive behavior of the Ω-loop of KPC-2.
