The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in humans and chimpanzees includes three classical class I loci, A, B and C, which encode glycoproteins expressed on the surface of all nucleated cells. There are also several nonclassical class I loci including E, which have more limited expression. By analyzing published sequences, we have shown that in exons 4 and 5, A locus alleles from both humans and chimpanzees are much more similar to E than to B or C alleles, whereas in exons 2 and 3 alleles from all three classical class I loci are much more similar to each other than any one is to E. We propose that some 20 million years ago, interlocus recombination led to the formation of a hybrid gene in which exons 2 and 3 were derived from the original A locus and exons 4 and 5 were derived from the E locus. The fact that such an ancient event can still be detected suggests that interlocus recombination is rare in the MHC and does not significantly contribute to MHC polymorphism, which is known to be extremely high. The present finding, however, supports Gilbert's idea that exons in a gene may occasionally be replaced by those from another gene in the evolutionary process.
