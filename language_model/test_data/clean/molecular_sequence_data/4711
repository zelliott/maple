The yolk protein (yp) genes encode the major nutritional polypeptides deposited in developing oocytes for subsequent utilization during embryogenesis, and represent a highly conserved family of genes in higher Diptera. Originally isolated from Drosophila melanogaster, they are expressed in a temporal-, tissue- and sex-specific manner in all species in which they have been identified. We report here the isolation of cDNAs encoding three independent yolk proteins from the common housefly, Musca domestica. Expression of the three M. domestica yp genes is analysed both by Northern and in-situ hybridization. We discuss in an evolutionary context both the significance of the expression patterns, and regions of apparent polypeptide sequence divergence.
