Analysis of protein glycosylation within the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has revealed an abundant and unreported set of core chitobiose modifications (CCMs) to N-linked glycans. With hydrazine release, an array of glycomers and isobars were detected with hexose extensions on the 3- and 3,6-positions of the penultimate and reducing terminus, respectively. A full complement of structures includes a range of glycomers possessing a Galbeta(1-4)Fuc disaccharide at the 3- and 6-positions of the protein-linked GlcNAc. Importantly, enzymatic (PNGase F/A) release failed to liberate many of these extended structures from reduced and alkylated peptides and, as a consequence, such profiles were markedly deficient in a representation of the worm glycome. Moreover, the 3-linked Galbeta(1-4)Fuc moiety was notably resistant to a range of commercial galactosidases. For identification, the fragments were spectrum-matched with synthetic products and library standards using sequential mass spectrometry (MS(n)). A disaccharide observed at the 3-position of penultimate GlcNAc, indicating a Hex-Fuc branch on some structures, was not further characterized because of low ion abundance in MS(n). Additionally, a Hex-Hex-Fuc trisaccharide on the 6-position of proximal GlcNAc was also distinguished on select glycomers. Similar branch extensions on 6-linked core fucosyl residues have recently been reported among other invertebrates. Natural methylation and numerous isobars complement the glycome, which totals well over 100 individual structures. Complex glycans were detected at lower abundance, indicating glucosaminyltransferase-I (GnT-I) and GnT-II activity. A range of phosphorylcholine (PC)-substituted complex glycans were also confirmed following a signature two-stage loss of PC during MS(n) analysis, although the precursor ion was not observed in the mass profiles. In a similar manner, numerous other minor glycans may be present but unobserved in hydrazine-release profiles dominated by fucosylated structures. All CCM structures, including multiple isomers, were determined without chromatography by gas-phase disassembly (MS(n)) in Paul and linear ion trap (IT) instruments.
