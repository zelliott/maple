The first mollusc mRNA coding G-protein-coupled transmembrane receptor (GPcapital ES, CyrillicR), homologous to human receptors LUSTR 1 (GPR107) and LUSTR 2 (GPR108), was isolated from haemocytes of common periwinkle Littorina littorea. The analyses showed that the full-length cDNA is 1935 bp long and is predicted to encode a 614 amino acid protein (named Lit-LUSTR) with a calculated molecular mass of 69.6 kDa and theoretical isoelectric point 7.59. Pair-wise comparisons between Lit-LUSTR and LUSTR proteins from human or mouse have approximately 38% identity and 56% similarity. Lit-LUSTR clusters with LUSTR-A sub-family proteins and is a first characterization of proteins containing Lung7TM-R domain in Mollusca. Significant differences were found between the Lit-LUSTR mRNA levels in haemocytes of healthy periwinkles and those naturally infected with the echinostome trematode Himasthla elongata. Down regulated expression of the LUSTR-like receptor caused by infection illustrates modification of the haemocyte receptor system and may be attributed to the previously demonstrated greater numbers of "immature" haemocytes in the circulation of infected snails.
