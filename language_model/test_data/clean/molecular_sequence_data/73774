The HLA-B locus is the most polymorphic locus known with currently over 100 different alleles described. Many of these alleles encode variants of the serologically-defined tissue transplantation antigens. This high level of diversity makes accurate tissue typing difficult. Here we present the sequence of a new HLA-B*08 variant, HLA-B*0804, found in Caucasian siblings JH and PF serologically typed as HLA-B51/B59 and HLA-B59/B60, respectively. Additionally, DNA-based typing by the polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) identified HLA-B*51 in JH and HLA-B*4001 in PF. However, PCR-SSP failed to identify a second allele in either of these individuals. The unusual finding of a B59 antigen in a Caucasian and the discrepant molecular typing results suggested that these individuals might express novel HLA molecules. Using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) followed by direct sequencing, we characterized a novel HLA-B*08 variant, HLA-B*0804. The presence of this allele was confirmed by cloning and sequencing. HLA-B*0804 differed from HLA-B*0801 by only one nucleotide substitution resulting in an amino acid replacement of phenylalanine by serine at position 67. Incidentally, this single nucleotide difference was sufficient to prevent amplification by PCR-SSP. This striking difference between both the serologically typed antigen and the PCR-SSP-identified allele compared to the sequenced allele supports the use of sequence-based typing for the analysis of HLA class I locus alleles.
