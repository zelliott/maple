MH61 is an acrosome-reacted sperm-specific monoclonal antibody. The antibody-coated beads effectively analyze the acrosomal status of human sperm. However, the nature of the antigen was not known. The antigen was purified by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE followed by blotting on PVDF paper. The N-terminal sequence of the antigen was analyzed by an automated protein sequencer. An exactly matching sequence was found in CD46, that is also known as a membrane cofactor protein.
