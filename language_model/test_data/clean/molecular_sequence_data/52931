Intercellular transfer of plasmid DNA during bacterial conjugation initiates and terminates at a specific origin of transfer, oriT. We have investigated the oriT structure of conjugative plasmid R64 with regard to the initiation and termination of DNA transfer. Using recombinant plasmids containing two tandemly repeated R64 oriT sequences with or without mutations, the subregions required for initiation and termination were determined by examining conjugation-mediated deletion between the repeated oriTs. The oriT subregion required for initiation was found to be identical to the 44-bp oriT core sequence consisting of two units, the conserved nick region sequence and the 17-bp repeat A sequence, that are recognized by R64 relaxosome proteins NikB and NikA, respectively. In contrast, the nick region sequence and two sets of inverted repeat sequences within the 92-bp minimal oriT sequence were required for efficient termination. Mutant repeat A sequences lacking NikA-binding ability were found to be sufficient for termination, suggesting that the inverted repeat structures are involved in the termination process. A duplication of the DNA segment between the repeated oriTs was also found after mobilization of the plasmid carrying initiation-deficient but termination-proficient oriT and initiation-proficient but termination-deficient oriT, suggesting that the 3' terminus of the transferred strand is elongated by rolling-circle-DNA synthesis.
