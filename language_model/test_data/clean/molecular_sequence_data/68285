We report gene transfer to the Edinburgh insertional mutant mouse (cf/cf), delivering CFTR cDNA-liposome complexes into the airways by nebulization. We show full restoration of cAMP related chloride responses in some animals and demonstrate, in the same tissues, human CFTR cDNA expression. Overall, a range of correction was seen with restoration of about 50% of the deficit between wild type mice and untreated cf/cf controls. We report modest correction in the intestinal tract following direct instillation and provide initial encouraging safety data for both the respiratory and intestinal tract following the liposome mediated gene delivery. The non-viral nature and potentially lower immunogenicity of DNA-liposomes suggest that this may offer a therapeutic alternative to adenoviral therapies.
