Ribosomal proteins contribute to the regulation and activity of ribosomes, and hence, the translational activity of the cell. Aberrant expression of ribosomal proteins has been linked to certain pathological conditions such as neoplasms. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA for the ribosomal protein (rp) S19 from a marine bivalve, the soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria), and we have examined its pattern of mRNA expression in the ovary and testis. The S19 cDNA contains a 450 nucleotide (nt) open reading frame (ORF), flanked by 89 nt and 26 nt of 5' and 3' untranslated regions, respectively. Probes synthesized from the S19 cDNA recognize a single transcript of approximately 550 nt in four different tissues. The predicted amino acid sequence from the ORF exhibits 58% identity with human and rat S19. Southern analysis of genomic DNA suggests that M. arenaria may have multiple copies of S19, a feature that is more similar to vertebrate than invertebrate rp genes. Expression of S19 mRNA in both ovary and testis was elevated throughout gametogenesis until after spawning, when a decrease in S19 message was observed. A comparison of S19 mRNA levels in post-spawn animals revealed a trend of elevated expression in ovaries and testes affected by a gonadal neoplasm, indicating that S19 may be a useful molecular marker for the pathological condition.
