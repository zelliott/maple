The two final steps of meta-cleavage pathway for catechol degradation involve conversion of 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate, via acetaldehyde, to acetyl coenzyme A. We report here the complete nucleotide sequences and overexpression of the phnIJ genes for an acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acylating) (ADA) and a 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase (HOA) from the meta-pathway operon of the phenanthrene-degrading bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. strain DJ77. Additional partial sequence analysis of adjacent DNA shows the gene order within the operon to be phnHIJ, identical to the order found for the isofunctional genes in the other meta-pathway operons. The deduced amino acid sequences of the PhnI (312 amino acids) and PhnJ (343 amino acids) have identities of 51-71% with the corresponding genes of dmp, xyl, nah, bph_LB400, bph_KKS102, tod, cum, cmt, and MTCY03C7 operons. The phylogenetic analyses reveal the evolutionary relationships of HOA and ADA.
