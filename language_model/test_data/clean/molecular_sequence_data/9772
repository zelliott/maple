Rat p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cDNA was isolated from rat kidney cDNA library using a PCR cloning strategy. The deduced amino acid sequence consists of 360 amino acids and shares 95.3% similarity with human p38 MAP kinase. The message for rat p38 MAP kinase was about 3.4 kilobases and was highly expressed in the kidney. In water-deprived rat kidneys, the steady-state levels of p38 MAP kinase mRNA increased about 2.7-fold as compared with those of control rats. This result suggests that p38 MAP kinase may play an important role in the osmoregulation in the kidney.
