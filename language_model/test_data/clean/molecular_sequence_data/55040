Acetylated polymannan polysaccharide (ApmP) isolated from Aloe barbadensis Miller contains a stable peroxidase that was solubilized to investigate its biochemical, electrophoretic, immunological, and proteomic properties. In the electrophoretic band corresponding to the solubilized peroxidase, proteomic analysis detected seven tryptic peptides that matched homologous peptides covering one third of the ATP22a peroxidase of Arabidopsis thaliana. All the characteristics tested indicated that the activity stabilized within the ApmP pertains to the basic secretory peroxidase family, which includes members that have several biotechnological uses. Hence ApmP might yield a widely used peroxidase in stabilized form.
