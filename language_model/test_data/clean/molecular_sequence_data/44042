Vitronectin is a multifunctional serum protein which provides a unique regulatory link between cell adhesion, humoral defense mechanism and the hemostatic system, and the heparin-binding properties of vitronectin are thought to have participated in various functional aspects. In addition to the carboxy-terminal glycosaminoglycan-binding motif, we report on two novel heparin-binding domains which were identified using phage display technique. One heparin-binding domain is located between amino acids Asp82 and Cys137 at the end of the connector region, while the other is in the second hemopexin-type repeat, between amino acids Lys175 and Asp219 of the vitronectin molecule. Our findings may shed new light to the activities of vitronectin and its binding to cells, which could not be explained solely on the basis of the known heparin-binding domain.
