The Aquifex aeolicus alphabeta-LeuRS is the only known heterodimeric class Ia aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. In this study, we investigated the function of the beta subunit which is believed to bind tRNA(Leu). A yeast three-hybrid system was constructed on the basis of the interaction of the beta subunit with its cognate tRNA(Leu). Then, seven mutated beta subunits exhibiting impaired tRNA binding capacities were selected out from a randomly mutated library. Two mutations were identified in the class Ia-helix-bundle-domain, which might interact with the D-hairpin of the tRNA analogous to other class Ia tRNA:synthetases complexes. The five other mutations were found in the LeuRS-specific C-terminal domain of which the folding is still unknown. tRNA affinity measurements and kinetic analyses performed on the isolated beta subunits and on the co-expressed alphabeta-heterodimers showed for all the mutants an effect in tRNA affinity in the ground state. In addition, an effect on the transition state of the aminoacylation reaction was observed for a 21-residues deletion mutant of the C-terminal end. These results show that the genetic approach of the three hybrid system is widely applicable and is a powerful tool for the investigation of tRNA:synthetase interactions.
