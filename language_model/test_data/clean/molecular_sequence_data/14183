We employed a heterologous secretion assay to identify proteins potentially secreted by type III secretion systems (T3SSs) in Vibrio parahaemolyticus. N-terminal sequences from 32 proteins within T3SS genomic islands and seven proteins from elsewhere in the chromosome included proteins that were recognized for export by the Yersinia enterocolitica flagellar T3SS.
