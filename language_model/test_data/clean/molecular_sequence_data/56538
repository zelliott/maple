Nucleotide sequence analysis of rhesus macaque major histocompatibility complex class I cDNAs allowed the identification of the orthologue of HLA-F, designated Mamu-F. Comparison of Mamu-F with earlier published human and chimpanzee orthologues demonstrated that these sequences share a high degree of similarity, both at the nucleotide and amino acid level, whereas a New World monkey (cotton-top tamarin) equivalent is more distantly related. Exon 7, encoding one of the cytoplasmatic domains, is absent for all primate Mhc-F cDNA sequences analyzed so far. In contrast to the human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque equivalents, the cotton-top tamarin Saoe-F gene seems to have accumulated far more nonsynonymous than synonymous differences.
