The complete amino acid sequence of cassowary (Casuarius casuarius) goose type lysozyme was analyzed by direct protein sequencing of peptides obtained by cleavage with trypsin, V8 protease, chymotrypsin, lysyl endopeptidase, and cyanogen bromide. The N-terminal residue of the enzyme was deduced to be a pyroglutamate group by analysis with a LC/MS/MS system equipped with the oMALDI ionization source, and then confirmed by a glutamate aminopeptidase enzyme. The blocked N-terminal is the first reported in this enzyme group. The positions of disulfide bonds in this enzyme were chemically identified as Cys4-Cys60 and Cys18-Cys29. Cassowary lysozyme was proved to consist of 185 amino acid residues and had a molecular mass of 20408 Da calculated from the amino acid sequence. The amino acid sequence of cassowary lysozyme compared to that of reported G-type lysozymes had identities of 90%, 83%, and 81%, for ostrich, goose, and black swan lysozymes, respectively. The amino acid substitutions at PyroGlu1, Glu19, Gly40, Asp82, Thr102, Thr156, and Asn167 were newly detected in this enzyme group. The substituted amino acids that might contribute to substrate binding were found at subsite B (Asn122Ser, Phe123Met). The amino acid sequences that formed three alpha-helices and three beta-sheets were completely conserved. The disulfide bond locations and catalytic amino acid were also strictly conserved. The conservation of the three alpha-helices structures and the location of disulfide bonds were considered to be important for the formation of the hydrophobic core structure of the catalytic site and for maintaining a similar three-dimensional structure in this enzyme group.
