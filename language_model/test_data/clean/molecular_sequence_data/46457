The rhesus macaque (RM) model has the potential to be an invaluable tool for studying B cell populations during pathogenic infections, however, to date, there has been no definitive delineation of naïve and memory B cell populations in the RM. This has precluded a rigorous analysis of the generation, persistence and resolution of a pathogen-specific memory B cell response. The present study utilized multiple analyses to demonstrate that CD27 expression on B cells is consistent with a memory phenotype. Compared to CD20+CD27- B cells, CD20+CD27+ B cells were larger in size, and preferentially accumulated at effector sites. Direct sequence analysis revealed that CD20+CD27+ B cells had an increased frequency of point mutations that were consistent with somatic hypermutation and at a functional level, CD40 ligation improved CD20+CD27- but not CD20+CD27+ B cell survival in vitro. These data provide definitive evidence that the naïve and memory B cell populations of the RM can be differentiated using surface expression of CD27.
