Iterative profile sequence analysis reveals a remote homology of peroxisomal serine-pyruvate aminotransferases from mammals to the small subunit of soluble hydrogenases from cyanobacteria, an isopenicillin N epimerase, the NifS gene products from bacteria and yeast, and the phosphoserine aminotransferase family. All members of this new class whose function is known are pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes, yet they have distinct catalytic activities. Upon alignment, a lysine around position 200 remains invariant and is predicted to be the pyridoxal phosphate-binding residue. Based on the detected homology, it is predicted that NifS has also a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent serine (or related) aminotransferase function associated with nitrogen economy and/or protection during nitrogen fixation.
