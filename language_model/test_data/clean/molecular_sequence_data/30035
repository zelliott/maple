The genes encoding the variable, joining and constant regions of human immunoglobulin light chains have been localized to the short arm of chromosome 2. However, several VK genes lie outside of the locus: a single copy cluster of five VK genes is located on chromosome 22; an isolated but amplified VkI gene is found on chromosome 1; and several isolated VkI genes are on as-yet-unidentified chromosomes other than chromosome 2. Vk genes not contained within the kappa locus are termed orphons. We have attempted to gain insight into the mechanism of transposition of both the chromosome 22 cluster and the several amplified VkI genes by searching in the kappa locus for a parent copy of the former, and by analyzing the junctions between transposed VKI-containing segments and adjacent non-amplified regions. The chromosome 22 orphon cluster must have been non-duplicatively transposed. Sequence features at the junctions of this and other orphon regions are direct and inverted repeats, and, in one case, an Alu repeat. These unusual features may have predisposed the orphon regions to transposition by serving as target sites for enzymes involved in recombination.
