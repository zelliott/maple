On the average, 30% of the residues in a protein are members of peptidic palindromes, tripeptidic and longer. This percentage may go up to 50% in histones and certain other DNA binding proteins. The longest peptidic palindrome encountered thus far was 14 residues in length. However, there is every reason to expect even longer peptidic palindromes in other proteins not yet analyzed.
