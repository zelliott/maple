The F-box protein CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) plays a central role in jasmonate (JA) signaling and is required for all JA responses in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). To dissect JA signal transduction, we isolated the partially suppressing coi1 (psc1) mutant, which partially suppressed coi1 insensitivity to JA inhibition of root growth. The psc1 mutant partially restored JA sensitivity in coi1-2 background and displayed JA hypersensitivity in wild-type COI1 background. Genetic mapping, sequence analysis, and complementation tests revealed that psc1 is a leaky mutation of DWARF4 (DWF4) that encodes a key enzyme in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis. Physiological analysis showed that an application of exogenous BR eliminated the partial restoration of JA sensitivity by psc1 in coi1-2 background and the JA hypersensitivity of psc1 in wild-type COI1 background. Exogenous BR also attenuated JA inhibition of root growth in the wild type. In addition, the expression of DWF4 was inhibited by JA, and this inhibition was dependent on COI1. These results indicate that (1) BR is involved in JA signaling and negatively regulates JA inhibition of root growth, and (2) the DWF4 is down-regulated by JA and is located downstream of COI1 in the JA-signaling pathway.
