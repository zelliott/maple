The DNA coding for the puff-specific protein Bj6 has been isolated by expression cloning. The gene is localized in 14C1,2 on the X chromosome and is expressed ubiquitously during embryonic development with prominent expression during the first 12 h of embryogenesis. cDNA and genomic clones have been sequenced and show a single open-reading frame of 2.1 kb length, coding for a Mr = 77,000 basic protein. In the aminoterminal half of the protein we detect stretches of repeated amino acids, centrally a region with homology to RNA-binding proteins containing the RNP 1 and RNP 2 consensus motif of RNA binding proteins, and the carboxyterminal part is rich in charged amino acids. The Bj6 protein is a product of the gene no-on transient A, a gene required for normal vision and courtship behaviour in Drosophila.
