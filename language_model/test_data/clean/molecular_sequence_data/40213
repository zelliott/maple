A three dimensional model was developed for Cry10Aa protein sequence of B. thuringiensis LDC-9 and B. thuringiensis israelensis that has not been solved empirically by X-ray crystallography or NMR. Homology modeling was employed for the structure prediction using Cry2Aa as template protein, a high-resolution X-ray crystallography structure. The model predicted for the B. thuringiensis LDC-9 Cry10Aa protein reveals a partial N-terminal domain only due to its partial sequence of 104 amino acids. B. thuringiensis israelensis Cry10Aa model contains three domains such as domain I, a bundle of eight alpha helices with the central relatively hydrophobic helix surrounded by amphipathic helices while domain II and III contain mostly beta-sheets. Significant structural differences within domain II in this model among all Cry protein structures indicates that it is involved in recognition and binding to cell surfaces. Comparison of B. thuringiensis israelensis predicted structure with available experimentally determined Cry structures reveals identical folds. The distribution of electrostatic potential on the surface of the molecules in the model is non-uniform and identifies one side of the alpha-helical domain as negatively charged indicating orientation of toxic molecules toward the cell membrane during the initial binding with a cell surface receptor. The collective knowledge of Cry toxin structures will lead to a more critical understanding of the structural basis for receptor binding and pore formation, as well as allowing the scope of diversity to be better appreciated. This model will serve as a starting point for the design of mutagenesis experiments aimed to improve the toxicity and to provide a new tool for the elucidation of the mechanism of action of these mosquitocidal proteins.
