Ferredoxin was purified from cells of Hydrogenobacter thermophilus strain TK-6. Purification was performed aerobically by the addition of octyl-beta-glucoside to the buffers. The purified ferredoxin had a molecular mass of 13,000 and contained a [4F3-4S] cluster. The protein had a long stretch at the N-terminal region; however, the sequence was not similar to the sequences of ferredoxins with a long stretch from Archaebacteria.
