We examined six human short tandem repeat (STR) loci (c-fms proto-oncogene for CSF-1 receptor, CSF1PO; thyroid peroxidase, TPOX; tyrosine hydroxylase, TH01; coagulation factor XIII a subunit, F13A01; c-fes/fps proto-oncogene, FESFPS and von Willebrand factor, vWA) in the Japanese macaque, Macaca fuscata, using commercially available human STR kits. No products were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the human CSF1PO, TH01, FESFPS and vWA primers. Macaque DNAs were amplified with human TPOX and F13A01 primers. Macaque PCR products amplified with the TPOX and F13A01 primers migrated more slowly than human ones during electrophoresis. Sequencing results showed that the nucleotide sequences of the counterpart of the TPOX and F13A01 STR loci in the Japanese macaque were closely similar to those of the human genes except for tandem repeat regions. The macaque products amplified with human TPOX and F13A01 primers were highly polymorphic, with four variants of the former and 15 variants of the latter in the nine samples. These results indicate that the commercially available kits can be used to discriminate the Japanese macaque samples from human samples.
