To facilitate genus and species level identification of a broad range of bacteria without the requirement of presumptive identification, we have developed a unified set of primers and polymerase chain reaction conditions to amplify spacer regions between the 16S and 23S genes in the prokaryotic rRNA genetic loci. Spacer regions within these loci show a significant level of length and sequence polymorphism across both genus and species lines. A generic pair of priming sequences was selected for the amplification of these polymorphisms from highly conserved sequences in the 16S and 23S genes occurring adjacent to these polymorphic regions. This single set of primers and reaction conditions was used for the amplification of 16S-23S spacer regions for over 300 strains of bacteria belonging to eight genera and 28 species or serotypes, including Listeria, Staphylococcus, and Salmonella species and additional species related to these pathogenic organisms. When the spacer amplification products were resolved by electrophoresis, the resulting patterns could be used to distinguish all of the species of bacteria within the test group. Unique elements in the amplification product patterns generally clustered at the species level, although some genus-specific characteristics were also observed. On the basis of the results obtained with our test group of 300 bacterial strains, amplification of the 16S-23S ribosomal spacer region is a suitable process for generating a data base for use in a polymerase chain reaction-based identification method, which can be comprehensively applied to the bacterial kingdom.
