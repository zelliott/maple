We have cloned and sequenced COX12, the nuclear gene for subunit VIb of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytochrome c oxidase. This subunit, which was previously not found in cytochrome c oxidase purified from S. cerevisiae, has a deduced amino acid sequence which is 41% identical to the sequences of subunits VIb of bovine and human cytochrome c oxidases. The chromosomal copy of COX12 was replaced with a plasmid-derived copy of COX12, in which the coding region for the suspected cytochrome oxidase subunit was replaced with the yeast URA3 gene. The resulting Ura+ deletion strain grew poorly at room temperature and was unable to grow at 37 degrees C on ethanol/glycerol medium, whereas growth was normal at both temperatures on dextrose. This temperature-dependent, petite phenotype of the deletion strain was complemented to wild-type growth with a single copy plasmid carrying COX12. Cytochrome c oxidase activity in mitochondrial membranes from the cox12 deletion strain is decreased to 5-15% of that in membranes from the wild-type parent, and this activity is restored to normal when the cox12 deletion strain is complemented by the plasmid-borne COX12. Optical spectra of mitochondrial membranes from the cox12 deletion strain revealed that optically detectable cytochrome c oxidase is assembled at room temperature and at 37 degrees C, although the heme a + a3 absorption is diminished approximately 50%. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by COX12 is identical to the N-terminal sequence of a subunit found in yeast cytochrome c oxidase purified by a new procedure (Taanman, J.-W., and Capaldi, R. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 22481-22485). We conclude that COX12 encodes a subunit of yeast cytochrome c oxidase which is essential during assembly for full cytochrome c oxidase activity but apparently can be removed after the oxidase is assembled, with retention of oxidase activity. This is the first instance in which deletion of a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase results in assembly of optically detectable cytochrome c oxidase but having markedly diminished activity.
