Seven groups, each consisting of two to nine unrelated HLA-A, -B, and -DR serologically identical individuals, were analyzed by DNA-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) in order to evaluate HLA-class II identity between unrelated individuals and to assess the importance of HLA-class II incompatibilities detected by DNA-RFLP in the allogeneic reactions. It is clear that DNA-RFLP represents a powerful typing method for HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP since the combinations of the RFLP band patterns define all the serological specificities and most of the cellular specificities to give a highly accurate typing. This report shows that an HLA-DP incompatibility induces proliferation in primary mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) between unrelated HLA-A, -B, -DR, -DQ, and -DW identical individuals, which may suggest the importance of this molecule as a transplantation antigen, especially for unrelated bone marrow transplantations. Still, an isolated HLA-DPw4/HLA-DP a disparity did not induce any proliferation in MLC. Moreover, our results show that DQw7 (w3)/DQw8 (w3) disparity associated with HLA-DR4 represents a nonfunctional incompatibility in MLR. The HLA-Dw subtypes of HLA-DR specificities can induce a high proliferative response in MLC. The HLA-Dw subtypes of HLA-DR specificities can induce a high proliferative response in MLC. Finally, DNA-RFLP typing represents a reliable method for the selection of histocompatible donor-recipient pairs and could potentially reduce many logistic problems and delays in live-donor transplantation, especially for unrelated bone marrow transplantation.
