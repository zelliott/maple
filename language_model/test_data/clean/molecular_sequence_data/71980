To better understand the virological aspect of the expanding AIDS epidemic in southern Africa, a set of 23 near-full-length clones of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) representing eight AIDS patients from Botswana were sequenced and analyzed phylogenetically. All study viruses from Botswana belonged to HIV-1 subtype C. The interpatient diversity of the clones from Botswana was higher than among full-length isolates of subtype B or among a set of full-length HIV-1 genomes of subtype C from India (mean value of 9. 1% versus 6.5 and 4.3%, respectively; P < 0.0001 for both comparisons). Similar results were observed in all genes across the entire viral genome. We suggest that the high level of HIV-1 diversity might be a typical feature of the subtype C epidemic in southern Africa. The reason or reasons for this diversity are unclear, but may include an altered replication efficiency of HIV-1 subtype C and/or the multiple introduction of different subtype C viruses.
