The 3' end of the beta-tubulin gene was amplified from 50 isolates of 45 species in Glomeromycota. The analyses included a representative selection of all families except Pacisporaceae and Geosiphonaceae. Phylogenetic analyses excluded three intron regions at the same relative positions in all species due to sequence and length polymorphisms. The beta-tubulin gene phylogeny was similar to the 18S rRNA gene phylogeny at the family and species level, but it was not concordant at the order level. Species in Gigasporaceae and Glomeraceae grouped together but without statistical support. Paralogous sequences in Glomus species likely contributed to phylogenetic ambiguity. Trees generated using different fungal phyla as out-groups yielded a concordant topology. Family relationships within the Glomeromycota did not change regardless if the third codon position was included or excluded from the analysis. Multiple clones from three isolates of Scutellospora heterogama yielded divergent sequences. However, phylogenetic patterns suggested that only a single copy of the beta-tubulin gene was present, with variation attributed to intraspecific sequence divergence.
