LuxS is responsible for the production of autoinducer 2 (AI-2), which functions in Vibrio harveyi as a quorum-sensing signal that controls the cell density-dependent expression of the lux operon. In nonluminescent organisms, the physiologic role of AI-2 is not clear. We report that inactivation of luxS in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans JP2 results in reduced growth of the mutant, but not the wild-type organism, under aerobic, iron-limited conditions. Stunted cultures of the luxS mutant A. actinomycetemcomitans JP2-12 grew to high cell density when subcultured under iron-replete conditions. In addition, the mutant strain grew to high cell density under iron limitation after transformation with a plasmid containing a functional copy of luxS. Results of real-time PCR showed that A. actinomycetemcomitans JP2-12 exhibited significantly reduced expression of afuA (eightfold), fecBCDE (10-fold), and ftnAB (>50-fold), which encode a periplasmic ferric transport protein, a putative ferric citrate transporter, and ferritin, respectively. The expressions of putative receptors for transferrin, hemoglobin, and hemophore binding protein were also reduced at more modest levels (two- to threefold). In contrast, expressions of sidD and frpB (encoding putative siderophore receptors) were increased 10- and 3-fold, respectively, in the luxS mutant. To better understand the mechanism of the AI-2 response, the A. actinomycetemcomitans genome was searched for homologs of the V. harveyi signal transduction proteins, LuxP, LuxQ, LuxU, and LuxO. Interestingly, ArcB was found to be most similar to LuxQ sensor/kinase. To determine whether arcB plays a role in the response of A. actinomycetemcomitans to AI-2, an arcB-deficient mutant was constructed. The isogenic arcB mutant grew poorly under anaerobic conditions but grew normally under aerobic iron-replete conditions. However, the arcB mutant failed to grow aerobically under iron limitation, and reverse transcriptase PCR showed that inactivation of arcB resulted in decreased expression of afuA and ftnAB. Thus, isogenic luxS and arcB mutants of A. actinomycetemcomitans exhibit similar phenotypes when cultured aerobically under iron limitation, and both mutants exhibit reduced expression of a common set of genes involved in the transport and storage of iron. These results suggest that LuxS and ArcB may act in concert to control the adaptation of A. actinomycetemcomitans to iron-limiting conditions and its growth under such conditions.
