An active site, cofactor-containing peptide has been obtained in high yield from bovine serum amine oxidase. Sequencing of this pentapeptide indicates: Leu-Asn-X-Asp-Tyr. Analysis of the peptide by mass spectrometry, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance leads to the identification of X as 6-hydroxydopa. This result indicates that, contrary to previous proposals, pyrroloquinoline quinone is not the active site cofactor in mammalian copper amine oxidases. Although 6-hydroxydopa has been implicated in neurotoxicity, the data presented suggest that this compound has a functional role at an enzyme active site.
