Transcript levels from the P5 promoter of adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV) are negatively regulated by the AAV Rep78 and Rep68 proteins in the absence of helper virus. We have identified a Rep-responsive negative cis element of the P5 promoter between the P5 TATA box and transcription start site by using 5' and 3' deletions of the P5 promoter fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. This element contains four imperfect GAGC repeats similar to the Rep recognition sequences (RRSs) in the AAV inverted terminal repeats and in the AAV preferred integration locus in chromosome 19. Band shift analyses showed that human 293 cell nuclear extracts containing Rep68 or Rep68/K340H, a putative nucleoside triphosphate (NTP)-binding-site mutant of Rep68, formed Rep-specific complexes with this P5 RRS DNA. Within the P5 RRS, mutation of a cytosine at position 273 in the AAV sequence to guanine abolished Rep68 binding to the DNA. A mutation in the P5 RRS within a full-length AAV genome, which abolished Rep binding, resulted in a 40 to 50% reduction in the ability of wild-type Rep68 to inhibit the accumulation of P5 transcripts in vivo. In contrast, the Rep68/K340H mutant was unable to down-regulate this mutated promoter. These results indicate that there are at least two mechanisms involved in the negative regulation of P5 transcript levels by Rep68; one involves Rep68 binding to the P5 RRS, and another requires the region of Rep68 containing the consensus NTP-binding motif. Furthermore, our studies of AAV genomes containing mutated RRS- and/or YY1-binding elements suggest that transcription factor YY1 binding to the transcription start site of P5 interferes with Rep68 repression of the P5 promoter.
