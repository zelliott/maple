Techniques for the transformation of halophilic archaebacteria have been developed recently and hold much promise for the characterization of these organisms at the molecular level. In order to understand genome organization and gene regulation in halobacteria, we have begun the characterization of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis in Halobacterium (Haloferax) volcanii. These studies are facilitated by the many auxotrophic mutants of H. volcanii that have been isolated. In this project we demonstrate that cosmid DNA prepared from Escherichia coli can be used to transform an H. volcanii histidine auxotroph to prototrophy. A set of cosmid clones covering most of the genome of H. volcanii was used to isolate the gene which is defective in H. volcanii WR256. Subcloning identified a 1.6-kilobase region responsible for transformation. DNA sequence analysis of this region revealed an open reading frame encoding a putative protein 361 amino acids in length. A search of the DNA and protein data bases revealed that this open reading frame encodes histidinol-phosphate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.9), the sequence of which is also known for E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
