CD8+ T cells (T(CD8+)) recognize viral Ags as short peptides (epitopes) displayed at the cell surface by MHC class I molecules. Using a panel of recombinant vaccinia viruses, we show that single-point mutations flanking either side of an H-2Kd-restricted epitope, residues 147-155, within full-length influenza nucleoprotein (NP) can impact, even ablate, presentation of that epitope, while having no effect on presentation of distal epitopes. The most severe blocking mutation (Ala to Pro at position 146) did not inhibit NP(147-155) presentation in the context of a truncated minigene, implying that this peptide is not a functional processing intermediate. An amino-terminal proline replacement also significantly reduced presentation of NP(50-57) (H-2Kk restricted), while the same mutation did not affect a third NP epitope. Thus, while trends in processing specificity may exist, the epitope itself contributes to flanking sequence effects. These findings were paralleled by in vivo priming experiments in which, depending on viral dose, subtle in vitro blocking effects were absolute. Proteasome/synthetic peptide coincubation studies support a role for enhanced epitope destruction in preventing presentation, as did the effect of the peptide aldehyde, LLnL, which restored presentation of NP(147-155) from the mutated constructs. This reagent did not inhibit epitope presentation, even from wild-type NP, suggesting that its production may be proteasome independent. These results support the notion that point mutation of epitope flanking sequence can serve as a mechanism for viral immune evasion, shed light on the mechanisms involved, and suggest that in vitro assays may not be sensitive indicators of flanking sequence effects.
