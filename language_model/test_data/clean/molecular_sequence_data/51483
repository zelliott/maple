The mouse short ear gene is required for normal growth and patterning of skeletal structures, and for repair of bone fractures in adults. We have carried out an extensive chromosome walk in the chromosome region that surrounds this locus. Here we show that the short ear region contains the gene for a TGF beta-related protein called bone morphogenetic protein 5 (Bmp-5). This gene is deleted or rearranged in several independent mutations at the short ear locus. Mice homozygous for large deletions of the Bmp-5 coding region are viable and fertile. Mutations at the short ear locus provide an important new tool for defining the normal functions of BMPs in mammals. The specific skeletal defects seen in short-eared animals, which occur against a background of otherwise normal skeletal structures, suggest that particular aspects of skeletal morphology may be determined by individual members of a family of signaling factors that can induce the formation of cartilage and bone in vivo.
