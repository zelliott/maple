Pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase (Pcp) is an aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.8) able to specifically remove the L-pyroglutamyl residue from the amino-terminus of polypeptides. Since nothing was known concerning the regulation and function of Pcps, a mutant of a milk-isolated strain lacking Pcp activity (Pseudomonas fluorescens MB1), was constructed by homologous recombination using a transcriptional fusion between pcp and a reporter gene (uidA). The wild-type and mutant strains were grown in synthetic media and in milk to investigate the environmental effects on pcp transcription. The expression of pcp and of the transcriptional fusion pcp::uidA was not sensitive to environmental conditions like temperature, osmolarity or nitrogen and phosphate starvation but was induced by the product of the enzymatic activity, pyroglutamic acid (pGlu). The expression of the native gene and the fusion in inducing conditions was also controlled by the iron concentration. The identification in the pcp promoter sequence of putative ferric uptake regulator (Fur) binding sites suggests a transcriptional regulation in a Fur-dependent fashion. Two other putative regulatory stretches, corresponding to inverted repeated sequences with perfect and imperfect symmetry, were also identified. pGlu and iron are therefore at least two of the transcriptional effectors of pcp expression.
