Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) remain a leading cause diarrheal illness, prompting a search for vaccine targets that led to the recent discovery of EtpA, a secreted adhesin of ETEC that acts by bridging flagella and host cells. In a murine model, immunization with recombinant EtpA glycoprotein inhibited colonization by two EtpA-producing human ETEC strains, H10407 and E24377A. In addition, vaccination with recombinant flagellin (serotype H11) generated antibodies that specifically recognized the tips of flagella from E24377A expressing a heterologous flagellar serotype (H28) and afforded significant protection against colonization. EtpA and/or flagellin could be valuable subunit antigens in the formulation of a broadly protective ETEC vaccine.
