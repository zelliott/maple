23S ribosomal RNa (rRNA) gene sequences of Streptococcus uberis and Strep. parauberis were determined by direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing. Oligonucleotide probes specific for Strep. uberis and Strep. parauberis were designed from variable regions of the 23S rRNA gene sequence data. Molecular hybridizations with PCR-amplified rRNA gene targets provided a precise and reliable means of differentiating Strep. uberis and Strep. parauberis from each other and from other streptococcal species.
