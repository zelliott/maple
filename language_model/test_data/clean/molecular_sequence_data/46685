The 14-3-3 family of proteins exerts diverse influences on the signal transduction pathways of cells. We have newly identified a human cDNA encoding the gamma subtype of the 14-3-3 family of genes. The deduced amino acid sequence of human 14-3-3gamma was identical to that of rat 14-3-3gamma. The human 14-3-3gamma gene (HGMW-approved symbol YWHAG) is highly expressed in brain, skeletal muscle, and heart. By fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, the human 14-3-3gamma gene was mapped to chromosome 7q11.23. Radiation hybrid mapping has shown that this gene is localized 2.33 cR telomeric to D7S1870, a polymorphic marker located at the most telomeric end of the common deletion region of Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS). This suggests that haploinsufficiency of 14-3-3gamma may not contribute to the WBS phenotype. However, information regarding the precise chromosomal location of a member of the 14-3-3 family of genes will aid in examining the relationship between this family of proteins and human disorders.
