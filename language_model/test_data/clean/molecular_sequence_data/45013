Covalent binding of a synthetic DNA fragment with eukaryotic transcription factor NF-kappaB has been studied in lysates of human colon carcinoma HCT-116 cells. For binding we used 32P-labeled 17/19 bp nucleotide DNA duplex containing an NF-kappaB recognition site (kappaB-site) in which one of internucleotide phosphate groups was replaced by a chemically active trisubstituted pyrophosphate group. Using gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions (Laemmli electrophoresis) followed by immunoblotting revealed selective irreversible binding of 32P-labeled DNA duplex with NF-kappaB in lysates of tumor cells in the presence of other cell components. Experiment on delivery of this DNA duplex containing rhodamine at 3 -end of the modified chain in an intact cell revealed that rhodamine-labeled DNA penetrated through the plasma membrane of tumor cells without any additional delivery systems. Using fluorescent microscopy, we found that the rhodamine-labeled DNA is initially localized in the cytoplasm. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that subsequent treatment of the cells with TNF-alpha promoted partial translocation of the DNA reagent into the nucleus.
