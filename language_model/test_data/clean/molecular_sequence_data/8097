An open reading frame encoding a member of the L16 family of ribosomal proteins is adjacent to the URA7 gene on the left arm of chromosome II in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The predicted L16-like polypeptide is basic (pl 11.12), contains 232 amino acids (26.52 kDa) and has 36% amino acid sequence identity to E. coli L16. Immunoblot analysis with polyclonal antibodies to the L16-like polypeptide showed specific cross-reaction with a 22,000 Mr mitochondrial polypeptide that co-sediments with the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome in sucrose density gradients. The levels of the L16 mRNA and protein varied in response to carbon source. In [rho degree] cells lacking mitochondrial rRNA, the L16 mRNA accumulated at normal levels, but the protein was barely detectable, indicating RNA-dependent accumulation of the L16 protein. Gene disruption experiments demonstrated that the yeast mitochondrial L16 is an essential ribosomal protein in vivo.
