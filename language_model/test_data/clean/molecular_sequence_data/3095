Sustained off resonance irradiation (SORI) collision-induced dissociation (CID) is a commonly used method of collisionally activating ions for fragmentation in Fourier transform mass spectrometric experiments. To achieve the degree of fragmentation desired, both the irradiation frequency and amplitude must be optimized. This is a time-consuming procedure, particularly when the m/z values of the precursor ions vary over a broad range. We present an approach that simplifies this optimization by precalculating the irradiation frequency of the ions to be fragmented as a constant percentage of the reduced cyclotron frequency. Using this approach, the optimal amplitude was found to be significantly less dependent on the m/z value of the precursor ion, and therefore required little or no adjustment. This method considerably simplified optimization of SORI-CID for analysis of carbohydrates, glycoconjugates, and peptides over the mass range m/z 300-3500, requiring optimization of only a single experimental parameter, the irradiation amplitude, and only for the first MS/MS stage.
