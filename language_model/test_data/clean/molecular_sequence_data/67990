Two mouse monoclonal antibodies have been characterized. Both antibodies specifically recognized the amino acid sequences which are responsible for the presence of the HPA-1a and HPA-1b alloantigens at the surface of human platelet. The monoclonality allied with an exquisite specificity of these antibodies allow a perfect typing of platelet HPA-1 status. A fast and reliable Elisa assay which fulfills all the needs and requirements of hematology laboratories has been set up and is described here. The Elisa assay has been tested on a population of 689 blood donors. The results agreed with the known phenotypic frequencies of the HPA-1 alloantigens.
