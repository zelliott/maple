Down-regulation of the delta-opioid receptor contributes to the development of tolerance to delta-opioid receptor agonists. The involvement of the carboxy terminus of the mouse delta-opioid receptor in peptide agonist-mediated down-regulation has been established. In the present study, we examined the down-regulation of the truncated human delta-opioid receptor by structurally distinct delta-opioid receptor agonists. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, expressing the full-length or truncated epitope-tagged human delta-opioid receptors were incubated with various delta-opioid receptor agonists (100 nM, 24 h), and membrane receptor levels were determined by [(3)H]naltrindole saturation binding. Each delta-opioid receptor agonist tested down-regulated the full-length receptor. Truncation of the carboxy terminus abolished down-regulation by all delta-opioid receptor agonists, except SNC80 ((+)-4-[(alphaR)-alpha-((2S,5R)-4-allyl-2,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-3-methoxybenzyl]N,N-diethylbenzamide). In addition, truncation of the C-terminus completely attenuated [D-Pen(2)-D-Pen(5)]enkephalin (DPDPE), but not SNC80-mediated [32P] incorporation into the protein immunoreactive with an anti-epitope-tagged antibody. These findings suggest that SNC80-mediated phosphorylation and down-regulation of the human delta-opioid receptor involves other receptor domains in addition to the carboxy terminus. Pertussis toxin treatment did not block SNC80-mediated down-regulation of the truncated Et-hDOR, indicating that the down-regulation is independent of G(i/o) protein activation and subsequent downstream signaling.
