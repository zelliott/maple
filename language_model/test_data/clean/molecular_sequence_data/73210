Two types of cDNA encoding the alpha subunit of pituitary gonadotropin (GTH) were cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for goldfish pituitary cDNA library. The goldfish GTH-alpha subunit cDNAs, designated as alpha 1 and alpha 2, encode 117 and 118 amino acids, respectively, including a 23-amino-acid signal peptide. These two types of cDNAs showed high homology in nucleotide and amino acid sequence, but deletion of a triplet nucleotides was present in alpha 1. Deduced amino acid sequences represented differences in four residues between alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunits. Analyses of goldfish genomic DNA revealed that each individual goldfish possesses two distinct genes relevant to GTH-alpha 1 and -alpha 2 subunits. Results of reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis suggest that these two GTH-alpha subunit genes are expressed at different levels without relation to sex and gonadal maturity.
