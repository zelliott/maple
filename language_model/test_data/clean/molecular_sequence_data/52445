The diagnosis severe combined immunodeficiency was made in a male infant at the age of 18 wk. Known causes of severe combined immunodeficiency were excluded. The activity of total 5'-nucleotidase (E.C. 3.1.3.5) in the PBMC was found to be strongly decreased. Analysis of the peripheral blood revealed a lymphocytosis, mainly of CD8+ T cells. These lymphocytes expressed high levels of CD29, CD38, CD45RA, and MHC class II molecules but no CD25, CD26, CD27, or CD28 Ag. The cells proliferated poorly to all T cell stimulants tested and no helper activity for IgM secretion could be induced. In contrast to the poor proliferative responses, high levels of TCR-induced cytolytic activity, without lymphokine-activated killer-cell outgrowth, were induced by CD3 mAb. Analysis of TCR-beta gene rearrangements indicated that two clonal populations constituted the majority of the E-rosette+ peripheral blood fraction. Moreover, the vast majority of the CD8+ cells were found to react with a mAb to V beta 3. Polymerase chain reaction on cDNA from peripheral blood cells with primers that amplify TCR V beta elements showed, in agreement with the fluorescence data, an overrepresentation of V beta 3 but absence of usage of approximately 50% of the other V beta elements. Thus, in a severe combined immunodeficiency patient, CD8+ T cells with limited T cell receptor usage and restricted effector functions were found. The observed alterations in the 5'-nucleotidase levels may be secondary to the outgrowth of this population.
