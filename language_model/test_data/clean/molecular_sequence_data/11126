AFT1, a 14-3-3 protein from Arabidopsis thaliana, was used as a 'bait' in the two-hybrid system to identify its interacting proteins. A caffeic acid/5-hydroxyferulic acid O-methyltransferase, OMT1, was identified as one of the several proteins that specifically interacts with AFT1 in yeast cells. The physical interaction between AFT1 and a partial OMT1 polypeptide can be demonstrated in vitro by using bacterially expressed proteins. A single copy gene was found to encode OMT1 in Arabidopsis, and its expression is both spatially and temporally regulated.
