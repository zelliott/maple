The specific recognition by Escherichia coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) of tRNA(Gln) is mediated by extensive protein:RNA contacts and changes in the conformation of tRNA(Gln) when complexed with GlnRS. In vivo accuracy of aminoacylation depends on two factors: competition between synthetases, and the context and recognition of identity elements in the tRNA. The structure of the tRNA(Gln):GlnRS complex supports studies from amber and opal suppressor tRNAs, complemented by in vitro aminoacylation of the mutated tRNA transcripts, that the glutamine identity elements are located in the anticodon and acceptor stem of tRNA(Gln). Recognition of individual functional groups in tRNA, for example the 2-amino group of guanosine, is also evident from the result with inosine-substituted tRNAs. Communication between anticodon and acceptor stem recognition is indicated by mutants in GlnRS isolated by genetic selection with opal suppressor tRNAs which are altered in interactions with the inside of the L-shaped tRNA. We have also used genetic selection to obtain mutants of GlnRS altered in acceptor stem recognition with relaxed specificity for amber suppressor tRNAs, and a more extensive mutational analysis shows the importance of the acceptor binding domain to accurate recognition of tRNA.
