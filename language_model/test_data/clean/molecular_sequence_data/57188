Platelet-derived growth factor-AA and -BB homodimers and -AB heterodimers bind with high affinity to the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) alpha-receptor. Basic polypeptides such as polylysine and protamine sulfate compete with PDGF for receptor binding, suggesting a role for ligand positive charge in the binding interaction. A pentapeptide amino acid sequence with a cationic tripeptide core is perfectly conserved between the A- and B-chains (Val158-Arg159-Lys160-Lys161-Pro162) and was therefore considered as a possible alpha-receptor-binding domain. We have investigated the functional importance of positive charge within this region of the PDGF A-chain by using site-directed mutagenesis to convert the cationic core amino acids to the acidic sequence triglutamic acid. cDNAs encoding wild-type (PDGF-AAwt) and charge mutant (PDGF-AAcm) proteins were expressed following stable transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells. Proper assembly and secretion of PDGF-AAcm was verified by metabolic labeling with [35S]cysteine, immunoprecipitation, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis under nonreducing and reducing conditions. PDGF-AAcm was secreted as two major species of disulfide-linked A-chain homodimers identical in molecular mass to those observed for PDGF-AAwt (32 and 35 kDa). Secreted PDGF-AAwt and PDGF-AAcm proteins were purified to homogeneity and subjected to structural and functional analyses. Compared to purified PDGF-AAwt, PDGF-AAcm displayed a marked reduction in both binding affinity for PDGF alpha-receptors and mitogenic activity in Swiss 3T3 cells. Large reductions were also observed in the ability of semipurified PDGF-AAcm to stimulate calcium influx and the production of inositol phosphates. Measurement of circular dichroism spectra of highly purified PDGF-AAcm and PDGF-AAwt revealed no significant difference in secondary structure. Collectively, these results indicate that the cationic Arg159-Lys160-Lys161 region plays a critical role in the biological activity of PDGF-AA by direct participation in ligand binding to the PDGF alpha-receptor.
