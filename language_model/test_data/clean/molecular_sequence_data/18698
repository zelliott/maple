Computational analysis of sequence homology of the chiSRC gene cluster, encoding a chitinase in Streptomyces peucetius, showed that the gene cluster could be a two-component regulon comprising a sensor kinase (chiS) and a response regulator (chiR). To prove that the ChiSRC is an authentic two-component system, the chiS gene was cloned and expressed in E.coli and the purified protein was used for biochemical analysis. In this report, we provide biochemical evidence to show that the sensor kinase encoded by chiS gene indeed is a histidine kinase capable of autophosphorylation and the histidine 144 residue of the ChiS protein is the phosphate acceptor. An insertion mutation at the chiS locus led to overproduction chitinase protein in S. peucetius implying that the chiC gene is negatively regulated by the two-component system.
