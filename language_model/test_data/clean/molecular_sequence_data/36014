Two small peptide substrates for HIV-1 proteinase were synthesised. The sequences chosen were basically from that of the gag-pol protein, which is the natural substrate for the proteinase. To protect these peptides from the attack of exopeptidases, the N- and C-termini were suitably protected, which also makes these substrates specific to HIV-proteinase and eliminates the requirement for highly purified enzyme.
