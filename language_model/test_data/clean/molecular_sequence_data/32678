A new yeast species, Candida gelsemii, is described to accommodate three isolates recovered in Georgia, USA, from the toxic nectar of the Carolina jessamine (Gelsemium sempervirens). The species resembles other members of the Metschnikowiaceae clade that have been recovered from nectar, but differs in a number of morphological and physiological characteristics. Analysis of rDNA sequences places the new species well into the clade, but in a basal position with respect to a group of Metschnikowia and Candida species known to occur in association with nectars and bees, as well as marine invertebrates. The type is strain UWOPS 06-24.1(T) (CBS 10509(T), NRRL Y-48212(T).
