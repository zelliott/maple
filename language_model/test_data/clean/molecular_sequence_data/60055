A cellulolytic anaerobic bacterium, strain I77R1BT, was isolated from a biomat sample of an Icelandic, slightly alkaline, hot spring (78 degrees C). Strain I77R1BT was rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, non-motile and stained Gram-negative at all stages of growth. It grew at 45-82 degrees C, with an optimum growth temperature around 78 degrees C. At 70 degrees C, growth occurred at pH 5.8-8.0, with an optimum near pH 7.0. At the optimum temperature and pH, with 2 g cellobiose l-1 as substrate, strain I77R1BT had a generation time of 2 h. During growth on Avicel, strain I77R1BT produced acetate, hydrogen and carbon dioxide as major fermentation products together with small amounts of lactic acid and ethanol. The strain fermented many substrates, including cellulose, xylan, starch and pectin, but did not grow with casein peptone, pyruvate, D-ribose or yeast extract and did not reduce thiosulfate to H2S. The G+C ratio of the cellular DNA was 35 mol%. Comparative 16S rDNA analysis placed strain I77R1BT among species of Caldicellulosiruptor. The closest relative was Caldicellulosiruptor lactoaceticus. Hybridization of total DNA showed 42% hybridization to C. lactoaceticus and 22% hybridization to Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus. A new species, Caldicellulosiruptor kristjanssonii sp. nov. (I77R1BT) is proposed.
