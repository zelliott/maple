We report herein the cDNA cloning of a novel rat acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) that preferentially uses arachidonate and eicosapentaenoate. This newly identified ACS (designated ACS4) contains 670 amino acids and is 68% identical to rat ACS3, a previously characterized ACS that is highly expressed in brain. ACS4 was overproduced in Escherichia coli and the resulting enzyme was purified to homogeneity. The purified enzyme utilizes arachidonate and eicosapentaenoate most preferentially among C8-C22 saturated fatty acids and C14-C22 unsaturated fatty acids. Kinetic analyses revealed that the enzyme has a high affinity for arachidonate and eicosapentaenoate and low affinity for palmitate. ACS4 transcripts are detectable in a wide range of tissues, with the highest level in adrenal gland. Immunoreactivity to ACS4 was detected in the zona fasciculata and reticularis of adrenal gland, in the corpus luteum and stromal luteinized cells in ovary, and in the Leydig cells of testis.
