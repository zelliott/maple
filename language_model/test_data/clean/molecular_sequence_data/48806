An expedient and simple protocol to access S-linked glycopeptides by Fmoc SPPS using unprotected carbohydrates is reported. The utility of the method was demonstrated with the solid phase synthesis of a MUC1 fragment (20 mer) containing two glycosylation sites that were substituted with S-linked glycans.
