The continuing explosion of sequencing data has inspired a corresponding effort in the annotation and classification of protein families. Within a particular protein family, however, individual members may have distinct functions, although they share a common fold and broadly defined physiological role. Rab GTPases are the largest subfamily of the Ras superfamily, yet from early in their discovery, it was apparent that each Rab protein has a unique subcellular localization and regulates a particular stage(s) membrane traffic. To gain insight into the contribution of individual residues to unique protein functions a general strategy is outlined. This method should allow the cell and molecular biologist with no specialist expertise to implement an algorithm that makes use of a combination of experimental and phylogenetic data. The algorithm is applicable to the analysis of any protein domain and here is illustrated with the analysis of residues contributing to the individual functions of a pair of Rab GTPases.
