Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a combination of deafness and pigmentary disturbances, normally inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. The pathology involves neural crest derivatives, but WS is heterogeneous clinically and genetically. Some type I WS families show linkage with markers on distal 2q and in three cases the disease has been attributed to mutations in the PAX3 gene. PAX3 encodes a paired domain, a highly conserved octapeptide and probably also a paired-type homeodomain. Here we describe a further three PAX3 mutations which cause WS; one alters the octapeptide motif plus the presumed homeodomain; a second alters all three elements and the third alters the paired box alone. The latter occurs in a family with probable type 2 WS, a clinical variant usually considered not to be allelic with type 1 WS.
