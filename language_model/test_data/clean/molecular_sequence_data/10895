A canine metallothionein cDNA obtained from the liver of a cadmium-treated beagle was cloned and sequenced. Asn at position 4 conserved among all mammalian metallothionein-1 and metallothionein-2 is replaced by Asp in the canine metallothionein cDNA clone. Because the acidic amino acid doesn't exist at either position 10 or 11 in the deduced amino acid sequence, it is supposed that this cDNA is derived from canine metallothionein-1 mRNA. Northern blot analysis using the cDNA as a probe revealed the induction of the canine metallothionein mRNA expression in the liver and kidney of a cadmium-treated beagle. Thus, the canine metallothionein cDNA obtained in the present study should provide an useful tool for the molecular investigation of metallothionein in dog.
