The limitation of traditional Ad vectors result in wide application of capsid-incorporation of antigens into adenovirus capsid proteins, but usually it can't rescue virus successfully when we engineered the hypervariable regions (HVRs) of hexon in adenovirus serotype 3(Ad3) vector. So we deleted or retained some amino acids in HVR1, HVR2, HVR5, HVR7 predicted by bioinformatics, constructed recombinant Ad3 vector pBRAddeltaE3GFP-mHexon, and transfected it into AD293 cell to confirm the influence on the virus rescue. These data of amino acids that can be deleted or retained in the HVRs of Ad3 vector should provide operating foundation for antigen capsid-incorporation strategy in human adenovirus serotype 3, and also lay the groundwork for application of expressing foreign antigens in the hexon of human adenovirus serotype 3 as a platform of multivalent vaccine vectors.
