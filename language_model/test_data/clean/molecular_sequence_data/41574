We report the heterologous production of Ala(0)actagardine in E. coli by co-expression of the substrate peptide GarA and its modification enzymes GarM and GarO. The activity of GarO, a luciferase-like monooxygenase that introduces the unique sulfoxide group of actagardine, was also investigated in vitro.
