ES (embryonic stem) cell differentiation is dependent on the presence of HS (heparan sulfate). We have demonstrated that, during differentiation, the evolution of specific cell lineages is associated with particular patterns of GAG (glycosaminoglycan) expression. For example, different HS epitopes are synthesized during neural or mesodermal lineage formation. Cell lines mutant for various components of the HS biosynthetic pathway are selectively impaired in their differentiation, with lineage-specific effects observed for some lines. We have also observed that the addition of soluble GAG saccharides to cells, with or without cell-surface HS, can influence the pace and outcome of differentiation, again highlighting specific pattern requirements for particular lineages. We are combining this work with ongoing studies into the design of artificial cell environments where we have optimized three-dimensional scaffolds, generated by electrospinning or by the formation of hydrogels, for the culture of ES cells. By permeating these scaffolds with defined GAG oligosaccharides, we intend to control the mechanical environment of the cells (via the scaffold architecture) as well as their biological signalling environment (using the oligosaccharides). We predict that this will allow us to control ES cell pluripotency and differentiation in a three-dimensional setting, allowing the generation of differentiated cell types for use in drug discovery/testing or in therapeutics.
