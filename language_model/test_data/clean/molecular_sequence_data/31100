Three HeLa cell surface collagen receptors of apparent molecular mass 102/58, 87, and 38/33 kDa were eluted from gelatin-Sepharose with salt gradients or Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptides. To understand how the collagen receptors are involved in HeLa cell spreading on collagen we investigated the effects of divalent cations and Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptides on adhesion to gelatin, since HeLa cells behave similarly on both native type I collagen and gelatin substrata and also whether Arg-Gly-Asp-containing substrata would substitute for gelatin in facilitating cell spreading. Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-containing peptides in solution inhibited HeLa cell spreading onto gelatin and promoted only partial HeLa cell spreading when bound to tissue culture plastic. Both partial spreading of HeLa cells on the Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser substratum and full spreading on gelatin was dependent on Mg2+, but not on Ca2+. Binding of the 102/58-, 87-, and 38/33-kDa collagen receptors to gelatin-Sepharose was increased fourfold in the presence of Mg2+, and subsequent elution of the collagen receptors and a 45-kDa collagen-binding protein not thought to be involved in HeLa cell spreading was achieved with EDTA. In contrast, affinity chromatography on Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Sepharose eluted predominantly the 45-kDa collagen-binding protein and the 38/33-kDa collagen receptor. In summary, the Mg2(+)-dependent interaction of the collagen receptors with the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence in collagen appears to be essential for the initial events in HeLa cell spreading but is not sufficient for full cell spreading.
