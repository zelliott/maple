The okadaic acid class of naturally occurring toxins is a structurally diverse group of molecules that inhibit the protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A. Studies providing information about the mode of binding between the toxins and the phosphatases contribute to an overall understanding of the signal transduction pathways in which the phosphatases are involved.
