Viable and killed BCG were compared for the ability to induce nitric oxide (NO) production in normal spleen cells and peritoneal exudate macrophages. Stimulation of spleen cells with viable BCG resulted in a strong expression of inducible NO synthase followed by an enhanced production of nitrite. However, those responses were not induced after stimulation with killed BCG or when macrophages were stimulated with killed and viable BCG. The same level of TNF-alpha mRNA expression was observed in reverse transcription-PCR after stimulation of spleen cells with viable and killed BCG. However, IFN-gamma production was induced only when spleen cells were stimulated with viable BCG. Concurrent stimulation of rIFN-gamma with either viable or killed BCG resulted in a strong nitrite production by macrophages. Neutralization of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha caused a complete inhibition of nitrite production. Furthermore, anti-asialo GM1 Ab plus complement treatment abolished IFN-gamma production after stimulation with viable BCG, indicating that the NK cell was the major source of IFN-gamma, and its production was triggered only by stimulation with viable BCG. The present study showed that the ability of viable BCG to induce NO production is superior to that of killed BCG, and both IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha are essential for BCG-induced NO production by spleen cells. NK cells appeared to be important as a source of IFN-gamma, and the insufficient NO induction by killed BCG was due to the inability to induce IFN-gamma from NK cells.
