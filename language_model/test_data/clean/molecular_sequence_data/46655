A protein, with a molecular weight of 20 kDa, and an N-terminal sequence analogous to those of thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs) and thaumatins, was first isolated from the legume of the French bean Phaseolus vulgaris cv Kentucky wonder using a simple procedure involving affinity and ion exchange chromatography. The protein was adsorbed on both CM-Sepharose and Affi-gel Blue Gel. It was the first leguminous TLP-like protein demonstrated to exert antifungal activity against Fusarium oxysporum, Pleurotus ostreatus, and Coprinus comatus but not against Rhizoctonia solani.
