The structure of the O-specific side-chain of the Hafnia alvei strain PCM 1206 lipopolysaccharide has been investigated. Methylation analysis, partial acid hydrolysis, FAB-MS/MS and 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy were the principal methods used. D-Allothreonine (D-aThr), amide-linked to the D-galacturonic acid, was identified as a constituent in the polysaccharide and the following structure of a pentasaccharide repeating unit was established: [structure: see text].
