Using PCR and genomic sequencing, we confirmed the presence of and homology between hepatitis G virus (HGV) (also called GB virus C) RNA in six serum samples and that in two saliva samples obtained from 34 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infections. Thus, HGV may be found outside the circulatory system.
