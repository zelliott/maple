We have identified a novel ubiquitin conjugating enzyme gene, L-UBC, which maps to human Chromosome (Chr) 14q24.3. This is also the location of the major early onset familial Alzheimer's disease gene (FAD3). L-UBC encodes a protein that demonstrates homology to the yeast ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, UBC-4, and human UbcH5. Their functions are to ubiquitinate specific proteins targeted for degradation. The protein also exhibits very strong homology to a rabbit protein, E2-F1, which mediates p53 degradation driven by papilloma virus E6 protein in vitro. The accumulation of specific proteins that have undergone aberrant processing in neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques is the classic pathological feature in brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Abnormal ubiquitination has previously been suggested to play a role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. This gene therefore represents a plausible candidate gene for FAD3.
