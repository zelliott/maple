Bartonella henselae is the primary agent of cat scratch disease (CSD). In order to study the genetic variation of B. henselae and the correlation of the various genotypes with epidemiological and clinical findings, two seminested, groEL- and pap31-based PCR assays were carried out with specimens from 273 patients. Amplicons were sequenced to determine the genotype of the causative Bartonella species. Compared to our reference intergenic spacer region-based PCR, the groEL- and pap31-based assays were 1.7 and 1.9 times more sensitive, respectively. All 107 positive patients were infected with B. henselae; neither Bartonella clarridgeiae nor other species were detected. Based on the groEL and pap31 sequences, B. henselae amplicons were classified into two genogroups, Marseille and Houston-1, and into four variants, Marseille, CAL-1, Houston-1, and a new variant, ZF-1. Patients infected with either one or the other genogroup did not exhibit different epidemiological or clinical characteristics. Our study highlights the genotypic heterogeneity of B. henselae in patients with CSD.
