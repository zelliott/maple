Cellular and nuclear uptake of dual labelled conjugates could be of great value for chemotherapy and cancer diagnostics. Therefore we designed conjugates in which gadolinium (Gd)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), a fluorescence marker were coupled to membrane translocation sequences (MTS). The MTSs we employed were the third helix of the Antennapedia homeodomain, the HIV-1 Tat peptide and the N-myristoylated HIV-1 Tat peptide. We used confocal laser scanning microscopy, fluorescence activated cell sorting, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and viability tests to examine the cellular and nuclear uptake of these conjugates into U373 glioma cells, as well as their cytotoxic effects. We found that the Antennapedia conjugate was taken up by no more than 20% of the cells. The HIV-1 Tat conjugate showed even lower uptake into less than 3% of cells. Interestingly, N-myristoylation of the HIV-1 Tat conjugate drastically improved its cellular uptake. Up to 70% of cells showed cellular and nuclear uptake of the N-myristoylated HIV-1 Tat conjugate. Conjugate cytotoxicity appears to correlate with cellular uptake.
