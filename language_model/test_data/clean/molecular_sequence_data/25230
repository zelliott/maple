Forced expression of the s-myc gene suppressed the tumorigenicity of rat RT4-AC tumor cells in nude mice, as reported previously. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis indicated that RT4-AC cells established from a tumor of the peripheral nervous system contain an activated neu gene with a T----A transversion in the transmembrane domain. Synthesis of a protein of 60 kd kd in RT4-AC cells was specifically inhibited by expression of the s-myc gene. These results strongly suggest that s-Myc suppresses the transforming activity of rat neural cells transformed by expression of the activated neu gene, and plays an important role in regulating expression of a cellular gene contributing to cell transformation, such as the gene that encodes the p60 protein.
