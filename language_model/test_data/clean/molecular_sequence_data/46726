Macromolecular centromere-kinetochore complex plays a critical role in sister chromatid separation, but its complete protein composition as well as its precise dynamic function during mitosis has not yet been clearly determined. Here we report the isolation of a novel mouse kinetochore protein, CENP-H. The CENP-H, with an apparent molecular mass of 33 kDa, was found to contain a coiled-coil structure and a nuclear localization signal. The CENP-H transcripts were relatively scarce but were detectable in most tissues and embryos at various stages of development. Immunofluorescence stainings of mouse fibroblast cells with anti-CENP-H-specific antibody demonstrated that the CENP-H is specifically and constitutively localized in kinetochores throughout the cell cycle; this was also confirmed by stainings with anti-centromere-specific antibody. Thus the newly isolated CENP-H may play a role in kinetochore organization and function throughout the cell cycle.
