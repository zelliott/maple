Covalent fusions between an mRNA and the peptide or protein that it encodes can be generated by in vitro translation of synthetic mRNAs that carry puromycin, a peptidyl acceptor antibiotic, at their 3' end. The stable linkage between the informational (nucleic acid) and functional (peptide) domains of the resulting joint molecules allows a specific mRNA to be enriched from a complex mixture of mRNAs based on the properties of its encoded peptide. Fusions between a synthetic mRNA and its encoded myc epitope peptide have been enriched from a pool of random sequence mRNA-peptide fusions by immunoprecipitation. Covalent RNA-peptide fusions should provide an additional route to the in vitro selection and directed evolution of proteins.
