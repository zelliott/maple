A TGF-beta inducible nuclear protein 1 (BmTINP1) was cloned from silkworm, Bombyx mori. Polyclonal antibodies against BmTINP1 were produced and subsequently used in immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry analyses. The immunoblotting analyses demonstrated that BmTINP1 was specifically expressed in the anterior silk gland (ASG) and the middle silk gland (MSG) but not in the posterior silk gland (PSG). There were two bands that suggested the existence of an isoform of BmTINP1. The expression profiles of BmTINP1 in ASGs and MSGs were similar, and they manifested a high level of expression throughout the period during which silk gland grew exponentially. Immunohistochemistry results revealed that BmTINP1 was translocated from the nucleus into the cytoplasm when larvae developed from the 4th-HCS into the 5th instar. 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) promotes the translocation, while the methoprene [a juvenile hormone (JH) analog] restrains the process. Our findings indicate that BmTINP1 is involved in silk produce along with the rapid growth of ASGs and MSGs during the last instar larvae, and the process could be regulated by hormones via control of BmTINP1 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
