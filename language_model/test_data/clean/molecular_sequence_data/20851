Calretinin is a member of the calcium-binding protein EF-hand family first identified in the retina. As with the other 200-plus calcium-binding proteins, calretinin serves a range of cellular functions including intracellular calcium buffering, messenger targeting, and is involved in processes such as cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Calcium-binding proteins including calretinin are expressed differentially in neuronal subpopulations throughout the vertebrate and invertebrate nervous system and their expression has been used to selectively target specific cell types and isolate neuronal networks. More recent experiments have revealed that calretinin plays a crucial role in the modulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability and the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Furthermore, selective knockout of calretinin in mice produces disturbances of motor coordination and suggests a putative role for calretinin in the maintenance of calcium dynamics underlying motor adaptation.
