A full-length cDNA clone of an Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) strain (2887A) isolated from aborted swine fetus was constructed and sequenced. Sequence comparison showed more than 99% nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity with two other EMCV strains, EMCV-PV21 and -R. However, the 2887A genomic sequence showed only about 84% nucleotide identity and 96% amino acid identity with EMCV-B, -D and -PV2 variants. RNA synthesized by in vitro transcription of this cDNA clone was infectious upon transfection of BHK21 cells, as shown by cytopathic effects and identification by neutralization test, and by propagation of the virus released into the culture media. The transcript RNA led to the production of infectious particles despite the presence of two nongenomic nucleotide residues at the 5' end, the short poly(C) tract (C(10)TCTC(3)TC(10)), the short poly(A) tail (7A), and the presence of six nongenomic nucleotides at the 3' end. The rescued virus was also found to be highly pathogenic for mice by intra-peritoneal inoculation producing a fatal disease indistinguishable from that of wild-type virus. An important finding concerning the molecular basis of infectivity was that the in vitro synthesized EMCV RNA transcript is infectious, although it contains a very short poly(A). The availability of the infectious cDNA clone of the reproductive failure strain of EMCV should prove to be useful for studying the molecular basis of the pathogenicity of EMCV in pig.
