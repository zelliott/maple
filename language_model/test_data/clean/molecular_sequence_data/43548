Several eukaryotic multiprotein complexes, including the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Snf/Swi complex, remodel chromatin for transcription. In contrast to the Snf/Swi proteins, Sfh1p, a new Snf5p paralog, is essential for viability. The evolutionarily conserved domain of Sfh1p is sufficient for normal function, and Sfh1p interacts functionally and physically with an essential Snf2p paralog in a novel nucleosome-restructuring complex called RSC (for remodels the structure of chromatin). A temperature-sensitive sfh1 allele arrests cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and the Sfh1 protein is specifically phosphorylated in the G1 phase. Together, these results demonstrate a link between chromatin remodeling and progression through the cell division cycle, providing genetic clues to possible targets for RSC function.
