Based on early pharmacological work, the serotonin 2A (5-HT(2A)) receptor subtype is believed to be involved in the regulation of toadfish pulsatile urea excretion. The goal of the following study was to characterize the toadfish 5-HT(2A) receptor at a molecular level, to determine the tissues in which this receptor is predominantly expressed and to further investigate the pharmacological specificity of toadfish pulsatile urea excretion by examining the effect of ketanserin, a 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist, on resting rates of pulsatile urea excretion. The full-length toadfish 5-HT(2A) receptor encodes a 496 amino acid sequence and shares 57-80% sequence identity to 5-HT(2A) receptors of other organisms, with 100% conservation among important ligand-binding residues. Toadfish 5-HT(2A) receptor mRNA expression was highest in the swim bladder and gonad, followed by the whole brain. All other tissues tested (esophagus, stomach, anterior intestine, posterior intestine, rectum, liver, kidney, heart, muscle and gill) had mRNA expression levels that were significantly less than whole brain. Toadfish 5-HT(2A) receptor mRNA expression within the brain was highest in the hindbrain, telencephalon and midbrain/diencephalon regions. Treatment with the 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist, ketanserin, resulted in a significant decrease in the pulsatile component of spontaneous urea excretion due to a reduction in urea pulse size with no significant change in pulse frequency. These results lend further support for the 5-HT(2A) receptor in the regulation of pulsatile urea excretion in toadfish.
