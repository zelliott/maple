Highly homologous DNA elements were found to be shared by the upstream regions of the mouse tyrosinase and tyrosinase related protein (TRP-1) genes. Several nuclear proteins were shown to bind to both of these upstream regions. Shared homologous DNA elements were also found in the 5' flanking sequences of Japanese quail and snapping turtle tyrosinase genes. Shared homologous nucleotide sequences were found to be scattered like an archipelago in the 5' upstream regions of mouse and human tyrosinase genes. Comparisons between Japanese quail and snapping turtle tyrosinase genes gave similar results. On the contrary, mammalian (mouse and human) and nonmammalian (quail and snapping turtle) tyrosinase genes did not show significant homology in their 5' upstream regions. In contrast, coding sequences in the first exons of vertebrate tyrosinase genes and their deduced amino acid sequences were found to be highly conserved except for their putative leader sequence-coding regions.
