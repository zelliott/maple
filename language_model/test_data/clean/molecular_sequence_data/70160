Regulation of transcriptional elongation is emerging as an important control mechanism for eukaryotic gene expression. In this essay, we review the basis of the current view of the regulation of elongation in the human c-myc gene and discuss similarities in elongation control among the c-myc, Drosophila hsp70 and the HIV-1 genes. Based upon these similarities, we propose a model for control of expression of these genes at the elongation phase of transcription. This model suggests that distinct promoter elements direct the assembly of RNA polymerase II transcription complexes which differ in their elongation efficiency.
