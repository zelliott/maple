Screening combinatorial libraries of conformationally constrained peptides against macromolecular targets is utilized in identifying novel drug leads and in developing new reagents for chemical biology. In methods such as phage-display selections, biotinylated macromolecular targets are often immobilized on avidin- and streptavidin-functionalized supports. Thus, the characterization of peptides that bind avidin and streptavidin is necessary for accurate interpretation of screening and selection results. Toward this goal, we panned a phage-displayed cyclic peptide library against NeutrAvidin, a chemically deglycosylated version of avidin. The selection produced a highly homologous consensus motif (Asp-Arg/Leu-Ala-Ser/Thr-Pro-Tyr/Trp). Two of these cyclic peptides, CDRATPYC and CDRASPYC, bound both NeutrAvidin and avidin with low-micromolar dissociation constants, whereas their acyclic counterparts had negligible affinity (< 80-fold). Moreover, these cyclic peptides were very specific for their targets and did not bind the structurally and functionally similar protein, streptavidin. Thus, we have identified a new class of cyclic peptides, distinct from the much-studied streptavidin-binding His-Pro-Gln peptide motif. These results will not only allow for discriminating between desired and background cyclic peptide motifs in selections and screens but also provide a new protein/peptide model system and a useful reagent in chemical biology that can have utility in protein immobilization, purification, and chemical tagging.
