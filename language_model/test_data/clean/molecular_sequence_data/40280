Three copies of eIF4E and three copies of eIF(iso)4E have been identified and sequenced from a Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV)-susceptible, inbred, diploid Brassica rapa line, R-o-18. One of the copies of eIF4E lacked exons 2 and 3 and appeared to be a pseudogene. The two other copies of eIF4E and two of the three copies of eIF(iso)4E were isolated from a bacterial artificial chromosome library of R-o-18. Using an Arabidopsis line (Col-0::dSpm) with a transposon knock-out of the eIF(iso)4E gene which resulted in a change from complete susceptibility to complete resistance to TuMV, complementation experiments were carried out with the two versions of eIF4E and the two versions of eIF(iso)4E. When transformed into Col-0::dSpm, all four Brassica transgenes complemented the Arabidopsis eIF(iso)4E knock-out, conferring susceptibility to both mechanical and aphid challenge with TuMV. One of the copies of eIF4E did not appear to support viral replication as successfully as the other copy of eIF4E or the two copies of eIF(iso)4E. The results show that TuMV can use both eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E from B. rapa for replication and, for the first time, that a virus can use eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E from multiple loci of a single host plant.
