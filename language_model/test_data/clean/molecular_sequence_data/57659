Recent findings have revealed much about the structure of involucrin. These findings make it possible to propose specific models regarding the role of involucrin and the mechanism of its crosslinking as an envelope precursor. These models provide clearly testable hypotheses that are expected to provide additional insights into the mechanism of cornified envelope assembly.
