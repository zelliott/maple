Avian rotaviruses are broadly distributed among birds, but only scarcely characterized on the molecular level. The VP4-, VP6-, VP7- and NSP5-encoding sequences of eight group A rotaviruses from chickens and turkeys determined here indicate a low degree of sequence similarity with mammalian rotaviruses. An NSP6-encoding region was missing in all chicken isolates except for isolate Ch2. Four novel genotypes (P[30], P[31], G22 and H8) were assigned by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group. Generally, chicken and turkey isolates clustered into separate branches of phylogenetic trees. However, chicken isolate Ch2 consistently clustered together with turkey isolates. Chicken isolate 06V0661G1 has a VP4-encoding sequence of unknown origin, but possesses VP6, VP7 and NSP5 genotypes typical for chicken isolates. These results might indicate interspecies transmission and reassortment among avian group A rotaviruses under field conditions. PCR protocols enabling amplification of avian and mammalian group A rotaviruses were developed for use in further epidemiological studies.
