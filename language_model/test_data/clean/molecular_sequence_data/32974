Our previous results have shown that some residues of V protein-specific domain in human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV2) are essential not only for STAT protein degradation but also for promoting virus growth. Here, we demonstrated that the virus growth of these recombinant hPIV2s (rPIV2) expressing mutated V proteins were improved in HeLa cell transiently expressing the wild-type V protein, but not in the cells constitutively expressing it. Consequently, we identified the region of the V protein that is essential for its oligomerization and for complex formation with NP protein. We also identified a host protein, AlP1/Alix, involved in apoptosis and efficient budding of several enveloped viruses as an interacting partner of the V and NP proteins. Depletion of AIP1/Alix by small interfering RNA suppressed virus growth. These data suggest that the conserved carboxyl terminus of the V protein plays an important role in virus growth.
