Sperm surface beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases are among the molecules mediating early gamete interactions in invertebrates and vertebrates, including man. The plasma membrane of Drosophila spermatozoa contains two beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases, DmHEXA and DmHEXB, which are required for egg fertilization. Here, we demonstrate that three putative Drosophila melanogaster genes predicted to code for beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases, Hexo1, Hexo2, and fdl, are all expressed in the male germ line. fdl codes for a homolog of the alpha-subunit of the mammalian lysosomal beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase Hex A. Hexo1 and Hexo2 encode two homologs of the beta-subunit of all known beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases, which we have named beta(1) and beta(2), respectively. Immunoblot analysis of sperm proteins indicated that the gene products associate in different heterodimeric combinations forming DmHEXA, with an alphabeta(2) structure, and DmHEXB, with a beta(1)beta(2) structure. Immunofluorescence demonstrated that all the gene products localized to the sperm plasma membrane. Although none of the genes was testis-specific, fdl was highly and preferentially expressed in the testis, whereas Hexo1 and Hexo2 showed broader tissue expression. Enzyme assays carried out on testis and on a variety of somatic tissues corroborated the results of gene expression analysis. These findings for the first time show the in vivo expression in insects of genes encoding beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases, the only molecules so far identified as involved in sperm/egg recognition in this class, whereas in mammals, the organisms where these enzymes have been best studied, only two types of polypeptide chains forming dimeric functional beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases are present in Drosophila three different gene products are available that might generate numerous dimeric isoforms.
