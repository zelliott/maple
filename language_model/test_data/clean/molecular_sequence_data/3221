To explore the pathogen and molecular basis of cryptogenic cirrhosis in a patient.

Serum was collected from a patient, male, aged 56, with cryptogenic cirrhosis. HBV serologic markers were qualitatively tested, and HBsAg, HBeAg, and anti-HBc were quantitatively determined again. HBV DNA in serum was qualitatively tested using PCR, and quantified using fluorescence quantitative PCR. S gene was amplified, cloned, and sequenced.

HbsAg and anti-Hbe were negative, and anti-HBs, HBeAg, anti-HBc, and HBV DNA were all positive. HBsAg (S/N) was 0.77 (cutoff of S/N: >/= 2.00), HbeAg (S/N) was 56.43 (cutoff of S/N: >/= 2.10), anti-HBc (S/C(O)) was 0.03 (cutoff of S/C(O): </= 1.00); HBV DNA was 1.54 x 10(9) copies/ml. An uncommon point mutation at nucleotide 336 (C to A) in S gene was found, resulting in the change of the 61st codon into a novel stop codon and failure of synthesis of HbsAg.

HBV proves the pathogen of this case. This special mutation well explains the patient's unusual serologic pattern. Moreover, this finding possesses important clinical and theoretical significance.
