A dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLDH) was purified and characterized for the first time from a crenarchaeon, Acidianus ambivalens. The holoenzyme consists of two identical subunits with a molecular mass of 45.4 kDa per monomer. It contains FAD as a prosthetic group and uses NAD+ as the preferential substrate, but can also reduce NADP+. The Michaelis-Menten constants of the forward (NAD+ reduction) and reverse (NADH oxidation) reactions were KM (dihydrolipoamide)=0.70 mM, KM (NAD+)=0.71 mM, KM (lipoamide)=1.26 mM and KM (NADH)=3.15 microM. A comparative study of NADH:lipoamide oxidoreductase and NADH:K3[Fe(CN)6] oxidoreductase activities was performed, the optimal temperature and pH being different for each: 55 degrees C, pH 7 and 89 degrees C, pH 5.5, respectively. Although DLDH is generally part of the alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes in Bacteria and Eukarya, none of these complexes has yet been isolated from Sulfolobales. The metabolic role of DLDH in these organisms is discussed.
