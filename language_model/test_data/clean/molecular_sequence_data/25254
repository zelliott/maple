An unusual RNA molecule encoded by the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage phi 29 is a structural component of the viral prohead and is required for the ATP-dependent packaging of DNA. Here we report a model of secondary structure for this prohead RNA developed from a phylogenetic analysis of the primary sequences of prohead RNAs of related phages. Twenty-nine phages related to phi 29 were found to produce prohead RNAs. These RNAs were analyzed by their ability to replace phi 29 RNA in in vitro phage assembly, by Northern blot hybridization with a probe complementary to phi 29 RNA, and by partial and complete sequence analyses. These analyses revealed four quite different sequences ranging in length from 161 to 174 residues. The secondary structure deduced from these sequences, in agreement with earlier observations, indicated that prohead RNA is organized into two domains. The larger 5'-domain (Domain I) is composed of 113-117 residues and contains four helices. Three of these helices appear to be organized into a central stem that is interrupted by two unpaired loops and the fourth helix and loop. The smaller 3'-domain (Domain II) is composed of 40-44 residues and consists of two helices. Domains I and II are separated by 8-13 unpaired residues. Nuclease cleavage occurs readily in this single-stranded joining region, and this cleavage allows the subsequent separation of the two RNA domains. The separated Domain I is fully active in DNA packaging in vitro. The functional significance and biological role of Domain II are unknown. The phylogenetic secondary structure model provides a basis for further analysis of the role of this RNA in bacteriophage morphogenesis.
