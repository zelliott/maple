Transfer of passive immunity from the mother to the fetus or newborn involves the transport of IgG across several epithelia. Depending on the species, IgG is transported prenatally across the placenta and yolk sac or is absorbed from colostrum and milk by the small intestine of the suckling newborn. In both cases apical to basolateral transepithelial transport of IgG is thought to be mediated by FcRn, an IgG Fc receptor with homology to major histocompatibility class I antigens. Here, we analyzed the intracellular routing of chimera encoding the rat FcRn tail fused to the ecto- and transmembrane domain of the macrophage FcgammaRIIb. Newly synthesized chimera were delivered in a nonvectorial manner to the apical and basolateral cell surface, from where the chimera were able to internalize and transcytose. Apical to basolateral and basolateral to apical transcytosis were differently regulated. This intracellular routing of the chimera is similar to that of the native FcRn, indicating that the cytosolic tail of the receptor is necessary and sufficient to endow an unrelated FcR with the intracellular transport behavior of FcRn. Furthermore, the di-leucine motif in the cytosolic domain of FcRn was required for rapid and efficient endocytosis but not for basolateral sorting of the chimera.
