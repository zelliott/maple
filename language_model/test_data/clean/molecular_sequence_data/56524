We have amplified, cloned and sequenced the gene encoding the thymidine kinase (TK) of a wild-type strain (Ab4) of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) and two mutants with defective TK activity isolated for resistance to penciclovir (PCV). One of the mutants, PR1, has suffered a 879-bp deletion which reduces the size of TK to 180 bp. The other mutant, PR3, has an adenine to cytosine mutation resulting in a Lys38-->Thr change. This mutation modifies the amino acid sequence of a domain involved in binding ATP, leading to non-detectable enzymatic activity. Lys38 thus appears to be essential for the activity of the TK of EHV-1.
