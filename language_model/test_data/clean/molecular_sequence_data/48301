Pectates lyase (Pel) plays an important role in bacteria pathogenicity. The crystal structure of Pel from Acidovorax citrulli (AcPel) has been solved to 1.37 Å resolution. AcPel belongs to the polysaccharide lyase family 1 (PL1), which has a characteristic right-handed β-helix fold. AcPel is similar with other Pels in the PL1 family, but also shows some differences at the substrate binding site.
