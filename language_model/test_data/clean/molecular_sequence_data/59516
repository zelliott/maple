To further characterize Tn5431, which is composed of Tn3 and Tn1721, DNA sequencing was carried out. It was demonstrated that Tn5431 arose by transposition of Tn3 into Tn1721. Multiple mutations in the Tn3 tnpA gene have occurred, rendering the Tn3 portion of Tn5431 transposition defective and ensuring the simultaneous transposition of the antibiotic resistance determinants on Tn3 and Tn1721.
