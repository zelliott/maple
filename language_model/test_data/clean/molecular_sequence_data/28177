We utilized the human 4F2 heavy-chain (4F2HC) gene as a model system to study the regulation of inducible gene expression during normal human T-cell activation. Previous studies have demonstrated that 4F2HC gene expression is induced during normal T-cell activation and that the activity of the gene is regulated, at least in part, by the interaction of a constitutively active 5'-flanking housekeeping promoter and a phorbol ester-responsive transcriptional attenuator element located in the exon 1-intron 1 region of the gene. We now report that 4F2HC intron 1 contains a transcriptional enhancer element which is active on a number of heterologous promoters in a variety of murine and human cells. This enhancer element has been mapped to a 187-base-pair RsaI-AluI fragment from 4F2HC intron 1. DNase I footprinting and gel mobility shift analyses demonstrated that this fragment contains two nuclear protein-binding sites (NF-4FA and NF-4FB) which flank a consensus binding site for the inducible AP-1 transcription factor. Deletion analysis showed that the NF-4FA, NF-4FB, and AP-1 sequences are each necessary for full enhancer activity. Murine 4F2HC intron 1 displayed enhancer activity similar to that of its human counterpart. Comparison of the sequences of human and murine 4F2HC intron 1s demonstrated that the NF-4FA, NF-4FB, and AP-1 sequence motifs have been highly conserved during mammalian evolution.
