The Rad3 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a DNA helicase which participates in the repair of ultraviolet-irradiated DNA and is inhibited in the presence of DNA containing thymine dimers. This protein is also involved in mitotic recombination and spontaneous mutagenesis and is essential for cell viability in the absence of DNA damage. Furthermore, the Rad3 protein also exhibits a DNA:RNA helicase activity in which there is a significant preference for a partial DNA:RNA hybrid rather than a partial duplex DNA substrate, which suggests that this protein might be involved in DNA repair within transcriptionally active genes. Finally, the Rad3 protein contains the DEAH motif and shares high amino acid sequence similarity with the DEAD family of RNA helicase proteins, suggesting that it might also possess an RNA helicase activity.
