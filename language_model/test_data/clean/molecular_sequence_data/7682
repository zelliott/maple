DNA methylation at the promoter region of X-linked genes is associated with the maintenance of X inactivation in mammals. One of the methylated DNA binding proteins, MECP2, that binds to methylated bases in DNA is encoded by a gene (Mecp2) located on the mouse X Chromosome (Chr). To determine whether this gene was expressed from the inactive X Chr, and X-autosome translocation (T(X;16)16H) system in which expression from the Mecp2 allele on the inactive X Chr could be assayed was used. Results from these experiments indicate that Mecp2 is subject to X inactivation in mouse.
