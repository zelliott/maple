Light induced phosphorylation of octopus rhodopsin was greatly enhanced by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S), suggesting that the kinases are involved in regulating interaction between rhodopsin and G-protein. We determined phosphorylated peptides of octopus rhodopsin in the presence or absence of GTP gamma S. Possible phosphorylation sites for octopus rhodopsin enhanced by GTP gamma S were Thr329, Thr330 and/or Thr336, which suggest that the G-protein associates with cytoplasmic loops including C-terminal peptide in the seventh helix of octopus rhodopsin.
