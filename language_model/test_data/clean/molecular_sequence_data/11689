Hereditary angioneurotic edema (HANE) is an autosomal dominant disease due to genetic alterations at the C1 inhibitor gene. Mutations within the C1 inhibitor gene are responsible for the molecular defect in type II HANE. Most of the dysfunctional proteins result from mutations involving the Arg-444 (the P-1 site of the reactive center) or amino acids NH2-terminal to the reactive center.

We have studied a Spanish family with type II HANE by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the exon eight of the C1 inhibitor gene. The purified 338-bp PCR product was subcloned and transformed into competent cells. After overnight cultures, we extracted the cloning vector from the positive colonies and sequenced both strands of the PCR product from each patient and healthy members of the family.

We show that affected individuals in this family have a missense mutation, changing an adenine to cytosine in the codon 445. This substitution changes threonine at the P-1' site of the reactive center to a proline. This mutation generates a new restriction site, recognized by Bsi YI.

To our knowledge, this is the first molecular defect characterized in a Spanish family with type II HANE, and to date, this is the first reported mutation at the P-1' site of the reactive center in individuals with type II HANE. This new mutation located at the reactive center emphasizes once more time the enormous heterogeneity of this gene.
