Deletion mapping of the human presenilin-1 (PS1) promoter delineated the most active fragment from -118 to +178 in relation to the transcription start site mapped in this study, in both human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH and hepatoma HepG2 cells. 5' deletions revealed that a crucial element controlling over 90% of the promoter activity in these cell lines is located between -22 and -6. A mutation altering only two nucleotides of the ETS consensus sequence present at -12 (GGAA to TTAA) has a similar effect. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that a set of specific complexes between nuclear factors and the PS1 promoter are eliminated by this point mutation, as well as by competition with an ETS consensus oligonucleotide. Competition experiments in DNase I footprinting correlated with electrophoretic mobility shift assays and showed that only one of several footprints over the PS1 promoter is eliminated by competition with an ETS consensus oligonucleotide. It extends from -14 to -6 and surrounds the ETS motif present at -12. Thus, a crucial ETS element is present at -12 and binds a protein(s) recognizing specifically the ETS consensus motif. At least one such complex is eliminated by preincubating the nuclear extract with an antibody with broad cross-reactivity with Ets-1 and Ets-2 proteins, thus confirming that an ETS transcription factor(s) recognizes the -12 motif. Several Sp1 binding motifs at positions -70, -55, and +20 surround this ETS element. Competition DNase I footprinting showed that Sp1-like nuclear factors recognize specifically these sites in both cell lines. Furthermore, a combination of 5' and 3' deletions indicated the presence of positive promoter elements between -96 and -35 as well as between +6 and +42. Thus, transfection and footprinting assays correlate to suggest that Sp1 transcription factor(s) bind at several sites upstream and downstream from the initiation site and activate the transcription of the PS1 promoter. Sequences downstream from the transcription initiation site also contain major control elements. 3' deletions from +178 to +107 decreased promoter activity by 80%. However, further deletion to +42 increased promoter activity by 3-4-fold. Collectively, these data indicate that sequences upstream and downstream from the transcription start site each control over 80% of the promoter activity. Hence, this suggests that protein-protein interactions between factors recognizing downstream and upstream sequences are involved.
