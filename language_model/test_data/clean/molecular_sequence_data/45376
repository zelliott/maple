Three anamorphic, ascomycetous yeast strains isolated from plant samples collected in Linzhi District, Tibet, China, were revealed as representing two novel species by 26S rRNA gene D1/D2 domain sequence and physiological property comparisons. The names Candida tibetensis sp. nov. and Candida linzhiensis sp. nov. are proposed for these novel species, with XZ 41-6T (=AS 2.3072T=CBS 10298T) and XZ 92-1T (=AS 2.3073T=CBS 10299T) as the respective type strains. D1/D2 sequence analysis showed that C. tibetensis and C. linzhiensis are closely related to Candida caryicola and Candida sequanensis, respectively.
