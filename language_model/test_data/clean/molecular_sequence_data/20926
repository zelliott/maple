Nipah virus (NiV), a highly pathogenic member of the Paramyxoviridae which originated from bats, encodes for a fusion (F) protein which is proteolytically processed within endosomes by cathepsin L. We show here that sequence requirements for NiV F activation differ markedly from other para- or orthomyxoviral fusion proteins. In contrast to other viral fusion proteins with monobasic cleavage sites, processing of NiV F proteins with one single basic amino acid in the cleavage peptide by exogenous trypsin is very inefficient, and introduction of a consensus sequence for furin does not result in cleavage by this ubiquitous protease. In contrast, a multibasic cleavage peptide in the NiV F protein completely impairs proteolytic processing and the generation of biological activity.
