This report describes the use of promoter trap lines from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to clone regulatory sequences that mediate guard-cell-specific reporter gene expression. Stomatal guard cells represent a highly differentiated cell type within the epidermis of green tissues of higher plants. They control the stomatal aperture in response to different endogenous and environmental signals in order to optimize carbon fixation while minimizing water loss. We screened available promoter trap lines for guard-cell-specific activation of a beta-glucuronidase (uidA) reporter gene in order to obtain marker lines for guard-cell development and to gain access to regulatory pathways leading to gene expression which is restricted to this cell type. From two lines identified we successfully cloned upstream regulatory sequences. For one line, guard-cell-specific promoter activity was confirmed by re-introducing the uidA gene, fused to the newly identified regulatory sequences, into the Arabidopsis nuclear genome. However, DNA sequences downstream of the uidA/T-DNA insertion sites in the original promoter trap lines revealed no obvious coding regions in the corresponding orientation, indicating that we have probably identified 'cryptic' promoters, being active in guard cells.
