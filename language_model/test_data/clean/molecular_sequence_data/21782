One of the prevailing arguments in evolutionary theory is that the duplicates of genes can acquire novel functionality. This is because only one of the paralogs need maintain the ancestral function, leaving room for natural experimentation due to a respite in purifying selection. Although many duplicates can subsequently become disabled by nullifying mutations, a few may also go on to diverge along a novel evolutionary trajectory. Here, evidence is provided that demonstrates how this scenario may not always be true. Rather, in the case of the highly conserved KPNA importin family, an initial relaxation in selection induced a frameshift that was later suppressed and heavily compensated for as part of a reparative and optimizing process. Despite a resulting divergence, there remains a distinct preservation of both sequence and functionality among the paralogs. This would indicate that duplicates can be retained by selection for reasons related to their redundant functionality. It also shows that, even when positive selection is inferred in duplicate genes, this may be of a compensatory nature rather than one representing any biochemical innovation. Generally, this development would perhaps be a more common outcome for gene duplication than is currently maintained.
