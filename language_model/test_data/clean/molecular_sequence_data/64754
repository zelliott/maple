In Tetrahymena thermophila, the development of a transcriptionally active macronucleus from a transcriptionally inert micronucleus is accompanied by the elimination of numerous DNA segments, called internally eliminated sequences (IESs), many of which belong to dispersed repetitive sequence families. To examine the relationship between the insertion and deletion events expected to occur during evolution of the repeats and the developmental elimination process, IESs were compared among different Tetrahymena strains. A 600 base-pair DNA segment, the R Indel, was discovered inside the R IES, one of the ten sequenced IESs out of an estimated 6000 total in the Tetrahymena genome. The R Indel was found in strains B3 and C2 but not in several other strains examined, indicating that the Indel was probably present in a progenitor of strains B3 and C2. The R Indel was found to belong to a moderately large sequence family of about 200 members; however, BLAST searches did not reveal meaningful similarities with other mobile elements. Sequence comparisons revealed that a 300 base-pair stretch, very closely related to the first half of the R Indel, was present inside the previously described B IES, another of the ten sequenced IESs. This is the first example of shared sequences between two of the known IESs.
