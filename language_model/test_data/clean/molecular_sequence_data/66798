Reperfusion of ischemic tissues elicits an acute inflammatory response involving serum complement, which is activated by circulating natural IgM specific to self-Ags exposed by ischemia. Recent reports demonstrating a role for the lectin pathway raise a question regarding the initial events in complement activation. To dissect the individual roles of natural IgM and lectin in activation of complement, mice bearing genetic deficiency in early complement, IgM, or mannan-binding lectin were characterized in a mesenteric model of ischemia reperfusion injury. The results reveal that IgM binds initially to ischemic Ag providing a binding site for mannan-binding lectin which subsequently leads to activation of complement and injury.
