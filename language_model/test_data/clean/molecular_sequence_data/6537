Many of the molecules necessary for neurotransmission are homologous to proteins involved in the Golgi-to-plasma membrane stage of the yeast secretory pathway. Of 15 genes known to be essential for the later stages of vesicle trafficking in yeast, 7 have no identified mammalian homologs. These include the yeast SEC6, SEC8, and SEC15 genes, whose products are constituents of a 19.5S particle that interacts with the GTP-binding protein Sec4p. Here we report the sequences of rSec6 and rSec8, rat homologs of Sec6p and Sec8p. The rSec6 cDNA is predicted to encode an 87-kDa protein with 22% amino acid identity to Sec6p, and the rSec8 cDNA is predicted to encode a 110-kDa protein which is 20% identical to Sec8p. Northern blot analysis indicates that rSec6 and rSec8 are expressed in similar tissues. Immunodetection reveals that rSec8 is part of a soluble 17S particle in brain. COS cell cotransfection studies demonstrate that rSec8 colocalizes with the GTP-binding protein Rab3a and syntaxin 1a, two proteins involved in synaptic vesicle docking and fusion at the presynaptic terminal. These data suggest that rSec8 is a component of a high molecular weight complex which may participate in the regulation of vesicle docking and fusion in brain.
