This paper reports a new strategy for oligosaccharide synthesis by combining solid-phase methods with cap and capture-release separation techniques, using the p-(5-(ethoxycarbonyl)pentyloxy)benzyl group (CPB) as a tag for the capture of desired oligosaccharides. After a complex carbohydrate mixture was obtained by solid-phase synthesis, the desired oligosaccharide containing a free carboxyl group derived from CPB was attached to an amino resin. The loaded resin was readily separated from side products by filtration and finally treated with acid to release the pure oligosaccharide product.
