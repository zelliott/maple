Peptoids, oligomers of N-substituted glycines, are described as a motif for the generation of chemically diverse libraries of novel molecules. Ramachandran-type plots were calculated and indicate a greater diversity of conformational states available for peptoids than for peptides. The monomers incorporate t-butyl-based side-chain and 9-fluorenylmethoxy-carbonyl alpha-amine protection. The controlled oligomerization of the peptoid monomers was performed manually and robotically with in situ activation by either benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(pyrrolidino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate or bromotris(pyrrolidino)phosphonium hexaflurophosphate. Other steps were identical to peptide synthesis using alpha-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)amino acids. A total of 15 monomers and 10 oligomers (peptoids) are described. Preliminary data are presented on the stability of a representative oligopeptoid to enzymatic hydrolysis. Peptoid versions of peptide ligands of three biological systems (bovine pancreatic alpha-amylase, hepatitis A virus 3C proteinase, and human immunodeficiency virus transactivator-responsive element RNA) were found with affinities comparable to those of the corresponding peptides. The potential use of libraries of these compounds in receptor- or enzyme-based assays is discussed.
