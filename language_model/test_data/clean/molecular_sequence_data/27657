Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes a nuclear trans-activator, termed Rev, that is required for the expression of the viral structural proteins and, hence, for viral replication. The Rev protein acts posttranscriptionally to induce the sequence-specific nuclear export of unspliced HIV-1 mRNA species that are otherwise excluded from the cell cytoplasm. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to identify two distinct regions of the HIV-1 Rev protein that are required for in vivo biological activity. The larger and more N-terminal of these two regions includes, but extends beyond, an arginine-rich sequence element required for nuclear localization. Mutation of a second, more C-terminal Rev protein sequence element was found to yield defective Rev proteins that act as trans-dominant inhibitors of Rev function. These Rev mutants are shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication when expressed in transfected cells and may have potential application in the treatment of HIV-1 related disease.
