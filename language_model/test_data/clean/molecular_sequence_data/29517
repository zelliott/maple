The complete nucleotide sequence of the RNA-1 of Squash mosaic virus (SqMV) was determined using a Japanese isolate (Y-SqMV). The sequence consisted of 5865 nucleotides excluding the poly (A) at the 3' terminus and contained a single long open reading frame with a coding capacity for a protein of Mr209971. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence suggested a genomic organization typical of comoviruses. The nucleotide sequence of the RNA-2 of Y-SqMV was also determined and compared with the SqMV isolates from the United States. The larger and smaller capsid protein (CP) coding region was compared to those of K-SqMV and Z-SqMV, which represent two subgroups of SqMV. The larger CP gene of Y-SqMV showed 93.0% and 88.0% identities with those of K-SqMV and Z-SqMV, respectively at the nucleotide level. The smaller CP gene of Y-SqMV was 94.1% and 88.4% identical with those of K-SqMV and Z-SqMV. The results suggested that the Japanese SqMV isolate (Y-SqMV) is distinct from those in the United States, and might represent a third subgroup.
