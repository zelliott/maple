The establishment and mapping of gene-specific DNA sequences greatly complement the ongoing efforts to map and sequence all human chromosomes. To facilitate our studies of human chromosome 7, we have generated and analyzed 2006 expressed-sequence tags (ESTs) derived from a collection of direct selection cDNA libraries that are highly enriched for human chromosome 7 gene sequences. Similarity searches indicate that approximately two-thirds of the ESTs are not represented by sequences in the public databases, including those in dbEST. In addition, a large fraction (68%) of the ESTs do not have redundant or overlapping sequences within our collection. Human DNA-specific sequence-tagged sites (STSs) have been developed from 190 of the ESTs. Remarkably, 180 (96%) of these STSs map to chromosome 7, demonstrating the robustness of chromosome enrichment in constructing the direct selection cDNA libraries. Thus far, 140 of these EST-specific STSs have been assigned unequivocally to YAC contigs that are distributed across the chromosome. Together, these studies provide > 2000 ESTs highly enriched for chromosome 7 gene sequences, 180 new chromosome 7 STSs corresponding to ESTs, and a definitive demonstration of the ability to enrich for chromosome-specific cDNAs by direct selection. Furthermore, the libraries, sequence data, and mapping information will contribute to the construction of a chromosome 7 transcript map.
