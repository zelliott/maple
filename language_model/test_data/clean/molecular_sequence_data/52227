Cloning and sequence analysis of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) cDNA, representing a cartilage pentameric protein, revealed a protein of 755 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 82,700 Da. Expression of the cDNA in COS cells showed that COMP is a homopolymer composed of five identical disulfide-linked subunits. COMP is homologous to the carboxyl-terminal half of thrombospondin, and the homologies include 89% and 54% of the residues in COMP and thrombospondin, respectively. The similarities are most pronounced in the carboxyl-terminal domains and in the calcium binding type 3 repeat domains in which about 60% of the amino acid residues are identical. In the type 2/epidermal growth factor repeat domains the two proteins contain 41% identical residues. The sequence of the amino-terminal 84-amino acid residues is unique for COMP. Comparison of the amino acid sequences in the type 2 and type 3 repeat domains of COMP and the thrombospondins shows that COMP is the product of a unique gene and not the result of an alternatively spliced thrombospondin gene.
