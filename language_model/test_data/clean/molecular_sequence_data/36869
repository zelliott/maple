In the synthesis of modified derivatives of octyl O-(alpha-D-mannopyranosyl)-(1-->3)-O-[(alpha-D-mannopyranosyl)-(1-->6)]- beta-D-mannopyranoside, 4.,5-epoxypentyl, a 4-diazirinopentyl, and a 5-(iodoacetamido)pentyl group were attached to the 3''-OH of the trisaccharide. The diazirino derivative may be especially suitable for photolabeling of the active site of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GlcNAcT-I). In addition, the 2'-OH group of the above-mentioned trisaccharide was reduced to a 2'-deoxy group and substituted 2'-O-methyl group.
