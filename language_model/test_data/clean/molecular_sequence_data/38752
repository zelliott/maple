The natriuretic peptide (NP) family is involved in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid volume. We isolated the 5'-flanking region of the type A human NP receptor gene and identified an insertion/deletion mutation in this region. We then assessed whether there is a genetic association between this mutation and essential hypertension (EH). The deletion allele lacks 8 nucleotides and alters binding sites for the activator protein-2 (AP-2) and Zeste transcriptional factors. We genotyped 200 EH and 200 normotensive (NT) individuals and found 9 subjects with the deletion (8 in the EH group and 1 in the NT group). All 9 individuals were heterozygous. The NT subject with the mutation had left ventricular hypertrophy without hypertension. Transcriptional activity of the deletion allele was <30% that of the wild-type allele. The plasma levels of brain NP in EH patients with the deleted allele were significantly higher than the levels in the EH patients with the wild-type allele, and plasma brain NP levels were significantly higher in subjects with the deleted allele than in subjects with the wild-type allele, despite comparable blood pressures. These findings suggest that in Japanese individuals, this deletion in the human NP receptor gene reduces receptor activity and may confer increased susceptibility to developing EH or left ventricular hypertrophy.
