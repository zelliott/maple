The histone H3 and H4 genes are shown to be expressed in both Arabidopsis plantlets and transitory multicellular suspension. The 5'- and 3'-ends of the H4 mRNAs have been localized on two H4 genes previously sequenced, H4A748 and H4A777. S1-nuclease mapping and reverse-transcriptase-primer-elongation experiments revealed the existence of two start points for transcription, located 31 and 37 nucleotides downstream from the TATA-box. The 3'-end of the mRNA corresponding to H4A748 was localized at 177 nt after the stop codon. The other gene, H4A777, most probably is not expressed. In addition to a long 3'-untranslated region, the H4 mRNA was shown to be polyadenylated in both plantlets and cell-suspension. This observation was extended to the H3 mRNAs of Arabidopsis and of two other dicots, tobacco and sunflower. Previous results on maize H3 and H4 mRNAs suggest that polyadenylation is a common feature for histone mRNAs in higher plants.
