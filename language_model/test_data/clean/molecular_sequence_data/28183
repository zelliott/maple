The genomic clones encoding lignin peroxidase isozyme H8 and two closely related genes were isolated from Phanerochaete chrysosporium BKM-1767, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. The positions and approximate lengths of introns were found to be highly conserved in all three clones. Analysis of homokaryotic derivatives indicated that the three clones are not alleles of the same gene(s).
