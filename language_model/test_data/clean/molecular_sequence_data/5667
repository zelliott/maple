SHP (short heterodimer partner) is a novel orphan receptor that lacks a conventional DNA binding domain and interacts with other members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. We have characterized the SHP sequences required for interaction with other superfamily members, and have defined an SHP repressor domain. In the mammalian two-hybrid system, a fusion of full-length SHP to the GAL4 DNA binding domain shows 9-cis-retinoic acid-dependent interaction with a VP16-retinoid X receptor alpha (RXR alpha) fusion. By deletion analysis, sequences required for this RXR interaction map to the central portion of SHP (amino acids 92 to 148). The same region is required for interaction with RXR in vitro and in the yeast two-hybrid system, and results from the yeast system suggest that the same SHP sequences are required for interaction with other members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily such as thyroid hormone receptor and retinoic acid receptor. In mammalian cells, a GAL4-SHP fusion protein shows about 10-fold-decreased transcriptional activation relative to GAL4 alone, and fusion of SHP to the C terminus of a GAL4-VP16 fusion to generate a triple chimera also results in a strong decrease in transactivation activity. Sequences required for this repressor function were mapped to the C terminus of SHP. This region is distinct from that required for corepressor interaction by other members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, and SHP did not interact with N-CoR in either the yeast or mammalian two-hybrid system. Together, these results identify novel receptor interaction and repressor domains in SHP and suggest two distinct mechanisms for inhibition of receptor signaling pathways by SHP.
