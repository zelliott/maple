A ribonuclease (RNase), possessing an N-terminal sequence disparate from those of ribonucleases from other mushrooms and previously isolated Pleuotus ostreatus RNases, was purified from the fruiting bodies of the edible mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus. The N-terminal sequence of Pleurotus ostreatus RNase did not manifest homology even to a previously reported RNase from the same mushroom. The ribonuclease was adsorbed on CM-Sepharose and Mono S. It exhibited a molecular mass of 12 kDa in both sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration on Superdex 75. The ribonuclease displayed an activity of 11490 U/mg on yeast tRNA. The highest ribonuclease activity was exhibited toward poly U, followed by poly A and poly C. No activity was shown toward poly G. The optimal pH for its activity was 7 and the optimal temperature was 55 degrees C. It inhibited cell-free translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate with an IC50 of 240 nM.
