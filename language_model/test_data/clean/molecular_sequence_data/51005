The mechanism of channel formation and action of channel-forming colicins is a paradigm for the study of dynamic aspects of membrane-protein interactions. The following experimental results concerning interaction of the colicin E1 channel domain with target membranes, in vitro and in vivo, are discussed: (1) the nature of the translocation-competent state of the channel-forming domain; (2) unfolding of the colicin channel peptide during in vitro binding and anchoring of the channel to liposome membranes at acidic pH; (3) reversal of channel peptide binding to liposomes by an alkaline-directed pH shift; (4) voltage-driven translocation and gating of the ion channel, discussed in the context of a four-helix model for a monomeric channel; (5) rescue of colicin-treated cells by high levels of external K+; (6) trypsin rescue of cells depolarized by the colicin ion channel; and (7) interaction of the channel domain with its immunity protein.
