An immunofluorometric method was developed for the semiquantitative determination of trihexosylceramide in cultured fibroblasts from Fabry disease patients, using a laser scanning confocal imaging system. The accumulated glycolipid was detected as granular inclusions in the cells. Heterozygote identification was achieved both by counting of immunoreactive cells and by measuring the relative fluorescence intensity with a digital imaging system.
