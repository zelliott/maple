In the bovine, seminal plasma heparin-binding proteins bind to sperm lipids containing the phosphorylcholine group and mediate the capacitating effects of heparin-like glycosaminoglycans during sperm residence in the female genital tract. We report the characterization of heparin- and phosphorylcholine-binding proteins of stallion and boar seminal plasma. Horse seminal plasma proteins HSP-1 and HSP-2, and boar protein pB1, belong to the same family as the bull heparin- and phosphorylcholine-binding proteins BSP-A1/2, BSP-A3, and BSP-30K. We have determined the amino acid sequence and posttranslational modifications of boar glycoprotein pB1. It contains 105 amino acids arranged into a mosaic structure consisting of a N-terminal 18-residue O-glycosylated polypeptide followed by two tandemly organized 40-45-residue fibronectin type II domains. pB1 displays 60-65% amino acid sequence similarity with its equine and bovine homologues. However, in their respective seminal plasmas, the BSP and the HSP proteins associate into 90-150-kDa oligomeric complexes, whereas pB1 forms a 35-40-kDa complex with spermadhesin AQN-1. In addition, pB1 appears to be identical to the recently described leukocyte adhesion regulator of porcine seminal fluid pAIF-1. Our results tie in with the hypothesis that homologous proteins from different mammalian species may display distinct biological activities, which may be related to species-specific aspects of sperm physiology.
