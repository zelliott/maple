The purT gene from Bacillus subtilis encoding the formate-dependent glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase T was cloned by functional complementation of an Escherichia coli purN purT double mutant. The nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 384 amino acids. The purT amino acid sequence showed similarity to the enzyme phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase encoded by the purK gene but not to the N10-formyltetrahydrofolate-dependent glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase N enzyme encoded by the purN gene. The glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase T level was repressed in cells grown in rich medium compared to minimal-medium-grown cells. However, when the culture entered the stationary-growth phase the enzyme level increased in rich medium and decreased in minimal medium. By comparing the deduced amino acid sequence of the B. subtilis purT gene product with translated nucleotide sequences in various databanks, evidence for the existence of putative purT genes in the Gram-negative bacteria Pasteurella haemolytica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was obtained.
