We isolated 4 different clones of the P-450(11 beta) gene from a bovine genomic library. These genomic clones were highly homologous with each other. Two of the isolated clones were pseudogenes. Determination of its nucleotide sequences indicated that the bovine P-450(11 beta) gene is divided into 9 exons by 8 introns and that it is about 8.5 kb in total length. The number of exons and the locations of intron insertion into the P-450(11 beta) gene are identical with those in the case of P-450(SCC), but different from those of other microsomal P-450s.
