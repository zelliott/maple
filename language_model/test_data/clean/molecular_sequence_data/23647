To study the DNA methylation events in normal and cloned rabbit embryos, we investigated the methylation status of a satellite sequence and the promoter region of a single-copy gene using bisulfite-sequencing technology. During normal rabbit embryo development, both sequences maintained hypermethylation status until the 8- to 16-cell stage when progressive demethylation took place. In cloned embryos, the single-copy gene promoter sequence was rapidly demethylated and precociously de novo methylated, while the satellite sequence maintained the donor-type methylation status in all examined stages. Our results indicate that unique sequences as well as satellite sequences may have aberrant methylation patterns in cloned embryos.
