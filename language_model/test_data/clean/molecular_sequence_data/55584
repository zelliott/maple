Abundant senile plaques are a histological hallmark in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. Such plaques consist of, among many other constituents, aggregated beta A4 amyloid peptide. This peptide is derived from an amyloid precursor protein (APP) by irregular proteolytic processing and is considered to be involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease. To study possible interactions of brain proteins with beta A4 amyloid or other fragments of APP, beta A4 amyloid and beta A4 amyloid extended to the C-terminus of APP were recombinantly produced as fusion proteins termed "Amy" and "AmyC," respectively. Using Amy and AmyC affinity chromatography, a 35-kDa protein from rat brain was isolated that bound tightly to AmyC but not to Amy, thus indicating an interaction of the protein with the C-terminus of APP. This 35-kDa protein was identified as the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Binding of GAPDH to AmyC but not to Amy was confirmed by gel filtration. Although AmyC slightly reduced the Vmax of GAPDH, the same reduction was observed in the presence of Amy. These findings suggest that the interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of APP with GAPDH is unlikely to influence directly the rate of glycolysis but may serve another function.
