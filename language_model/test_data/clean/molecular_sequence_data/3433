Guanine deaminase catalyses the conversion of guanine to xanthine and ammonia, thereby irreversibly removing the guanine base from the pool of guanine-containing metabolites. We have identified five alleles at the mouse guanine deaminase locus by cDNA sequencing. These alleles were defined by single-nucleotide polymorphisms at a total of 19 positions. For each allele the representative strains are as follows: Gda(a), C57BL/6J and DBA/2J; Gda(b), A/J; Gda(c), MOLF/Ei; Gda(d), CAST/Ei; and Gda(e), SPRET-1. The only codon change resulting in an amino acid substitution was found at nucleotide 523, where GAT was replaced by AAT in Mus spretus resulting in the deduced substitution of Asp-174 by Asn. The single-nucleotide difference between the a and b alleles was also typed by allele-specific oligonucleotide amplification for 17 common strains of Mus musculus susbp. musculus. By typing the AxB and BxA recombinant inbred (RI) strain sets, Gda was mapped to mouse chromosome 19, a region syntenic with human chromosome 9q11-q22.
