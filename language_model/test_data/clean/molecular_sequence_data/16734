A 60-nucleotide region (S1) downstream of the transcription start site of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S RNA can enhance gene expression. By using transient expression assays with plant protoplasts, this activity was shown to be at least partially due to the effect of transcriptional enhancers within this region. We identify sequence motifs with enhancer function, which are normally masked by the powerful upstream enhancers of the 35S promoter. A repeated CT-rich motif is involved both in enhancer function and in interaction with plant nuclear proteins. The S1 region can also enhance expression from heterologous promoters.
