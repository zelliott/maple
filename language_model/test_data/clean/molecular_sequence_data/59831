We identified some gene linkage groups in Entamoeba histolytica using a 4-M urea improved transversal alternating field electrophoresis (TAFE) method. Complex rosette-structured DNA molecules were found trapped along the gel lanes, explaining the fuzziness of the patterns. Using several episomal probes, including 16 S, 5.8 S, and 25 S ribosomal (r)Dna genes, an autonomous replication sequence (ARS), and EhVR1, we identified a complete ribosomal episome linkage group (CELG) at the 1.2-Mb position. Three other incomplete groups were found: IELG-1, formed by EhVR1, 16 S, 5.8 S, and 25 S genes; IELG-2 formed by EhVR1, 16 S and 25 S; and IELG-3 formed only by 5.8 S. Ehadh3, Ehpfo, and Ehredox genes migrated at the 1.8-Mb position, forming the non-ribosomal linkage group, NRLG-1.8, while the Ehenl-1 gene migrated at 1.6 Mb forming the NRLG-1.6 group. Ehhk was located at 1.2, 0.8, and 0.17 Mb in three different groups: NRLG-1.2, IELG-3-0.8, and NRLG-0.17. Putative lineal chromosomes were also identified using an heterologous telomeric probe. By in situ hybridization experiments, the rDNA and Ehhk genes were located in both nucleus and cytoplasm, while the Ehpfo and Ehredox genes were found mainly in the nucleus. We propose a model hypothezising that the 16 S and 25 S genes are in a linear molecule, duplicated in two inverted repeats, which may be looped out of the linear DNA to form an episome probably lacking or not the 5.8 S sequence, which could be added later by recombination.
