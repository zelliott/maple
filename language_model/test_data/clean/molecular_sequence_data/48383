The present study examined sequence variation in three mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes, namely cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3 (cox3) and NADH dehydrogenase subunits 1 and 4 (nad1 and nad4), among Ascaridia galli isolates from different geographical localities in China. A portion of cox3 (pcox3), nad1 (pnad1) and nad4 (pnad4) genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) separately from adult A. galli individuals and the amplicons were subjected to sequencing from both directions. The length of the sequences of pcox3, pnad1 and pnad4 were 408 bp, 471 bp and 333 bp, respectively. The intraspecific sequence variations within A. galli were 0-1.7% for pcox3, 0-2.8% for pnad1 and 0-3.4% for pnad4. The A+T contents of the sequences were 67.16-67.65% (pcox3), 67.09-67.94% (pnad1) and 69.91-71.77% (pnad4). The interspecific sequence differences among members of the Ascaridida were significantly higher, being 13.2-30.9%, 12.8-29.0% and 15.1-34.1% for pcox3, pnad1 and pnad4, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses using combined sequences of pcox3, pnad1 and pnad4, with three different computational algorithms (Bayesian analysis, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony), all revealed distinct groups with high statistical support. These findings demonstrated the existence of intraspecific variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences among A. galli isolates from different geographical regions in China, and have implications for studying molecular epidemiology and population genetics of A. galli.
