Although the structural analysis of membrane proteins is advancing, an understanding of the basic principles that underlie their folding and assembly remains limited because of the high insolubility intrinsic to these molecules and concomitant challenges in obtaining crystals. Fortunately, from an experimental standpoint, membrane protein folding can be approximated as the rigid-body docking of pre-formed alpha-helical transmembrane segments one with another to form the final functional protein structure. Peptides derived from the sequences of native alpha-helical transmembrane segments and those that mimic their properties are therefore valuable in the experimental evaluation of protein folding within the membrane. Here we present an overview of the progress made in our laboratory and elsewhere in using peptide models toward defining the sequence requirements and forces stabilizing membrane protein folds.
