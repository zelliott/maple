GERI-155 is a macrolide antibiotic containing two deoxyhexose molecules, that has antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The deoxysugar biosynthetic gene cluster of GERI-155 was cloned from Streptomyces sp., GERI-155. One of the orfs, gerD, appeared to encode glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase (dTDP-glucose synthase), which converts dTTP and glucose-1-phosphate to dTDP-D-glucose and pyrophosphate. GerD was expressed in E. coli in vector pHJ2 and the expressed protein was purified to apparent homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B and DEAE-Trisacryl column chromatography. The specific activity of the enzyme increased 16-fold with a recovery of 10%. It migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of 30 kDa. The purified protein had glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase activity, catalyzing a reversible bimolecular group transfer reaction. In the forward reaction the highest activity was obtained with the combination of dTTP and alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate, and only 5.5% of that activity was obtained with UTP in place of dTTP. In the opposite direction the purified protein was highly specific for dTDP-D-glucose and pyrophosphate.
