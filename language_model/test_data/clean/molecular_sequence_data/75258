Nucleotide sequences for two immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (VH) genes and one pseudogene in the goldfish (Carassius auratus) and the family relationships and distribution of these genes in individual fish are presented. Comparison of the nucleotide and inferred amino acid sequences of goldfish and other vertebrate VH genes indicates that goldfish VH genes show the major VH gene regulatory and structural features (5'-putative promoter region, split hydrophobic leader, three framework and two complementarity-determining regions, and 3'-recombination signals for VH to diversity region joining) and that goldfish VH genes are not more closely related to one another than they are to VH genes of evolutionarily distant vertebrates such as the mammals. Goldfish VH genes appear to exist in distinct families, and individual goldfish can carry from none to apparently greater than 15 genes of a given family. These results suggest that whereas the basic structure of VH genes has been conserved in evolution, there may be substantial variation in the nature and population distribution of VH gene families in the vertebrates.
