Catalytic RNAs recognize specific sequences of RNA and cleave at a specific site. In this study, we designed hammerhead ribozymes with a thermodynamically stable loop of the sequence 5'C(UUCG)G3' to prevent the aggregation of ribozymes with hammerhead structures. The cleavage activities of these ribozymes were examined using a synthetic pentadecamer with the sequence for the c-Ha-ras mRNA mutated at codon 12 (GGU-->GUU). For in vivo studies, we constructed a plasmid which expressed a highly active ribozyme targeted against the mutated c-Ha-ras mRNA. When this ribozyme-encoding gene and the activated c-Ha-ras gene were cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells, morphologically normal cells were obtained. We also determined that the expression of the c-Ha-ras gene was inhibited in these cells. These results show that ribozymes containing this stable hairpin loop are useful for the regulation of specific gene expression in vivo.
