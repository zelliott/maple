cDNA clones encoding the alpha 1, alpha 2 and alpha 3 chains of mouse collagen VI have been isolated by screening cDNA libraries with the corresponding human probes. The composite cDNAs for the alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3 chains are 2.5, 1.6 and 2.9 kb in size respectively. The alpha 1 and alpha 2 cDNAs encode the C-terminal portions of the chains as well as the entire 3'-untranslated regions, while the alpha 3 cDNAs encode a central segment of 959 amino acids flanking the triple-helical domain. The deduced amino acid sequences share 86-88% identity with the human counterparts and 67-73% identity with the chicken equivalents. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of mouse, human and chicken collagens reveal that the key features of the protein, including the cysteine residues, imperfections in the Gly-Xaa-Xaa regions, Arg-Gly-Asp sequences and potential N-glycosylation sites, are mostly conserved.
