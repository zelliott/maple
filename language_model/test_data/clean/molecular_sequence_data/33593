Evidence suggests that the products of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL112-113 genes are involved in viral DNA replication during lytic infection. A polyclonal antibody was raised against the UL112 open reading frame (ORF) to characterize its function in detail. Immunoblots utilizing the UL112 antibody identified seven distinct protein bands (p20, p26, p28, p34, p43, p50 and p84) expressed during the HCMV infectious cycle. After screening a cDNA library constructed from cells 72 h after infection with HCMV, only four different cDNA protein-producing constructs were obtained, and their ORFs corresponded to p34, p43, p50 and p84. The proteins p20, p26 and p28 were further shown to be selectively included within mature HCMV particles, virions, non-infectious enveloped particles and dense bodies. Immunoaffinity protein purification was used to prepare the samples for liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. This analysis revealed that p20, p26 and p28 were derived from the UL112 ORF, most likely through post-translational proteolytic cleavage.
