In this study, we cloned the gene encoding 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS) from the hyper-lignin-degrading fungus Phanerochaete sordida YK-624. The deduced amino acid sequence showed highest identity (93.0%) to ALAS of P. chrysosporium. Expression of the gene encoding ALAS, which we named aas, corresponded temporally with the expression and activity of manganese peroxidase.
