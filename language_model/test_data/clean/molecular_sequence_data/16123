Pig plasma gelsolin (Mr = 81595; 739 residues) contains 704 identical residues out of a maximum 730 when compared to the cytoplasmic form of human gelsolin. The cDNA sequence also codes for a peptide of 33 residues N-terminal to the nine-residue plasma extension sequence previously reported: these 33 residues are highly homologous to the human signal peptide and plasma extension. Comparison of the gelsolin sequences with chicken brush border villin, severin from Dictyostelium discoideum and fragmin from Physarum polycephalum shows a strong evolutionary relationship between all these proteins. There are six large repeating segments in gelsolin and villin, and three similar segments in severin and fragmin. Although these multiple repeats cannot be related to any known function of these actin-severing proteins, this superfamily of proteins appears to have evolved from an ancestral sequence of 120 to 130 amino acid residues.
