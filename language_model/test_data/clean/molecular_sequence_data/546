To identify the function of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) mutation in the genesis of human glioma.

Mutations were found through polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism, and then the changed DNA fragments were purified and multiplied and sent to Shanghai for sequencing. Blast and ORF finder were used to find out the amino changes in NCAM.

An A-C transversion was found at position 1 126 in NCAM's 7 exon in a patient with glioblastoma from 43 astrocytoma.

Structural change in the protein caused by point mutation may be the reason for tumorigenesis of astrocytoma.
