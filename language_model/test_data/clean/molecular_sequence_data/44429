The primary structure of the 4.2-kb BamHI-fragment occurring abundantly in the genome of barley Hordeum vulgare was determined. By means of computer analysis, considerable homology was found between this fragment and the copia-like BARE-l retrotransposon studied earlier. A unique distinction of the BamHI fragment is its symmetrical structure caused by the presence of two mutually inverted parts, each of which is homologous to a long region of BARE-l including a 5'-LTR (long terminal repeat) and the adjacent leader sequence. No sequences homologous to the coding domains of BARE-l were revealed in the fragment. However, potentially functional signals were found: TATA boxes and primer-binding sites (PBS) exhibiting statistically significant homology to the corresponding regulatory signals of known retroelements. Thus, we have revealed and characterized a repeated element of the H. vulgare genome that is a markedly modified derivative of the BARE family of retrotransposons of this genome.
