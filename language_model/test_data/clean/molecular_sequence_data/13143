We isolated cDNA clones from Xenopus larvae, which encode a protein highly homologous to the mammalian beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), and analyzed developmental change of Xenopus APP gene expression. The maternal APP mRNA is accumulated from early oogenesis, but after fertilization, this mRNA is degraded reaching a minimum level around the gastrula stage. Zygotic transcription appears to start after the gastrula stage and to continue during subsequent embryonic and larval stages. These results suggest some fundamental roles of the APP molecule in Xenopus early development.
