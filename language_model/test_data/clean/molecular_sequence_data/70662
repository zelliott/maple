A cDNA encoding a novel glucuronyltransferase was cloned from a rat brain cDNA library. The cDNA sequence contained an open reading frame encoding 324 amino acids, with type II transmembrane topology. The amino acid sequence revealed 49% homology to rat GlcAT-P, a glucuronyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope of glycoproteins, [Terayama et al. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94, 6093-6098] and the highest sequence homology was found in the catalytic region. Northern blot analysis indicated that this newly cloned glucuronyltransferase is expressed in the nervous system, consistent with the selective localization of the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope in the nervous system. Transfection of this cDNA into COS-1 cells induced the expression of the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope on cell surfaces, and induced the morphological changes in these cells. These results indicated that this newly cloned cDNA is a second glucuronyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope.
