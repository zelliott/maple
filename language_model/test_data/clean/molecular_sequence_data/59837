A fucoxanthin-chlorophyll protein (FCP) cDNA from the raphidophyte Heterosigma carterae encodes a 210-amino acid polypeptide that has similarity to other FCPs and to the chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins (CABs) of terrestrial plants and green algae. The putative transit sequence has characteristics that resemble a signal sequence. The Heterosigma fcp genes are part of a large multigene family which includes members encoding at least two significantly different polypeptides (Fcp1, Fcp2). Comparison of the FCP sequences to the recently determined three-dimensional structure of the pea LHC II complex indicates that many of the key amino acids thought to participate in the binding of chlorophyll and the formation of complex-stabilizing ionic interactions are well conserved. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences of light-harvesting proteins shows that the FCPs of several chromophyte phyla form a natural group separate from the intrinisic peridinin-chlorophyll proteins (iPCPs) of the dinoflagellates: Although the FCP and CAB genes shared a common ancestor, these lineages diverged from each other prior to the separation of the CAB LHC I and LHC II sequences in the green algae and terrestrial plants.
