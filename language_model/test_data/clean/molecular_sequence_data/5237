We previously sequenced the 4333-nucleotide cDNA of the COPA (HEP-COP) gene which encodes the human homologue of the alpha-subunit of the coatomer protein complex, involved in intracellular protein transport. Within the 3' untranslated region at nucleotides 4049-4333 was observed an Alu repeat containing conserved A and B block elements, and showing high homology to the human Alu-Sx subfamily consensus sequence. Upstream of the Alu repeat were noted a TATA box, a CAAT motif and two activating transcription factor (ATF)-like binding sites, which represent putative regulatory elements directing Alu transcription. In addition, the 25 and 35 N-terminal amino acid residues of COPA and its bovine homologue were identical to xenin-25 and proxenin, respectively. Xenin-25 is a gastrointestinal hormone that stimulates exocrine pancreatic secretion. This peptide is related to xenopsin, neurotensin and neuromedin N which are bioactive peptides derived from larger precursors via proteolytic cleavage by cathepsin E at processing sites determined by conserved C-terminal sequences, i.e. proline/valine-X-X-hydrophobic amino acid. Given the conformity of the C-terminal residues of xenin-25 (PWIL) and of its progenitor molecule, proxenin (VIQL), it is proposed that these peptides are generated by a similar mechanism of post-translational modification involving a parent precursor represented by the alpha-subunit of coatomer.
