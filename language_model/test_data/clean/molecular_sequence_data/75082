Even though a "CCAAT" box element is localized approximately equal to 80 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site in many eukaryotic promoters, it is not recognized by a single ubiquitous transcription factor. We show here that such a sequence present in the rat albumin promoter binds a protein distinct from the CCAAT-binding transcription factor CTF/NFI or from the CCAAT-binding protein (CBP) previously described. The protein binding to the albumin CCAAT sequence (ACF or albumin CCAAT factor) is not exclusive to liver, since we found a protein with identical properties in spleen.
