Sequential treatment of partially (two-thirds) hepatectomized rats with diethylnitrosamine and 2-acetylaminofluorene induces the emergence of diploid hepatocytes in rat liver. These carcinogen-induced diploid cell populations are thought to contain the progenitors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), i.e., initiated, cells. In the study presented here, we addressed the question of whether putative mutations in carcinogen-induced diploid hepatocytes can cooperate with activated oncogenes in the process of transformation in vitro. Both carcinogenesis in vivo and transformation in vitro have been shown to be multistep processes requiring at least two independent transforming events. Diploid and polyploid rat hepatocytes were isolated by centrifugal elutriation. The purity of the elutriated fractions was 88 +/- 3% in the diploid fraction and 84 +/- 3% in the polyploid fraction. Hepatocytes from both the elutriated cell fractions and, for comparison, hepatocytes from untreated rats were transfected by electroporation with oncogene expression vectors containing the mutated human T24 c-Ha-ras gene and of the N-myc gene. Transient expression of transfected DNA was similar in both hepatocyte populations. No cell lines could be established by using the N-myc vector. In contrast, the carcinogen-induced diploid hepatocytes, but not polyploid hepatocytes, could be converted by transfection with the ras vector into permanent anchorage-independent growing cell lines with hepatocyte-like morphology and differentiation. These cell lines expressed the myc proto-oncogene and transforming growth factor-alpha constitutively. Thus, carcinogen-induced diploid hepatocytes are sensitive to transformation by the ras oncogene, suggesting cooperation between putative preexisting mutations in the diploid cells and the ras oncogene product in hepatocellular transformation.
