T cell receptor (TCR) V alpha and V beta chain usage of HTLV-I tax-specific, HLA class I restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTL) was determined from lymphocytes obtained from peripheral blood of patients with HTLV-I associated neurological disease. To characterize TCR repertoire, CD8+ lymphocytes from peripheral blood were cloned in limiting dilution, and the resulting wells were screened for HTLV-I-specific precursor CTL activity. RNA was isolated from HLA-A2 restricted HTLV-I tax peptide-specific (tax 11-19; LLFGYPVYV) CD8+ CTL lines and cDNA was analyzed by PCR amplification using V alpha and V beta chain family-specific oligonucleotide primers. The results indicate that CD8+ cytotoxic T cell lines from HLA-A2 HAM/TSP patients express a limited repertoire of T cell receptor chains which may correlate with duration and severity of disease. The restricted use of TCR genes expressed by antigen-specific CTL may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP and may be of value in developing immunotherapeutic strategies that focus on eliminating these cells or inhibiting their activity.
