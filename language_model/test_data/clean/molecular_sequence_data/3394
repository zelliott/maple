Two conservative gene clusters, the S10 ribosomal protein region and one (of the two) set of rRNA genes, were split in a genome crossover rearrangement event in Mycoplasma gallisepticum. As a result of the rearrangement the major part of the S10 ribosomal protein cluster is located upstream of genes for 23S-5S rRNA (rrn23-5), but the genes infA-rpl36-rps13-rpoA-rpl17 are located immediately downstream of the isolated gene for 16S rRNA (rrn16). A new ribosomal protein cluster infA-rpl36-rps13-rpoA-rpl17-rps16-trmD-rpl19 was formed. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that this ribosomal protein cluster is an operon.
