Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a gram-negative marine bacterium, is an important pathogen causing food-borne gastroenteritis or septicemia. Recent genome sequencing of the RIMD2210633 strain (a Kanagawa phenomenon-positive clinical isolate of serotype O3:K6) revealed that the strain has two sets of gene clusters that encode the type III secretion system (TTSS) apparatus. The first cluster, TTSS1, is located on the large chromosome, and the second, TTSS2, is on the small chromosome. Previously, we reported that TTSS1 is involved in the cytotoxicity of the RIMD2210633 strain against HeLa cells. Here, we analyzed proteins secreted via the TTSS apparatus encoded by TTSS1 by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified the proteins encoded by genes VP1680, VP1686, and VPA450. To investigate the roles of those secreted proteins, we constructed and analyzed a series of deletion mutants. Flow cytometry analysis using fluorescence-activated cell sorting with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V demonstrated that the TTSS1-dependent cell death was by apoptosis. The cytotoxicity to HeLa cells was related to one of the newly identified secreted proteins encoded by VP1680. Adenylate cyclase fusion protein studies proved that the newly identified secreted proteins were translocated into HeLa cells. Thus, these appear to be the TTSS effector proteins in V. parahaemolyticus.
