The utility of proteomics to assess pollutant response of Scrobicularia plana clams from three sites of Guadalquivir Estuary at the southern end of the National Park of Do√±ana (SW Spain) has been studied. Protein expression profiles were analyzed by 2-DE in soluble fractions of S. plana gills. Nearly 2000 well-resolved spots were detected in silver-stained gels, with focused areas in the 4-6.5 pH range. Different protein expression signatures were found at each site, with the highest number of more intense spots in animals with the highest metal content. Nineteen more intense protein spots were analyzed out by nanospray-ion trap tandem mass spectrometry, de novo sequencing and a bioinformatics search for their possible identification. While sequence tags of 16 more intense protein spots were obtained, including several proteins induced by pollutant exposure of model organisms, only 2 proteins were unambiguously identified: hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH). Both enzymes were significantly higher in animals with the highest metal contents. Thus, we propose these two proteins, HPRT and G3PDH, as novel pollution biomarkers.
