Recently we have isolated and characterized a cDNA coding for a novel developmentally regulated chick embryo protein, cartilage associated protein (CASP). Here we describe the isolation and characterization of the cDNAs coding for the mouse CASP. Comparison of the mammalian putative protein sequence with the chick sequence shows a very high identity overall (51%); in particular the chick protein is homologous to the half amino terminus of the mouse protein. Furthermore, the comparison of the CASP cDNA sequence with sequences of the genebank database confirms our hypothesis that the CASP genes belong to a novel family that also includes genes encoding for some nuclear antigens. In all mouse tissues examined three CASP mRNAs species are detected, whereas in chick tissues a single mRNA is present. Immunohistochemistry studies show that the protein is expressed in all mouse embryonic cartilages. The mouse cartilage associated protein gene (Crtap) was assigned to chromosome 9F3-F4 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
