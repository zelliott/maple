Members of the order Methanocellales play a key role in methane emissions in paddy fields. Because of their slow growth and fastidious culture conditions, pure cultures are difficult to isolate and have been unavailable until recently. Here we report the complete genome sequence of a novel isolate in this group, Methanocella conradii strain HZ254.
