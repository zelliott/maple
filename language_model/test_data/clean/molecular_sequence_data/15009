H-Rev107 is a protein that was previously cloned as a negative regulator of proto-oncogene Ras and classified as a class II tumor suppressor. Its structural similarity to lecithin retinol acyltransferase and Ca2+-independent phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) N-acyltransferase led us to analyze H-Rev107 as an enzyme involved in phospholipid metabolism. Here, we show that recombinant H-Rev107s from rat, human, and mouse possess phospholipase (PL) A1 or A2 activity toward phosphatidylcholine (PC). Further examination with purified recombinant protein revealed that H-Rev107 functions as a cytosolic Ca2+-independent PLA(1/2) for PC and PE with higher PLA1 activity than PLA2 activity. Dithiothreitol and iodoacetic acid exhibited stimulatory and inhibitory effects, respectively. Histidine-21 and cysteine-111 of rat H-Rev107 were presumed to form a catalytic dyad based on database analysis, and their single mutants were totally inactive. These results suggested that H-Rev107 is a hydrolase of the thiol type. The N-terminal proline-rich and C-terminal hydrophobic domains of H-Rev107 were earlier reported to be responsible for the regulation of cell proliferation. Analysis of deletion mutants indicated that these domains are also catalytically essential, suggesting relevance of the catalytic activity to the anti-proliferative activity.
