The anterior pituitary is thought to be unable to synthesize dopamine (DA) except under experimental conditions where a tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity, the rate-limiting step of its synthesis, has been demonstrated. In this work, we tested whether the enzyme described as active under particular conditions comes from de novo TH gene transcription or from a pre-existing TH mRNA poorly translated or untranslated under physiological conditions. Therefore, we searched for the presence of TH mRNA in normal female rat pituitary using the polymerase chain reaction following reverse transcription (RT/PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH). The neurointermediate lobe (NIL) of the hypophysis was used as negative tissue, since it is thought to be unable to synthesize TH. As expected, no ISH labelling could be seen in the neural lobe (NL). However, scarce labelled cells were found in the intermediate lobe (IL) confirming the positive results observed in the NIL by RT/PCR. The anterior lobe (AL) also presented TH mRNA by PCR and ISH. The TH gene expression in sparse cells of the AL is discussed in regard to the ability of the AL to synthesize DA under particular conditions from a pre-existing mRNA.
