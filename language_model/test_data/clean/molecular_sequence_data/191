A novel antimicrobial peptide, Bactrocerin-1, was purified and characterized from an immunized dipteran insect, Bactrocera dorsalis. Bactrocerin-1 has 20 amino acid residues with a mass of 2,325.95 Da. The amino acid sequence of Bactrocerin-1 showed very high similarity to the active fragment (46V-65S-NH(2)) of Coleoptericin A. The composition of amino acid residues revealed that Bactrocerin-1 is a hydrophobic, positively charged, and Lys/Ile/Gly-rich peptide. Minimal growth inhibition concentration (MIC) measurements for synthesized Bactrocerin-1 showed a very broad spectrum of anti-microbial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. Bactrocerin-1 did not show hemolytic activity toward mouse red blood cells even at a concentration of 50 microM. Analysis of the Helical-wheel projection and the CD spectrum suggested that Bactrocerin-1 contains the amphipathic alpha-helix.
