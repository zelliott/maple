O-Acetyl-ADP-ribose (OAADPR) is a metabolite produced from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as a product of sirtuin-mediated protein deacetylation. We present here a simple, one-step, nonenzymatic synthesis of OAADPR from NAD and sodium acetate in acetic acid. We extended the reaction to other carboxylic acids, demonstrating that the reaction between NAD and nonaqueous carboxylate buffers produces mixtures of the corresponding 2'- and 3'-carboxylic esters.
