The Framesearch algorithm includes the possibility of a frameshift error in its alignment algorithm, and therefore can find alignments that span different reading frames. Protocols in this unit describe the use of Framesearch to search a protein sequence database for sequences that are similar to a query nucleotide sequence, and to search a nucleotide sequence database for sequences that are similar to a query protein sequence. Three alternate protocols describe ways to improve the speed of Framesearch and thus make it practical for routine use. Framesearch is especially appropriate for low-quality single-read nucleotide sequence data, such as ESTs (expressed sequence tags) or early drafts of genomic sequences; it does not offer any significant advantage over less CPU-intensive algorithms for relatively high-quality nucleotide sequences without many single-nucleotide insertion or deletion errors.
