The two glycosylated N- and C-terminal lobes of buffalo lactoferrin have been produced by limited proteolysis using proteinase K. Lactoferrin is a single chain glycoprotein of molecular mass 80 kDa with two iron-binding sites and two structural lobes connected by a short peptide. Purified samples of lactoferrin, isolated from buffalo colostrum, were subjected to hydrolysis using trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin, subtilisin and proteinase K. The first three proteinases produced two major fragments of approximately 35 and 23 kDa together with small molecular mass peptides. Trypsin and chymotrypsin partly digested lactoferrin, while pepsin converted all the intact lactoferrin into fragments. Subtilisin hydrolysis produced fragments of 40 and 26 kDa together with low molecular mass peptides. However, SDS-PAGE of the proteinase K hydrolysis product gave a clear band at 40 kDa together with a band indicating a substantial quantity of low molecular mass peptides (< 14.4 kDa). Upon ion-exchange chromatography this product gave two major fractions, which were further purified by gel filtration and identified as the C and N lobes from their N-terminal sequences. Thus, the 40 kDa band in SDS-PAGE of the proteinase K hydrolysis product contained two fragments of equal molecular mass. On further hydrolysis with proteinase K, the N lobe was completely hydrolysed into low molecular mass peptides, while only a small fraction of the C lobe was converted into small products. This suggested that an inhibitory fragment was present in the C lobe that was released on hydrolysis to small fragments and prevented complete digestion of the C lobe by high-affinity binding to the active site of proteinase K. This fragment was isolated from the lactoferrin-proteinase K complex and its sequence determined to be Val-Ala-Gln-Gly-Gly-Ala-Ala-Gly-Leu-Ala. Circular dichroism studies indicated a high alpha-helical content in the native lactoferrin while comparatively lower helical structures were present in the N and C lobes. In addition, the iron saturations of the N and C lobes appeared to be lower than that of the native protein.
