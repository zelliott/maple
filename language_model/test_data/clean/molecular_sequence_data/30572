The Saccharomyces cerevisiae anaerobic gene (ANB1) is negatively regulated both by oxygen and heme. We have shown recently that an upstream repressor site located in the 5'-flanking region of this gene controls its expression (Mehta, K.D., and Smith, M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 8670-8675). In this paper, we present the complete genomic sequence of the ANB1 locus of S. cerevisiae. The ANB1 locus encodes a protein of 157 residues with an Mr of 17, 134. The deduced amino acid sequence of the ANB1 gene product shows strikingly extensive sequence and structural homology (63.5% identical residues and an additional 15% conservative substitutions) to the 154-amino-acid-long human and rabbit eukaryotic translation initiator factor (eIF)-4D. Factor eIF-4D is the only known mammalian protein that undergoes a unique post-translational modification of Lys-50 to the amino acid hypusine, and interestingly the same lysine is also present in the ANB1 gene product. Results presented provide strong evidence that the ANB1 locus that encodes a transcript, tr-2, and a second locus encoding a transcript, tr-1, together encode two forms of yeast eIF-4D. Interestingly, heme regulates both the loci in an opposite manner; as a result it can dictate the isoform available under conditions of high and low oxygen tension. The ROX1 locus of S. cerevisiae is known to regulate CYC1, COXVb, and ANB1 genes at the transcriptional level; the ROX1 locus thus regulates all known anaerobically expressed genes that are involved in different cellular functions such as respiration and protein synthesis.
