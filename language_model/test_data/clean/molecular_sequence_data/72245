A family of four satellite DNAs has been characterized in the genome of the bivalve mollusc, Donax trunculus. All share HindIII sites, a similar monomer length of about 160 base pairs (bp), and the related oligonucleotide motifs GGTCA and GGGTTA, repeated six to 15 times within the repetitive units. The motif GGTCA is common to all members of the satellite family. It is present in three of them in both orientations, interspersed within nonrepetitive DNA sequences. The hexanucleotide GGGTTA appears to be the main building element of one of the satellites forming a prominent subrepeat structure in conjunction with the 5-bp motif. The former has been also found in perfect tandem repeats in a junction region adjacent to the proper satellite sequence. Southern analysis has revealed that (GGGTTA)n and/or related sequences are abundant and widely distributed in the D. trunculus genome. The distribution observed is consistent with the concurrence of the scattering of short sequence motifs throughout the genome and the spread of longer DNA segments, with concomitant formation of satellite monomer repeats. Both kinds of dispersion may have contributed to the observed complex arrangement of the HindIII satellite DNA family in Donax.
