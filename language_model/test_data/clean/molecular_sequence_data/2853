The pilin structural gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1244 was cloned in both cosmids and lambda. Expression of the cloned gene was detected in P. aeruginosa strains PAO2003, PA103, and 653A by an immunoblot reaction utilizing monoclonal antibodies. Western blot analysis showed that pilin expressed from the cloned gene was slightly larger than native 1244 pilin when produced in strains PAO2003 and 653A, but distinctly smaller in PA103. Bacteriophages specific for the 1244 pilus did not lyse strain PAO2003 containing the cloned 1244 pilin gene, indicating that functional 1244 pili were not assembled in this recombinant strain. Nucleotide sequencing revealed a coding region which when translated would produce a 15,615 dalton peptide. The amino-terminal region of this peptide is identical with published pilin sequences. While the rest of the peptides are generally dissimilar, common residues are seen within potentially antigenic regions.
