Malaria continues to be a major public health concern, and there are concerted efforts to eliminate it. The quest for a vaccine remains a top priority, and vaccines based on the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) are among the lead candidates, with the RTS,S vaccine currently undergoing phase 3 testing in Africa. Previous studies have reported anti-CSP antibody-mediated enhancement of in vitro invasion of homologous sporozoites. This effect has been shown to be concentration dependent; high-level antibodies are inhibitory, whereas low-level antibodies lead to enhancement of invasion. Nondominant shared epitopes may lead to the generation of low titers of cross-reactive antibodies that may prove to be detrimental. We report cross-species recognition of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium berghei sporozoites by anti-Plasmodium vivax CSP serum samples. In addition, we report that vaccination of mice with VMP001, a P. vivax CSP vaccine candidate, reduces, not enhances, P. berghei infection in mice.
