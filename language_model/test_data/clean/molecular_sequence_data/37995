A mutant embryonal carcinoma cell line, NR1-6, was established subsequent to retroviral insertion. The insertion was shown to be causative for a number of aberrant properties associated with the mutant cells. Analysis of >17 kb of the insertion site flanking region failed to reveal any homology between this locus and any reported sequence with the exception of one EST of unknown function and a few repetitive elements including B1 element and a CA dinucleotide repeat. CA repeats occur commonly in the mouse genome and usually show size variation. In this study, we mapped this multiphenotype locus using CA repeat polymorphism and Jackson Laboratory's interspecific backcross panels. The locus maps to the proximal end of the X chromosome between MGI offsets 1.5 and 4.5 and has been designated DXUalb1. There are several interesting candidate genes within this region. Analyses of their expression pattern may lead us to a better understanding of the molecular regulation of the variant mutant phenotypes.
