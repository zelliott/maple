A 2550-bp portion of the mitochondrial genome of a Demosponge, genus Tetilla, was amplified from whole genomic DNA extract and sequenced. The sequence was found to code for the 3' end of the 16S rRNA gene, cytochrome c oxidase subunit II, a lysine tRNA, ATPase subunit 8, and a 5' portion of ATPase subunit 6. The Porifera cluster distinctly within the eumetazoan radiation, as a sister group to the Cnidaria. Also, the mitochondrial genetic code of this sponge is likely identical to that found in the Cnidaria. Both the full COII DNA and protein sequences and a portion of the 16S rRNA gene were found to possess a striking similarity to published Cnidarian mtDNA sequences, allying the Porifera more closely to the Cnidaria than to any other metazoan phylum. The gene arrangement, COII-tRNALys-ATP8-ATP6, is observed in many Eumetazoan phyla and is apparently ancestral in the metazoa.
