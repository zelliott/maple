We have previously developed an assay to measure DNA homologous pairing activities in crude extracts: The POM blot. In mammalian nuclear extracts, we detected two major DNA homologous pairing activities: POMp100 and POMp75. Here, we present the purification and identification of POMp75 as the pro-oncoprotein TLS/FUS. Because of the pro-oncogene status of TLS/FUS, we studied in addition, the relationships between cell proliferation and POM activities. We show that transformation of human fibroblasts by SV40 large T antigen results in a strong increase of both POMpl00 and TLS/POMp75 activities. Although detectable levels of both POMp100 and TLS/POMp75 are observed in non-immortalized fibroblasts or lymphocytes, fibroblasts at mid confluence or lymphocytes stimulated by phytohaemaglutinin, show higher levels of POM activities. Moreover, induction of differentiation of mouse F9 line by retinoic acid leads to the inhibition of both POMp100 and TLS/POMp75 activities. Comparison of POM activity of TLS/FUS with the amount of TLS protein detected by Western blot, suggests that the POM activity could be regulated by post-translation modification. Taken together, these results indicate that POMp100 and TLS/POMp75 activities are present in normal cells but are connected to cell proliferation. Possible relationship between cell proliferation, response to DNA damage and DNA homologous pairing activity of the pro-oncoprotein TLS/FUS are discussed.
