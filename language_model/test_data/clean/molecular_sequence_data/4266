Mutants of HERG, the human form of ERG (the ether-a-go-go-related K+ channel gene), are responsible for some forms of the long-QT syndrome, an abnormality of cardiac repolarization. HERG was cloned from brain and has properties similar but not identical to the rapidly activating component of the native cardiac K+ channel current (Ikr). We identified in the mouse an alternatively processed form of ERG (MERG B) that is expressed abundantly in heart but only in trace amounts in brain. MERG B has a unique 36-amino acid NH2-terminal domain that is strongly basic and considerably shorter than the 376-amino acid NH2-terminal domain of HERG. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the kinetics of activation and deactivation of the MERG B current were best fit by a biexponential function, with the fast components dominant over the slow components. The fast component of activation had a mean tau value of 163 +/- 16 ms at -20 mV and 8 +/- 4 ms at +20 mV (n = 4). The fast component of deactivation had a mean tau value of 145 +/- 29 ms at -20 mV and 12 +/- 4 ms at -90 mV (n = 4). The MERG B current was blocked by the selective IKr blocker, dofetilide, with an IC50 of 54 nmol/L. In addition, we isolated HERG B, the human homologue of MERG B, which has electrophysiological characteristics qualitatively similar to those of MERG B. We have identified ERG B, an alternatively processed isoform of the ERG gene, expressed selectively in heart and with electrophysiological characteristics similar to those of native cardiac IKr.
