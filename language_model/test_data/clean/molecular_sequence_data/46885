Phospholipase D (PLD) of Streptomyces antibioticus was labelled with fluorescent-labelled substrate, 1-hexanoyl-2-{6-[(7-nitro-2-1, 3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-amino]hexanoyl}-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, when it was incubated with the substrate and the reaction followed by SDS/PAGE. Mutant enzymes lacking the catalytic activity were not labelled under the same conditions, indicating that labelling of the PLD occurred as the result of its catalytic action. This confirmed that the labelled protein was the phosphatidyl PLD intermediate. PLDs contain two copies of the highly conserved catalytic HxKxxxxD (HKD) motif. Therefore, two protein fragments were separately prepared with recombinant strains of Escherichia coli. One of the fragments was the N-terminal half of the intact PLD containing one HKD motif, and the other was the C-terminal half with the other motif. An active enzyme was reconstructed from these two fragments, and therefore designated fragmentary PLD (fPLD). When fPLD was subjected to the labelling experiment, only the C-terminal half was labelled. Therefore, it was concluded that the catalytic nucleophile that bound directly to the phosphatidyl group of the substrate was located on the C-terminal half of PLD, and that the N-terminal half did not contain such a nucleophile.
