We investigated the structure and developmental pattern of expression of two genes clustered at the janus locus, located at 99D.3R. Data obtained from genomic and cDNA sequencing and from a combination of S1 mapping and primer extension experiments indicated a very unusual organization of this locus, which appeared to be composed of two partially overlapping genes, designated janA and janB. These two genes were found to be transcribed in the same direction. janA encoded one minor and two major transcripts. The 5' end of the janB mRNA mapped within the 3' untranslated region of the janA transcribed sequence. The overlapping region was 118 bases long. Similarities observed between these two genes with respect to both peptidic sequence and intron position strongly suggested that this locus originated from the duplication of an ancestral transcription unit. However, each of the resulting genes has acquired its own specificity of expression linked to sex determination. The janB transcript was detected only in males, and its expression at the adult stage was restricted to germ line cells. The janA gene displayed a much more complex expression; one of the major mRNAs was found in both sexes and at all stages, whereas the two other janA transcripts were expressed only in males.
