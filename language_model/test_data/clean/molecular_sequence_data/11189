dishevelled (Dsh) is a member of the segment polarity gene family in Drosophila which plays an important role in the early developmental patterning processes. A human homologue of Dsh (DVL-1) has recently been described. Here, we report the cloning of a second human homologue of Dsh (called DVL-3) by cDNA library screening. The human DVL-3 gene encodes a predicted 716 amino acid protein which exhibits 98% amino acid identity with mouse Dvl-3 and 49% with Drosophila Dsh. DVL-3 was mapped to 3q27. The expression of DVL-3 mRNA was detected in 30 human cell lines and 2 primary cell cultures. DVL-3 mRNA was detected in normal human breast tissues (n = 4) and tumours (n = 25). Statistically, there was no difference in DVL-3 mRNA level between normal breast tissues and tumours. In human colorectal samples, DVL-3 was expressed equally in matched normal tissues, polyps and tumours. The data indicates that DVL-3 is widely expressed in human cells and supports the notion of a new developmental gene family for dishevelled which may have a widespread role in signal transduction.
