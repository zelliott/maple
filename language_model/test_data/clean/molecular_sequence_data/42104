Acid-stable trypsin-plasmin inhibitor (ASTPI) had almost no direct effect on the increased levels of the plasma enzymes elastase, plasmin and plasminogen activators in an acute pancreatitis model in the dog, whereas it strongly inhibited the activation of such enzymes by intravenous administration. In vivo experiments also showed strong inhibition by ASTPI of pancreas tissue elastase and plasma fibrinolysis. Anti-shock and anti-pancreatitis effects of ASTPI observed in clinical therapy may be related to this "indirect inhibition".
