Secondary and tertiary structures of human blood alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein, a member of the lipocalin family, have been studied for the first time by infrared and Raman spectroscopies. Vibrational spectroscopy confirmed details of the secondary structure and the structure content predicted by homology modeling of the protein moiety, i.e., 15% alpha-helices, 41% beta-sheets, 12% beta-turns, 8% bands, and 24% unordered structure at pH 7.4. Our model shows that the protein folds as a highly symmetrical all-beta protein dominated by a single eight-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. Thermal dynamics in the range 20-70 degrees C followed by Raman spectroscopy and analyzed by principle component analysis revealed full reversibility of the protein motion upon heating dominated by decreasing of beta-sheets. Raman difference spectroscopy confirmed the proximity of Trp(122) to progesterone binding.
