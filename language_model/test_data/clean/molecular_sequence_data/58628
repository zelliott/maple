A cDNA clone specifying a cell wall protein was isolated from a Yarrowia lipolytica cDNA library. The cDNA library was constructed in the expression vector lambda gt 11, with the RNA isolated from actively growing mycelial cells. The deduced amino acid sequence shows that the encoded protein contains an N-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide. We have designated this protein YWP1 for Yarrowia lipolytica cell Wall Protein. Northern hybridization identified YWP1 transcript only when Y. lipolytica was growing in the mycelial form. The encoded protein seems to be covalently bound to the glucan cell wall since it is not released from the cell walls by sodium dodecyl sulphate extraction, but it is solubilized following partial degradation of beta-glucan by Zymolyase digestion. The protein is localized in the outer surface on the tip of the growing mycelial cells and is found partially cryptic in sub-apical locations, suggesting that it participates directly in the mycelial wall architecture.
