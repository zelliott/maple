A facultatively anaerobic, prosthecate bacterium, strain Mfc52(T), was isolated from a microbial fuel cell inoculated with soil and fed with cellulose as the sole fuel. Cells were Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, straight or slightly curved rods, and some of them had one or two polar prosthecae (stalks). Cells reproduced by binary fission or by budding from mother cells having prosthecae. Strain Mfc52(T) fermented various sugars and produced lactate, acetate and fumarate. Ferric iron, nitrate, oxygen and fumarate served as electron acceptors, while sulfate and malate did not. Nitrate was reduced to nitrite. The DNA G+C content was 64.7 mol%. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogeny, strain Mfc52(T) was affiliated with the genus Rhizomicrobium in the class Alphaproteobacteria and most closely related to Rhizomicrobium palustre with a sequence similarity of 97 %. Based on these physiological and phylogenetic characteristics, the name Rhizomicrobium electricum sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is Mfc52(T) ( = JCM 15089(T)  = KCTC 5806(T)).
