Carbohydrates on cell surfaces are important biomolecules in various biological recognition processes. Elucidation of the biological roles of complex oligosaccharides necessitates an efficient methodology to synthesize these compounds and their analogs. Enzymatic synthesis renders itself to be useful in the construction of an oligosaccharide structure owing to its mild reaction condition, high regio- and stereoselectivity. This review article focuses on the recent progress in oligosaccharide syntheses catalyzed by glycosyltransferases, namely sialyltransferase, galactosyltransferase, fucosyltransferase, and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. A survey of the latest patent and literature related to this field is also included.
