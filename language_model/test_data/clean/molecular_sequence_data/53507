Human thioredoxin-like protein (txl) is a novel member of the expanding thioredoxin superfamily whose main characteristic is the presence, after the thioredoxin domain, of a C-terminal extension of 184 residues with no homology with any other protein in the databases. Txl is a cytosolic ubiquitously expressed protein and it has been copurified with a kinase of the STE20 family, which is proteolytically activated by caspases in apoptosis. However, no cellular function has yet been assigned to this protein. In the present study we report the genomic organization of the txl gene which encompasses approximately 36 kb organized in eight exons ranging from 96 bp to 303 bp. In contrast, intron sizes are much bigger ranging from 1.5 kb to 12 kb. Chromosomal localization of txl gene revealed that it maps at position 18q21, a region frequently affected in different human tumours. Furthermore, we have identified the putative homologues of txl in both Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans that display much closer homology to the known thioredoxins than the human txl protein. Indeed, critical residues for optimal thioredoxin activity are present in both Drosophila and Caenorhabditis txl but absent in the human protein suggesting that txl might have evolved to carry out a function different from the general disulfide reductase typical of thioredoxins.
