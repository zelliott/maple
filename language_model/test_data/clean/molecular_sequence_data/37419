Our mutagenesis study has investigated all amino acid mutations in the penicillin-binding domain of PBP 1A from Hungarian pneumococcal isolate 3191 to determine the importance of every mutation in the development of penicillin and cefotaxime resistance. Our data reveal that mutations at amino acid positions 574 to 577 and position 539 cause penicillin and cefotaxime resistance.
