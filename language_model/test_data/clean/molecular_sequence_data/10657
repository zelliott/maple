A phenotypic study has been carried out on six moderately halophilic gram-positive nonmotile cocci isolated from ponds of a saltern located in Huelva, Spain. These strains were examined for 150 morphological, physiological, biochemical, and nutritional traits and showed phenotypic characteristics similar to those of Nesterenkonia halobia (formerly Micrococcus halobius). The guanine-plus-cytosine (G + C) content of their DNA ranged between 70 and 72 mol%, values quite similar to those described for N. halobia (71.5 mol%). The 16S rDNA sequence analysis of one representative isolate showed that it is phylogenetically quite close to N. halobia, within the high-G + C-content gram-positive branch. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments showed a high degree of homology (72 to 100%) among the six isolates and the type strain N. halobia ATCC 21727. All data demonstrate quite clearly that the six isolates are members of the species N. halobia. Since this species was described on the basis of a single strain isolated from unrefined solar salt, and its description is not complete (especially in the utilization of different compounds), our study contributes to a better description of the moderate halophile N. halobia.
