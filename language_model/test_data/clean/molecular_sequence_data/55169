Many studies have used surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to search for blood-based proteins that are related to the presence of breast cancer. We review the biomarkers discovered or targeted measured by these methods and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these studies. We highlight two proteins that were most often related to breast cancer: C3a des-arginine anaphylatoxin (C3adesArg) (molecular weight: 8,938 Da) and fragments of inter-alpha trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 (ITIH4). In addition, we elaborate on three important methodological aspects related to these studies: protein identification, specificity of the markers, and disease heterogeneity. Finally, we propose some points to be addressed in future studies. These include the use of other analytical measurement techniques, need of protein identification, the importance of identical sample handling protocols for cases and controls, and the stratification of the results according to molecular subtypes and stages of breast cancer. Ultimately this may lead to the discovery of new and valid breast cancer specific biomarkers.
