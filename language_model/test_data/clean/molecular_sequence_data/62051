The molecular mechanism of hereditary persistence of alpha-fetoprotein (HPAFP) has been previously described in a large Scottish family, consisting of a -119G>A substitution in the distal hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF-1) binding site of the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene promoter. We report here the molecular mechanisms of HPAFP in 2 new unrelated families.

Family 1 was of Bengali origin, and family 2 was Italian. Four of 5 subjects (family 1) and 3 of 9 (family 2) showed HPAFP. The AFP gene promoter was studied in all available family members.

All subjects with high AFP levels had mutated promoter sequences. Family 1 showed the reported -119G>A substitution. Family 2 showed -55C>A and -65C>T substitutions in the proximal putative HNF-1 binding region of the promoter. The -55C>A mutation increased the similarity of the proximal HNF-1 binding region to a consensus binding region. Gel shift assays confirmed its increased affinity toward HNF-1, and transfection experiments revealed an increased level of gene transcription. The -65C>T substitution theoretically created a CCAAT box. However, gel shift and transfection experiments failed to show any biological effect of this substitution that is associated with the -55C>A mutation.

Two different mutations localized in either HNF-1 binding sites of the AFP gene promoter may result in HPAFP. This highlights the importance of HNF-1 in AFP gene expression. Unexplained persistent AFP should lead to family study and/or AFP gene promoter sequencing to avoid inappropriate explorations and treatment decisions.
