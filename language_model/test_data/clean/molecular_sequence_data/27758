As a first step in determining the importance of the anaplerotic function of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) in amino acid biosynthesis, the ppc gene coding for PEPC of Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC13032 has been cloned by complementation of an Escherichia coli ppc mutant strain. PEPC activity encoded by the cloned gene is not affected by acetyl-CoA under conditions where the E. coli enzyme is strongly activated, whereas acetyl-CoA is able to relieve inhibition by L-aspartate used singly or in combination with alpha-ketoglutarate. Amplification of the ppc gene in a C. glutamicum lysine-excreting strain resulted in increased PEPC-specific activity and lysine productivity. The nucleotide sequence of a DNA fragment of 4885 bp encompassing the ppc gene has been determined. At the amino acid level, PEPC from C. glutamicum presents overall a high degree of similarity with corresponding enzymes from three different organisms. The location of some strictly conserved regions may have important implications for PEPC activity and allostery.
