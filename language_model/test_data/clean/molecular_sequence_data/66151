The new human leucocyte antigen-DRB1*0465 allele was identified in the Hodgkin's lymphoma cell line KM-H2. This novel allele differs from the DRB1*0406 allele by a single nucleotide exchange at position 288 (211) (A-->T), which results in an arginine to tryptophan amino acid replacement at codon 90 in the new allele.
