The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a new diagnostic technique for the detection of enteroviral infection; however, it currently provides only qualitative results. The aim of this study was to adapt PCR for the accurate quantitation of enteroviral RNA in clinical specimens. For this purpose, we designed a standard RNA which was homologous to sequences at the 5' end of the coxsackie B3 enterovirus genome but contained a single-base-pair mutation which created a novel internal restriction site. Serial dilutions of this standard template RNA were mixed with a fixed concentration of coxsackie B3 enterovirus RNA. The viral and standard templates were reversed transcribed to cDNA and coamplified by PCR, and a comparison of the radioactive PCR products was made. Since the templates were both present in a single reaction tube and competed for the same primers, the ratio of products remained proportional throughout the amplification process. By this approach, a fourfold-difference in viral titer was clearly distinguishable. Moreover, we were able to accurately quantitate as few as 15 50% tissue culture infectious doses, which reflects common clinical viral titers. This study lays the foundation for quantitation of enteroviral RNA in clinical specimens and establishes a technique that can readily be applied to the diagnosis of enteroviral infection.
