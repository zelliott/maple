Eotaxin selectively binds CC chemokine receptor (CCR) 3, whereas monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-3 binds CCR1, CCR2, and CCR3. To identify the functional determinants of the chemokines, we generated four reciprocal chimeric chemokines-M10E9, M22E21, E8M11, and E20M23-by shuffling the N-terminus and N-loop of eotaxin and MCP-3. M22E21 and E8M11, which shared the N-loop from MCP-3, bound to monocytes with high affinity, and activated monocytes. In contrast, M10E9 and E20M23, which lacked the N-loop, failed to bind and transduce monocyte responses, identifying the N-loop of MCP-3 as the selectivity determinant for CCR1/CCR2. A BIAcore assay with an N-terminal peptide of CCR3 (residues 1-35) revealed that all chimeras except E20M23 exhibited varying degrees of binding affinity with commensurate chemotaxis activity of eosinophils. Surprisingly, E20M23 could neither bind the CCR3 peptide nor activate eosinophils, despite having both N-terminal motifs from eotaxin. These results suggest that the two N-terminal motifs of eotaxin must cooperate with other regions to successfully bind and activate CCR3.
