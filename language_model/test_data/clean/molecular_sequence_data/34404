A double crossover tile based artificial two-dimensional (2D) DNA lattice was fabricated and the dry-wet method was introduced to recover an original DNA lattice structure in order to deposit DNA lattices safely on the organic layer without damaging the layer. The DNA lattice was then employed as an electron blocking layer in a polymer solar cell causing an increase of about 10% up to 160% in the power conversion efficiency. Consequently, the resulting solar cell which had an artificial 2D DNA blocking layer showed a significant enhancement in power conversion efficiency compared to conventional polymer solar cells. It should be clear that the artificial DNA nanostructure holds unique physical properties that are extremely attractive for various energy-related and photonic applications.
