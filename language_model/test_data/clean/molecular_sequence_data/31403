Understanding the mechanisms of plant salinity tolerance can facilitate plant engineering for enhanced salt stress tolerance. Sugar beet monosomic addition line M14 obtained from the intercross between Beta vulgaris L. and Beta corolliflora Zoss exhibits tolerance to salt stress. Here we report the salt-responsive characteristics of the M14 plants under 0, 200, and 400 mM NaCl conditions using quantitative proteomics approaches. Proteins from control and the salt treated M14 plants were separated using 2D-DIGE. Eighty-six protein spots representing 67 unique proteins in leaves and 22 protein spots representing 22 unique proteins in roots were identified. In addition, iTRAQ LC-MS/MS was employed to identify and quantify differentially expressed proteins under salt stress. Seventy-five differentially expressed proteins in leaves and 43 differentially expressed proteins in roots were identified. The proteins were mainly involved in photosynthesis, energy, metabolism, protein folding and degradation, and stress and defense. Moreover, gene transcription data obtained from the same samples were compared to the corresponding protein data. Thirteen proteins in leaves and 12 in roots showed significant correlation in gene expression and protein levels. These results suggest the important processes for the M14 tolerance to salt stress include enhancement of photosynthesis and energy metabolism, accumulation of osmolyte and antioxidant enzymes, and regulation of methionine metabolism and ion uptake/exclusion.
