The highly polymorphic maize globulin1 (glb1) gene encodes an abundant embryo storage protein. The present study extends the analysis of glb1 variants to further explore the nature of polymorphism at this locus. The null allele Glb1-N1Hb, derived from the Illinois High Protein (IHP) strain of maize was characterized at the molecular level by nucleotide sequence analysis. Among other differences, a single-base insertion leading to a premature termination codon in the carboxyl-terminal half of the otherwise normal protein was observed. The likely reasons for the absence of GLB1 protein accumulation in the IHP strain of maize are discussed.
