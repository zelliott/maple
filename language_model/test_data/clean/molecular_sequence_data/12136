The regulation of apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) gene expression by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) was investigated in the human hepatoma cell line Hep G2. TPA treatment decreased apo A-I mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner, by up to 50% versus control cells within 24 h. Nuclear run-on transcription assays demonstrated a transcriptional effect of TPA. Using transfection analysis with a plasmid construct containing the -1378/+11 apo A-I promoter fused to the secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (SPAP) reporter gene, we showed that the SPAP activity was decreased to 50% when Hep G2 cells were incubated in the presence of TPA. The inhibitory effect of TPA was still maintained when fragment -253 to -4 of apo A-I promoter was linked to the CAT reporter gene. These data indicate that transcriptional modulation of apolipoprotein A-I gene expression following phorbol ester treatment is transduced by gene elements located between -253 and -4 of the apo A-I promoter.
