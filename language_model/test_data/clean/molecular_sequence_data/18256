Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a cytokine with a wide range of biological activities in inflammatory and immunologic responses. These activities are mediated by specific cell surface receptors of 55 kDa and 75 kDa apparent molecular masses. A 75-kDa TNF receptor cDNA was isolated using partial amino acid sequence information and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). When expressed in COS-1 cells, the cDNA transfers specific TNF-binding properties comparable to those of the native receptor. The predicted extracellular region contains four domains with characteristic cysteine residues highly similar to those of the 55-kDa TNF receptor, the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor, and the CDw40 and OX40 antigens. The consensus sequence of the TNF receptor extracellular domains also has similarity to the cysteine-rich sequence motif LIM. In marked contrast to the extracellular regions, the intracellular domains of the two TNF receptors are entirely unrelated, suggesting different modes of signaling and function.
