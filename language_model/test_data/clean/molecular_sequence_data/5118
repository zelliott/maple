We have used gene targeting in the DT40 cell line to create a cell line which expresses a fusion between CENP-C and a mouse steroid receptor and which behaves as a conditional loss of function mutant of CENP-C. Under restrictive conditions these cells arrest at the metaphase/anaphase junction and after a delay of approximately 2.5 h die by apoptosis. These results indicate that CENP-C is either necessary for anaphase chromosome movement or for mediating a signal which triggers centromere function during anaphase. Our approach is simple and applicable to a wide range of proteins with general cell autonomous functions in vertebrates.
