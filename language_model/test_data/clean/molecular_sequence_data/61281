The double D-loop DNA hybrid contains four DNA strands following hybridization of two RecA protein coated complementary single-stranded DNA probes with a homologous region of a double-stranded DNA target. A remarkable feature of the double D-loop DNA hybrids is their kinetic stabilities at internal sites within linear DNA targets after removal of RecA protein from hybrids. We report here that heterologous DNA inserts in one or both probe strands affect the kinetic stability of protein-free double D-loop hybrids. DNA heterologies normally distort DNA-DNA hybrids and consequently accelerate hybrid dissociation. In contrast, heterologous DNA inserts impede dissociation of double D-loops, especially when the insert sequences interact with each other by DNA base pairing. We propose a mechanism for this kinetic stabilization by heterologous DNA inserts based on the hypothesis that the main pathway of dissociation of double D-loop DNA hybrids is a DNA branch migration process involving the rotation of both probe-target duplexes in the hybrids. Heterologous DNA inserts constrain rotation of probe-target duplexes and consequently impede hybrid dissociation. Potential applications of the stabilized double D-loops for gene targeting are discussed.
