Human endothelin (ET) A receptor (hETAR) is a G-protein-mediated receptor that binds ET1 with high affinity and ET2 and ET3 with lower affinities. ET1 is the most potent endogenous vasoconstrictor known at this time. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, hETAR is rapidly desensitized after stimulation with ET1. This desensitization lasts 90-110 min. Human neurokinin A (hNKAR) and human serotonin type 2 receptors were also expressed in the Xenopus system for comparison to hETAR. hNKAR desensitizes for 25-35 min, while the serotonin receptor does not appear to desensitize. To examine the role of the cytoplasmic tail of hETAR in desensitization, deletion mutations were constructed which remove 11, 36, and 51 amino acids from the cytoplasmic tail. The mutations removing 11 and 36 residues were functional, but the mutation removing 51 amino acids was not functional. The two functional mutations have a resensitization time similar to that of hETAR. In summary, the prolonged desensitization time of hETAR is unique for G-protein-mediated receptors and may attenuate the adverse physiological effects of the endothelin family. In addition, the cytoplasmic tail of hETAR does not appear to play a role in desensitization or resensitization of this receptor.
