A beta-actin gene of carp (Cyprinus carpio) was isolated from a genomic EMBL3 library. The nucleotide sequence of the gene indicates six exons spanning 3.6 kb. Southern blot hybridization of restriction endonuclease digests of carp genomic DNA indicate that there are two copies of the beta-actin isotype and several other species of actin genes. The transcriptional start site is 85 bp and 24 bp downstream respectively from consensus CCAAT and TATA promoter elements. The organization of the carp beta-actin gene is identical to that of chicken, human, and rat genes in terms of size, exon/intron locations and junctions and in having a translationally silent first exon. The fish gene is 90% and 99% conserved at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively, with land vertebrate beta-actin genes. Northern blot analysis of beta-actin gene expression indicated that the gene is highly expressed in brain, less so in muscle, and much less so in liver cells. The putative beta-actin proximal promoter of carp, identified by the conservation of known actin regulatory sequences, is transcriptionally active in both mammalian and piscine cells.
