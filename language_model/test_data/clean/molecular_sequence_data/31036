An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed for the Lewis blood-group associated alpha-(1----4)-fucosyltransferase activity. Microtiter plates coated with the bovine serum albumin conjugate of a synthetic beta-D-Galp-(1----3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc disaccharide are incubated with a fucosyltransferase preparation in the presence of guanosine 5'-diphosphofucose. The resulting immobilized Lewis-a active trisaccharide beta-D-Galp-(1----3)-[alpha-L-Fucp-(1----4)]-beta-D-GlcpNAc is then detected and quantitated using a monoclonal anti-Lewis-a antibody. Product formation detected in this manner is linear with time, proportional to enzyme activity, and reproducibly quantitated in the 50-400 fmol range.
