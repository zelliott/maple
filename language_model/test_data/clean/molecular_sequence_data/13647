We describe the results of functional studies on DNA clones encoding functional bradykinin receptors derived from human, rat, and mouse sources and including both genomic and complementary DNA clones. In both the Xenopus oocyte and the COS cell expression systems, the receptors from human and rat showed the pharmacological properties of B2 receptors, but receptors from mouse displayed both B1- and B2-like pharmacological properties. We further investigated the molecular relationship between the B1 and B2 receptor subtypes expressed by a human fibroblast cell line, and we demonstrate that these two receptor subtypes are encoded by distinct mRNA species.
