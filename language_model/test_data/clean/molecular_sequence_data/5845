We isolated a DNA fragment (ALU1-P) encoding a protein with an activity of aluminum tolerance from an Al tolerant soil microorganism, Arthrobacter viscosus. This microorganism was isolated from acidic tea field soils. The cloned DNA is composed of 1090 nucleotides, which has one open-reading frame without any stop codon. However, when the DNA fragment was transferred into Escherichia coli, a microorganism susceptible to Al toxicity, it endowed E. coli with Al tolerance. The deduced amino acid sequence of the DNA showed 65% identity with the protein of YbaX gene in Escherichia coli, and 51.1% identity with YB91 Haein hypothetical protein of HI1191 gene in Haemophilus influenzae. The ALU1-P gene in the expression vector produced a protein of 192 amino acids deriving a molecular weight of 21.3 kDa by using the stop codon in vector. The ALU1-P gene is a new one that has the characteristic of Al tolerance.
