The author present a different stimulation regiment in assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist (GnRH-antagonist) introduces a new treatment option for patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF or ICSI. This protocol is safe (with reduction of OHSS risk), short and simple. No significant differences in fertilization rates and embryo quality were found between agonist and antagonist treatment. The clinical outcome was good and the ongoing pregnancy rate was within the range of pregnancy rates of a long protocol GnRH-agonist.
