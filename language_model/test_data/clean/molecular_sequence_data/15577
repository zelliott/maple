The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the possible role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), adrenomedullin (AM) and adrenomedullin-2/intermedin (IMD) on food intake regulation in goldfish (Carassius auratus). We examined the effects of intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of these related hormones on food intake. Food-deprived goldfish were subjected to ICV injections of CGRP, AM and IMD and their food intake were quantified. CGRP at 10ng/g body weight (bw) significantly decreased food intake as compared to saline-treated fish. IMD at 10 and 50ng/g bw both significantly decreased food intake as compared to saline group. No significant differences were observed after AM administration. Our results suggest, for the first time in fish, a role for both CGRP and IMD in the central regulation of feeding in fish.
