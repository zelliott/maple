Signal transduction involving heterotrimeric G proteins is universal among fungi, animals, and plants. In plants and fungi, the best understood function for the G protein complex is its modulation of cell proliferation and one of several important signals that are known to modulate the rate at which these cells proliferate is D-glucose. Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings lacking the beta subunit (AGB1) of the G protein complex have altered cell division in the hypocotyl and are D-glucose hypersensitive. With the aim to discover new elements in G protein signaling, we screened for gain-of-function suppressors of altered cell proliferation during early development in the agb1-2 mutant background. One agb1-2-dependent suppressor, designated sgb1-1(D) for suppressor of G protein beta1 (agb1-2), restored to wild type the altered cell division in the hypocotyl and sugar hypersensitivity of the agb1-2 mutant. Consistent with AGB1 localization, SGB1 is found at the highest steady-state level in tissues with active cell division, and this level increases in hypocotyls when grown on D-glucose and sucrose. SGB1 is shown here to be a Golgi-localized hexose transporter and acts genetically with AGB1 in early seedling development.
