In the progeny of the monosomic addition line of common wheat, Triticum aestivum, carrying the gametocidal chromosome of Aegilops cylindrica, deletion chromosomes carrying the break point within the nucleolar organizing region of chromosome 1B appeared. Attempts were made to amplify the break points by PCR using primers of telomere and rDNA (rRNA gene). In one deletion line, specific amplification of DNA fragments including the 18S rRNA gene, telomere repeats, and their junction occurred. At the junction of telomere and rRNA gene there was a 31-bp inverted duplication of the rRNA gene. Telomere sequences were initiated from the sequence TAG in the duplication. Between the duplications a small sequence was also inserted. This novel DNA sequence at the break point indicates that the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle(s) took place after the first chromatin breakage by the gametocidal gene.
