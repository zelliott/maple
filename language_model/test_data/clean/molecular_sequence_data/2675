Evidence is presented which supports a suggestion that in large T antigens from polyomaviruses-serving as replication initiators--there is DNA-recognizing structure helix-turn-helix, firstly observed in transcription regulators of E. coli and some bacteriophages. It is suggested that all these proteins recognize DNA by the same mechanism.
