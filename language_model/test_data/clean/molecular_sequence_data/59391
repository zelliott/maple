In excised pith parenchyma from Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Wisconsin Havana 38, auxin (naphthalene-1-acetic acid) together with cytokinin (6-benzylaminopurine) induced a greater than 40-fold increase in a p34cdc2-like protein, recoverable in the p13suc1-binding fraction, that had high H1 histone kinase activity, but enzyme induced without cytokinin was inactive. In suspension-cultured N. plumbaginifolia Viv., cytokinin (kinetin) was stringently required only in late G2 phase of the cell division cycle (cdc) and cells lacking kinetin arrested in G2 phase with inactive p34cdc2-like H1 histone kinase. Control of the Cdc2 kinase by inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation was indicated by high phosphotyrosine in the inactive enzyme of arrested pith and suspension cells. Yeast cdc25 phosphatase, which is specific for removal of phosphate from tyrosine at the active site of p34cdc2 enzyme, was expressed in bacteria and caused extensive in-vitro activation of p13suc1-purified enzyme from pith and suspension cells cultured without cytokinin. Cytokinin stimulated the removal of phosphate, activation of the enzyme and rapid synchronous entry into mitosis. Therefore, plants can control cell division by tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdc2 but differ from somatic animal cells in coupling this mitotic control to hormonal signals.
