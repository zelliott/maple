A multiplex polymerase chain reaction protocol for the detection of Photobacterium damselae and subspecies piscicida and damselae discrimination, with internal amplification control, was developed. Assay specificity was assessed by testing 19 target and 25 non-target pure cultures. The detection limit was 500 fg, corresponding to 100 genome equivalents. The optimized protocol was also prevalidated with spleen, kidney and blood samples from infected and uninfected sea bass, without any culture step, and it can be proposed as a valid alternative to culture standard methods for the rapid and specific diagnosis of photobacteriosis in fish.
