A cDNA clone coding for general odorant-binding protein2 was isolated from the antenna of Helicoverpa armigera by RT-PCR and (5'/3')-RACE technique. Results of sequencing and structural analyses showed that the full-length of GOBP2Harm was 636 bp, possessing 162 amino acid residues and a signal peptide of 21 amino acids. Its predicted molecular weight and isoelectric point were 18.2 kDa and 5.21, respectively. This deduced amino acid sequence shared some common structural features with odorant-binding proteins from several moth species, including the six conserved cysteine motif, typical of insect's OBPs. Northern blot showed that GOBP2Harm is specifically expressed in the antenna of Helicoverpa armigera at similar levels in both sexes. In order to obtain sufficient GOBP2 for further determining its biochemical and physiological properties, a bacterical expression vector of GOBP2 was constructed and successfully expressed. The protein was obtained mainly as insoluble inclusion bodies, that, however, could be solubilized and refolded. The rGOBP2 was purified by affinity chromatography and gel filtration. The rGOBP2 was shown to cross-react with an anti-GOBP antiserum from Antheraea polyphemus. Finally, polyclonal antibodies against GOBP2Harm were used to mark the distribution of the protein in olfactory sensilla and were tested by immuno-electron microscopy. In the male, GOBP2Harm is mainly expressed in sensilla basiconica, while in the female, it is equally expressed in sensilla basiconica and in sensilla trichodea.
