The cDNAs encoding ovine trophoblastin (oTP) were isolated from an ovine embryo cDNA lambda gt 11 library by screening with a synthetic 29-mer oligodeoxynucleotide corresponding to amino acid (aa) residues 34 to 43 of oTP. The cDNA contained an open reading frame of 595 bp and the deduced amino acid sequence indicates a protein precursor of 195 aa. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons establish that oTP shares extensive homology with alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha) but is more closely related to the IFN-alpha sII subfamily. When the oTP cDNA was cloned into an eukaryotic expression vector and transfected in monkey COS cells, a high level of antiviral activity was detected. RNA blot analyses of total RNA reveal that the oTP-coding gene is expressed during a relatively short period (eleven to 21 days). The abundant expression of oTP mRNA corresponds closely to the time at which the embryo acts to extend luteal lifespan. RNAs homologous to oTP were also detected in goat and cow embryos at equivalent periods of their development, but not in the pig.
