One of the main problems still hampering solid-phase peptide synthesis using orthogonal protection strategies based on the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl amino protecting group is the difficult removal of currently used arginine arylsulphonyl guanidino protecting groups. Poor acid liability of 4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethylbenzenesulphonyl-protected arginine has led to the popularity of the newer 2,2,5,7,8- pentamethylchroman-6-sulphonyl guanidino protecting group. This group was initially believed to have liability to trifluoroacetic acid, the reagent commonly used to simultaneously deprotect peptides and detach them from the synthesis resin, comparable to tert.-butyl and trityl type protecting groups used for the protection of other peptide side-chain functionalities. In a comparison of three established cleavage/deprotection mixtures we have shown that this is not always the case, particularly in multiple arginine peptides. We have found that only hard-acid deprotection with trimethylsilyl bromide reliably removed both arylsulphonyl guanidino protecting groups from a variety of arginine-containing peptides.
