To identify genes upregulated during the process of ciliated cell differentiation of airway epithelial cells, differential display was used to compare RNA from rat tracheal epithelial (RTE) cells cultured under conditions that inhibit/promote ciliated cell differentiation. Several partial complementary DNAs (cDNAs) were identified whose expression was regulated coordinately with ciliated cell differentiation. One of these, KPL2, detected a messenger RNA transcript of approximately 6 kb when used as a probe on Northern blots of RNA from ciliated cultures but was undetectable in RNA from nonciliated cultures. Sequencing of overlapping clones obtained by a modified rapid amplification of cDNA ends procedure generated a complete cDNA sequence that exhibited no significant homology to sequences in GenBank, indicating that KPL2 is a novel gene. Southern analysis demonstrated that KPL2 exists as a single-copy gene. KPL2 contains a long open reading frame predicted to code for a protein of > 200 kD. Several putative functional motifs are present in the protein, including a calponin homology domain, three nuclear localization signals, a consensus P-loop, and a proline-rich region, suggesting that KPL2 has a unique function. KPL2 was undetectable in heart and liver samples, but was expressed in brain and testis, tissues that contain axonemal structures. In seminiferous tubules of the testis, KPL2 expression was stage-specific and appeared to be highest in spermatocytes and round spermatids. During differentiation of RTE cells, the expression of KPL2 closely paralleled that of an axonemal dynein heavy chain. These results suggest that KPL2 plays an important role in the differentiation or function of ciliated cells in the airway.
