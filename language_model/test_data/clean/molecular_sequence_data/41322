Two bifunctional enzymes cooperate in the assembly and the positioning of two sugars, D-olivose and D-mycarose, of the anticancer antibiotic mithramycin. MtmC finishes the biosynthesis of both sugar building blocks depending on which MtmGIV activity is supported. MtmGIV transfers these two sugars onto two structurally distinct acceptor substrates. The dual function of these enzymes explains two essential but previously unidentified activities.
