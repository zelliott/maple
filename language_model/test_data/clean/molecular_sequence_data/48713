The pseudoautosomal region (PAR) has important biological functions in spermatogenesis, male fertility and early development. Even though pig (Sus scrofa, SSC) is an agriculturally and biomedically important species, and its genome is sequenced, current knowledge about the porcine PAR is sparse. Here we defined the PAR in SSCXp/Yp by demarcating the sequence of the pseudoautosomal boundary at X:6,743,567 bp in intron 3-4 of SHROOM2 and showed that SHROOM2 is truncated in SSCY. Cytogenetic mapping of 20 BAC clones containing 15 PAR and X-specific genes revealed that the pig PAR is largely collinear with other mammalian PARs or Xp terminal regions. The results improved the current SSCX sequence assembly and facilitated distinction between the PAR and X-specific genes to study their expression in adult and embryonic tissues. A pilot analysis showed that the PAR genes are expressed at higher levels than X-specific genes during early development, whereas the expression of PAR genes was higher at day 60 compared to day 26, and higher in embryonic tissues compared to placenta. The findings advance the knowledge about the comparative organization of the PAR in mammals and suggest that the region might have important functions in early development in pigs.
