The M RNA segment of Toscana (TOS) phlebovirus was cloned and the complete nucleotide sequence determined. The M RNA segment is 4215 nucleotides in length, and it contains a single major open reading frame (ORF) in the viral-complementary sequence, between nucleotides 18 and 4034, which can encode for a polyprotein of 1339 amino acids (Mr 149 kDa). The viral segment is expressed via a unique mRNA containing 10-14 non-templated nucleotides at the 5' end and it is truncated at the 3' end by about 140 nucleotides in a purine-rich region. In M predicted amino acid sequences, several hydrophobic regions have been identified. They could function as a signal sequence or a transmembrane region for the different proteins. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of M precursor product revealed 38, 36, and 25% identity and 58, 56, and 47% similarity with those of Rift Valley fever (RVF), Punta Toro (PT) and Unkuniemi (UUK) viruses, respectively. Residues conserved among the proteins are mainly located at the COOH-portion of the precursor, while the major divergence is in the NSm coding regions. Based on sequence comparison and similarity of hydropathic pattern of TOS M segment with other phleboviruses the N-termini of TOS GN and GC glycoproteins were placed at residues 297 and 936 of the precursor.
