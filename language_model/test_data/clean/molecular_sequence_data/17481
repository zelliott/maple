S100 beta is a multifunctional protein that is found in large amounts in astrocytes and a number of other tissues. In the developing nervous system, S100 beta is secreted from proliferating astrocytes during the time of neurite outgrowth from cortical neurons. The secreted form has neurotrophic activity on primary neurons and neuroblastoma cells. The neurotrophic activity is sensitive to reduction of disulfide bonds, and appears to be a disulfide dimer of S100 beta. The accumulation of S100 beta in mature glial cells is associated with microtubule network. The transfection and expression of cDNA for S100 beta in mammalian cells confers neurotrophic activity on extracts of these cells. Based on our observations of a neurotrophic activity for S100 beta, the occurrence of the gene for S100 beta on human chromosome 21 (Allore et al., 1988) and the elevated levels of S100 beta-containing cells in AD and DS brains (Griffin et al., 1989), we suggest that S100 beta plays a role in the abnormal development of the nervous system in DS and the degeneration of central neurons in AD. It is essential at the present stage to demonstrate the action of S100 beta in vivo, and to construct animal models, such as transgenic mice, that overexpress S100 beta. Such models will allow the dissection of the role of S100 beta in the developing and degenerating central nervous system.
