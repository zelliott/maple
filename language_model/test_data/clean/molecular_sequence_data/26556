The centromere is a key chromosomal component for sister chromatid cohesion and is the site for kinetochore assembly and spindle fiber attachment, allowing each sister chromatid to faithfully segregate to each daughter cell during cell division. It is not clear what types of sequences act as functional centromeres and how centromere sequences are organized in Oryza brachyantha, an FF genome species. In this study, we found that the three classes of centromere-specific CentO-F satellites (CentO-F1, CentO-F2, and CentOF3) in O. brachyantha share no homology with the CentO satellites in Oryza sativa. The three classes of CentO-F satellites are all located within the chromosomal regions to which the spindle fibers attach and are characterized by megabase tandem arrays that are flanked by centromere-specific retrotransposons, CRR-F, in the O. brachyantha centromeres. Although these CentO-F satellites are quantitatively variable among 12 O. brachyantha centromeres, immunostaining with an antibody specific to CENH3 indicates that they are colocated with CENH3 in functional centromere regions. Our results demonstrate that the three classes of CentO-F satellites may be the major components of functional centromeres in O. brachyantha.
