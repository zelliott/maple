The complete nucleotide sequence of the dextranase gene of Streptococcus rattus ATCC19645 was determined. An open reading frame of the dextranase gene was 2,760 bp long and encoded a dextranase protein consisting of 920 amino acids with a molecular weight of 100,163 Da and an isoelectric point of 4.67. The S. rattus dextranase purified from recombinant Escherichia coli cells showed dextran-hydrolyzing activity with optimal pH (5.0) and temperature (40 C) similar to those of dextranases from Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus. The deduced amino acid sequence of the S. rattus dextranase revealed that the dextranase molecule consists of two variable regions and a conserved region. The variable regions contained an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal cell wall sorting signal; the conserved region contained two functional domains, catalytic and dextran-binding sites. This structural feature of the S. rattus dextranase is quite similar to that of other cariogenic species such as S. mutans, S. sobrinus, and Streptococcus downei.
