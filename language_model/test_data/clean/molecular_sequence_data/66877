An acquired V617F JAK2 mutation occurs in patients with polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocythemia (ET). In a proportion of V617F-positive patients, mitotic recombination produces mutation-homozygous cells that come to predominate with time. However, the prevalence of homozygosity is unclear, as previous reports studied mixed populations of wild-type, V617F-heterozygous, and V617F-homozygous mutant cells. We therefore analyzed 1766 individual hematopoietic colonies from 34 patients with PV or ET in whom granulocyte sequencing demonstrated that the mutant peak did not predominate. V617F-positive erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-Es) were more frequent in patients with PV compared with patients with ET (P = .022) and, strikingly, V617F-homozygous BFU-Es were detected in all 17 patients with PV, but in none of the patients with ET (P < .001). Moreover, mutation-homozygous cells were present in 2 patients with ET after polycythemic transformation. These results demonstrate that V617F-homozygous erythroid progenitors are present in most patients with PV but occur rarely in those with ET.
