The effects of the inoculant strain Sphingomonas paucimobilis 20006FA (isolated from a phenanthrene-contaminated soil) on the dynamics and structure of microbial communities and phenanthrene elimination rate were studied in soil microcosms artificially contaminated with phenanthrene. The inoculant managed to be established from the first inoculation as it was evidenced by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis, increasing the number of cultivable heterotrophic and PAH-degrading cells and enhancing phenanthrene degradation. These effects were observed only during the inoculation period. Nevertheless, the soil biological activity (dehydrogenase activity and CO(2) production) showed a late increase. Whereas gradual and successive changes in bacterial community structures were caused by phenanthrene contamination, the inoculation provoked immediate, significant, and stable changes on soil bacterial community. In spite of the long-term establishment of the inoculated strain, at the end of the experiment, the bioaugmentation did not produce significant changes in the residual soil phenanthrene concentration and did not improve the residual effects on the microbial soil community.
