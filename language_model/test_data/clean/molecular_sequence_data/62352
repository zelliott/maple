DNA fragments were amplified by PCR from all tested strains of Aeromonas hydrophila, A. caviae, and A. sobria with primers designed based on sequence alignment of all lipase, phospholipase C, and phospholipase A1 genes and the cytotonic enterotoxin gene, all of which have been reported to have the consensus region of the putative lipase substrate-binding domain. All strains showed lipase activity, and all amplified DNA fragments contained a nucleotide sequence corresponding to the substrate-binding domain. Thirty-five distinct nucleotide sequence patterns and 15 distinct deduced amino acid sequence patterns were found in the amplified DNA fragments from 59 A. hydrophila strains. The deduced amino acid sequences of the amplified DNA fragments from A. caviae and A. sobria strains had distinctive amino acids, suggesting a species-specific sequence in each organism. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence patterns appear to differ between clinical and environmental isolates among A. hydrophila strains. Some strains whose nucleotide sequences were identical to one another in the amplified region showed an identical DNA fingerprinting pattern by repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-PCR genotyping. These results suggest that A. hydrophila, and also A. caviae and A. sobria strains, have a gene encoding a protein with lipase activity. Homologs of the gene appear to be widely distributed in Aeromonas strains, probably associating with the evolutionary genetic difference between clinical and environmental isolates of A. hydrophila. Additionally, the distinctive nucleotide sequences of the genes could be attributed to the genotype of each strain, suggesting that their analysis may be helpful in elucidating the genetic heterogeneity of Aeromonas.
