We have isolated cDNA clones covering the complete B chain of the complement subunit Clq from mouse; this subunit initiates the classical complement pathway. Deoxynucleotide sequence analysis shows that these clones contain 156 nucleotides of the 5' untranslated region, followed by sequences coding for the 25 amino acids of the signal peptide; all of the 228 amino acids of the mature protein; and 140 nucleotides of the 3' untranslated region, including a poly A additional signal. The coding region for the mature protein contains 261 nucleotides for the Gly-X-Y repeat and 408 nucleotides for the globular portion of Clq. By comparing the nucleotide sequence of the mouse B chain of Clq with the human B chain (Reid, K.B.M., 1985, Biochem. J. 231, 729), we find a high homology (80%) within the mature protein, a lower homology within the signal peptide (59%) and the 3' untranslated region (47%) and no homology (26%) in the 5' untranslated region.
