Rat type 1 angiotensin II receptor has two subtypes, namely type 1a and type 1b. The regulation of the expressions of these two subtype receptor mRNAs was studied by using a competitive polymerase chain reaction method. The expression of the type 1a mRNA in the liver was negatively and that of the type 1b mRNA in the adrenal was positively modulated by bilateral nephrectomy. In the ventricle of 16 week old Spontaneously hypertensive rat, the expression level of the AT1b receptor mRNA was higher than that in the ventricle of the age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rat, while the expression levels of the AT1a mRNA in the ventricle were almost similar between the two strains at this age. Although type 1a and type 1b have almost similar functional properties, the expressions of their mRNAs were differentially regulated.
