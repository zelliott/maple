RLIP76 (also known as RalBP1) is an effector for Ral small G proteins. RLIP76 is a multifunctional, multi-domain protein that includes a GTPase activating domain for the Rho family (RhoGAP domain) and a GTPase binding domain (GBD) for the Ral small G proteins. The juxtaposition of these two domains (GAP and GBD) may be a strategy employed to co-ordinate regulation of Rho family and Ral-controlled signalling pathways at a crossover node. Here we present the (1)H, (15)N and (13)C NMR backbone and sidechain resonance assignments of the GAP and GBD di-domain (31 kDa).
