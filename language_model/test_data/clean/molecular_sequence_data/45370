Strain DY(T), which was isolated from garden soil in Japan, was subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and the GyrB protein revealed that the closest relative of strain DYT was [Flavobacterium] ferrugineum Sickles and Shaw 1934, with 94.8 and 90.1 % similarity, respectively. The two strains had similar chemotaxonomic characteristics, with menaquinone 7 as the major quinone system, 47.2-48.9 mol% DNA G+C content and 15 : 0 iso, 15 : 1 iso, 17 : 0 iso 3-OH and summed feature 3 as the major fatty acids. Based on genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, [Flavobacterium] ferrugineum IAM 15098T could be clearly differentiated from other members of the genus Flavobacterium. Strain DYT and [Flavobacterium] ferrugineum IAM 15098T could be easily distinguished from neighbouring taxa by morphological features (non-motile, non-gliding and non-filamentous single cells). Therefore, it is proposed that [Flavobacterium] ferrugineum IAM 15098T and strain DYT represent two separate species of a new genus, Terrimonas gen. nov., with the names Terrimonas ferruginea comb. nov. (type species; type strain IAM 15098T=ATCC 13524T) and Terrimonas lutea sp. nov. (type strain DYT=IAM 15284T=CCTCC AB205006T), respectively.
