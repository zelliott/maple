HLA-B5 and B35 CREG antigens include HLA-B35, B51, B52, B53, and B78. Recent studies suggest that the genes encoding the HLA-B5, B35 CREG, and HLA-B58 antigens share a common ancestor. We sequenced the exons of the genes encoding HLA-B51, B53, and B58 from American black individuals and the gene HLA-B52 encoding from an Arabic individual, and compared them with previously reported sequences of HLA-B51 (B*5101) and HLA-B52 (B*5201) from Japanese, HLA-B53 (B*5301) from an Algerian, and HLA-B58 (B*5801) from a Sardinian. The sequences of the genes from the American black and Arabic individuals were identical to those from the other races. These findings support the hypothesis that these antigens have evolved prior to divergence of the major ethnic groups.
