Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T cells and shares most but not all biological activities with interleukin-4 (IL-4). Both cytokines play an important role as a switch factor directing synthesis of IgE; they act on monocytes and endothelial cells, but unlike IL-4, IL-13 does not act on T cells. These cytokines have both common and distinct components in their respective receptors. Based on sequence similarity shared by cytokine receptor family members, we have identified a cDNA encoding the human IL-13 receptor (IL-13R). This cDNA was used to examine the pattern of IL-13R mRNA expression by Northern blot analyses of poly(A)+ RNA purified from different human tissues and cell lines. Among several myeloma cell lines analyzed, the U266 cell line was the only one found to express IL-13R transcripts. This cell line is also the only one described as producing IgE. The IL-13R gene was mapped to chromosome Xq24 by in situ hybridization. Interestingly, this locus is near that of the CD40 ligand gene, the product of which is also involved, like IL-13, in proliferation and IgE isotype switching of human B cells. The human IL-13R gene maps between two cytokine receptor genes located on the chromosome arm Xq region: the interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain gene (Xq13.1) and the interleukin-9 receptor gene (Xq28). The lack of nucleotide sequence similarity suggests unrelated evolutionary pathways between these receptor genes.
