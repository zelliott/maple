A cDNA clone encoding a zinc finger protein (AREB6) was isolated from a HeLa cell expression library using a positive regulatory element (-102 to -58) of rat Na,K-ATPase alpha 1 subunit gene (Atp1a1) as a probe. The clone is apparently an extended one of Nil-2-a originally isolated as a negative regulator of interleukin 2 gene [Williams, T.M. et al. (1991) Science 254, 1791-1794]. The open reading frame encodes 1,124 amino acids. It contains 7 zinc-finger motifs arranged in two widely separated clusters. A glutamic acid-rich region is observed at the C terminus from residues 989 to 1123. Co-transfection of the AREB6 cDNA with Atp1a1 fused to a reporter luciferase gene indicated that the AREB6 protein enhances or represses the promoter activity of the gene depending on the quantity of cDNA and on the cell type. The mRNA of AREB6 is expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, but not in liver, spleen, or pancreas. Genomic Southern analysis indicated that the gene encoding AREB6 is present as only one copy or two at most. Another cDNA clone obtained by using the same probe was identified as HEB [Hu, J.S., Olson, E.N., & Kingston, R.E. (1992) Mol. Cell. Biol. 12, 1031-1042]. Co-transfection of the cDNA enhanced or repressed the promoter activity of Atp1a1 depending on the cell type.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
