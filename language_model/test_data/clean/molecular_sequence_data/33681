Here we report the cloning and expression of chick TPTE, the avian ortholog of the mammalian pTEN2 gene. In the chick embryo, cTPTE expression begins at HH (Hamburger and Hamilton) stage 18 and is restricted to the tubular structures of the developing kidney. In the mesonephros, cTPTE expression localizes to the proximal tubules. In the adult kidney cTPTE expression is no longer detectable. The data presented here suggest that cTPTE plays an important role in the regulation of embryonic kidney function.
