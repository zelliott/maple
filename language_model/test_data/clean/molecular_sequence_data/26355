A mobile element (ME) having 91% homology with Dm1360 (Kholodilov et al., 1987) has been cloned from the Drosophila melanogaster genome and sequenced. The family of ME was designated hoppel. The members of this family are flanked by short inverted repeats likewise P, hobo and HB. The hoppel is hybridized with 10-30 euchromatic sites of polytene chromosomes of different Drosophila stocks. Abundant hybridization with heterochromatic regions of chromosomes-chromocenter, pericentric heterochromatin, the 4 chromosome and telomeres was observed in all stocks of D. melanogaster examined and in D. simulans. At least six genomic variants of ME differing in length of the central part were revealed. Hoppel possesses ARS activity similar to the P element. Two ME hoppel were shown to be arranged as a direct repeat in the recombinant phage.
