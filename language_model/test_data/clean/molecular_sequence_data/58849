We report the cloning of a novel human gene, CMKLR1, which encodes a protein that has notable sequence and structural homology to the seven transmembrane G-protein linked chemokine receptors. This gene has 55% nucleotide sequence homology to the IL-8 type 1 receptor and 53% to the N-formyl peptide related receptor 1 genes. The mRNA of this receptors is expressed in a broad array of tissues associated with hematopoietic and immune function including, spleen, thymus, appendix, lymph node, bone marrow, and fetal liver. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization the gene encoding CMLKR1 (chemokine-like receptor 1) was localized to human chromosome 12q24.1.
