The metal-binding motif in the sequence of leukotriene A4 (LTA4) (EC 3.3.2.6), a bifunctional zinc metalloenzyme, contains a glutamic acid that is conserved in several zinc hydrolases. To study its role for the two catalytic activities, Glu-296 in mouse leukotriene A4 hydrolase was replaced by a glutamine or alanine residue by site-directed mutagenesis. Wild-type and mutated cDNAs were expressed four or five times in Escherichia coli, and the resulting proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity. With respect to their epoxide hydrolase activities--i.e., the conversion of LTA4 into leukotriene B4--the mutated enzymes [Gln296]LTA4 hydrolase and [Ala296]LTA4 hydrolase exhibited specific activities of 1070 +/- 160 and 90 +/- 30 nmol of LTB4 per mg of protein per min (mean +/- SD; n = 4 or 5), respectively, corresponding to 150% and 15% of unmutated enzyme. In contrast, when the mutated proteins were assayed for peptidase activity toward alanine-4-nitroanilide, they were found to be virtually inactive (less than or equal to 0.2% of unmutated enzyme). To serve as a positive control, we also replaced Ser-298 with an alanine residue, which resulted in a protein ([Ala298]LTA4 hydrolase) with catalytic properties almost indistinguishable from the wild-type enzyme. Substitution of Glu-296 by glutamine or alanine was also carried out with human LTA4 hydrolase, and the mutated human enzymes displayed specific activities similar to the corresponding mouse proteins. Zinc analyses of the purified mouse and human proteins confirmed that the mutations did not significantly influence their zinc content. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate a direct catalytic role for Glu-296 in the peptidase reaction of LTA4 hydrolase, where it presumably acts as a base to polarize water, whereas its function, if any, is apparently not essential in the epoxide hydrolase reaction.
