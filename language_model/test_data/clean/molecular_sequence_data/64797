The p33(ING1b) tumor suppressor protein plays a prominent role in cellular stress responses including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, apoptosis, and chromatin remodeling. As the main product of the inhibitor of growth 1 (ING1) gene, p33(ING1b) is the most intensively studied protein of the ING family. So far, most ING1 antibodies have been raised against full-length proteins. Since all ING1 isoforms share an identical carboxyl-terminus, and commercially available ING1 antibodies often lack specificity, we sought to develop a polyclonal antibody capable of specifically recognizing the p33(ING1b) protein. Here, we describe the development and characterization of the p33(ING1b)-specific antibody.
