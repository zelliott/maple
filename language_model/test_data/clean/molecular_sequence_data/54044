In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Msh2p, a central component in mismatch repair, forms a heterodimer with Msh3p to repair small insertion/deletion mismatches and with Msh6p to repair base pair mismatches and single-nucleotide insertion/deletion mismatches. In haploids, a msh2Delta mutation is synthetically lethal with pol3-01, a mutation in the Poldelta proofreading exonuclease. Six conditional alleles of msh2 were identified as those that conferred viability in pol3-01 strains at 26 degrees but not at 35 degrees. DNA sequencing revealed that mutations in several of the msh2(ts) alleles are located in regions with previously unidentified functions. The conditional inviability of two mutants, msh2-L560S pol3-01 and msh2-L910P pol3-01, was suppressed by overexpression of EXO1 and MSH6, respectively. Partial suppression was also observed for the temperature-sensitive mutator phenotype exhibited by msh2-L560S and msh2-L910P strains in the lys2-Bgl reversion assay. High-copy plasmids bearing mutations in the conserved EXO1 nuclease domain were unable to suppress msh2-L560S pol3-01 conditional lethality. These results, in combination with a genetic analysis of msh6Delta pol3-01 and msh3Delta pol3-01 strains, suggest that the activity of the Msh2p-Msh6p heterodimer is important for viability in the presence of the pol3-01 mutation and that Exo1p plays a catalytic role in Msh2p-mediated mismatch repair.
