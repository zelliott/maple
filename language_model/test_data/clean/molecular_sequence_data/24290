Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized from L-Arg in the P450-type heme active site of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS). The internal axial ligand of the heme, Cys415, may hydrogen-bond to the side chain of the conserved Arg418 residue in neuronal NOS (nNOS). To understand the role of Arg418, we generated the nNOS mutants, Arg418Ala and Arg418Leu. NO formation activities with the mutants using both L-Arg and NHA as substrates were less than 0.1 nmol/min/nmol heme, in contrast to rates of 34-35 nmol/min/nmol heme with the wild-type enzyme. The heme reduction rate of the mutants was very slow, less than 10(-2) min(-1), in contrast with that (more than 10 min(-1)) of the wild type. The backbone amide group of Arg418 interacts with the Cys415 thiolate through van der Waals contact, whereas the carbonyl oxygen of Cys415 and the guanidino N(epsilon) atom of Arg418 form a tight hydrogen bond. The results suggest that Arg418 is critical in preserving the heme proximal structure and thus, is indirectly involved in both catalysis and electron transfer from the reductase domain to the heme.
