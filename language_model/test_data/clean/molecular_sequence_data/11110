The human dopamine D4 receptor (hD4R), which has been implicated in human diseases such as schizophrenia and in a personality trait called "novelty seeking," has not yet been characterized at the protein level. Following epitope scanning of the hD4R, we have produced a highly specific monoclonal antibody named DFR1 raised against an amino-terminal peptide in a predicted extracellular region of the receptor. DFR1 decorated recombinant hD4Rs on the surface of intact Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy and also recognized recombinant hD4.2, hD4.4, and hD4.7 receptor isoforms by western blot analysis. When expressed stably in CHO cells, all three hD4R isoforms contained N-linked glycosylation and showed apparent molecular masses of 48, 55, and 67 kDa for hD4.2, hD4.4, and hD4.7, respectively. DFR1 immunoreactivity representing hD4R protein or dopamine D4 receptor-like antigens was observed in crude membrane extracts of postmortem human brain tissue by immunoblotting. The DFR1 antibody provides a new immunological tool with the potential to further our understanding of the human dopamine D4 receptor protein.
