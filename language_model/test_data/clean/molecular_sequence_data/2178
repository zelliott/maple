Full-length cDNA clones have been isolated for an mRNA which codes for four different but homologous proteins--a sulfatide activator protein, a co-beta-clucosidase, and two other proteins of similar structures. The primary structure as deduced from the nucleotide sequence is highly homologous to the precursor of the rat Sertoli cell sulfated glycoprotein 1. The full-length clone was 2,734-bp long, starting from 8 bases above the initiator ATG and terminating with a poly A tail. The nucleotide sequence confirmed an earlier prediction based on the amino acid sequence that a previously published sequence contained errors. On the other hand, the amino acid sequence now closely agrees with the recent revised sequence published by the same group except for several amino acids near the N-terminus. Two alternate forms of the sulfatide activator were detected, differing from each other by the presence or absence of 3-amino acid insertion.
