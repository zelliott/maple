Relative hydrophobicities of aromatic amino acid residues are investigated by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) on 10 synthetic copolypentapeptides of poly(VPGVG) of elastin. Utilizing the hydrophobic-driven process of the inverse temperature transition exhibited by these polypentapeptides in aqueous solution, the relative hydrophobicities of Phe, Trp, and Tyr residues are determined by the critical temperature and heat of the transition. The DSC data for the aromatic residue containing copolypentapeptide aqueous solution indicate that tryptophan is the most hydrophobic amino acid residue, phenylalanine the third most hydrophobic on basis of transition temperature and the second on basis of transition heat. For tyrosine, significant differences are observed between the phenolic and the phenoxide anionic states. At pH 7, where tyrosine is protonated, it is found to be the second most hydrophobic amino acid residue on the basis of the transition temperature, whereas on the basis of the heat of transition, it is less hydrophobic than both tryptophan and phenylalanine. Changing the pH from pH 7 to pH 12, for example, for poly[0.8(VPGVG), 0.2(VPGYG)] in aqueous solution shifts the transition temperature from 7 to 49 degrees C with a dramatically reduced heat. On the basis of both the transition temperature scale and the heat of transition, the hydroxylated tyrosine appears less hydrophobic than glycine.
