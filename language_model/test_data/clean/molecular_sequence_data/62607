Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a human pathogen of the alphaherpesvirus family which infects and spreads in the nervous system. Glycoproteins play a key role in the process of assembly and maturation of herpesviruses, which is essential for neuroinvasion and transneuronal spread. Glycoprotein B (gB) is a main component of the HSV-1 envelope and is necessary for the production of infectious particles. The cytoplasmic domain of gB, the longest one among HSV-1 glycoproteins, contains several highly conserved peptide sequences homologous to motifs involved in intracellular sorting. To determine the specific roles of these motifs in processing, subcellular localization, and the capacity of HSV-1 gB to complement a gB-null virus, we generated truncated or point mutated forms of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged gB. GFP-gB with a deletion in the acidic cluster DGDADEDDL (amino acids [aa] 896 to 904) behaved the same as the parental form. Deletion or disruption of the YTQV motif (aa 889 to 892) abolished internalization and reduced complementation by 60%. Disruption of the LL motif (aa 871 to 872) impaired the return of the protein to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) while enhancing its recycling to the plasma membrane. Truncations from residue E 857 abolished transport and processing of the truncated proteins, which had null complementation activity, through the Golgi complex. Altogether, our results favor a model in which HSV-1 gets its final envelope in the TGN, and they suggest that endocytosis, albeit not necessary, might play a role in infectivity.
