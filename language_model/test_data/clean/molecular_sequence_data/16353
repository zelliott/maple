The DNA coding for parts of the repetitive amino acid sequence of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein has been spliced to a sequence encoding part of the precursor to the major merozoite surface antigens, to produce a hybrid gene. Expression in Escherichia coli produces a protein with antigenic determinants from both malaria proteins. Antibodies raised against the expressed material react with both a peptide derived from the circumsporozoite repeat sequence, and the merozoite surface molecule. Hybrid molecules of this type may be the basis of a malaria vaccine.
