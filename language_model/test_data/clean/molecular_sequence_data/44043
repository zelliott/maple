A low degree of amino acid sequence similarity to FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs) has been obtained for the peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) domain of E. coli trigger factor (TF) that was thought to be significant with regard to the enzymatic properties of the bacterial enzyme. We examined whether the alteration of a negatively charged side-chain at position 37 (FKBP numbering) and a phenylalanine at position 99, both highly conserved through both types of enzymes, leads to parallel effects on the catalytic activity of both FKBP12 and TF-PPIase domain in a series of tetrapeptide substrates with different P1 subsites. For the latter enzyme, substitution of Glu178 by Val or Lys, which aligns to Asp37 in human FKBP12, enhanced the PPIase activity, whereas a strongly decreased enzymatic activity was determined for the Asp37Leu and Asp37Val variants of FKBP12. Regardless of the P1 subsite of the substrate used for the assay, mutation of Phe233Tyr generated a protein variant of the TF-PPIase domain with about 1% of the wild type PPIase activity. Dependent on the substrate nature, a moderate decrease as well as a 4.8-fold increase in k(cat)/K(M) could be determined for the corresponding Phe99Tyr FKBP12 variant. Neither of the mutations of the TF-PPIase domain was able to implant FK506 inhibition found as a major characteristic of the FKBP family of PPIases.
