Several studies have attempted to identify regions of the MHC class II molecule that participate in signal transduction. The importance of intact murine I-A cytoplasmic domains, either to tether the class II molecule to the cytoskeleton or to recruit signal-transducing proteins, is now well established. Recent data have also suggested that residues of the I-A beta transmembrane are involved in a second distinct signaling pathway. In the light of data suggesting that the second messengers activated on ligation of human and mouse class II molecules may differ, we set out to investigate whether the structural requirements for signaling for the human DR molecule are similar to those already described for the murine I-A molecule. We show that mutant DR class II molecules lacking 12 amino acids of the beta-chain cytoplasmic tail fail to translocate the protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha) and PKC beta II isoenzymes following stimulation with an anti-class II mAb. In contrast, truncation of either or both cytoplasmic domains of the DR molecule has no effect on class II-induced tyrosine kinase activity. PKC translocation following class II stimulation has been observed in both human and murine B lymphocytes, whereas tyrosine kinase activation is present in human B lymphocytes but absent in resting murine B lymphocytes. Therefore, we conclude that the DR beta cytoplasmic tail is requisite for the principal signaling pathway initiated via MHC class II. These data suggest that the signaling pathways seen in resting vs primed murine B cells may also operate in human APCs.
