Synthetic O-glycopeptides containing one or two GalNAc residues attached to Ser or Thr were used as substrates to investigate the effect of peptide structure on the activity of crude preparations of UDP-Gal:GalNAc alpha-R beta 3-Gal-transferase from pig stomach and pig and rat colonic mucosa and of a partially purified enzyme preparation from rat liver. High-performance liquid chromatography used to separate enzyme products revealed that uncharged glycopeptides with an acetyl group at the amino-terminal end and a tertiary butyl or an amide group at the carboxy-terminal end were resistant to proteolysis in crude preparations. The activity of beta 3-Gal-transferase varied with the sequence and length of the peptide portion of the substrate, the presence of protecting groups, the attachment site of GalNAc, and the number of GalNAc residues in the substrate. The presence and position of Pro had little effect on enzyme activity; ionizing groups near the GalNAc unit interfered with enzyme activity. Since the GalNAc-Thr moieties in many of these O-glycopeptides have been shown to assume similar rigid conformations, the variation in enzyme activity indicates that the beta 3-Gal-transferase recognizes both the peptide and carbohydrate moieties of the substrate. Rat and pig colonic mucosal homogenates contain beta 3- and beta 6-GlcNAc-transferases that synthesize respectively O-glycan core 3 (GlcNAc beta 3GalNAc alpha-R) and core 4 [GlcNAc beta 6(GlcNAc beta 3)GalNAc alpha-R]. These enzymes also showed variations in activity with different peptide structures; these effects did not parallel those observed with beta 3-Gal-transferase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
