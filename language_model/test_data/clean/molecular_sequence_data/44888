The cDNA encoding murine procathepsin E was isolated and sequenced and recombinant enzyme was produced in Escherichia coli. The activity of the purified recombinant mouse cathepsin E was characterised quantitatively using two synthetic peptide substrates and naturally occurring inhibitors. The majority of the recombinant enzyme was present as a homodimer (Mr approximately 80) in which the two monomers were linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond. By analogy to previous studies with human cathepsin E, this is most likely a consequence of the presence of a unique cysteine residue near the N-terminus of the mature proteinase. The availability of (i) recombinant murine enzyme in reasonable quantities and (ii) a full-length cDNA now enables structural investigations and attempts to generate 'knock-out' mice deficient in this important aspartic proteinase to be undertaken.
