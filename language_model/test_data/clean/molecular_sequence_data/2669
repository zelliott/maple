Numerous luciferase structural gene mutants of Vibrio harveyi have been generated by random mutagenesis and phenotypically characterized [Cline, T.W., & Hastings, J.W. (1972) Biochemistry 11, 3359-3370]. All mutants selected by Cline and Hastings for altered kinetics in the bioluminescence reaction had lesions in the alpha subunit. One of these mutants, AK-20, has normal or slightly enhanced thermal stability and enhanced FMNH2 binding affinity but a much-reduced quantum yield of bioluminescence and dramatically altered stability of the aldehyde-C4a-peroxydihydroflavin-luciferase intermediate (IIA), with a different aldehyde chain length dependence from that of the wild-type luciferase. To better understand the structural aspects of the aldehyde binding site in bacterial luciferase, we have cloned the luxAB genes from the V. harveyi mutant AK-20, determined the nucleotide sequence of the entire luxA gene, and determined the mutation to be TCT----TTT, resulting in a change of serine----phenylalanine at position 227 of the alpha subunit. To confirm that this alteration caused the altered kinetic properties of AK-20, we reverted the AK-20 luxA gene by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis to the wild-type sequence and found that the resulting enzyme is indistinguishable from the wild-type luciferase with respect to quantum yield, FMNH2 binding affinity, and intermediate IIA decay rates with 1-octanal, 1-decanal, and 1-dodecanal. To investigate the cause of the AK-20 phenotype, i.e., whether the phenotype is due to loss of the seryl residue or to the properties of the phenylalanyl residue, we have constructed mutants with alanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan at alpha 227.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
