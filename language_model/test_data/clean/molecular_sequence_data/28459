Chicken intestinal calbindin-D28k is an intracellular protein which is believed to have a fundamental role in vitamin D-mediated transport of calcium. A mapping approach based on 252Cf plasma desorption mass spectrometry (PD mapping) was used to screen the DNA-deduced sequence of calbindin-D28k for sequence changes and post-translational modifications. In the PD mapping experiment, purified calbindin-D28k was cleaved with cyanogen bromide and the resulting peptides were subjected to PD mass spectrometric analysis either as a mixture or as high-performance liquid chromatography isolated fractions. The DNA-derived primary structure of calbindin-D28k was confirmed by rapid PD mass spectral identification of the CNBr peptide fragments, and the nature of the N-terminal blocking group was readily determined to be an acetyl group. The relatively non-destructive nature of the PD mass spectrometric analysis allowed the mapping of the N-terminal peptide through an additional in situ V8 protease enzymatic reaction.
