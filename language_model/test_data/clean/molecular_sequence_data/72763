Rhodostomin (RHO) from Agkistrodon rhodostoma venom, consisting of 68 amino acids with an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequence and 12 cysteine residues, is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation. We previously demonstrated that cell culture plates coated with the bacterially produced fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase-RHO [GST-RHO(RGD)] can facilitate human hepatoma cell attachment via intergrin interaction within 15 min. In this study, we further characterized the effect of RHO fusion protein on platelet cells by creating two other related fusion proteins, GST-RHO(RGE) and GST-(PS)RHO. The former was a single amino acid-substituted mutant, in which the aspartic acid residue of RGD was replaced by glutamic acid, and the latter was an insertion mutant, in which a pentapeptide of protein kinase A phosphorylation site was inserted between GST and RHO. These two mutant proteins together with a wild-type of GST-RHO(RGD) and native form of RHO were used to study effects on the inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Results indicated that GST-RHO(RGD) inhibited platelet aggregation as potently as the native RHO, while the two other mutants were inactive. Furthermore, when unactivated platelet cells attached on the GST-RHO(RGD)-coated plate, they became a flattened pancake shape. From the results of facilitation of cell attachment on fusion protein-coated plates, we concluded that: (1) the GST-RHO(RGD) fusion protein is equally functional in inhibition of platelet aggregation and facilitation of cell attachment, which is through the interaction of RGD and integrins on the cell membrane; (2) the GST-RHO(RGE) mutant protein is unable to bind with integrins and results in loss of function; (3) the insertion mutant of GST-(PS)RHO may disrupt a proper conformation of RHO and also results in loss of function; (4) the bacterially produced fusion protein GST-RHO(RGD) can be properly used as an antithrombotic agent and an extracellular matrix.
