A novel recombinant human adenovirus (HAdV) species D was isolated from the stool of a pharyngitis patient in Japan and genetic characterization was performed by sequencing variable regions between HAdV types. The nucleotide sequences of the penton base gene and loops 1 and 2 in the hexon gene showed 100% identity with that of the recently identified HAdV-56. Although we observed greatest identity for the entire hexon gene sequence with that of HAdV-56, we noted even greater similarity between the partial nucleotide sequence of the conserved region 4 and that of HAdV-37. Furthermore, the fibre gene and early region 3 sequences were completely identical to that of HAdV-37. These results suggest that the strain is a novel adenovirus related to HAdV-37 and HAdV-56.
