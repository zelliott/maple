Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) strains are a diverse group of organisms capable of causing severe gastrointestinal disease in humans. Within the STEC family, certain strains appear to have greater virulence for humans. STEC strains carrying eae and belonging to serogroup O157 or O111 have been responsible for the vast majority of outbreaks of STEC disease reported to date. Here we describe a STEC O113:H21 strain lacking eae that was responsible for a cluster of three cases of hemolytic-uremic syndrome. This strain produces a single Stx2-related toxin and adheres efficiently to Henle 407 cells.
