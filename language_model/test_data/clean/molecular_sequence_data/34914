HML, a lectin from the red marine alga Hypnea musciformis, defines a novel lectin family. Orthorhombic crystals of HML belonging to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) grew within three weeks at 293 K using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. A complete data set was collected at 2.4 A resolution. HML is the first marine alga lectin to be crystallized.
