The Saccharomyces cerevisiae anaerobic gene (ANB1) is negatively regulated both by oxygen and heme. A 299-base pair-long fragment from the 5'-flanking region of the ANB1 gene was found to confer oxygen-mediated negative regulation to an heterologous CYC1-LacZ hybrid gene. Studies with deletions of predefined length in this fragment demonstrated the presence of separate elements that comprise an upstream promoter that is active in the absence or presence of oxygen, and an upstream repressor site (URS) which confers strong repression upon the promoter element when oxygen is present. The promoter element is located 5' to the URS in the ANB1 gene. Mixed oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to obtain nucleotide substitutions in the URS which partially or completely inactivated this sequence without affecting the promoter activity. The URS region has three short direct repeats which seem to be important for function, as nucleotide substitutions within the repeats and not outside them, inactivated URS function. A model to explain the negative regulation of the ANB1 gene by oxygen and heme is proposed.
