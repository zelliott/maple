The differential expression of the multilocus CK isozyme system throughout development of the two Xenopus species X. laevis and X. borealis was investigated. A cDNA containing the nearly complete coding sequence of the CK-IV subunit of X. laevis was isolated and sequenced. Early development of X. laevis proceeds with a stock of maternally derived CK-IV/IV isozyme. While the mRNA declines rapidly after fertilization and disappears before neurulation, maternal CK-IV/IV isozyme is active far beyond the onset of zygotic expression and is still detectable when tadpoles start feeding. Zygotic expression of CK-IV begins after neurulation, at stage 22/24, and seems to start simultaneously with that of another gene, CK-III. Modulation in the expression of these two genes and the appearance of two other isoforms, the CK-I and CK-II/III isozymes, take place during development in a tissue-specific manner. During metamorphosis, the CK phenotypes of eyes and skeletal musculature undergo additional changes. The final adult pattern only appears several weeks after metamorphosis. The presumed orthologous CK isozymes of X. borealis show a developmental profile similar to that of X. laevis, except that CK-II/II is equally present in oocytes and during early development, in addition to CK-IV/IV isozyme. These results show that the expression of each of the four CK genes of Xenopus is under differential developmental control.
