Osteogenin was purified from bovine bone matrix and its activity monitored by an in vivo bone induction assay. The purification method utilized extraction of the bone-inducing activity with 6 M urea, followed by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, and Sephacryl S-200. Active fractions were further purified by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis without reduction. Osteogenin activity was localized in a zone between 30 and 40 kDa. The amino acid sequences of a number of tryptic peptides of the gel-eluted material were determined. Reduction and alkylation of purified osteogenin in 7 M guanidine hydrochloride resulted in the total loss of biological activity. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions revealed a broad band with an apparent molecular mass of 22 kDa.
