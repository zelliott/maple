Subcutaneous adipose tissue of neonatal lambs has been examined for the presence of markers diagnostic of thermogenic brown fat. Uncoupling protein, uncoupling protein mRNA, and iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase activity were each detected in subcutaneous adipose tissue, as well as in the major internal fat depot (perirenal), of newborn lambs. These brown fat markers were not present, however, in adipose tissue of adult sheep. It is concluded that subcutaneous fat in newborn lambs is functionally 'brown', and similar to the internal fat; subcutaneous and internal adipose tissues follow a similar developmental path--from 'brown' to 'white'.
