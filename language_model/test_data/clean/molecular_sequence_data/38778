Sex-lethal (Sxl) is Drosophila melanogaster's key regulating gene in the sex-determining cascade. Its homologue in Megaselia scalaris, the chromosome 3 gene Megsxl, codes for a protein with an overall similarity of 77% with the corresponding D. melanogaster sequence. Expression in M. scalaris, however, is very unlike that in D. melanogaster. Megsxl transcripts with a long ORF occur in both sexes. Differential splicing is conserved but not sex-specific. There are several splice variants, among them one is common to gonads and somatic tissues of all developmental stages investigated, one is specific for ovaries and embryos, and a third one is not found in ovaries. In the ovary, Megsxl is heavily transcribed in nurse cells and transported into eggs. These results suggest a non-sex-determining function during early embryogenesis; the presence of Megsxl RNA in testes and somatic tissues calls for other (or more) functions.
