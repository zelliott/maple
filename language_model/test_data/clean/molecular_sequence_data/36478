The temperature dependence of the UV- and CD-spectra of the oligonucleotides 3'-d(A)10-L-(T)10-5' [anti(AT)], 3'-d(A)10-L-d(T)10-3' [par(AT)] and 3'-d(A)10-L-(dT)10-L-(dT)10-5' [tripl(ATT)] (L = -PO(CH2CH2O) 3p-) in the phosphate buffer at pH 7 under different concentrations of NaCL and in the presence or absence of 0.01 M MgCl2 was studied. All registered structural changes are the result of intramolecular processes if the concentrations of the oligonucleotides is low (about 2.2.10(-5) M). Par(AT) and anti(AT) exist in the only two forms, transforming into each other: under low temperatures they exist as hairpins with the parallel or antiparallel orientation of chains accordingly which transform into unfolded chains when the temperature increased. In contrast trip(ATT) exists in the three different forms depending on the temperature and ion conditions. They are: the three- stranded clip, the two-stranded hairpin with a single stranded "tail" and completely unfolded chain. For the first time this work presents thermodynamic parameters of the triplex formation from deoxyoligonucleotides depending on NaCl concentration. We have registered the CD spectra to one-, two-, and three-stranded forms. Ethidium bromide binding to three-stranded "clip" was investigated, and it was established that molecules of the dye may intercalate into the "clip" with formation of stable complexes (the constant of association 10(6) M-1). It is maximum three molecules of ethidium bromid which may bound to one molecule of the three-stranded clip. It has been shown that the suggested synthetic model (three oligonucleotide blocks combined by hydroxyalkyl chains) is the most convenient for physico-chemical investigations of triplexes today.
