In order to characterize the mouse homologue of the CD2 molecule, which has not yet been identified by immunologic means, cDNA clones putatively encoding mouse CD2 have been isolated by cross-hybridization with a cDNA probe for rat CD2. The predicted amino acid sequence of the putative mouse CD2 protein is consistent with that of a transmembrane glycoprotein, i.e., it consists of an N-terminal region of 186 amino acids bearing six potential N-glycosylation sites, a hydrophobic transmembrane segment of 25 residues, and a large cytoplasmic region of 116 amino acids rich in proline and basic residues. Comparison with the human and rat CD2 sequences clearly indicated the predicted mouse protein to be the mouse equivalent. Striking evolutionary conservations between mouse, rat, and human CD2 were found in their cytoplasmic region, suggesting a functional consequence of that segment for the physiologic role of CD2, such as signal transduction. RNA blot hybridization analysis demonstrated the expression of CD2 in T lymphocytes and in the NK cell lineage in mice. These data strongly suggest that the putative mouse CD2 molecule may perform some biologic functions in mouse T lymphocytes and NK cells as documented in humans.
