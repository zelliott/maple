The screening of the open reading frames identified in the whole yeast genome has allowed us to discover 34 proteins belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family. By phylogenetic study, they can be divided into 27 subfamilies including ADP/ATP, phosphate and citrate carriers, putative oxoglutarate and GDC carriers and 22 new subfamilies. Topology predictions using the 'positive inside rule' approach have shown that the yeast carriers are similarly oriented with both extremities exposed to the cytosol. In each subfamily, a strict conservation of the charged residues in the six transmembrane alpha-helices is observed, suggesting a functional role for these residues and the existence of 27 functionally distinct carriers.
