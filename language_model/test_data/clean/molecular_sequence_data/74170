Bacillus sphaericus is unable to use hexose and pentoses as the sole carbon source, due to the lack of key enzymes in Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (EMP), Hexose Monophophate Pathway (HMP) and Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway, such as phosphofructokinase (PFK). Based on the genome sequence annotation results of B. sphaericus C3-41, the phosphofructokinase gene pfk was verified with a single copy on chromosome, the aim of this research is to analysis the EMP pathway in B. sphaericus further, and confirm the function of phosphofructokinase.

The methods of southern-blot of pfk gene among different B. sphaericus strains, pfk ORF cloning from C3-41 and expressing in Escherichia coli, the corresponding sequence analysis and anlignment were used.

The pfk ORF of B. sphaericus was composed of 960 bp nucleitides encoding a protein about 42 kDa, and the PFK sequence analysis showed it had the conservative amino acids-binding sites and an ATP-binding domain. The expression of pfk in recombinant E. coli strain could complement the PFK activity of a pfk mutated E. coli strain DF1020.

The expressed PFK had the conventional phosphofructokinase activity, and settled the foundation for the further research of catabolism of B. sphaericus.
