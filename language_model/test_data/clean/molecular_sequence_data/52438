We have characterized a series of mouse monoclonal anti-CD4 and describe both their CD4 epitope recognition and Id expression. We also determined the V region gene sequences of these antibodies in an attempt to correlate epitope recognition and Id expression with V region sequence. All of these preparations recognize epitopes that cluster around the HIV gp120 binding site on the human CD4 molecule. However, we observed differences in epitope recognition among the anti-CD4 preparations, based on either competitive inhibition assays or functional assays, such as syncytium inhibition. Analysis of Id specificities using a polyclonal anti-Id generated against anti-Leu 3a indicated that five of the seven monoclonal anti-CD4 expressed a shared Id. Based on V region gene sequences, the V region kappa-chain (V[kappa]) from each of the seven antibodies was encoded by the V[kappa]21 gene family and expressed the J[kappa]4 gene segment. Those preparations that expressed the shared Id with anti-Leu 3a have virtually identical V[kappa] sequences, with a high degree of homology in the CDR. The VH region gene sequences of six of the seven antibodies also shared overall homology and appeared to be encoded by the J558 VH gene family. The seventh anti-CD4 VH region is encoded for by the VHGAM gene family. The majority of these antibodies used JH3 gene segment, although the JH2 and JH4 gene segments were also represented. In addition, several of these antibodies share a common sequence organization within their V-D-J joining regions that appears to involve N and P sequences to generate unique D segments. Together, these data suggest that differences in epitope recognition among the monoclonal anti-CD4 may reflect sequence variability primarily within the CDR3 region of both V[kappa] and VH. The basis for the detection of a shared Id most likely reflects the high degree of homology within the V[kappa] region sequences. In addition, these data, which are based on a limited analysis, suggest the possible restricted use of V region germ-line gene families in the secondary antibody response of BALB/c mice to specific epitopes on the human CD4 molecule.
