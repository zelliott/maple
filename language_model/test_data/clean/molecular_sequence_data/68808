Zymobacter palmae gen. nov., sp. nov. was proposed for a new ethanol-fermenting bacterium that was isolated from palm sap in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. The bacterium is gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, catalase-positive, oxidase-negative, nonsporeforming and peritrichously flagellated. It requires nicotinic acid for growth. It ferments hexoses, alpha-linked di- and tri-saccharides, and sugar alcohols (fructose, galactose, glucose, mannose, maltose, melibiose, saccharose, raffinose, mannitol and sorbitol). Fifteen percent of maltose in broth medium is effectively fermented, whereas glucose with a concentration higher than 10% delayed growth initiation and decreased growth rates. Maltose is fermented to produce ethanol and CO2 with a trace amount of acids. Approximately 2 mol of ethanol are produced from 1 mol moiety of hexose of maltose. The organism possesses ubiquinone-9. The G + C content of the DNA is 55.8 +/- 0.4 mol%. Major cellular fatty acids were palmitic and oleic acids and cyclopropanic acid of C19:0. Characteristic hydroxylated acid was 3-hydroxy dodecanoic acid. The bacterium is distinct from other ethanol-fermenting bacteria belonging to the genera Zymomonas Kluyver and van Niel 1936 and Saccharobacter Yaping et al. 1990 with respect to chemotaxonomic and other phenotypic characters to warrant to compose a new genus and a new species. The type strain is strain T109 (= IAM 14233).
