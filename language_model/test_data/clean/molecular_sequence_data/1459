DNA 1 components are satellite-like, single-stranded DNA molecules associated with begomoviruses (family Geminiviridae) that require the satellite molecule DNA beta to induce authentic disease symptoms in some hosts. They have been shown to be present in the begomovirus-DNA beta complexes causing cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD) and okra leaf curl disease (OLCD) in Pakistan as well as Ageratum yellow vein disease (AYVD) in Singapore. We have cloned and sequenced a further 17 DNA 1 molecules from a diverse range of plant species and geographical origins. The analysis shows that DNA 1 components are associated with the majority of begomovirus-DNA beta complexes, being absent from only two of the complexes examined, both of which have their origins in Far East Asia. The sequences showed a high level of conservation as well as a common organization consisting of a single open reading frame (ORF) in the virion sense, a region of sequence rich in adenine and a predicted hairpin structure. In phylogenetic analyses, there was some evidence of grouping of DNA 1 molecules according to geographic origin, but less evidence for grouping according to host plant origin. The possible origin and function of DNA 1 components are discussed in light of these findings.
