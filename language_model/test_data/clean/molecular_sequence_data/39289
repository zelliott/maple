A Gram-negative, aerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming and rod-shaped bacterium, strain Gsoil 043(T), was isolated from soil from a ginseng field in Pocheon province, South Korea. The novel isolate was characterized in order to determine its taxonomic position. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain Gsoil 043(T) was shown to belong to the family 'Flexibacteraceae' and was related to Dyadobacter fermentans (96.7 %), Dyadobacter crusticola (96.3 %) and Dyadobacter hamtensis (95.8 %). The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of the novel strain to other recognized species within the family 'Flexibacteraceae' was less than 87.0 %. The G+C content of genomic DNA was 48 mol%. Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic data (major menaquinone, MK-7; major fatty acids, C(16 : 1)omega7c, iso-C(15 : 0) and C(16 : 0)) supported the affiliation of strain Gsoil 043(T) to the genus Dyadobacter. The results of physiological and biochemical tests enabled strain Gsoil 043(T) to be differentiated genotypically and phenotypically from the three Dyadobacter species with validly published names. The novel isolate therefore represents a novel species for which the name Dyadobacter ginsengisoli sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain Gsoil 043(T) (=KCTC 12589(T)=LMG 23409(T)).
