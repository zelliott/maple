Leaf blight-resistant sorghum accession SC326-6 was crossed to the susceptible cultivar BTx623 to analyze the genetic basis for resistance. Field scoring of inoculated F2 progeny revealed that resistance was transmitted as a dominant single-gene trait. By combining the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique with bulked-segregant analysis, it was possible to identify PCR amplification products that segregated with disease response. Primer OPD12 amplified a 323-bp band (D12R) that segregated with resistance. Creation of longer primers, or SCARs (sequence characterized amplified regions) for D12R resulted in the amplification of a single major band of the predicted size from all the resistant F2 progeny and the resistant parent SC326-6, but not from BTx623 or 24 of 29 susceptible F2 progeny. The SCAR primers also amplified a single band with DNA from IS3620C, the female parent in a cross with BTx623 that has been used to produce a recombinant inbred population for RFLP mapping. An equivalent band was amplified from all 137 recombinant inbred progeny, indicating that organelle DNA is the amplification target in this cross.
