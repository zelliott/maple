A new water channel (aquaporin-8, gene symbol AQP8) was isolated from rat pancreas and liver by homology cloning. Ribonuclease protection assay showed intense expression of the gene in pancreas and liver, less intense in colon and salivary gland, and negligible in other organs. The full-length cDNA was obtained by ligation of approximately 1.4-kilobase (kb) cDNA isolated from the rat liver cDNA library to approximately 0.5 kb of the 5'-end fragment obtained by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends method. A major transcript of approximately 1.45 kb was demonstrated in liver and colon by Northern blot analysis. Expression of the cRNA in Xenopus oocytes markedly enhanced osmotic water permeability in a mercury-sensitive manner, indicating a water channel function of this molecule. The open reading frame encoded a 263-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular size of 28 kDa. Hydropathy analysis represented six membrane-spanning domains and five connecting loops containing two sites of NPA motif as preserved in other aquaporins. Unlike other mammalian aquaporins, AQP8 has an unusual structure with a long N terminus and a short C terminus, which are found in plant aquaporin, gamma-tonoplast intrinsic protein. By in situ hybridization, AQP8 mRNA expression was assumed in hepatocytes, acinal cells of pancreas and salivary gland, and absorptive colonic epithelial cells. The physiological role(s) of AQP8 remain to be elucidated.
