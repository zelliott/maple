The Kell blood group system consists of at least 21 antigens, which may be classified into five sets of alleles and at least 10 independently expressed antigens. The molecular basis of four of the five sets of alleles has been described; point mutations in KEL leading to amino acid substitutions characterize the alleles. In this study, the point mutation associated with the remaining allele, KEL14/KEL24, was determined.

The 19 exons of KEL were amplified from genomic DNA by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure. The PCR products were sequenced. DNA sequences from unrelated KEL:14,24 and KEL:-14,24 individuals were compared to the DNA sequence of the common KEL:14,-24 phenotype.

DNA from the KEL:14,24 person yielded both G and C at nt 659, indicating an Arg and Pro polymorphism in amino acid residue 180 of Kell protein. DNA from the KEL:-14,24 person had a G659C mutation in exon 6, indicating an Arg180Pro substitution. The G659C change introduces an Hae III restriction enzyme site, which was used to confirm the base mutations by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the PCR products.

A G659C mutation, predicting an Arg180Pro change in Kell protein, is associated with the KEL14/KEL24 allele.
