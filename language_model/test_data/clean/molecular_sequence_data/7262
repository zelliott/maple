We have used the Aspergillus niger (An) aphA gene as a probe and cloned the A. ficuum (Af) SRRC 265 gene encoding an extracellular pH 6.0-optimum acid phosphatase (APase6) from a genomic library. The identity of the Af aphA gene was confirmed and its nucleotide (nt) sequence verified by comparing its deduced amino acid (aa) sequence to that of purified Af APase6. A comparison of the nt sequences of the An and Af genes suggested that errors were made in the previously reported An aphA sequence. Several regions of the An aphA were resequenced and the mistakes corrected. With its nt sequence corrected, the An aphA is nearly identical to the cloned Af gene encoding APase6, and in 90.4% agreement in the coding regions. Both genes have three conserved introns and when translated, both nt sequences code for a polypeptide of 614 aa. There is now evidence that the two cloned genes are homologous and code for acid phosphatases that are 96% identical.
