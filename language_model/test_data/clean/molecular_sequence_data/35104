Mamestra brassicae nucleopolyhedrovirus-K1 (MabrNPV-K1) was isolated from naturally infected M. brassicae (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae in Korea. The full genome sequences of MabrNPV-K1 were determined, analysed and compared to those of other baculoviruses. The MabrNPV-K1 genome consisted of 152,710 bp and had an overall G + C content of 39.9%. Computer-assisted analysis predicted 158 open reading frames (ORFs) of 150 nucleotides or greater that showed minimal overlap. Two inhibitor of apoptosis (iap) and six baculovirus repeated ORFs were interspersed in the MabrNPV-K1 genome. The unique MabrNPV-K1 ORF133 was identified in the MabrNPV-K1 genome that was not previously reported in baculoviruses. The gene content and arrangement in MabrNPV-K1 had the highest similarity with those of Helicoverpa armigera MNPV (HearMNPV) and Mamestra configurata NPV-B (MacoNPV-B), and their shared homologous genes were 99% collinear. The MabrNPV-K1 genome contained four homologous repeat regions (hr1, hr2, hr3 and hr4) that accounted for 3.3% of the genome. The genomic positions of the four MabrNPV-K1 hr regions were conserved among those of HearMNPV and MacoNPV-B. The gene parity plot, percent identity of the gene homologues and a phylogenetic analysis suggested that these three viruses are closely related not only to each other but also to the same virus strains rather than different virus species.
