We cloned and sequenced the 8767-bp full-length cDNA for the chicken cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), of interest because, unlike its mammalian homologs, it does not bind insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II). The cDNA encodes a protein of 2470 aa that includes a putative signal sequence, an extracytoplasmic domain consisting of 15 homologous repeat sequences, a 23-residue transmembrane sequence, and a 161-residue cytoplasmic sequence. Overall, it shows 60% sequence identity with human and bovine CI-MPR homologs, and all but two of 122 cysteine residues are conserved. However, it shows much less homology in the N-terminal signal sequence, in repeat 11, which is proposed to contain the IGF-II-binding site in mammalian CI-MPR homologs, and in the 14-aa residue segment in the cytoplasmic sequence that has been proposed to mediate G-protein-coupled signal transduction in response to IGF-II binding by the human CI-MPR. Transient expression in COS-7 cells produced a functional CI-MPR which exhibited mannose-6-phosphate-inhibitable binding and mediated endocytosis of recombinant human beta-glucuronidase. Expression of the functional chicken CI-MPR in mice lacking the mammalian CI-MPR should clarify the controversy over the physiological role of the IGF-II-binding site in mammalian CI-MPR homologs.
