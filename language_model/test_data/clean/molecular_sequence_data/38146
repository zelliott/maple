The deficiency of porin isoform 1 (HVDAC1) in human skeletal muscle has been associated with a pathological phenotype related to defects in the bioenergetic metabolism. In the best studied case, porin deficiency was not apparent in cultured fibroblasts: this observation raised the conclusion that no molecular defect was in the cDNA sequence coding for the protein. To get more insight in the pathogenetic mechanism that is involved in porin isoform 1 deficiency, we have determined the whole structure of the corresponding human gene. On the basis of the corresponding mouse gene structure and the human cDNA sequence, we designed long extension PCR amplifications using the whole genomic DNA as a template. Exonic/intronic regions were isolated and the exons and surrounding introns sequenced. The 5' and 3' extremities of the gene were determined by genome walking. The porin isoform 1 human gene is made up of 9 exons and spans about 33 kbp. A whole panel of PCR parameters was set and is now ready to be used for specific amplification upon patients' genomic DNA. The analysis of the putative promoter sequence was performed. It revealed the presence of a sterol Repressor element (SRE), an SRY, the testis-determining factor, and a nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF-2) binding site. These sites, according to results from literature, could be involved in the functional modulation of the gene expression.
