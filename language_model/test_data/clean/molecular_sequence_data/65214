1,3-Propanediol oxidoreductase encoded by dhaT gene, a gene of 1,3-propanediol regulon, is important in converting glycerol to 1,3-propanediol in Klebsiella pneumoniae. DhaT gene was amplified from the genome of K. pneumoniae, sequenced and its amino acid sequence deduced. A predicted secondary structure and 3D-structural model was constructed by homology modelling. Based on these results, we infer that 1,3-propanediol oxidoreductase belongs to NAD(P)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase group III of iron-activated dehydrogenases.
