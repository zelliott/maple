The functional recovery from impaired motor activity induced by 6-hydroxydopamine lesions in rat nucleus accumbens was accelerated by subcutaneous treatment with the ACTH-(4-9) analogue Met/O2/-Glu-His-Phe-D-Lys-Phe (ORG 2766). Treatment was effective after daily injections of ORG 2766 dissolved in saline during the first 6 days following the lesion (ED50: 28.5 ng kg-1 day-1) or after a single injection of the peptide in a biodegradable microsphere formulation administered after the lesion (ED50: 8.9 ng kg-1 day-1). This study shows that a single injection of a microsphere preparation can replace multiple injections with ORG 2766 in order to facilitate functional recovery after brain damage.
