The full length cDNA sequence for neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) gene from red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) has been cloned, subjected to bioinformatic analysis, and examined for expression in different tissues. Red drum nNOS showed high identity to nNOS of mammals and other fish species. Notably, a unique 7-aa insertion was found in the important catalytic sites of the NO synthase domain, possibly affecting the function of red drum nNOS. Furthermore, this nNOS was expressed not only in brain but also in most of the internal organs including liver, intestine, spleen, head kidney and thymus.
