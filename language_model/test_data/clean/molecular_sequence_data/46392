This chapter contains brief notes on molecular genetics, focusing on those aspects most frequently encountered in genetic epidemiology. The main sections cover the organisation and physical structure of genetic material, the mechanisms involved in transmitting genetic material from one generation to the next, and forms of genetic variation.
