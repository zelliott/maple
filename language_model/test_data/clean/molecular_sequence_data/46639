The rapid identification of suspect rabies infection is essential in human cases, to ensure appropriate post-exposure treatment of contacts, and in animal cases to allow specific control strategies to be decided and implemented. We describe here the use of high speed air thermo-cycler PCR as a diagnostic tool for the detection of rabies and rabies-related viruses. Using this technique we were able to diagnose rabies in a human within 5 h. Furthermore, the application of automated sequencing of the resultant product enabled a definitive characterisation of classical rabies within 16 h. The utility of this assay was confirmed further by the successful detection of representatives of the six lyssavirus genotypes.
