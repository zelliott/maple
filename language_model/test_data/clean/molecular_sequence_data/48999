Telithromycin (HMR 3647) is the first ketolide introduced into clinical practice. Ketolides are semisynthetic derivates of erythromycin A that carry novel biological properties on the erythronolide A ring. This new class of antimicrobials was designed to overcome current resistance mechanisms against erythromycin A within Gram-positive cocci. Ketolides do not induce macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS(B)) resistance and are active against erythromycin resistance methylase gene (erm)-carrying Gram-positive cocci. This review summarizes published data on telithromycin and intends to define the challenge that a new antimicrobial brings to medical practice.
