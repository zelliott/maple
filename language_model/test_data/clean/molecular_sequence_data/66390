We found that zaprinast, a well-known cyclic guanosine monophosphate-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, acted as an agonist for a G protein-coupled receptor, GPR35. In our intracellular calcium mobilization assay, zaprinast activated rat GPR35 strongly (geometric mean EC(50) value of 16nM), whereas it activated human GPR35 moderately (geometric mean EC(50) value of 840nM). We also demonstrated that GPR35 acted as a Galpha(i/o)- and Galpha(16)-coupled receptor for zaprinast when heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells. These findings will facilitate the research on GPR35 and the drug discovery of the GPR35 modulators.
