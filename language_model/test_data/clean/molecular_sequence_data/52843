A novel cDNA clone encoding a protein structurally related to the transcriptional repressor Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which regulate homeotic genes and others, was isolated from mouse and rat brain. The coding protein contained the SPM domain and mbt repeats, both of which are characteristic of the PcG proteins, and showed significant similarity in amino acid sequence to the Drosophila Sex comb on midleg (Scm) protein. Since this novel protein contains the mbt repeats in four tandem copies, we designated this murine gene as Sfmbt for Scm-related gene containing four mbt domains. Cloning and characterization of the mouse Sfmbt gene revealed that the coding sequence comprised 20 exons, dispersed along approximately 40kb, and mapped to the proximal part of Chromosome 14. Northern blot analysis showed that the Sfmbt mRNAs were expressed most abundantly in the adult testis, and less intensively in all other tissues examined.
