Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is known to elicit various developmental-like effects on astrocytes in vitro, but these effects were studied mainly over short-term periods. In this work we asked the question whether bFGF could induce long-term effects on rat astrocytes in culture. This factor was found to induce only a transient mitogenic effect lasting less than 48 h, even when the treatment was carried on for 4 days. By contrast, it induced long-term effects on the rate of synthesis of several proteins as seen by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after labeling the cells with [35S]methionine. The most upregulated protein was extracted from preparative gels of soluble extracts of cultured bFGF-treated astrocytes and of normal brain. It was characterized by internal amino acid microsequencing. Two tryptic digest peptides had N-terminal sequences similar to rat lens aldose reductase. This protein was also expressed in oligodendroglial and neuronal cells in culture, but it was not upregulated by bFGF. Aldose reductase is thought to be involved in a minor pathway of glucose metabolism and in diabetic complications. Its long-term regulation by bFGF will possibly help in the understanding of its actual physiological role.
