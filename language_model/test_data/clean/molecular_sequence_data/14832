Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) binding to the TGF-β type I (TGFBR1) and type II (TGFBR2) receptors delivers a plethora of cell-type specific effects. Moreover, the responses to TGF-β are tuned by regulatory mechanisms at the receptor level itself. To further elucidate TGF-β family signal transduction in teleosts, we therefore cloned the first complete set of a putative TGF-β receptor complex in salmonids. Rainbow trout TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 are transmembrane proteins with a serine/threonine kinase domain and are highly conserved within vertebrates. High expression levels in muscle and brain indicate regulation of the TGF-β system in muscular and nervous systems. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced expression of both receptor chains in RTgill cells while bacterial and viral mimics modulated the two receptors inversely in head kidney (HK) macrophages. In addition, T cell mitogens lowered receptor levels in HK leukocytes. These data provide the first insights into TGF-β type I and II receptor modulation during immune responses in teleost fish.
