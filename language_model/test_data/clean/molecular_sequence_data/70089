Biochemical and pharmacological properties of KRI-1314, a newly synthesized, low molecular weight (M.W.: 690) renin inhibitor, were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The novel amino acid norstatine, which is shorter in chain length than the well-known statine, was incorporated into KRI-1314 as a tetrahedral transition-state analogue for the Leu10-Val11 scissile peptide in the renin substrate. KRI-1314 more strongly inhibited plasma renins from primates than those from dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs and rats. KRI-1314 competitively inhibited highly-purified human renin with a Ki value of 9.9 x 10(-10) M. KRI-1314 strongly inhibited the tissue renin-like activities of various organs from Japanese monkeys, with IC50 values on the order of 10(-8) M. KRI-1314 was also very stable in various tissue homogenates from Japanese monkeys. Both intravenous (from 0.25 to 3 mg/kg) and oral (10 and 30 mg/kg) administration of KRI-1314 to anesthetized and conscious sodium-depleted Japanese monkeys, respectively, significantly lowered the blood pressure and plasma renin activity without affecting the heart rate. In Japanese monkeys, KRI-1314 was continuously detected in the plasma up to at least 7 hr after oral administration of 10 and 30 mg/kg. These results demonstrate that KRI-1314 is a highly potent, primate-selective and long-lasting oral renin inhibitor with a blood pressure lowering effect.
