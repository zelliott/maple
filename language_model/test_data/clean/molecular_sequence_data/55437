The A-to-V mutation at position 111 (A111V) in the mechanosensitive channel NCgl1221 (MscCG) causes constitutive glutamate secretion in Corynebacterium glutamicum. Patch clamp experiments revealed that NCgl1221 (A111V) had a significantly smaller gating threshold than the wild-type counterpart and displayed strong hysteresis, suggesting that the gain-of-function mutation in the gating of NCgl1221 leads to the oversecretion of glutamate.
