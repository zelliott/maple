Burkholderia is an important bacterial genus with a complex taxonomy that contains species of both ecological and pathogenic importance, including nine closely related species collectively termed the Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC). Unfortunately, 16S rRNA gene analysis has proven to be not sensitive enough to discriminate between species of the BCC. Alternative species identification strategies such as recA-based PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, although initially useful, have proven to be inaccurate with the increasing species diversity of the BCC. recA gene sequence analysis is more discriminatory and corroborates other biochemical and polyphasic means of taxonomic differentiation. However, it is limited by the fact that certain BCC species are subdivided into discrete recA sequence subgroups that may confuse clinical diagnoses. In this study, an effective approach is described for the rapid differentiation of BCC species from both environmental and clinical sources by means of a single-locus sequencing and PCR assay using fur as a target gene that provides sequence phylogenies that are species specific and, with few exceptions, not divided into subspecies clusters. This assay is specific and can be used to correctly determine the species status of BCC strains tested following sequencing and amplification of the fur gene by both general and species-specific primers. Based on our results, this typing strategy is simpler than and as sensitive as established tests currently in use clinically. This assay is useful for the rapid, definitive identification of all nine current BCC species and potentially novel species groups.
