Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) leader RNA and a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide of the same sequence were found to inhibit the replication of adenovirus DNA in vitro. In contrast, the small RNA transcribed by the VSV defective interfering particle DI-011 did not prevent adenovirus DNA replication. The inhibition produced by leader RNA was at the level of preterminal protein (pTP)-dCMP complex formation, the initiation step of adenovirus DNA replication. Initiation requires the adenovirus pTP-adenovirus DNA polymerase complex (pTP-Adpol), the adenovirus DNA-binding protein, and nuclear factor I. Specific replication in the presence of leader RNA was restored when the concentration of adenovirus-infected or uninfected nuclear extract was increased or by the addition of purified pTP-Adpol or HeLa cell DNA polymerase alpha-primase to inhibited replication reactions. Furthermore, the activities of both purified DNA polymerases could be inhibited by the leader sequence. These results suggest that VSV leader RNA is the viral agent responsible for inhibition of adenovirus and possibly cellular DNA replication during VSV infection.
