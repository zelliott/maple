An insertion/deletion polymorphism between exons 7 and 8 of the pepsinogen C gene (PGC), previously detectable with Southern analysis, was formatted for detection with PCR. Alleles were rapidly typed by UV irradiation of ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. Whereas Southern analysis revealed two alleles, the smaller fragments generated with PCR allowed the resolution of three alleles that were previously scored as a single allele and increased the heterozygosity of the system from 0.20 to 0.53. After a set of reference families was genotyped with the PCR-based polymorphism, a linkage map around the PGC gene on chromosome 6 was constructed. This included the HLA cluster and the highly informative D6S223 locus. PGC lies 22 cM proximal to HLA-DPB and between D6S5 and D6S4 at distances of 4.5 and 13.1 cM, respectively.
