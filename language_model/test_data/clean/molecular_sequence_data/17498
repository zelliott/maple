A rat gene closely related to a human heat-inducible/cell cycle-dependent hsx70 gene was cloned from a rat genomic library. Northern blot analysis showed that it encodes a 2.5 kb transcript, one of the two heat-inducible mRNAs (2.5 and 2.7 kb) detected in rat tissues. Comparison of the known expression pattern of rat major heat shock proteins and mRNAs suggests that the isolated rat gene most probably codes for HSP71 protein.
