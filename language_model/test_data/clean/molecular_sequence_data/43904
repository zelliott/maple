By using radiolabeled murine cyclin D3 cDNA as a probe, two cyclin D3 genomic clones, MCD3P-117 and MCD3P-327, were isolated from a murine genomic library constructed with murine liver DNA. Physical mapping and DNA sequence analysis revealed that these clones contain approximately 1.5 kb uninterrupted linear sequence similar to murine cyclin D3 cDNA, indicating that the 1.5 kb sequence is a processed pseudogene for cyclin D3. When the nucleotide sequence of the cyclin D3 pseudogene was compared with that of cyclin D3 cDNA at the nucleotide level, the pseudogene contained 229 bp of 5'- and 371 bp of 3'-untranslated regions, and a recognizable complete coding region that is 90% identical to murine cyclin D3. This sequence is bounded by the repeat sequence (GC/AGCTCTCC), which is common to many processed pseudogenes. However, multiple genetic lesions, including substitution, deletion and/or insertion events that result in modification of the reading frame were found in the pseudogene sequence. The pseudogene appeared to accumulate 67 random point mutations in the functional coding region composed of 879 nucleotide positions. It is thus estimated that the cyclin D3 pseudogene arose approximately 11 million years (Myr) ago. These data provide the first characterization of murine cyclin D3 pseudogene and insight into its evolutionary age.
