Galectins are a family of soluble beta-galactoside-binding lectins distributed in both vertebrates and invertebrates and, more recently, found also in fungus. The 32-kDa galectin isolated from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Hirabayashi, J., Satoh, M., and Kasai, K. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 15485-15490) was the first "tandem repeat-type" galectin, containing two homologous carbohydrate-binding sites. Here, we report the structure of the nematode 32-kDa galectin gene. Physical mapping by yeast artificial chromosome polytene filter hybridization revealed that the 32-kDa galectin gene is located on chromosome II. Analysis of the transcript (1.4 kilobases) showed the presence at its 5'-end of a 22-nucleotide trans-spliced leader sequence (SL1). The entire genomic structure spanning >5 kilobase pairs (kbp), including the 5'-noncoding region, two intervening sequences (introns 1 and 2), and the 3'-noncoding region, was completely determined by the combination of genomic polymerase chain reaction and conventional colony hybridization. Intron 1 was relatively long (2.4 kbp) and was found to be inserted after the ninth codon (TAC) from the initiation codon. This position proved to be almost homologous to the conserved first intron insertion position in the vertebrate galectin genes (i. e. genes of mammalian galectin-1, -2, and -3 and chick 14-kDa galectin). On the other hand, intron 2 was much shorter (0.6 kbp), and it was inserted into the central region of the second carbohydrate-binding site. Although such an insertion pattern has never been observed in the vertebrate galectin genes, it seems to be common in C. elegans tandem repeat-type galectin genes, as predicted by the C. elegans genome project (Coulson, A., and the C. elegans Genome Consortium (1996) Biochem. Soc. Trans. 24, 289-291). Based on extensive sequence comparison, the origin and molecular evolution of the tandem repeat-type galectins are discussed.
