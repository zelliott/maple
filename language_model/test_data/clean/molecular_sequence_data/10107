Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS), caused by del(17)p11.2, represents one of the most frequently observed human microdeletion syndromes. We have identified three copies of a low-copy-number repeat (SMS-REPs) located within and flanking the SMS common deletion region and show that SMS-REP represents a repeated gene cluster. We have isolated a corresponding cDNA clone that identifies a novel junction fragment from 29 unrelated SMS patients and a different-sized junction fragment from a patient with dup(17)p11.2. Our results suggest that homologous recombination of a flanking repeat gene cluster is a mechanism for this common microdeletion syndrome.
