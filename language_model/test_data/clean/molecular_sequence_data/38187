We have investigated the expression and regulation of the mRNAs for the type I BMP receptors, BMPR-IA and BMPR-IB, in quail embryos in vivo and in neural crest cultures in vitro. BMPR-IB mRNA was expressed in the primordial sympathetic ganglia at stage 17, soon after the first expression of Cash-1 mRNA, the avian homolog of the Drosophila transcription factor achaete-scute. BMP-4 mRNA was detected in the dorsal aorta at stage 17, coincident with BMPR-IB mRNA expression in the sympathetic ganglia. BMPR-IA mRNA was first expressed in the sympathetic ganglia at stage 18. Moreover, BMP-4 ligand mRNA was detected in the sympathetic ganglia starting at stage 18. BMPR-IA and BMPR-IB were differentially regulated in cultured neural crest cells. BMPR-IB was expressed in primary outgrowths of neural crest cells but was downregulated after primary outgrowths were harvested and replated in secondary cultures. In secondary cultures of neural crest cells, exogenous BMP-2 and BMP-4 increased the expression of BMPR-IA but decreased the expression of BMPR-IB. The expression of both type I BMP receptors was inhibited by exogenous TGF-beta1. Our results suggest distinct roles for BMPR-IA and BMPR-IB in the development of the sympathoadrenal phenotype from cells of the neural crest.
