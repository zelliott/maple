We report in this paper the sequence of a part of chromosome XI of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This 17 kbp nucleotide sequence represents the right half of cosmid pUKG151 and contains nine open reading frames, YKL453, 450, 449, 448, 445, 443, 442, 441 and the 5' part of YKL440. YKL440 was previously identified as the MBR1 gene and plays a role in mitochondrial biogenesis. YKL443 is a homologue of the yeast serine-rich protein (SRP1), while YKL453 presents strong homologies with the KIN1/KIN2/SNF1 kinase family. It must be pointed out that the size of this gene is well above average for yeast.
