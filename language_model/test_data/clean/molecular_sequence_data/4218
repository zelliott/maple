Amphiphilic alpha-helices play a major role in membrane dependent processes and are manifested in the primary structure of a protein by the periodic appearance of hydrophobic residues. Based on these periodic sequences, the hydrophobic moment was introduced, <microH>, which essentially treats the hydrophobicity of amino acid residues as a two-dimensional vector sum and provides a measure of amphiphilicity within regular repeat structures. To identify putative amphiphilic alpha-helix forming sequences, hydrophobic moment analysis assumes an amino acid residue periodicity of 100 and scans protein primary structures to find the 11-residue window with maximal <microH>. Taken with the window's mean hydrophobicity, <H0>, hydrophobic moment plot analysis uses the coordinate pair, [<microH>, <H0>] to classify alpha-helices as either surface active, globular or transmembrane. More recently, this latter analysis has been extended to recognize candidate oblique orientated alpha-helices. Here, the hydrophobic moment is reviewed and data to query the logic of using a fixed window length and a fixed residue angular periodicity in hydrophobic moment analysis are provided. In addition, problems associated with the use of such analysis to predict alpha-helix structure/function relationships are considered.
