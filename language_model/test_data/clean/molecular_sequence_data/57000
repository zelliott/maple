Available genetic information places the mouse db gene approximately 5 cM distal to Ifa on mid/distal mouse chromosome 4. These data have indicated that there is a relevant paucity of genetic markers that map to this region of chromosome 4. To increase the density of the genetic map on mid-chromosome 4, we have applied the techniques of microdissection and microcloning of the mid-portion of mouse chromosome 4. A total of 47 RFLPs from the microdissection library were used to type the progeny of three C57BL/6J Mus spretus backcrosses. The resulting composite genetic map positions seven known genes, 41 microclones, and three other anonymous markers to a region of approximately 21 cM on mid-chromosome 4 extending from b to Lck. The density of markers in this region of chromosome 4 should be sufficient to initiate the physical mapping of this subchromosomal segment, facilitating efforts to clone the db gene, as well as other uncloned mutant loci in this region of chromosome 4.
