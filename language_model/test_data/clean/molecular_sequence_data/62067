The global regulator, GacS (global activator for antibiotics and cyanide sensor kinase), of the rhizosphere bacterium Pseudomonas chlororaphis O6 (Pc O6) was required for increased resistance to hydrogen peroxide as cultures mature. Specific bands of peroxidase and catalase activity were absent in the stationary-phase cells of the Pc O6 gacS mutant, whereas a manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) isozyme was expressed earlier and to a greater extent than in the wild-type. In the wild-type cell, transcript accumulation of rpoS was higher in late logarithmic (log)-phase cells than cells from mid log-phase or stationary-phase. Transcript abundance from rpoS was reduced in the gacS mutant throughout the growth phase compared to the wild-type expression. The sequence of a small RNA, rsmZ, found downstream of rpoS in other pseudomonads was lacking in Pc O6. This RNA is implicated in the control of genes activated by the GacS system. Thus, the mechanism by which GacS mediates the activation of genes under its control requires further investigation in Pc O6.
