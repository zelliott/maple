Novel homologous DsbA-like disulfide bond formation (Dsb) proteins of Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Ehrlichia canis were identified which restored DsbA activity in complemented Escherichia coli dsbA mutants. Recombinant Ehrlichia Dsb (eDsb) proteins were recognized by sera from E. canis-infected dogs but not from E. chaffeensis-infected patients. The eDsb proteins were observed primarily in the periplasm of E. chaffeensis and E. canis.
