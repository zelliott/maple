Seven strains of canine parvovirus (CPV) were isolated from affected dogs in Japan between 1999 and 2000, and their VP2 genes were genetically analyzed. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of VP2 suggested that three field isolates corresponded to CPV type 2a, while the other four to CPV type 2b. The phylogenetic tree constructed from the VP2 genes showed that the newly isolated strains are classified into the cluster consisting of recent Japanese and Taiwanese field isolates, which are distinct from Vietnamese isolates, United States Isolates, or classical CPV type 2. These results suggest that the CPV transmission occurred between Japan and Taiwan in 1990s, and the offspring are still circulating in both countries.
