Markers for evaluating the establishment of cyanobacteria based on their sensitivity or resistance to antibiotics, saccharide utilization patterns and PCR generated fingerprints were developed. Four selected strains (isolates from rhizosphere soils of diverse agro-ecosystems) have shown potential as diazotrophs and exhibited plant growth promoting abilities. Different responses were obtained on screening against 40 antibiotics, which aided in developing selectable antibiotic markers for each strain. Biochemical profiles generated using standardized chromogenic identification system (including saccharide utilization tests) revealed that 53 % of the saccharides tested were not utilized by any strain, while some strains exhibited unique ability for utilization of saccharides such as melibiose, cellobiose, maltose and glucosamine. PCR based amplification profiles developed using a number of primers based on repeat sequences revealed the utility of 3 primers in providing unique fingerprints for the strains.
