We have produced and characterized a panel of seven somatic cell hybrids defining eight potential intervals on human chromosome 18. Using 24 markers that have previously been assigned to this chromosome, we have placed markers into six of these regions. The gene for alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor (PLI) and the anonymous DNA segment locus D18S23 are excluded from this chromosome.
