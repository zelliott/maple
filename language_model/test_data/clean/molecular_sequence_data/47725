To determine which amino acids in TEM-1 beta-lactamase are important for its structure and function, random libraries were previously constructed which systematically randomized the 263 codons of the mature enzyme. A comprehensive screening of these libraries identified several TEM-1 beta-lactamase core positions, including F66 and L76, which are strictly required for wild-type levels of hydrolytic activity. An examination of positions 66 and 76 in the class A beta-lactamase gene family shows that a phenylalanine at position 66 is strongly conserved while position 76 varies considerably among other beta-lactamases. It is possible that position 76 varies in the gene family because beta-lactamase mutants with non-conservative substitutions at position 76 retain partial function. In contrast, position 66 may remain unchanged in the gene family because non-conservative substitutions at this location are detrimental for enzyme structure and function. By determining the beta-lactam resistance levels of the 38 possible mutants at positions 66 and 76 in the TEM-1 enzyme, it was confirmed that position 76 is indeed more tolerant of non-conservative substitutions. An analysis of the Protein Data Bank files for three class A beta-lactamases indicates that volume constraints at position 66 are at least partly responsible for the low tolerance of substitutions at this position.
