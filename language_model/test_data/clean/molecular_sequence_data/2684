The O-specific side-chains of the lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli O86:K2:H2 have been investigated using n.m.r. spectroscopy, methylation analysis, and specific degradations, and shown to be composed of the pentasaccharide repeating-unit (formula; see text) which represents the biological repeating-unit. The blood-group B activity was confirmed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
