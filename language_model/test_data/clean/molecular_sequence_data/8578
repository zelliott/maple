Satellite DNA specific to the oat C genome was sequenced and located on chromosomes of diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid Avena ssp. using in situ hybridization. The sequence was present on all seven C genome chromosome pairs and hybridized to the entire length of each chromosome, with the exception of the terminal segments of some chromosome pairs. Three chromosome pairs belonging to the A genome showed hybridization signals near the telomeres of their long arms. The existence of intergenomic chromosome rearrangements and the deletions of the repeated units are deduced from these observations. The number of rDNA loci (18S-5.8S-26S rDNA) was determined for the tetraploid and hexaploid oat species. Simultaneous in situ hybridization with the satellite and rDNA probes was used to assign the SAT chromosomes of these species to their correct genomes.
