Fusion between the NUP98 and NSD3 genes in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia associated with t(8;11)(p11.2;p15), is reported for the first time. The t(8;11)(p11.2;p15) was identified by classical cytogenetics. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed a split signal with a mix of BAC 118H17 and 290A12, indicating the translocation disrupted NUP98. FISH restriction at 8p11-12 showed a split of BAC 350N15. Molecular investigations into candidate genes in this BAC showed the NUP98 fusion partner at 8p11.2 was the NSD3 gene. To date the NSD3 gene has never been implicated in hematologic malignancies.
