2,3-Di-O-phytanyl-1-O-glucopyranosylglycerol and polar derivatives of its 6'-glucose moiety have been synthesized. The target molecule contains the diphytanyl-sn-glycerol moiety which is alpha-linked to glucose. The key step in its synthesis involves the coupling of phytanyl bromide and isopropylidene threitol. We also demonstrated that the 6'-hydroxyl group of glycolipids can be functionalized without protection of the sugar moiety.
