A carbazole-utilizing bacterium was isolated by enrichment from petroleum-contaminated soil. The isolate, designated Sphingomonas sp. strain XLDN2-5, could utilize carbazole (CA) as the sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. Washed cells of strain XLDN2-5 were shown to be capable of degrading dibenzofuran (DBF) and dibenzothiophene (DBT). Examination of metabolites suggested that XLDN2-5 degraded DBF to 2-hydroxy-6-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-6-oxo-2,4-hexadienic acid and subsequently to salicylic acid through the angular dioxygenation pathway. In contrast to DBF, strain XLDN2-5 could transform DBT through the ring cleavage and sulfoxidation pathways. Sphingomonas sp. strain XLDN2-5 could cometabolically degrade DBF and DBT in the growing system using CA as a substrate. After 40 h of incubation, 90% of DBT was transformed, and CA and DBF were completely removed. These results suggested that strain XLDN2-5 might be useful in the bioremediation of environments contaminated by these compounds.
