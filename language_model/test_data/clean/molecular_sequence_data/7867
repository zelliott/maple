Synovial cell proliferation is one of the pathological bases of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Several cytokines including IL-1 and IL-6 and growth factors have been shown to be involved in the synovial cell proliferation in RA. Thrombin is a multifunctional protease and acts as a mitogen for several cell types through its specific receptor. To assess whether thrombin is involved in overproliferation of rheumatoid synovial cells, we measured the concentration of thrombin-anti-thrombin III (ATIII) complex (TAT) in synovial fluid obtained from patients with RA or osteoarthritis (OA). We also examined the effect of thrombin or thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP) on cell growth of synovial cell clones (SCCs) established from an RA patient. The concentrations of TAT in the synovial fluid from patients with RA were significantly higher than in those with OA. Moreover, both thrombin and TRAP enhanced proliferation of synovial cells in vitro. We also characterized the expression of thrombin receptor mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR. The expression of mRNA for thrombin receptor was up-regulated by thrombin or TRAP stimulation. Thrombin receptor antigen was also detected on both SCCs and synovial tissue from RA patients by immunostaining using a monoclonal antibody against thrombin receptor. These findings indicate that thrombin may act as a mitogen for synovial cells through thrombin receptor and may play some role in synovial overproliferation and remodeling in RA.
