The nucleocapsid (NC) protein of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 plays a key role in viral genomic packaging by specifically recognizing the Psi(Psi) RNA sequence within the HIV-1 genome RNA. Recently, a novel cell-based assay was developed to probe the specific interactions in vivo between the NC and Psi-RNA using E.coli cells (J. Virol. 81: 6151-55, 2007). In order to examine the extendibility of this cell-based assay to RNAs other than Psi-RNA, this study tested the RNA aptamers isolated in vitro using the SELEX method, but whose specific binding ability to NC in a living cellular environment has not been established. The results demonstrate for the first time that each of those aptamer RNAs can bind specifically to NC in a NC zinc finger motif dependent manner within the cell. This confirms that the cell-based assay developed for NC-Psi interaction can be further extended and applied to NC-binding RNAs other than Psi-RNA.
