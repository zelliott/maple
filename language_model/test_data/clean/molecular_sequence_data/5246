Human alpha-lactalbumin has not been described as a glycoprotein, despite the fact that several alpha-lactalbumins of both ruminant and nonruminant species are known to be glycosylated. In all these species the glycosylation site is the 45Asn in the usual triplet 45Asn-Gly/Gln-47Ser. We have found that human alpha-lactalbumin is glycosylated and the glycosylation site has been determined by protein sequencing and mass spectrometry. We report an unusual glycosylation site at 71Asn in the triplet 71Asn-Ile-73Cys, which is conserved in all known alpha-lactalbumins except red-necked wallaby. That a relatively small proportion of the protein is glycosylated (about 1%) may reflect the importance of this region of the protein sequence to the molten globule state of alpha-lactalbumin.
