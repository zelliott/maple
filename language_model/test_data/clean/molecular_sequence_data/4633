Monoclonal antibodies were generated against a synthetic glycoconjugate containing the trisaccharide alpha-Kdo-(2-->8)-alpha-Kdo-(2-->4)-alpha-Kdo (Kdo, 3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octulopyranosonic acid) which represents the genus-specific epitope of the lipopolysaccharide from the obligatory intracellular human pathogen Chlamydia. Antibodies of all immunoglobulin G isotypes were obtained and characterized by enzyme immunobinding and inhibition assays using the immunizing antigen as well as chemically synthesized derivatives of the Kdo trisaccharide. The latter contained (1) one of the three residues in beta- instead of alpha-linkage, (2) a Kdo residue the carboxyl group of which had been reduced to a CH2OH group (Kdo(C1-red)), or (3) changing the linkage of the terminal Kdo from 2-->8 to 2-->4. Only one compound, namely, alpha-Kdo-(2-->8)-alpha-Kdo(C1-red)-(2-->4)-alpha-Kdo exhibited binding to and inhibition of Kdo trisaccharide-specific antibodies, whereas all other compounds were not active. Structural and conformational investigations using NMR spectroscopy at high field on the allyl glycosides of the oligosaccharides 6-12 confirmed the conformational similarities between those structures 4, 5, and 10 which were able to bind to the antibodies investigated.
