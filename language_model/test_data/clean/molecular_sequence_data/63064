Serratia marcescens cells swarm at 30 degrees C but not at 37 degrees C, and the underlying mechanism is not characterized. Our previous studies had shown that a temperature upshift from 30 to 37 degrees C reduced the expression levels of flhDC(Sm) and hag(Sm) in S. marcescens CH-1. Mutation in rssA or rssB, cognate genes that comprise a two-component system, also resulted in precocious swarming phenotypes at 37 degrees C. To further characterize the underlying mechanism, in the present study, we report that expression of flhDC(Sm) and synthesis of flagella are significantly increased in the rssA mutant strain at 37 degrees C. Primer extension analysis for determination of the transcriptional start site(s) of flhDC(Sm) revealed two transcriptional start sites, P1 and P2, in S. marcescens CH-1. Characterization of the phosphorylated RssB (RssB approximately P) binding site by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed direct interaction of RssB approximately P, but not unphosphorylated RssB [RssB(D51E)], with the P2 promoter region. A DNase I footprinting assay using a capillary electrophoresis approach further determined that the RssB approximately P binding site is located between base pair positions -341 and -364 from the translation start codon ATG in the flhDC(Sm) promoter region. The binding site overlaps with the P2 "-35" promoter region. A modified chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was subsequently performed to confirm that RssB-P binds to the flhDC(Sm) promoter region in vivo. In conclusion, our results indicated that activated RssA-RssB signaling directly inhibits flhDC(Sm) promoter activity at 37 degrees C. This inhibitory effect was comparatively alleviated at 30 degrees C. This finding might explain, at least in part, the phenomenon of inhibition of S. marcescens swarming at 37 degrees C.
