While there have been numerous reports concerning the possible role(s) of gangliosides in neuronal development and their efficacy, or lack thereof, as possible therapeutic agents for the treatment of neuronal injury, the molecular mechanisms by which they induce specific cellular effects are not well understood. This review presents evidence for the existence of cell surface molecules able to adhere to the oligosaccharide portion of specific gangliosides and describes methods employed for their study. The identification of such cell surface molecules permits the hypothesis that the binding of the oligosaccharide portion of the ganglioside by its cell surface receptor is responsible for initiating the intracellular reactions that lead to modified cell behavior.
