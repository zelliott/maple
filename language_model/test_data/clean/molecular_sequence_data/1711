Post-source decay (PSD) fragmentation of chemically or enzymatically produced aminoglycans has been evaluated through matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Conversion of native glycans to their respective aminoglycan derivatives improved detection sensitivity of the usual fragments and promoted cross-ring fragmentation of linear oligosaccharides, facilitating linkage recognition. The cross-ring fragmentations for both dextrin and dextran oligosaccharides were not limited to the reducing-end glucose moiety, as they were extended throughout the entire molecule. When the amino group was generated for N-glycans derived from three different glycoproteins, an enhancement of PSD was observed, without a significant extent of cross-ring fragmentation.
