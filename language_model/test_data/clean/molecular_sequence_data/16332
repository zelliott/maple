It was demonstrated that insertion sequence IS5 contains a sequence-directed bent (sharply curved) DNA structure at its terminus, close to one of its 16 bp terminal repeats. The minimal number of copies of IS5 related sequences and the locations of the latter on the Escherichia coli K12 W3110 chromosome were determined. Evidence is presented of the occurrence of IS5 mediated translocation and duplication of a large DNA segment on the E. coli chromosome.
