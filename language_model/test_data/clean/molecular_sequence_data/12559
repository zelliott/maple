The key expression of the simian virus 40 (SV40) major late promoter could be repressed by the human TR4 orphan receptor via the +55 region of the SV40 major late promoter (nucleotide numbers 368-389, 5' -GTTA-AGGTTCGTAGGTCATGGA-3'). Using the coupled in vitro transcribed and translated TR4 orphan receptor with a molecular mass of 67.3 kilodaltons, electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed specific binding with a dissociation constant of 1.09 nM between the TR4 orphan receptor and the SV40 +55 oligonucleotides. In addition, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay demonstrated that this SV40 +55 region can function as a repressor via the TR4 orphan receptor, suppressing the transcriptional activities of both SV40 early and late promoters. Together, our data suggest that the TR4 orphan receptor may play an important role for the suppression of the SV40 gene expression.
