The presence of four different isoforms of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormones (LHRH) and one LHRH receptor (LHRH-R) has been reported in vertebrates. In the human genome only LHRH-I and LHRH-II genes have been identified. The human LHRH-I gene is composed of four exons separated by three introns. Three LHRH receptor or receptor-like genes have been demonstrated. The well-established type-I LHRH receptor (LHRH-R-I) gene is composed of three exons separated by two introns. In this study we investigated the expression of transcript forms of LHRH-R-I in human benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using gene specific primers. Thirty-five human BPH specimens were obtained at surgery. Normal human pituitaries collected at autopsy served as control. RNA extraction and RT-PCR with gene-specific primers for LHRH-R-I forward (F1)/reverse (R1), LHRH-R-I F2/R3, LHRH-R-I F1'/R2' were carried out to determine the mRNA expression for LHRH-R-I transcript forms. The expected PCR products amplified with gene specific primers were LHRH-R-I F1/R1 with 319 bp, LHRH-R-I F2/R3 with 309 bp and LHRH-R-I F1'/R2' with 219 bp. PCR products for LHRH-R-I F1/R1 were detected in 21 (60%) and for LHRH-R-I F2/R3 in 5 of 35 (14%) BPH samples. No PCR products for LHRH-R-I F1'/R2' were found. In conclusion, we detected mRNA for LHRH-R-I in human BPH specimens. Our results suggest that LHRH-R-I gene may have more than two splice variants or uncharacterised transcript forms of LHRH-R-I. Our findings support the merit of further investigation of the expression of LHRH-R-I and its transcript forms in human BPH.
