Far-UV circular dichroism spectra of bovine lung cyclic GMP dependent protein kinase (G-kinase) show that the enzyme contains alpha-helical and beta-pleated sheet elements. Binding of cyclic GMP changes the spectra in a way consistent with the induction of beta-sheet from random coil. Examination of the amino-terminal sequence of G-kinase indicates the presence of a strongly alpha-helical segment with several features in common with the leucine zipper motif. We propose that this sequence may be the important part of the dimerization domain of the enzyme. A synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 1-39 of G-kinase has a strongly alpha-helical CD spectrum, supporting the predicted secondary structure of this amino-terminal sequence. In contrast to the native enzyme, a structure reduced in alpha-helix was found when a constitutively active form of G-kinase, which lacks amino acids 1-77, was studied.
