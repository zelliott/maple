The structure of YaaE from Bacillus subtilis was determined at 2.5-A resolution. YaaE is a member of the triad glutamine aminotransferase family and functions in a recently identified alternate pathway for the biosynthesis of vitamin B(6). Proposed active residues include conserved Cys-79, His-170, and Glu-172. YaaE shows similarity to HisH, a glutaminase involved in histidine biosynthesis. YaaD associates with YaaE. A homology model of this protein was constructed. YaaD is predicted to be a (beta/alpha)(8) barrel on the basis of sequence comparisons. The predicted active site includes highly conserved residues 211-216 and 233-235. Finally, a homology model of a putative YaaD-YaaE complex was prepared using the structure of HisH-F as a model. This model predicts that the ammonia molecule generated by YaaE is channeled through the center of the YaaD barrel to the putative YaaD active site.
