We determined the time-dependent effects of conditional expression of neutrophil inhibitory factor (NIF), a specific 41-kDa CD18 integrin antagonist, on the time course of NIF expression and lung PMN (polymorphonuclear leukocyte) infiltration and vascular injury in a model of Escherichia coli-induced sepsis in mice. Studies were made in mice transduced with the E-selectin (ES) promoter-NIF construct (using liposomes) in which the NIF cDNA was driven by the inflammation- and endothelial cell-specific ES promoter. We observed time-dependent expression of NIF in pulmonary vascular endothelium that paralleled the ES expression. Expression of both was evident at 1 h after E. coli challenge, peaked at 3-6 h, and returned to basal level within 48 h. We observed that increases in PMN uptake and transalveolar PMN migration induced by E. coli challenge were reversed in a time-dependent manner following NIF expression in mice. NIF expression also prevented the progression of lung vascular injury and edema formation following E. coli challenge. Thus the conditional expression of NIF using the ES promoter can reverse, in a time-dependent manner, lung PMN infiltration and vascular injury induced by gram-negative sepsis. The results support the model that initial engagement of CD18 integrins enables the further recruitment of additional PMN into lung tissues such that PMN continue to sequester and migrate after E. coli challenge.
