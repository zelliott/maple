To define the position of a 13q12 breakpoint from a patient with ganglioneuroblastoma, a series of somatic cell hybrids carrying human chromosome translocations with breakpoints in the proximal part of chromosome 13 has been compiled. Sequence-tagged sites (STS) have been generated from a series of Alu-PCR probes previously shown to be in the 13q12 region. Together with an STS for the oncogene FLT1, these have been used to define the relative positions of the translocation breakpoints in the hybrids. In this way, four markers have been ordered in three subregions of 13q12 and reference breakpoints established. The refined physical map of 13q12 provides a series of reference markers with known locations and will be invaluable in the further characterization of breakpoints in this region.
