The mitochondrial outer membrane of eukaryotic cells contains voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC) also termed porins. Three cDNAs from wheat (Triticum aestivum) were isolated and sequenced (Tavdac 1-3). They share 65% similarity of their amino acid sequences, and therefore they probably represent isoforms. The deduced amino acid sequence of one of the cDNAs was found to be identical to the purified VDAC protein from wheat mitochondria [8]. Secondary structure analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of the three vdac cDNAs revealed a characteristic alpha helix at their N-terminal and beta-barrel cylinders characteristic of VDAC channels. The Tavdac cDNAs are differentially expressed in meristematic tissues. The transcript levels of Tavdac 1 in all wheat tissues is at least 2.5-fold higher than Tavdac 2 and Tavdac 3. Tavdac 2 has a low level of expression in all floral tissues whereas Tavdac 3 is highly expressed in anthers. This is the first report on differential expression of vdac genes in plants. The Tavdac genes have been mapped on the wheat genome. Tavdac 1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 5, Tavdac 2 on the long arm of chromosome 1 and Tavdac 3 on the long arm of chromosome 3. A phylogenetic reconstruction indicates that vdac genes underwent numerous duplication events throughout their evolution. All duplications occurred after the separation of plants from animals and fungi, and no orthologous genes are shared among phyla. Within plants, some of the vdac gene duplications probably occurred before the monocotydelon-dicotydelon split.
