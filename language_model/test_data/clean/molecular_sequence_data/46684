In searching for a tumor suppressor gene in the 3p21.3 region, we isolated two genes, RBM5 and RBM6. Sequence analysis indicated that these genes share similarity. RBM5 and-to a lesser extent-RBM6 also have similarity to DXS8237E at Xp11.3-11.23, which maps less than 20 kb upstream of UBE1. A homologue of UBE1, UBE1L, is located at 3p21. 3. FISH analysis showed that the distance between UBE1L and RBM5 in 3p21.3 is about 265 kb. DXS8237E and UBE1 on the X chromosome have the same orientation, whereas on chromosome 3 the orientation of RBM5 and that of RBM6 are opposite to the orientation of UBE1L. Presumably, part of the Xp11.3-11.23 region has duplicated to chromosome 3. Part of this region on chromosome 3 may subsequently have duplicated again within the same chromosomal region. Inversion at some stage of the evolution of the human genome would explain the change in orientation of the genes on chromosome 3 compared with that of the genes on the X chromosome.
