Ricin A-chain, abrin A-chain, and alpha-trichosanthin are members of a larger group of proteins called ribosome-inactivating proteins. These proteins all function to catalytically inactivate eukaryotic 60 S ribosomal subunits leading to rapid shutdown of protein synthesis. They are homologous in sequence and are probably evolutionarily related. We have determined the complete primary amino acid sequence of alpha-trichosanthin and have found it to be homologous, as expected, to that of abrin A-chain and ricin A-chain. A crystal structure for ricin, which includes ricin A-chain and ricin B-chain, has been determined from x-ray diffraction data. Based on the sequence homologies of these proteins, we fit the primary sequences of abrin A-chain and alpha-trichosanthin to the backbone structure for ricin A-chain and have generated energy-minimized molecular models for them. These models should prove useful in studying the structural-functional relationships of these proteins in particular and of the class in general.
