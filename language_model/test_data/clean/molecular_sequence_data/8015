CD44 is a widely expressed, multifunctional, cell-surface glycoprotein that has been implicated in the regulation of normal hematopoiesis. In addition, expression of particular isoforms of CD44 has been associated with malignant transformation and/or the acquisition of metastatic potential. In this study, we used two recently developed monoclonal anti-CD44 antibodies, one reactive with an epitope shared by many CD44 isoforms and the other with an epitope unique to CD44 isoforms containing amino acids encoded by the alternatively spliced exon v10, to compare the expression of CD44 on primitive hematopoietic cells from the marrow of normal individuals and their neoplastic counterparts present in the peripheral blood of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Multiparameter fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis and cell sorting studies showed that CD44 is normally expressed at high to very high levels on both long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) and granulopoietic colony-forming cells (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units [CFU-GM]). In contrast, primitive erythropoietic progenitors (burst-forming units-erythroid [BFU-E]) in normal marrow were more homogeneous in their expression of CD44, and very few (less than 5%) showed the very high levels of CD44 seen on 20% to 25% of LTC-IC and CFU-GM. Antibody staining showed the expression of exon v10-containing CD44 isoforms to be restricted to a small subpopulation (4% to 8%) of morphologically recognizable mature (CD34-) myeloid cells within the light-density fraction of normal marrow cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed the presence of two exon v10-containing mRNA species. In CML, a significantly greater proportion of the circulating neoplastic CFU-GM expressed very high levels of CD44, and these CFU-GM were accompanied by an increased number of light density v10+ cells, including some that coexpressed CD34. Nonmalignant hematopoietic progenitors mobilized by prior chemotherapy and growth factor treatment of patients with Hodgkin's disease or acute myeloid leukemia in remission showed no changes in CD44 expression relative to normal marrow progenitors. These results provide evidence of early differentiation-associated changes in CD44 expression during normal hematopoiesis in vivo that may be deregulated in the neoplastic clone of patients with CML.
