Brucella abortus arginase and ornithine cyclodeaminase genes have been cloned and sequenced. These gene sequences are located in the same operon and occur in the same order as the homologous genes in Agrobacterium tumefaciens Ti C58 plasmid. The nucleotide sequences of the two genes have 72% and 65% identity to the respective Ti plasmid genes. Both genes are present in a single copy, and expression of arginase is regulated in response to arginine.
