To examine the distribution of the Na(+)-translocating NADH-quinone reductase (Na(+)-NQR) among marine bacteria, we developed a simple screening method for the detection of this enzyme. By reference to the homologous sequences of the Na(+)-NQR operons from Vibrio alginolyticus and Haemophilus influenzae, a pair of primers was designed for amplification of a part of the sixth ORF (nqr6) of the Na(+)-NQR operon. When PCR was performed using genomic DNA from 13 marine bacteria, a 0.9-kbp fragment corresponding to nqr6 was amplified in 10 strains. Although there were three PCR-negative strains phylogenetically, based on the sequence of the 16S rRNA, these were placed far from the PCR-positive strains. No product was observed in the case of nonmarine bacteria. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of nqr6 were highly conserved among the PCR-positive marine bacteria. A phylogenetic analysis of marine bacteria, based on nqr6 sequencing, was performed.
