MJ0968 has been proposed to be an ancestor of P-type ATPase, because its primary structure is highly homologous to that of the core catalytic domain of P-type ATPase. However it completely lacks amino acid sequences that possibly constitute transmembrane domains. To examine if MJ0968 is indeed a P-type ATPase, it was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified. It did show ATPase activity, autophosphorylation and inhibition by vanadate. All these properties support the idea that MJ0968 is indeed a soluble P-type ATPase.
