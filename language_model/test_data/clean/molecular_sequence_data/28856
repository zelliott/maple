Comparative sequence analysis of presenilins reveals the conserved transmembrane domain shared with leukocyte antigen CD47, possibly involved in signal transduction. Sensitive techniques of multiple sequence alignment extend the earlier observation of the aminopeptidase homology domain in nicastrin to suggest that this protein may be a catalytically active component of secretasome involved in proteolysis or co-proteolysis of presenilin or beta-amyloid.
