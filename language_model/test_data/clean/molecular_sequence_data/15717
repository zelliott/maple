Here, we describe for the first time the Crc (catabolite repression control) protein from the soil bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi. Expression of A. baylyi crc varied according to the growth conditions. A strain with a disrupted crc gene showed the same growth as the wild type on a number of carbon sources. Carbon catabolite repression by acetate and succinate of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase, the key enzyme of protocatechuate breakdown, was strongly reduced in the crc strain, whereas in the wild-type strain it underwent strong catabolite repression. This strong effect was not based on transcriptional regulation because the transcription pattern of the pca-qui operon (encoding protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase) did not reflect the derepression in the absence of Crc. pca-qui transcript abundance was slightly increased in the crc strain. Lack of Crc dramatically increased the mRNA stability of the pca-qui transcript (up to 14-fold), whereas two other transcripts (pobA and catA) remained unaffected. p-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase activity, encoded by pobA, was not significantly different in the absence of Crc, as protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase was. It is proposed that A. baylyi Crc is involved in the determination of the transcript stability of the pca-qui operon and thereby effects catabolite repression.
