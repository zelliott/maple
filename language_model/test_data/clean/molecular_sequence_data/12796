A gene encoding the wheat transcription factor HBP-1b(c38) and its promoter region have been structurally analyzed. Protein-DNA interaction studies indicated the specific binding of the hexamer motif ACGTCA found in the promoter to the HBP-1b isoforms including HBP-1b(c38), suggesting that transcription of the HBP-1b(c38) gene may be autoregulated.
