The yiaMNO genes of Escherichia coli K-12 encode a binding protein-dependent secondary, or tri-partite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP), transporter. Since only a few members of this family have been functionally characterized to date, we aimed to identify the substrate for this transporter. Cells that constitutively express the yiaK-S gene cluster metabolized the rare pentose L-xylulose, while deletion of the yiaMNO transporter genes reduced L-xylulose metabolism. The periplasmic substrate-binding protein YiaO was found to bind L-xylulose, and stimulated L-xylulose uptake by spheroplasts. These date indicate that the yiaMNO transporter mediates uptake of this rare pentose.
