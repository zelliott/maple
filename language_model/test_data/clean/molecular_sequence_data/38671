We have identified human and mouse cDNAs encoding a novel ubiquitin-specific protease designated USP23. Both cDNAs encode a 62-kDa protein containing the highly conserved His and Cys domains characteristic of the C19 cysteine protease family of ubiquitin-specific processing proteases (UCH-2). Human tissue Northern blots revealed USP23 to be ubiquitously expressed, whereas USP12, its closest human paralogue, displayed a more restricted expression pattern. The human USP23 gene mapped to chromosome 1q22.
