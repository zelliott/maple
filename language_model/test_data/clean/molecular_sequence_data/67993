The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) nef regulatory protein, a protein involved in AIDS pathology, was used as a model to investigate and analyze B- and T-cell epitopes. In this paper, we describe the potential structural basis of antigenic and immunogenic reactivity of synthetic peptides derived from the macromolecular antigen. The relationship between B- and T-cell determinants in the context of regulatory mechanisms involved in immune recognition, while integrating recent data concerning MHC presentation. As a result of the recent progress in the field of peptide recognition and presentation, the potential of the peptide approach for constructing successful synthetic vaccines needs to be continuously re-evaluated.
