We describe a new group (type 3) of the recently proposed species Mycobacterium celatum isolated from eight patients with AIDS in London, England. Sequences of genes coding for 16S rRNA (EMBL accession no. Z46664) showed a divergence of 17 bases from M. celatum type 2 reference isolates and a divergence of 7 bases from M. celatum type 1 reference isolates. A reference strain is available (NCTC 12882).
