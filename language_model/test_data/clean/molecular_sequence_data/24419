The treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a major challenge because of the incomplete understanding of the triggering events that lead to the selective neurodegeneration characteristic of AD brains. Here we describe a new transcript of synaptic vesicle protein 2B (SV2Bb) mRNA that is up-regulated at mRNA level in neurons by amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) fragment (1-42). In comparison to SV2B this new mRNA encodes for the same protein but it has an elongated 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) that contains several AU-rich (AUR) cis-acting elements which are probably involved in posttranscriptional regulating of SV2Bb translation. In conclusion, alteration of SV2B(b) expression appears to be involved in processes of neuronal degeneration.
