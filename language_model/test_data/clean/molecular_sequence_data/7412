The human cellular CNBP gene locus has been sequenced and is comprised of 6453 bp from the transcription start point (tsp) to the polyadenylation signal, and an additional 201 bp of 5' and 259 bp of 3' flanking sequences. The gene consists of five exons, four of which contain coding information for two alternatively spliced products, CNPB alpha and beta. The open reading frame (ORF) of 177 amino acids (aa) is encoded by exons 2 through 4 (CNBP alpha, M(r) 19463). The protein contains seven zinc-finger (Zf) domains. CNBP beta lacks seven aa in the linker region between the first two Zf, because of the use of an alternative 5' donor site within exon 2. The sixth Zf is the only Zf domain that is not completely encoded within a single exon and is interrupted by an intron (intron 4). The 5' untranslated region (UTR) contains 849 bp and is interrupted by intron 1. The 3' UTR, ending at the polyadenylation signal, is 857 bp long and is contained within exon 5. One Alu repeat was identified within intron 1, the largest intron of CNBP.
