Human genomic clones that span the entire lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene have been isolated and used to determine its structure. The gene is approximately 30 kilobase (kb) pairs in length in which the mRNA specifying sequence is divided into 10 exons. Exons 1-9 are of average size (105-276 bp) whereas exon 10, which specifies the entire 3' uncoding sequence, is 1948 bp in length. Exon 1 codes for the signal peptide, exon 2 includes the protein domain that was shown to bind to the lipoprotein substrate, and exons 6 and 9 code for sequences that are relatively rich in basic amino acids and therefore likely to be involved in anchoring of the enzyme to the capillary endothelium by interaction with the acidic domain of heparan sulfate. Four closely spaced mRNA 5' termini were observed, indicating multiple transcription initiation sites, one of which seems to be favored. Two potential enhancer sequence motifs in the 5' upstream region were observed. One may specify expression in response to intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, and the other may be responsible for expression in adipocytes.
