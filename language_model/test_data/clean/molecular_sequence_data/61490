In search of key enzymes in Plasmodium phospholipid metabolism, we demonstrate the presence of a parasite-encoded phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD) in the membrane fraction of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes. PSD cDNA, encoding phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PfPSD), was cloned by screening a directional cDNA library derived from the trophozoite erythrocytic stage. The corresponding PfPSD gene is located on chromosome 9 of P. falciparum, contains one intron of 938 nucleotides and is transcribed into a 3.7 kb mRNA. PfPSD cDNA encodes a putative protein of 362 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 42.6 kDa, which clearly belongs to the type I PSD family. Only a 35 kDa polypeptide was detected in the parasite using a specific rabbit antiserum. PfPSD has a 314VGSS317 sequence near its carboxyl-terminus that is related to the Escherichia coli, yeast and human LGST motif, which is the site of proenzyme processing. PSD enzyme was expressed in E. coli with a KM of 63 +/- 19 microM and a VMAX of 680 +/- 49 nmol of phosphatidylethanolamine formed h-1 mg-1 protein. Site-directed mutagenesis of the VGSS active site demonstrated that the PfPSD proenzyme was processed into two non-identical subunits (alpha and beta) and revealed the crucial role played by each residue in enzyme processing and activity. Using indirect immunofluorescence, PfPSD labelling was co-localized with an endoplasmic reticulum marker, but not with a mitochondrial vital dye. This P. falciparum PSD is the first type I PSD identified in the endoplasmic reticulum compartment.
