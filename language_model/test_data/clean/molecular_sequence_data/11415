The examination of immunomodulatory properties of oligopeptides derived from two exposed loops (containing thymopentin-like and tuftsin-like sequences, respectively) of the proteins belonging to TGF beta family suggests that the particular species of the TGF beta family should differ distinctly in their influence on the immune response. According to our results obtained from three TGF beta species of mammals, TGF beta 2 should be a strong immunosuppressor, whereas for TGF beta 3 the immunostimulative potency is more probable. TGF beta 1 species would possess both immunosuppressive and immunostimulative potency, residing in two different loops of the protein. The results obtained also suggest that chicken TGF beta 4 should be associated with immunostimulative effects and xenopus TGF beta 5 with immunosuppressive ones.
