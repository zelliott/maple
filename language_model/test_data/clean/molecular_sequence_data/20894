Ts8B2 is a gene which encodes for a member of the Taenia solium metacestode 8kDa antigen family. Since the Ts8B2-GST recombinant protein compares very favourably with other diagnostic antigens, and in order to study the antigenic nature and structure of this molecule, the Ts8B2 was expressed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. The diagnostic potential of the recombinant Ts8B2 proteins was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using a collection of serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with clinically defined neurocysticercosis (NCC), and also sera from T. solium infected pigs. Despite the predicted glycosylation of the Ts8B2-Bac recombinant protein, there was very little difference in assay sensitivity/specificity when the Ts8B2 reagent was expressed in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems, suggesting that peptidic Ts8B2 epitopes are immunodominant in porcine cysticercosis and human neurocysticercosis. Conveniently, production of recombinant Ts8B2 in Escherichia coli is economical and facile, making it a feasible and practical choice as a diagnostic reagent for use in endemic areas. The Ts8B2 ELISA is particularly useful for the diagnosis of active as opposed to inactive cases of NCC and conduct of the assay is also facilitated by the fact that assay sensitivity is significantly greater when serum as opposed to CSF samples are employed.
