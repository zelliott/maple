Two agarolytic strains of Gram-negative, heterotrophic, facultatively anaerobic, marine bacteria, designated AAM1T and AAT1T, were isolated from seawater samples collected in the shallow coastal region of An-Ping Harbour, Tainan, Taiwan. Cells grown in broth cultures were straight rods that were motile by means of a single polar flagellum. The two isolates required NaCl for growth and grew optimally at about 25-30 degrees C, in 2-4% NaCl and at pH 8. They grew aerobically and could achieve anaerobic growth by fermenting D-glucose or other sugars. The major isoprenoid quinone was Q-8 (79.8-92.0%) and the major cellular fatty acids were summed feature 3 (C16:1omega7c and/or iso-C15:0 2-OH; 26.4-35.6%), C18:1omega7c (27.1-31.4%) and C16:0 (14.8-16.3%) in the two strains. Strains AAM1T and AAT1T had DNA G+C contents of 52.9 and 52.4 mol%, respectively. The two strains had a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 98.6% and shared 84.9-92.4% sequence similarity with the type strains of Agarivorans albus (91.2-92.4%), eight Alteromonas species (84.9-87.1%), two Aestuariibacter species (86.0-87.0%), Bowmanella denitrificans (86.1-86.7%), eight Glaciecola species (85.0-87.9%) and Salinimonas chungwhensis (85.9-86.1%). Despite their high sequence similarity, strains AAM1T and AAT1T had a DNA-DNA relatedness value of only 4.5%. The data obtained from these polyphasic taxonomic studies revealed that the two agarolytic isolates could be classified as representatives of two novel species in a new genus, Aliagarivorans gen. nov., with Aliagarivorans marinus sp. nov. [type strain is AAM1T (=BCRC 17888T=JCM 15522T)] as the type species and Aliagarivorans taiwanensis sp. nov. [type strain is AAT1T (=BCRC 17889T=JCM 15537T)] as a second species.
