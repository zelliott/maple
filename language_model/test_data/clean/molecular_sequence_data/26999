A Gram-negative, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacterium, designated strain R2A36-4T, was isolated from greenhouse soil and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic analysis. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the strain represented a novel member of the family Sphingobacteriaceae. Its nearest phylogenetic neighbour was the type strain of [Flexibacter] canadensis CIP 104802T (93.2% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). Strain R2A36-4T and [F.] canadensis CIP 104802T fell in a distinct cluster within the family Sphingobacteriaceae. Strain R2A36-4T contained MK-7 as the predominant quinone. Strain R2A36-4T and [F.] canadensis CIP 104802T had iso-C15:0, iso-C17:0 3-OH, summed feature 3 and C15:1omega6c as the major fatty acids. Strain R2A36-4T could be distinguished from [F.] canadensis on the basis of several physiological properties and fatty acid compositions. Based on phenotypic characterization and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain R2A36-4T represents a novel species within a new genus, for which the name Solitalea koreensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Solitalea koreensis is strain R2A36-4T (=KACC 12953T=DSM 21342T). It is also proposed that [F.] canadensis be transferred to this genus as Solitalea canadensis comb. nov. (type strain UASM 9DT=ATCC 29591T=CIP 104802T=DSM 3403T=NBRC 15130T=JCM 21819T=KACC 13276T=LMG 8368T).
