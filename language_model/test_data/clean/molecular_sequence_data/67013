Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a painful, disfiguring and debilitating disease prevalent in Ethiopia and other countries around the world. In Ethiopia, CL is primarily caused by Leishmania aethiopica and less often by L. tropica and L. major. The intracellular survival mechanisms of Leishmania parasites are still not well understood. Recently a new family of antioxidant enzymes called peroxidoxins have been identified that play an important role in parasite survival. In this study, we have identified two distinct peroxidoxin genes (Pxn1 and Pxn2) that are part of a multi-gene family in L. aethiopica. Protein sequence analysis showed that Pxn1 and Pxn2 are highly homologous to peroxidoxins from other Leishmania species. We have found that L. aethiopica Pxn1 is predominantly expressed in amastigotes and stationary phase promastigotes, whereas Pxn2 is constitutively expressed in the different stages of the parasite. This pattern of RNA expression is consistent with patterns seen in some Leishmania species, but not all. Data from this study will be helpful in enhancing vaccine strategies and drug studies targeted towards peroxidoxins.
