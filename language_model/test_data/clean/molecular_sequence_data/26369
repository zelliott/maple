Three novel non-CS antigens have been identified on P. falciparum and P. berghei sporozoites and exoerythrocytic parasites. CSP-2 is a sporozoite surface protein common to P. falciparum and P. berghei that elicits antibody-mediated protection, and is also found within P. berghei EE parasites. LSA is a P. falciparum EE-specific antigen localized within the parasitophorous vacuole. LSA-2 is a P. berghei EE-specific antigen, localized on the parasitophorous vacuole membrane, that protected mice to P. berghei sporozoite challenge, and elicited cytotoxic T cells that killed P. berghei EE parasites in vitro.
