1. The venom of the solitary scoliid wasp Colpa interrupta (F.) shows a kinin-activity, when tested on a cascade of mammalian smooth muscle preparations, and, in addition, a contraction of the rat colon. 2. The venom also irreversibly blocks the nicotinic synaptic transmission from the cercal nerve to a giant interneuron in the sixth abdominal ganglion of the cockroach, Periplaneta americana. 3. The same activities have been found within one HPLC fraction. 4. However, rechromatography of this fraction resulted in four subfractions being active on smooth muscles. 5. One fraction caused contraction of the colon, three other fractions contained kinin-activity. 6. Only the most active kinin fraction blocked synaptic transmission in the insect CNS. 7. This fraction contained threonine-bradykinin. 8. Synthetic Thr-bradykinin causes irreversible presynaptic activation-induced block of transmission in the insect CNS.
