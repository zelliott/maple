The eIF4A gene family codes for proteins which unwind secondary structures of mRNA during translational initiation. The tobacco eIF4A-10 promoter is one of a few of constitutive promoters found in plants. Research was conducted to identify the proximal promoter elements and to evaluate the potential application of the promoter for regulating transgene expression in a range of crop plants. A large intron (892 bp) in the leader sequence was found to be dispensable for constitutive promoter activity and did not contribute to the overall performance of the promoter. Deletion analysis showed that the upstream region between -151 bp and -73bp relative to the transcriptional start site was essential for the high level of expression and the constitutive activity. The data indicated that the elements in this region may coordinate and compensate each other for the high levels of promoter expression. The downstream leader sequence also contained a strong quantitative enhancer element that was essential for the full activity of the eIF4A-10 promoter. The eIF-4A10 promoter was found to be active in a wide range of plant species and tissues indicating that it will be useful for the constitutive expression of transgenes in plants.
