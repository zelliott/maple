A bacteriocin-producing strain was isolated from raw milk and named Streptococcus bovis HJ50. Like most bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria, bovicin HJ50 showed a narrow range of inhibiting activity. It was sensitive to trypsin, subtilisin and proteinase K. Bovicin HJ50 was extracted by n-propanol and purified by SP Sepharose Fast Flow, followed by Phenyl Superose and Sephadex G-50. Treatment of Micrococcus flavus NCIB8166 with bovicin HJ50 revealed potassium efflux from inside the cell in a concentration-dependent manner. The molecular mass of bovicin HJ50 was determined to be 3428.3 Da. MS analysis of DTT-treated bovicin HJ50 suggested that bovicin HJ50 contains a disulfide bridge. The structural gene of bovicin HJ50 was cloned by nested PCR based on its N-terminal amino acid sequence. Sequence analysis showed that it encodes a 58 aa prepeptide consisting of an N-terminal leader sequence of 25 aa and a C-terminal propeptide domain of 33 aa. Bovicin HJ50 shows similarity to type AII lantibiotics. Chemical modification using an ethanethiol-containing reaction mixture showed that two Thr residues are modified.
