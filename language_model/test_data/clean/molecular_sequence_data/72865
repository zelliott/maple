Human thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) is a deoxyribonucleoside kinase that phosphorylates thymidine, deoxycytidine, and deoxyuridine. The enzyme also phosphorylates anti-viral and anti-cancer nucleoside analogs. We have identified an expressed sequence tag cDNA that encoded a 27.5-kDa protein approximately 30% similar to the human deoxycytidine kinase and deoxyguanosine kinase. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to have similar substrate specificity as reported for purified native human TK2. The recombinant TK2 was shown to phosphorylate the anti-cancer nucleoside analog 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine. Northern blot analysis showed two mRNA species at 2.4 and 4.0 kilobases predominantly expressed in liver, pancreas, muscle, and brain. We identified a sequence-tagged site designed from the 3' region of the TK2 cDNA. The sequence-tagged site has been mapped to 81-84 centimorgans from the top linkage group of chromosome 16, which corresponds to the 16q22 region. Our data show that deoxycytidine kinase, deoxyguanosine kinase, and TK2 belong to a family of closely related enzymes. At the time of this report all four of the known human deoxyribonucleoside kinases have been cloned. This provides the opportunity to characterize their individual contribution to therapeutic and toxic effects of nucleoside analogs.
