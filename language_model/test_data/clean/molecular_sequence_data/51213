Rat islets express a pertussis toxin sensitive G-protein involved in receptor-mediated inhibition of insulin secretion. This has been assumed previously to represent "G(i)" which couples inhibitory receptors to adenylate cyclase. Incubation of islet G-proteins with 32P-NAD and pertussis toxin resulted in the labelling of a band of molecular weight 40,000. This band was very broad and did not allow resolution of individual components. Incubation of the radiolabelled proteins with an anti-G(o) antiserum resulted in specific immunoprecipitation of a 32P-labelled band. These results demonstrate that the complement of pertussis toxin sensitive G-proteins in rat islets includes G(o).
