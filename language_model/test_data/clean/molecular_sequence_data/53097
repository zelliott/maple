HIV-1 Tat protein activates resting cells, rendering them permissive for viral replication. Replication of HIV-1 in vitro is enhanced by intercellular passage of Tat protein and inhibited by anti-Tat antibodies. Tat dependence of HIV-1 replication in vivo during acute, chronic asymptomatic and AIDS stages of infection was assessed by comparisons of plasma viremia in Tat-immunized or control monkeys challenged with SHIV(33) or SHIV(33A). Chronic plasma viremia became undetectable or minimized in Tat-immunized asymptomatic SHIV(33)-infected monkeys (p<0.008) while the high viral loads of acute infection or SHIV(33A)-induced simian AIDS were unaffected by Tat immunization. Active or passive immunotherapies targeting Tat provide potential approaches to controlling chronic HIV-1 viremia and preventing AIDS.
