The F0 sector of the ATP synthase complex facilitates proton translocation through the membrane, and via interaction with the F1 sector, couples proton transport to ATP synthesis. The molecular mechanism of function is being probed by a combination of mutant analysis and structural biochemistry, and recent progress on the Escherichia coli F0 sector is reviewed here. The E. coli F0 is composed of three types of subunits (a, b, and c) and current information on their folding and organization in F0 is reviewed. The structure of purified subunit c in chloroform-methanol-H2O resembles that in native F0, and progress in determining the structure by NMR methods is reviewed. Genetic experiments suggest that the two helices of subunit c must interact as a functional unit around an essential carboxyl group as protons are transported. In addition, a unique class of suppressor mutations identify a transmembrane helix of subunit a that is proposed to interact with the bihelical unit of subunit c during proton transport. The role of multiple units of subunit c in coupling proton translocation to ATP synthesis is considered. The special roles of Asp61 of subunit c and Arg210 of subunit a in proton translocation are also discussed.
