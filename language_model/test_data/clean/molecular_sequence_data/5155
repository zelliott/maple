Asparagine-linked sugar chains were quantitatively released from chimpanzee, Rhesus monkey and rat IgA proteins as oligosaccharides by hydrazinolysis, converted to radioactive oligosaccharides by reduction with NaB3H4, and separated into neutral and two acidic fractions by paper electrophoresis. The acidic oligosaccharides were converted to neutral ones by sialidase digestion, indicating that they are sialyl derivatives. However, the content of N-acetyl and N-glycolyl neuraminic acids was different among three species. The neutral and sialidase-treated acidic oligosaccharides were fractionated by Bio-Gel P-4 column chromatography in combination with linkage-specific sequential exoglycosidase digestion. Although IgA molecules from these species have mainly biantennary complex-type sugar chains, the contents of fucose and bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residues displayed marked species differences. In addition to these sugar chains, a small amount of the high mannose-type sugar chains was detected in chimpanzee and rat, but not in Rhesus monkey IgA. These results indicated that the processing of asparagine-linked sugar chains of IgA is different in each species.
