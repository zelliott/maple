We cloned and sequenced a DNA fragment from the thermophilic archaeal strain Sulfolobus shibatae B12 that includes the gene topR encoding the reverse gyrase. The RNA of the reverse gyrase gene was characterized indicating that the topR gene is fully functional in vivo. We showed by primer extension analysis that transcription of topR initiates 28 bp downstream from a consensus A-box promoter. In order to understand how this particular type I DNA topoisomerase introduces positive superturns into the DNA, we compared the amino acid sequence of reverse gyrase from S.shibatae with the two other known reverse gyrases. This comparison indicates a common organization of these proteins: the carboxy-terminal domain is related to the type I-5' topoisomerase family while the amino-terminal domain possesses some motifs of proteins described as RNA or DNA helicases. By using local alignments, we showed that (i) reverse gyrases constitute a new and rather homogenous group within the type I-5' DNA topoisomerase family; (ii) a careful sequence analysis of the amino-terminal domain allows us to relate the presence of some motifs with an ATP binding and hydrolysis reaction coupled to a DNA binding and unwinding activity.
