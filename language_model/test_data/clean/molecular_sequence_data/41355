Inspired by bacterial adhesins, we present a promising strategy of how to engineer peptides to probe various mechanical strains of extracellular matrix fibers. Functional sequence alignment of bacterial adhesins reveals that the bacterial linkers connecting the multivalent binding motifs recognizing fibronectin show considerable heterogeneity in length. Their length regulates the tunable affinities for fibronectin fibrils when stretched into different mechanical strain states. This platform has potential applications in probing extracellular matrix fiber strains in tissues.
