Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) of 28 residue peptides harboring gamma-carboxylated glutamic acid residues, a posttranslational modification of several proenzymes of the blood coagulation cascade, using either collisions or infrared photons results in complete ejection of the gamma-CO2 moieties (-44 Da) before cleavage of peptide-backbone bonds. However, MS/MS using electron capture dissociation (ECD) in a Fourier transform mass spectrometer cleaves backbone bonds without ejecting CO2, allowing direct localization of this labile modification. Sulfated side chains are also retained in ECD backbone fragmentations of a 21-mer peptide, although CAD causes extensive SO3 loss. ECD thus is a unique complement to conventional methods for MS/MS, causing less undesirable loss of side-chain functionalities as well as more desirable backbone cleavages.
