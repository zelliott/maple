A method for obtaining auxotrophic mutants for amino acids coding by regulatory region of cat 86 has been reported. A selection of Bacillus subtilis BR 151 mutants for studying the translational regulation of cat 86 has been carried out. The procedure described is very convenient for genetic analysis.
