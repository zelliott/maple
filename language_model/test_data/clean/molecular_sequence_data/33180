Two actinomycete strains, NRRL B-24165(T) and NRRL B-24166(T), isolated from lesions on equine placentas in Kentucky, USA, were analysed using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, morphological observations and the presence of ll-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid in whole-cell hydrolysates, the new isolates clearly belonged to the genus Streptomyces. Analyses of the phylogenetic positions of strains NRRL B-24165(T) and NRRL B-24166(T) based on 16S rRNA gene sequences of all recognized species of the genus Streptomyces, as well as evaluation of morphological and physiological characteristics, demonstrated that the new isolates could be differentiated from all recognized species and therefore represented novel species. It is proposed that the new strains represent two novel species for which the names Streptomyces atriruber sp. nov. (type strain NRRL B-24165(T)=DSM 41860(T)=LDDC 6330-99(T)) and Streptomyces silaceus sp. nov. (NRRL B-24166(T)=DSM 41861(T)=LDDC 6638-99(T)) are proposed. The species names are based on the distinctive colours of the substrate mycelium of these strains, dark red and deep orange-yellow, respectively.
