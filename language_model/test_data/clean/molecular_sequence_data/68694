The retinoblastoma (RB) tumour suppressor protein is capable of repressing the activity of promoters containing DNA binding sites for the transcription factor E2F. Recently a protein which binds RB and possesses the DNA binding characteristics of E2F has been cloned. Here we show that the E2F activation domain is the target for RB-induced repression. RB can silence the 57 residue E2F activation domain but cannot effectively repress an E2F mutant which has reduced RB binding capacity. Extensive mutagenesis of E2F shows residues involved in RB binding are required for transcription activation. Mutations which affect both functions most dramatically lie within the minimal RB binding region. A further subset of sensitive residues lies within a new repeat motif E/DF XX L X P which flanks the minimum RB binding site. These data show that RB can mask E2F residues involved in the activation process, possibly by mimicking a component of the transcriptional machinery. Consistent with this model, we find that the TATA box binding protein TBP can bind to the E2F activation domain in vitro in a manner indistinguishable from that of RB.
