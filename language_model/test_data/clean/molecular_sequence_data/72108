Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a complex developmental disorder involving the hemizygous deletion of genes on chromosome 7q11.23. The cardiovascular aspects of the disorder are known to be caused by haploinsufficiency for ELN, but the genes contributing to the other features of WBS are still undetermined. Fifteen genes have been shown to reside within the WBS deletion, and here we report the identification and cloning of an additional gene that is commonly deleted. WBSCR11, which was identified through genomic DNA sequence analysis and cDNA library screening, was positioned toward the telomeric end of the WBS deletion. The gene is expressed in all adult tissues analyzed, including many regions of the brain. The predicted protein displays homology to another gene from the WBS deletion, GTF2I, which is known to be a transcription factor. We postulate that WBSCR11 is also a transcription factor and may contribute to the spectrum of developmental symptoms found in WBS.
