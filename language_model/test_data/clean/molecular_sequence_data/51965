IL12 (formerly NKSF or CLMF) is a unique cytokine composed of two unrelated disulfide-linked subunits. The larger 40-kDa subunit (p40) is a member of the cytokine receptor family, and the smaller 35-kDa subunit (p35) is related to IL6 and GCSF. The chromosomal localization of these two subunits was determined by PCR analysis of DNA from rodent-human hybrids. More refined mapping was obtained by PCR analysis of hybrids containing translocation chromosomes and for p40, by analysis of radiation hybrids. The subunits map to different chromosomes: p40 (IL12B) to 5q31-q33 and p35 (IL12A) to 3p12-3q13.2.
