The tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily consists of approximately 10 characterized members of human proteins. We have identified a new member of the TNFR superfamily, TR2, from a search of an expressed sequence tag data base. cDNA cloning and Northern blot hybridization demonstrated multiple mRNA species, of which a 1.7-kilobase form was most abundant. However, TR2 is encoded by a single gene which, maps to chromosome 1p36.22-36.3, in the same region as several other members of the TNFR superfamily. The most abundant TR2 open reading frame encodes a 283-amino acid single transmembrane protein with a 36-residue signal sequence, two perfect and two imperfect TNFR-like cysteine-rich domains, and a short cytoplasmic tail with some similarity to 4-1BB and CD40. TR2 mRNA is expressed in multiple human tissues and cell lines and shows a constitutive and relatively high expression in peripheral blood T cells, B cells, and monocytes. A TR2-Fc fusion protein inhibited a mixed lymphocyte reaction-mediated proliferation suggesting that the receptor and/or its ligand play a role in T cell stimulation.
