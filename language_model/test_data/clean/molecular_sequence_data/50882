Polymerase chain reaction was applied to human genomic DNA using primers corresponding to the rat substance P receptor cDNA. As a result, a fragment of 94 b.p. was isolated identical to the fragment 771-864 of the above-mentioned cDNA, with the exception of the G796----A substitution (Val----Ile in the amino acid sequence). A comparison of the established sequence with the published structures of tachykinin receptors of NK-1, NK-2 and NK-3 types allows its assignment to the substance P receptor (NK-1 tachykinin receptor) gene detected in the human genome.
