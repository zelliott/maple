Plants are attractive expression systems for large-scale, low-cost production of high-value proteins. The xylanase 2 gene (Xyn2), encoding an endo-β-1,4-xylanase from Trichoderma reesei, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and the poplar (Populus spp.). The optimal temperature and pH of the recombinant xylanase were 50 °C and 5.0 respectively when expressed in E. coli. The purpose of this study was to produce recombinant xylanase in poplar. The Xyn2 gene was transferred into poplars by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The transgenic status and transgene expression of the transformed poplar were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis. The poplar-expressed xylanase was biologically active, with an expression level of up to 14.4% of total leaf soluble protein. In the leaves, the average xylanase content was 1.016 mg per g of leaf fresh weight in the transgenic poplar. We found that the poplar might make possible the large-scale production of commercially important recombinant proteins.
