A Gram-stain-negative, non-motile, rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated D1-W3(T), was isolated from tidal flat sediment of the South Sea, South Korea, and subjected to a taxonomic study using a polyphasic approach. Strain D1-W3(T) grew optimally at pH 7.0-8.0, at 25 °C and in the presence of 2 % (w/v) NaCl. Neighbour-joining phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain D1-W3(T) fell within the clade comprising species of the genus Loktanella, clustering with the type strains of Loktanella tamlensis, Loktanella rosea and Loktanella maricola, with which it exhibited the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values (98.1-98.2 %). The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values between strain D1-W3(T) and the type strains of other species of the genus Loktanella were in the range 93.5-96.5 %. The DNA G+C content of strain D1-W3(T) was 58.1 mol% and the mean DNA-DNA hybridization values with L. tamlensis KCTC 12722(T), L. rosea LMG 22534(T) and L. maricola DSW-18(T) were 13-25 %. Strain D1-W3(T) contained Q-10 as the predominant ubiquinone and C18 : 1ω7c as the predominant fatty acid. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and one unidentified aminolipid. Differential phenotypic properties, together with the phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness, showed that strain D1-W3(T) could be differentiated from other species of the genus Loktanella. On the basis of the data presented, strain D1-W3(T) represents a novel species of the genus Loktanella, for which the name Loktanella sediminilitoris sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is D1-W3(T) ( = KCTC 32383(T) = CECT 8284(T)).
