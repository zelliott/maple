Rat keratin K5 and vimentin complementary DNAs have been isolated, identified, and used to study keratin and vimentin expression as markers for cell differentiation. Isologous rat neoplastic epithelial cell lines used were based on a clonal benign epithelial line (A5P/B10) and a clonal anaplastic malignant derivative line (T952/F7). Stable cytoplasmic mRNA was detected for keratin but not vimentin in the benign cells. The anaplastic derivative cells expressed vimentin but showed a 1000-fold reduction in the keratin message, which nuclear run-on assays identified as being due to posttranscriptional down-regulation. An identical pattern of posttranscriptional down-regulation was found in independent malignant somatic cell hybrids of the benign and anaplastic cells. trans-acting regulatory mechanisms implicated in posttranscriptional (pretranslational) keratin down-regulation in these anaplastic malignant cells may play a role in the apparent loss of differentiation evident in tumor progression.
