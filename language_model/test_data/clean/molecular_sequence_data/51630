The formation of B lymphoid restricted progenitors was followed during chicken embryonic development by monitoring the appearance of the various Ig gene rearrangements (DJH, VHDJH, V lambda J lambda), as a sensitivity that allows the detection of a single rearranged cell. By quantifying the DJH committed progenitor populations, we describe their evolution in different compartments at different developmental stages. The yolk sac is the first site where DJH-positive cells are observed (at days 5-6 of development); via the general circulation, they then seed the various organs while undergoing VHDJH and V lambda J lambda rearrangements, which occur simultaneously but lag behind DJH by one to several days. These progenitor populations decline with time in most lymphoid sites and only expand in the bursa. RAG-1 expression is observed in the bursa in the absence of ongoing rearrangement activity and thus appears to be an improper marker of rearrangement in the chicken. Commitment to the B cell lineage seems to result from an intrinsic cell program, but the survival and expansion of the committed B progenitors require the specific microenvironment of the bursa.
