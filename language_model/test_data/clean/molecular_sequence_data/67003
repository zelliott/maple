The sequence of the alpha-transinducing factor (alpha-TIF) of canine herpesvirus (CHV-l) was determined. Alignment of the predicted CHV-1 alpha-TIF amino acid sequence with other alpha-TIF homologues reveals a core region of similarity with divergent amino and carboxyl termini. Analysis of the CHV-1 infected cell protein 4 promoter region identified a region containing nine copies of a 52 bp repeat that showed significant up-regulation of transcription by alpha-TIF. This region contained an imperfect 'TAATGARAT' motif, the binding site for herpes simplex virus 1 alpha-TIF, with an imperfect Oct-1 binding site immediately following. The infectious laryngotracheitis virus alpha-TIF was also shown to up-regulate transcription through this region of the promoter. Transfection of CHV-1 genomic DNA failed to yield infectious virus in canine kidney cell lines. Co-transfection of genomic DNA and an alpha-TIF expression plasmid resulted in virus plaques, indicating a potential essential role for alpha-TIF in CHV-1 infection.
