Vaccines are promising for the control of toxoplasmosis. Here, we evaluated the immunogenicity of 17 peptides derived from SAG1 surface protein of Toxoplasma gondii in CH3 mice. Only 8 of 16 peptides induced specific antibodies. After a lethal challenge, only the vaccination with 4 of 17 peptides that were from the carboxy terminal end of the protein conferred significant survival. Our work shows that vaccination with peptides from the carboxy-terminal positions of SAG1 major surface protein of Toxoplasma protects mice against a lethal challenge.
