These data show the presence of mRNAs for two complement components (C) in the adult rat brain and describe their responses to experimental lesions. Cortical deafferentation caused elevations in striatal C1qB and C4 mRNAs that coincided temporally and overlapped anatomically with the course of degeneration of corticostriatal afferent fibers. By in situ hybridization, C1qB mRNA in the lesioned striatum was colocalized to cells immunoreactive for CR3, a complement receptor found on microglia-macrophages. The mRNA for SGP-2, a putative C inhibitor in rat, showed parallel changes. Similarly, in hippocampus and other brain regions, kainic acid lesions increased C1qB mRNA. The data suggest that microglia-macrophages and possibly other cells in rat brain rapidly up-regulate C-mRNAs in response to deafferentation and local neuron injury. These experimental responses provide models to analyze changes in C components during Alzheimer's disease and other chronic neurodegenerative conditions.
