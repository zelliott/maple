Using methods for database screening with individual protein sequences and alignment blocks, a conserved domain is delineated in a group of proteins including several FAD-dependent oxidases. Two motifs within this domain resemble phosphate-binding loops and may be directly involved in FAD binding. These motifs can be readily distinguished from previously described nucleotide-binding sites using a method for database screening with position-dependent weight matrices derived from alignment blocks. Unexpectedly, this group of known and predicted FAD-dependent oxidases includes the product of the DIMINUTO gene, which is involved in Arabidopsis development, and its homologues from man and Mycobacterium leprae.
