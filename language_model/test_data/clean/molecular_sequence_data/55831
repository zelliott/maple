The effects of hyperosmolality on the production and mRNA expression of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) were examined in the present study. Osmolality in incubation media was changed from 290 to 490 or 690 mosmol/kgH2O by adding NaCl, urea, mannitol, or raffinose. A preliminary experiment was carried out using tubule suspension from the inner medulla. Hyperosmolality by NaCl stimulated ET-1 accumulation in rats (from 323.5 +/- 76.3 to 478.0 +/- 108.4 and 573.7 +/- 47.8 pg.mg protein-1 x 24 h-1 in 290, 490, and 690 mosmol/kgH2O, respectively) and rabbits. In contrast, hyperosmolality by urea markedly decreased ET-1 accumulation and hyperosmolality by mannitol showed no effect on it. We next examined whether hyperosmolality changes ET-1 mRNA. After incubation in isotonic or hypertonic solution for 6 h, ET-1 mRNA was determined using reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in microdissected IMCD and glomerulus. Hyperosmolality by NaCl and raffinose significantly increased the PCR products of ET-1 mRNA in IMCD, whereas mannitol did not. The stimulatory effect of hyperosmolality by NaCl on ET-1 mRNA expression was not observed in glomerulus. Our data suggested a stimulatory effect of hyperosmolality on production and mRNA expression of ET-1 in IMCD but not in glomerulus.
