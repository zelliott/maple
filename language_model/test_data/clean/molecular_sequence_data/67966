A panel of mutants of the hepatitis B virus X gene (HBx) was constructed by oligonucleotide-directed insertion of two codons (Arg Pro) at 10- or 20-amino-acid intervals along the entire gene. These mutants were tested in transiently transfected HepG2 cells for their effects on HBx trans-activation of an AP1-CAT reporter plasmid. The effects of HBx mutations on the mRNA and protein stability were also determined. Our results reveal two separate internal domains of the HBx, one around amino acid residue 68 and the other between residues 110 and 139, that are necessary for its activity. Mutations in the amino terminus (to position 45), between the two necessary domains and in the extreme carboxyl terminal portion of HBx, have little or no effect on its activity.
