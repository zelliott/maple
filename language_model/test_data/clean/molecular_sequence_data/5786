Screening of a human foetal brain genomic DNA library allowed us to isolate an EcoRI-EcoRI fragment containing 6 kb of the 5'-flanking region, the open reading frame and 4 kb of the 3'-flanking region of the alpha2C4 gene. Analysis of the sequenced region (4850 bp) revealed that the first 900 bp 5' to the start codon are very rich in GC (84%), contain several Sp1-binding sites and lack a consensus TATA box. The 5'- and 3'-ends of the alpha2C4 transcript were determined by RNase-protection assays carried out with a series of antisense probes. The data obtained with cellular RNA from HepG2 cells demonstrated that transcription is initiated 891 bases upstream of the translation-start site and that the polyadenylation site is located 550 bases downstream of the stop codon. These results are consistent with the existence of a non-conventional TATA box (TTAGAAA) and the presence of a unique polyadenylation signal (AATAAA). They also fit with the size of alpha2C4-RNA found by Northern-blot analysis (2.9 kb). The transcriptional activity of the alpha2C4 promoter region was investigated by transfecting several cell types with chimaeric constructs containing various fragments of the 5'-non-coding region and luciferase as a reporter gene. The activity of the construct containing the entire 5'-non-coding region appeared to depend on the host cell. Removal of the 5'-untranslated region resulted in loss of cell specificity and a concomitant increase in luciferase activity. Transfection of HepG2 and SK-N-MC cells with constructs deleted of additional 5'-flanking fragments permitted the definition of a minimal 200 bp promoter fragment containing the pseudo-TATA box and two putative SP1-binding sites.
