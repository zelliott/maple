The pro-death Bcl-2 family protein and tumor suppressor Bax is frequently mutated in tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI). The mutation often results in a "Bax negative" phenotype and therefore is generally thought to be beneficial to the development of the tumor. Here, we report the identification of a novel Bax isoform, BaxΔ2, which is unique to microsatellite unstable tumors. BaxΔ2 is generated by a unique combination of a microsatellite deletion in Bax exon 3 and alternative splicing of Bax exon 2. Consistently, BaxΔ2 is only detected in MSI cell lines and primary tumors. BaxΔ2 is a potent cell death inducer but does not directly target mitochondria. In addition, BaxΔ2 sensitizes certain MSI tumor cells to a subset of chemotherapeutic agents, such as adriamycin. Thus, our data provide evidence that mutation and alternative splicing of tumor suppressors such as Bax are not always beneficial to tumor development but can be detrimental instead.
