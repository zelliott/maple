A number of RP-HPLC systems, including those prescribed in several official monographs, have been evaluated for separating oxytocin, the vasopressins, some clinically important analogues and two additional neurohypophyseal nonapeptides. The separation has been compared with capillary zone electrophoresis and micellar electrophoresis in four micellar systems: cationic, anionic, zwitterionic and neutral. Complete separation was achieved by both RP-HPLC and micellar CE but the importance of charge as a major parameter of separation in CE confers a distinct and useful selectivity to micellar CE based separations.
