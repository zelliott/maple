N-Acetylneuraminic acid is a main constituent of glycoproteins and gangliosides. In many membrane-bound receptors it is the target for external stimuli. The key enzyme for its biosynthesis is the bifunctional enzyme UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase, catalysing the first two steps of the biosynthesis in the cytosol. The rat enzyme was previously isolated and characterised. In this report we present the corresponding human cDNA sequence, compare it with the primary structure of the rodent enzyme, and report the analysis of its expression in different human tissues and cell lines.
