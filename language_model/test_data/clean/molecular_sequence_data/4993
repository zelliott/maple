The homoserine dehydrogenase (HD) genes from Brevibacterium lactofermentum lysine- and threonine-producing mutants were cloned, using the polymerase chain reaction, and sequenced. We found the amino acid substitutions, Val104Ile in the lysine-producing mutants in which HD may cause leaky mutation and Ser393Phe in the threonine-producing mutant with feedback-insensitive HD.
