A novel aptameric enzyme subunit (AES) which can detect target DNAs has been developed. AES is an enzyme-inhibiting aptamer bearing a target-molecule binding site which can allosterically control enzymatic activity. The thrombin-inhibiting aptamer bearing a G-quartet structure was chosen as the enzyme-inhibiting aptamer. The stem-and-loop structure, which contains a strand complementary to the target DNA, was inserted into the G-quartet structure of the thrombin-inhibiting aptamer to disrupt the G-quartet structure through the hybridization of the target DNA with the complementary strand in the AES. The disruption of the G-quartet structure led to a decrease of the inhibitory activity of the whole aptameric complex. Using this designed aptamer, we were able to detect target DNAs by measuring the thrombin activity in a homogeneous solution without bound/free separation, and the lower detection limit was 20 nM.
