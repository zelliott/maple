The etiology of Crohn's disease in humans is largely unknown. Clinical signs of Crohn's disease partly resemble the clinical picture of Johne's disease in ruminants caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis. Because of the high prevalence of these bacteria in (products of) ruminants and their remarkable thermostability, concern has been raised about the possible role of these bacteria in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. In an attempt to develop a molecular typing method to facilitate meaningful comparative DNA fingerprinting of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis isolates from the human and animal reservoirs, multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) was explored and compared to IS900 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing. MLVA typing subdivided the most predominant RFLP type, R01, into six subtypes and thus provides a promising molecular subtyping approach to study the diversity of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis.
