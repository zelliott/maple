Malignant transformation is accompanied by altered cell surface glycosylation. N-Linked oligosaccharides carrying beta1-6GlcNAc branches are associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. Therefore, compounds that can enter cells and block biosynthesis of beta1-6GlcNAc-branched glycans without overt cytotoxicity are potential anticancer agents. We have developed a homogeneous cell-based assay for detection of such compounds. The method enables identification of agents that block beta1-6GlcNAc-branched glycan expression after incubation for 16-20 h with MDAY-D2 tumor cells, thereby protecting the cells from the subsequent addition of leukoagglutinin, a cytotoxic plant lectin. We observed that MDAY-D2 cell number is directly proportional to the level of endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity measured spectrophotometrically in cultures after the addition of substrate. The alkaline phosphatase assay was capable of detecting as few as 1,500 cells. The assay was readily adapted for high-throughput screening as reagent costs are low and no cell harvesting and washing steps are required. Under high-throughput operating conditions, the coefficient of variation for controls was found to be 4.2%. The results suggest that measurement of alkaline phosphatase in this cell assay format may be adapted for wider applications in high-throughput screenings for compounds that relieve cells from other growth inhibitors.
