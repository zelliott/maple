Rab3 and Rab27 GTPases control late events in the secretory pathway of mammalian cells including docking and fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane. The action of Rab3 and Rab27 on the exocytotic process is exerted through the activation of specific effectors. Several proteins with the capacity to interact in a GTP-dependent manner with Rab3 and Rab27 have been identified. However, for most of these potential Rab effectors a precise function in the secretory process has not yet been attributed. In this chapter we describe a series of approaches that can be applied to assess the properties of Rab3 and Rab27 effectors and their potential role in the regulation of dense core granule release.
