Prostate secretory protein of 94 amino acids (PSP94) has shown the potential to be a diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic agent for prostate cancer. Primates have been the main animal models for studying the biology of this molecule. We have cloned and analyzed the cDNA and promoter region of PSP94 from baboon (Papio anubis). Sequence divergence among baboon, monkey, pig, and human, in both the exons and 5'-flanking region indicates rapid evolution of the PSP94 gene. There are conserved steroid hormone response elements (SHRE) in the promoter region of all three primate species. Multiple, alternative transcripts starting near these SHREs and upstream to the TATA box were identified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of 5'-cDNA ends (5' RACE) in primate prostatic tissues. This differential transcription initiation may be linked to androgen regulation of PSP94 gene expression. PSP94 transcripts were detected by RT-PCR in a wide variety of mucus-secreting tissues. However, the alternative transcripts were found only in the prostate. The distribution of the PSP94 protein in baboon secretory tissues was also examined by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody against the human homolog. A positive immunoreactive band was detected, but it was weak, due probably to epitope divergence between the two species. In all young, healthy primate animals tested, the level of immunoreactive PSP94 in prostate tissues was lower than expected. In addition, RT-PCR combined with Southern blot analysis on prostate tissues in these animals failed to detect the PSP57 mRNA produced by alternative splicing of PSP94 primary transcript. These observations can be explained by the sexual immaturity and incomplete prostate development in these young primates. This explanation was supported by histological examination of their prostate during PSP94 immunohistochemistry.
