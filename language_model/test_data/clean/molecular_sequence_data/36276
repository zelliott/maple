The Threonine-Glycine (Thr-Gly) region of the period gene (per) in Drosophila was compared in the eight species of the D. melanogaster subgroup. This region can be divided into a diverged variable-length segment which is flanked by more conserved sequences. The number of amino acids encoded in the variable-length region ranges from 40 in D. teissieri to 69 in D. mauritiana. This is similar to the range found within natural populations of D. melanogaster. It was possible to derive a Thr-Gly "allele" of one species from that of another by invoking hypothetical Thr-Gly intermediates. A phylogeny based on the more conserved flanking sequences was produced. The results highlighted some of the problems which are encountered when highly polymorphic genes are used to infer phylogenies of closely related species.
