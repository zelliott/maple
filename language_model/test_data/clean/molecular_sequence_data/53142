Choristoneura fumiferana multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (CfMNPV) is a baculovirus pathogenic to spruce budworm, the most damaging insect pest in Canadian forestry. CfMNPV is less virulent to its host insect and its replication cycle is slower than the baculovirus type species Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) but the basis of these characteristics is not known. We have now identified, localized, and determined the sequence of the region of CfMNPV carrying potentially important regulatory genes including p47, lef-12, gta, and pkip. DNA database searches revealed that this region of CfMNPV is most closely related to the homologous OpMNPV genes. Transcription analysis demonstrated that CfMNPV P47 is encoded by a 1.6-kb transcript, LEF-12 is encoded by a 2.6-kb transcript, and GTA is encoded by a 2.1-kb transcript. Transcripts for these genes were detectable at 6 h postinfection but all of them showed a burst in expression levels between 12 and 24 h postinfection corresponding to the time of initiation of CfMNPV DNA replication. A polyclonal antibody, raised against CfMNPV P47, detected a nuclear 43-kDa polypeptide from 12 to 72 h postinfection, demonstrating that the CfMNPV p47 gene product is first expressed at a time corresponding to the burst of transcriptional activity between the early and the late phases. Both AcMNPV and CfMNPV P47 translocate to the nucleus of infected cells.
