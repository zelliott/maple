The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 protein Tat acts as a transcription transactivator that stimulates expression of the infected viral genome. It is released from infected cells and can similarly affect neighboring cells. The nucleocapsid is an important protein that has a related significant role in early mRNA expression, and which contributes to the rapid viral replication that occurs during HIV-1 infection. To investigate the interaction between the Tat and nucleocapsid proteins, we utilized cDNA microarrays using pTat and flag NC cotransfection in HEK 293T cells and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to validate the microarray data. Four upregulated genes and nine downregulated genes were selected as candidate genes. Gene ontology analysis was conducted to define the biological process of the input genes. A proteomic approach using PathwayStudio determined the relationship between Tat and nucleocapsid; two automatically built pathways represented the interactions between the upregulated and downregulated genes. The results indicate that the up- and downregulated genes regulate HIV-1 replication and proliferation, and viral entry.
