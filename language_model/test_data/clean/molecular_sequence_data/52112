Localization of the molluscan cardioexcitatory tetrapeptide FMRFamide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2) in the brain and hypophysis of the brown hagfish, Paramyxine atami, was examined by immunohistochemistry specially regarding a possible relationship with neuropeptide Y (NPY). FMRFamide-immunoreactive fibers were demonstrated in many regions of the brain, with the highest density in the diencephalon. However, no immunoreactivity was found in the hypophysis. Labeled cells were chiefly located in the nucleus hypothalamicus of the diencephalon, although a few cells were recognized in the ventrolateral area of the caudal tegmentum. Examination of adjacent sections immunostained alternatively with anti-NPY antiserum and anti-FMRFamide antiserum showed overlapping of the distributional patterns of the immunoreactive structures in the brain. Moreover, the same cells in the nucleus hypothalamicus were immunostained with both antisera. Cross-blocking experiments showed that the FMRF-amide-immunoreactivity is abolished by preabsorption of the antiserum with homologous antigen, but not eliminated completely by pretreatment with appropriate antigens (NPY, avian pancreatic polypeptide and methionine-enkephalin-Arg-Phe). In contrast, the NPY-immunoreactivity was blocked by pretreatment of the antiserum with NPY, pancreatic polypeptide or FMRFamide, although no blocking by enkephalin was observed. Accordingly, the present study shows that, in the brown hagfish, FMRFamide-immunoreactive structures in the brain can be recognized by anti-NPY antiserum.
