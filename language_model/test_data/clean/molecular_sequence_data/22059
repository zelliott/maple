The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been long advocated as a model for cancer research, but little is known about the real molecular similarities between zebrafish and human tumors. Comparative analysis of microarray data from zebrafish liver tumors with those from four human tumor types revealed molecular conservation at various levels between fish and human tumors. This approach provides a useful strategy for identifying an expression signature that is strongly associated with a disease phenotype.
