Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes a Vif protein which is important for virus replication and infectivity. Vif is a cytoplasmic protein which exists in both membrane-associated and soluble forms. The membrane-associated form is an extrinsic membrane protein which is tightly associated with the cytoplasmic side of membranes. We have analyzed the mechanism of membrane targeting of Vif and its role in HIV-1 replication. Mutagenesis studies demonstrate that C-terminal basic domains are required for membrane association. Vif mutations which disrupt membrane association also inhibit HIV-1 replication, indicating that membrane localization of Vif is likely to be required for its biological activity in vivo. Membrane binding of Vif is almost completely abolished by trypsin treatment of membranes. These results demonstrate that membrane localization of Vif requires C-terminal basic domains and interaction with a membrane-associated protein(s). This interaction may serve to direct Vif to a specific cellular site, since immunofluorescence staining and plasma membrane fractionation studies show that Vif is localized predominantly to an internal cytoplasmic compartment rather than to the plasma membrane. The mechanism of membrane targeting of Vif is different in some respects from that of other extrinsic membrane proteins, such as Ras, Src, and MARCKS, which utilize a basic domain together with a lipid modification for membrane targeting. Membrane targeting of Vif is likely to play an important role in HIV-1 replication and thus may be a therapeutic target.
