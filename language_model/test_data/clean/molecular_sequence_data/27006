Strain 1a22T, a nitrogen-fixing bacterium, was isolated from soil associated with the rhizosphere of a perennial grass growing in a fallow agricultural field in Ithaca, New York, USA. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence placed the strain in the Rubrivivax-Roseateles-Leptothrix-Azohydromonas-Aquincola-Ideonella branch of the Betaproteobacteria and the closest characterized relative was the type strain of Ideonella dechloratans (97.7% 16S rRNA sequence similarity). Cells of strain 1a22T were Gram-negative, motile, straight rods, which formed polyhydroxybutyrate-like granules and were positive for oxidase and weakly positive for catalase. Cells were chemo-organotrophic, unable to grow by reduction of chlorate or nitrate and grew exclusively through aerobic respiration. Growth with mannitol on N-free solid media caused the strain to produce copious amounts of slime. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 67.4 mol%. The major cellular fatty acids were C16:1 cis-9 and C16:0 and cells contained significant amounts of the hydroxy fatty acids C10:0 3-OH, C12:0 2-OH and C12:0 3-OH. Based on DNA-DNA hybridization studies, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, fatty acid analysis, and morphological and physiological characteristics, strain 1a22T represents a novel species in the genus Ideonella, for which the name Ideonella azotifigens sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Ideonella azotifigens is 1a22T (=JCM 15503T=DSM 21438T).
