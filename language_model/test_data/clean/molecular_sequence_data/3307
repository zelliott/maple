This report describes the genetic and antigenic variability of bovine viral diarrhea virus strains isolated in Belgium. Part of the 5' untranslated region and the 5' end of the gp53 (E2) coding sequence were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most field isolates segregated into genotypes Ib or II. Only one out of 28 field isolates belonged to genotype Ia. Interestingly, some type I strains were equally divergent from types Ia and Ib strains and clustered into additional subtypes within genotype I. Immune sera from young calves experimentally inoculated with field isolates first identified on the basis of their sequences were used in two-way neutralisation experiments. The results clearly differentiated type I from type II strains although some degree of cross-neutralisation was observed. Within type I, the new clusters could not be antigenically differentiated from the more prevalent type Ib strains or from type Ia strain NADL, suggesting that BVDV genotype I is antigenically homogeneous. The isolation of BVDV types I and II strains from cell lines and from a bovine vaccine suggest that molecular epidemiology surveillance is warranted for BVDV.
