We have raised mouse monoclonal antibodies to eight synthetic peptides corresponding to different regions of the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and rabbit polyclonal antisera to beta-galactosidase fusion proteins which encompass three different regions of CFTR. Immunoblot, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and immunocytochemical experiments demonstrate that, in addition to recognising CFTR, these antibodies recognise one or more immunologically related proteins with a similar molecular mass, calcium responsiveness and tissue distribution to CFTR.
