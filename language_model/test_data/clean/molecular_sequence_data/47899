Members of the spirochete genus Borrelia carry numerous linear DNA replicons with covalently closed hairpin telomeres. The genome of one member of this genus, B. burgdorferi B31, has now been completely characterized and contains a linear chromosome, twelve linear plasmids and nine circular extra-chromosomal elements. The phylogenetic position of the Borrelia spirochetes strongly suggests that a progenitor with circular replicons acquired the ability to replicate linear DNA molecules.
