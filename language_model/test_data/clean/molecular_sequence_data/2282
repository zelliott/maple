As an alternative to microscopic identification of Entamoeba histolytica parasites isolated from stool, a sensitive and species-specific DNA hybridization probe was made for rapid diagnosis of E. histolytica parasites in clinical samples directly applied to nylon membranes. The DNA hybridization probe was made by screening a genomic library of a virulent HM-1:IMSS strain of E. histolytica to detect recombinant plasmids containing highly repeated parasite DNA sequences. Four plasmid clones that reacted across Entamoeba species coded for highly repeated rRNA genes of E. histolytica. Four other plasmid clones were E. histolytica specific in that they bound to four axenized and nine xenic strains of E. histolytica but did not recognize closely related E. histolytica-like Laredo, Entamoeba moshkovskii, or Entamoeba invadens parasites. The diagnostic clones detected as few as eight cultured amoebae and did not distinguish between pathogenic and nonpathogenic zymodemes of E. histolytica. The diagnostic clones were sequenced and contained 145-base-pair sequences which appear to be tandemly repeated in the genome. No stable transcript which is homologous to the diagnostic DNA was detected. In a study of stool samples from Mexico City shown by microscopy to contain E. histolytica, Entamoeba coli, Giardia lamblia, Endolimax nana, Trichuris trichiuria, and Chilomastix mesnili parasites, the DNA hybridization probe demonstrated a sensitivity of 1.0 and a specificity of 0.93. We conclude that the DNA hybridization probe can be used for rapid and accurate diagnosis of E. histolytica parasites.
