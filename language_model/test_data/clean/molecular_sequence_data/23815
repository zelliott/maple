To obtain antigenic genes encoding newborn larvae antigens of Trichinella spiralis.

Newborn larvae (NBL) cDNA library of Trichinella spiralis was screened using the infected swine serum and positive clones were sequenced and analysed.

158 positive clones were obtained from 4.5 x 10(5) recombinant clones by immunoscreening. The sequence analysis of positive clones showed that there are 36 novel cDNAs, 5 reported cDNAs and 12 cDNAs without the ORF showing high similarity to the mitochondrial DNA of Trichinella spiralis.

Some cDNAs encoding antigenic protein of newborn larvae of Trichinella spiralis were obtained.
