Two polypeptides, eristocophins I and II, have been characterized from leaf-nosed viper (Eristocophis macmahoni) venom. They contain 10 half-Cys residues of a total of 61/62 residues, have 72% residue identity, and exhibit similarities to platelet aggregation inhibitors and segments of adhesive proteins. Eristocophin I contains the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp, known to inhibit fibrinogen interaction with the platelet receptor. Eristocophin II has Met instead of Arg in this sequence, and an adjacent Trp-Asn-Asp segment. The latter is also typical of adhesive proteins, thus linking two potentially functional segments in one molecule. Exchanges are maximal in these segments, suggesting that the polypeptides exhibit functional divergence with isoform differences in important regions.
