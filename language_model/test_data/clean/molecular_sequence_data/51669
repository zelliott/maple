Rotary shadowing/electron microscopy of chondroitin 6-sulphate (CS6) and 4-sulphate (CS4) showed that the former, but not the latter, aggregated to mesh works. Preparations made from salt (ammonium acetate) solutions showed enhanced aggregation. Computer modelling, using molecular mechanics and dynamics, was applied to secondary structures (twofold helices) derived from NMR studies, to determine geometric and energetic constraints on duplex and higher-aggregate formation. The calculations suggested that chondroitin, CS6 and undersulphated CS4 could form duplexes, while CS4 could not, thus bridging the gap between atomic dimensions (NMR) and high polymer scale (electron microscopy). Calculations suggested that water structure helped to stabilise the twofold helix. It is proposed that the twofold helical, flat, tape-like molecules aggregate via hydrophobic bonding between the very extensive hydrophobic patches (9 CH units) repeated on alternating sides of the polymers. The negative charge of the polyanions opposes aggregate formation. Calculations showed that duplexes were formed with decreasing stability as the charge density increased, and as the charge was concentrated towards the centre line of the polymer (i.e. in CS4). The unsulphated polymer chondroitin could form duplexes and higher aggregates as readily as hyaluronan. Hyaluronan was calculated to form stable heteroduplexes with CS6 and CS4. The frequency and positioning of the sulphate-ester group within the polymer thus determines whether the molecule participates in duplex formation.
