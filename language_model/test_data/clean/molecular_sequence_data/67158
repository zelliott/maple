In Pichia pastoris, coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicles form at discrete transitional ER (tER) sites. Analyzing COPII coat proteins in this yeast will help to reveal the mechanisms of tER organization. Here, we show that like Saccharomyces cerevisiae, P. pastoris contains essential SEC23 and SEC24 genes, as well as the non-essential SEC24 homolog LST1. In addition, P. pastoris contains a novel non-essential SEC23 homolog that we have designated SHL23. The products of all four genes are concentrated at tER sites. Deletion of SHL23 does not disrupt tER morphology. As judged by two-hybrid analysis, Sec23p associates with both Sec24p and Lst1p, whereas Shl23p associates selectively with Lst1p. These results suggest that P. pastoris COPII vesicles contain an Shl23p/Lst1p complex that is absent in S. cerevisiae.
