Activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) by inflammatory cytokines requires the successive action of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) and IkappaB kinase-alpha (IKK-alpha). A widely expressed protein kinase was identified that is 52 percent identical to IKK-alpha. IkappaB kinase-beta (IKK-beta) activated NF-kappaB when overexpressed and phosphorylated serine residues 32 and 36 of IkappaB-alpha and serines 19 and 23 of IkappaB-beta. The activity of IKK-beta was stimulated by tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 treatment. IKK-alpha and IKK-beta formed heterodimers that interacted with NIK. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive form of IKK-beta blocked cytokine-induced NF-kappaB activation. Thus, an active IkappaB kinase complex may require three distinct protein kinases.
