We cloned and sequenced a 3296-bp cDNA encoding the rat Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP). Comparison of the nucleotide (nt) and deduced amino acid (aa) sequences to those of previously described GAP cDNAs revealed greater than 90% identity. Homology is highest between rat and mouse GAP both at the nt (96% identity) and deduced aa levels (98% identity).
