Ten peptides with differential growth-inhibitory activity against the gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, the gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli, and the yeast Candida albicans were isolated from an extract of the skin of a North American frog, the green frog Rana clamitans. Ranatuerin-1C (SMLSVLKNLGKVGLGLVACKINKQC), ranalexin-1Ca (FLGGLMKAFPALICAVTKKC), ranalexin-1Cb (FLGGLMKAFPAIICAVTKKC), ranatuerin-2Ca (GLFLDTLKGAAKDVAGKLLEGLKCKIAGC KP), and ranatuerin-2Cb (GLFLDTLKGLAGKLLQGLKCIKAGCKP), are members of three previously characterized families of antimicrobial peptides, first identified in the North American bullfrog Rana catesbeiana. In addition, five structurally related peptides (temporin-1Ca, -1Cb, -1Cc, -1Cd, and -1Ce), comprising 13 amino acid residues and containing a C-terminally alpha-amidated residue, belong to the temporin family first identified in the European common frog Rana temporaria. Peptides belonging to the brevinin-1, brevinin-2, esculentin-1, and esculentin-2 families, previously isolated from the skins of Asian and European Ranid frogs, were not identified in the extract. The data support the hypothesis that the distribution and amino acid sequences of the skin antimicrobial peptides are valuable tools in the identification and classification of Ranid frogs.
