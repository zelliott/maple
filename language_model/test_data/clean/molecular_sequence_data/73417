The amphibian intestine has two morphologically distinct structures during development. Early embryogenesis generates a simple, tube-like intestine in the tadpole whereas after thyroid hormone (T3)-dependent metamorphosis a newly remodeled adult intestine is formed similar to that of higher vertebrates. This change requires a drastic transformation of the epithelial layer We have isolated a Na+/PO4 3- cotransporter gene that may contribute to this transformation. The deduced amino acid sequence of this gene shows a high degree of homology to the mammalian renal Na+/PO4 3- cotransporters, which have little or no expression in organs other than the kidney. The frog gene is highly expressed and regulated by T3 in the intestine with little expression and/or regulation by T3 in most other organs. Its mRNA is restricted to the differentiated epithelial cells both in tadpoles and postmetamorphic frogs. Interestingly, its expression is low in premetamorphic tadpoles, but up-regulated when metamorphosis is initiated by endogenous T3. As the larval epithelium undergoes programmed cell death (apoptosis), the mRNa level drops to a minimum. Subsequently, the gene is reactivated at the tip region of the newly formed adult intestinal folds and a crest-trough polarity of expression is established by the end of metamorphosis. This temporal regulation profile is also reproduced when premetamorphic tadpoles are treated with T3 to induce precocious intestinal remodeling. These results suggest a possible role of the Na+/PO 4 3- cotransporter during metamorphosis and demonstrate that the adult epithelial cell differentiation pattern is established in the direction of crest-to-trough of the intestinal fold, concurrent with the epithelial morphogenic process.
