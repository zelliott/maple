Algal triacylglycerol biosynthesis is of increasing interest for potential biodiesel production. A model microalga, Chlamydomonas, has multiple isoforms of diacylglycerol acyltransferase type 2 (DGTT) catalyzing the final step of triacylglycerol biosynthesis; however, the functions of the isoforms are poorly understood. Here, we performed heterologous complementation assay of Chlamydomonas DGTT1 to 4 in a yeast mutant defective in triacylglycerol biosynthesis. DGTT1, 2 and 3 but not 4 complemented the phenotype, including triacylglycerol levels. Interestingly, complementation by DGTT2 increased triacylglycerol content by 9-fold.
