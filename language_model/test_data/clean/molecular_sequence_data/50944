The large-scale purification of the anti-gibberellin monoclonal antibody, MAC 182, is described. N-Terminal amino acid sequences of the heavy and light chains were determined and compared with those of known antibodies. Fab-fragments were prepared and purified to a state suitable for crystallization.
