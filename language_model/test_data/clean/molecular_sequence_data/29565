Asexual individuals of the green alga Volvox carteri consist of two cell types, somatic and reproductive cells. The somatic cells are terminally differentiated post-mitotic cells which undergo gradual senescence leading to cell death in every generation. To understand the gene expression programs associated with senescence of somatic cells, we cloned two cDNAs, LSG1 and LSG2, that are preferentially expressed during this late developmental stage. These two cDNAs were deduced to encode Pro-rich motifs characteristic of extensin proteins that are components of the extracellular matrix. LSG1 also resembled genes encoding plant pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR-1), while LSG2 showed similarities with genes encoding matrix metalloproteinases, including a gamete lytic enzyme of Chlamydomonas. We also found that S9, one of the late somatic cDNAs previously cloned by Tam and Kirk (Dev. Biol. 145 (1991) 51), was deduced to encode a protein with a composition similar to LSG2. The expression of PR-1 and a matrix-metalloproteinase-encoding gene has been shown to be induced during senescence in higher plants. These results indicate that some of the late somatic genes in V. carteri are related to the senescence-associated genes in higher plants.
