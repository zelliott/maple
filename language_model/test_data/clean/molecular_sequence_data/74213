The detection of gametocytes in human peripheral blood is one of the most important measures in a malaria survey. We attempted to detect gametocytes of Plasmodium falciparum by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of dried blood on filter paper. On field samples analysis, the specific RT-PCR products for region 3 of pfg377 mRNA were observed in 67 of 131 falciparum malaria patients. The minimum detection level of RT-PCR-positive samples was 0.03 gametocytes/microl on quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Gametocyte positive rate was not dependent on sex or age. A higher frequency of gametocytes was found in single P. falciparum infection than in mixed species infection (P<0.01). In this study, 47 of the 131 patients were asymptomatic. Eighteen of these 47 patients showed pfg377 mRNA expression. Moreover, four alleles of region 3 of pfg377 were detected in pfg377 mRNA-positive patients and 13 of 67 pfg377 mRNA-positive patients carried more than one gametocyte-producing clone. These results suggest that dried blood on filter paper is a useful for a molecular epidemiologic study of malaria transmission and gametocyte-targeted control.
