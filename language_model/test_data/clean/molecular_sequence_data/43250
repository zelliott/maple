Among the three characterized subunits comprising the signal peptidase complex of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sec11p, Spc1p, and Spc2p), only Sec11p is essential for cell growth, signal peptide cleavage, and signal peptidase-dependent protein degradation. Here we report the cloning of the SPC3 gene encoding the homolog to mammalian signal peptidase subunit SPC22/23. We find that Spc3p is also required for cell growth and signal peptidase activity within the yeast endoplasmic reticulum.
