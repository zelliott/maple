The complete structure of the mouse lactoferrin gene is presented. Mouse lactoferrin (mLF) is encoded by a single copy gene of approximately 30 kilobases (kb) in size. The gene is organized into 17 exons separated by 16 introns. The exons range in size from 48 base pairs (bp) to 190 bp whereas the introns range from 0.2 kb to 4.3 kb. Structural analysis of the mouse lactoferrin gene reveals that this gene shares a similar intron-exon distribution pattern with both human transferrin and chicken ovotransferrin.
