We report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA from mouse thymus encoding the murine homolog of the protein product of the Syrian hamster Pcph proto-oncogene. The single open reading frame identified in the cDNA sequence encoded a protein predicted to have 428 amino acids, which shared 93.7% amino acid identity with the Syrian hamster Pcph within the first 412 residues but had a shorter, highly dissimilar C-terminus. Northern and western analyses revealed that Pcph mRNA and protein were widely distributed in mouse embryo and adult tissues, with the highest expression in adults detected in kidney and liver. The mouse Pcph proto-oncogene was mapped by linkage analysis to within 3.3+/-2.3 cM of Pkch-rs1 on chromosome 12. These data should prove valuable in designing studies to define the cellular function of the Pcph proto-oncogene.
