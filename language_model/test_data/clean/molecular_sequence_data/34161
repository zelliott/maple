A rare genotype G6P[9] was identified in two human group A rotavirus strains designated as KF14 and KF17, that were detected in stool specimens from children with diarrhea in Japan. VP7 gene sequences of these two strains were identical and genetically closely related to G6 human rotavirus strains reported in European countries and the United States. To our knowledge, this is the first report of detection of a G6 human rotavirus in Japan. For further genetic analysis to elucidate the origin of the G6 rotavirus, nearly full-length sequences of all 11 RNA segments were determined for the KF17 strain. The complete genomic constellation of KF17 was determined as G6-P[9]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T3-E3-H3, a novel genotype constellation for human rotavirus. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that VP6, VP1-3, and NSP2 genes of KF17 clustered with bovine-like G6 human strains and some animal strains into sub-lineages distinct from those of common DS-1-like G2 human rotaviruses. On the other hand, KF17 genes encoding VP4, NSP1, and NSP3-5 showed high sequence identities to the human G3P[9] strain AU-1, and clustered with AU-1 and some feline strains within the same lineage. These findings suggested that the G6P[9] human rotavirus detected in Japan may have occurred through reassortment among uncommon bovine-like human rotaviruses and human/feline AU-1-like rotaviruses.
