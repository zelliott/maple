The gene coding for the phaseolotoxin-insensitive ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OCTase) from Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola has been cloned and sequenced. The gene has a deduced coding capacity for a polypeptide with a calculated Mr of 36,520 daltons. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the OCTase enzymes encoded by the P. aeruginosa argF and the Escherichia coli argI and argF genes with the deduced sequence of the newly identified gene shows that 79 amino acid residues are strictly conserved in all four polypeptides; among these 7 out of 9 residues are involved in enzyme function. Of three amino acid regions that have been implicated in substrate binding or catalysis, two are strictly conserved, and the third involved in carbamoylphosphate binding differs. This correlates well with published data showing that phaseolotoxin competes for the carbamoylphosphate binding site in the phaseolotoxin-sensitive OCTases. We propose that the gene be named argK.
