The origins of fungal group I introns within nuclear small-subunit (nSSU) rDNA are enigmatic. This is partly because they have never been reported in basal fungal phyla (Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota), which are hypothesized to be ancestral to derived phyla (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). Here we report group I introns from the nSSU rDNA of two zygomycete fungi, Zoophagus insidians (Zoopagales) and Coemansia mojavensis (Kickxellales). Secondary structure analyses predicted that both introns belong to the IC1 subgroup and that they are distantly related to each other, which is also suggested by different insertion sites. Molecular phylogenetic analyses indicated that the IC1 intron of Z. insidians is closely related to the IC1 intron inserted in the LSU rDNA of the basidiomycete fungus Clavicorona taxophila, which strongly suggests interphylum horizontal transfer. The IC1 intron of C. mojavensis has a low phylogenetic affinity to other fungal IC1 introns inserted into site 943 of nSSU rDNA (relative to E. coli 16S rDNA). It is noteworthy that this intron contains a putative ORF containing a His-Cys box motif in the antisense strand, a hallmark for nuclear-encoded homing endonucleases. Overall, molecular phylogenetic analyses do not support the placement of these two introns in basal fungal IC1 intron lineages. This result leads to the suggestion that fungal IC1 introns might have invaded or been transferred laterally after the divergence of the four major fungal phyla.
