The Helicobacter pylori genome encodes four penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). PBPs 1, 2, and 3 exhibit similarities to known PBPs. The sequence of PBP 4 is unique in that it displays a novel combination of two highly conserved PBP motifs and an absence of a third motif. Expression of PBP 4, but not PBP 1, 2, or 3, is significantly increased during mid- to late-log-phase growth.
