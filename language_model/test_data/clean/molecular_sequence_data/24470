This study was aimed to identify lentil (Lens culinaris subsp. culinaris) convicilin genes and to carry out a comparative analysis of these genes in the tribe Vicieae. Convicilins differ from vicilins, a related group of plant seed storage proteins, mainly by the presence of an additional sequence of amino acids in the sequence corresponding to the first exon, referred as the N-terminal extension. A single gene for convicilin, a component of legume seed storage proteins, was identified in the cultivated lentil. In this species, the N-terminal extension is formed by a stretch of 126 amino acids of which 59.2% are charged amino acids: 29.6% glutamic acid, 3.2% aspartic acid, 14.4% arginine, 8.8% lysine, and 3.2% histidine. This lentil convicilin sequence is similar to the sequence of convicilins in other species of the tribe Vicieae. However, the size of the N-terminal extension clearly differs among convicilins. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analyses including convicilin and vicilin of Vicieae species indicated that the differentiation between vicilins and convicilins predated the differentiation of the two vicilin gene families (47- and 50-kDa vicilins), and that the N-terminal extension evolved mainly by a series of duplications of short internal sequences and triplet expansions, the predominant one being GAA.
