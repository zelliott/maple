The Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) was used to isolate large numbers of low temperature-induced genes from the cold-treated winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Dongbori). One hundred and sixty blti (barley low temperature-induced) cDNA clones were obtained. Northern blot analyses showed that several blti clones were differentially expressed by treatment of low temperature, NaCl, dehydration and ABA. One of the clones, blti2, was induced from 3 to 72 h after cold treatment while its transcript was detected only at 12 h after ABA treatment, indicating that the expression of blti2 by low temperature was regulated by an ABA-independent pathway. The full-length cDNA sequences were 944 nucleotides long and the open reading frame consisted of 492 nucleotides encoding 164 amino acids. Nucleotide sequences showed no sequence homology with the previously reported low temperature-responsive (LTR) barley genes, and the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that the blti2 contains three membrane-spanning regions. These results suggest that blti2 is a novel transmembrane protein induced by low temperature.
