The entire nef gene sequence of HIV-2, NIH-Z strain, has been cloned into the pJL6 expression vector and used for the synthesis of a 23-kDa protein in E. coli. The expressed protein is a fusion between the N-terminal 13 amino acids of the cII gene, 8 amino acids resulting from the ligation procedure, and the 180 amino acids that comprise the HIV-2 Nef sequence from the NIH-Z strain. The bacterially expressed Nef protein has been purified to apparent homogeneity on analytical scale (10-20 micrograms) by a combination of sequential detergent extraction, gel filtration, and reversed-phase high-performance chromatography. The expressed Nef protein is highly susceptible to proteolysis (chymotryptic-like activity) and this property accounts for the low yield obtained by gel filtration and RP-HPLC. Larger amounts (> 100 micrograms) of the purified Nef protein have been produced by a purification procedure that employs sequential detergent extraction, chromatography on Q-Sepharose in the presence of 7 M urea, and chromatography on hydroxylapatite, also in 7 M urea. The purified HIV-2 Nef protein has been used for the production of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. The milder method of purification should facilitate structure-function studies of the Nef protein and its role in the life cycle of HIV.
