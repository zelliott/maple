Two polysaccharides were isolated from the basidiomycete Flammulina velutipes, via successive hot extraction with water, 2% and 25% aq. KOH, and then submitted to freeze-drying. The precipitate formed by repeated freeze-thawing from the 2% aq. KOH extraction PK2 was analyzed by determination of its monosaccharide composition, as well as by methylation analyses using GC-MS, mono- ((13)C, (1)H NMR) and bidimensional ((1)H (obs.), (13)C HMQC) spectroscopy, and controlled Smith degradations. It was established to be a branched beta-glucan, with a main chain of (1-->3)-linked-Glcp residues, substituted at O-6 by single-unit beta-Glcp side chains. The precipitate formed by repeated freeze-thawing from the 25% KOH extraction PK25 contained Xyl, Man, and Glc and was heterogeneous by HSPEC and extraction with DMSO gave a soluble xylomannan (XM). It was homogeneous with a molar mass 30.8 x 10(4)g/mol (dn/dc=0.186). Using the above chemical analyses, it was a xylomannan with Man and Xyl in a 3:2 molar ratio. Its main chain consisted of (1-->3)-linked alpha-Manp units, mainly substituted at O-4 by beta-Xylp units or with some beta-Xylp-(1-->3)-beta-Xylp groups.
