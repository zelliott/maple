The polysaccharides obtained from the alkali-extractable, water-soluble fraction (F1SS) from the cell wall of Myrothecium verrucaria and Myrothecium atroviride were shown to be composed of beta-(1-->6)-galactofuranose fully substituted at O-2 by terminal residues of alpha-glucopyranose and alpha-glucuronic acid. Glucuronic acid was substituted at O-4 by glucopyranose in the Myrothecium species M. inundatum, M. setiramosum, M. prestonii, M. tongaense and M. roridum. The acidic polysaccharides from Phaeostilbella atra (=Myrothecium atrum) and Myrothecium gramineum lacked the backbone of 2,6 di-O-substituted galactofuranose and contained a high amount of O-5-substituted beta-galactofuranose. The structures of the polysaccharides isolated from Myrothecium cinctum and Myrothecium penicilloides were unrelated to each other and to the polysaccharides from the other species analysed. The usefulness of these polysaccharides as a characteristic for delimitation of the genus Myrothecium is discussed.
