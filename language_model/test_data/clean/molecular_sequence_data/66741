2-DE remains the most popular and versatile protein separation method among a rapidly growing array of various proteomics technologies. However, variability in sample processing, experimental design and data analyses results in a limited cross-validation between studies performed in different laboratories. One of the goals of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) is to establish standards and guidelines for proteomics studies. We contributed to the HUPO Brain Proteome Project by analyzing brains from neonatal and adult mice using 2-DE. Here we propose a standard workflow to analyze 2-DE images and extract statistically significant differences. After differential analysis and identification by MALDI-TOF/TOF, dihydropyrimidinase-related proteins, brain FABP, stathmin, isocitrate dehydrogenase, gamma enolase, annexin V, glutamine synthetase, creatine kinase B chain, triosephosphate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase were found differentially expressed between the two groups. The functions and potential mechanisms underlying the variation observed for these proteins are discussed.
