This study sought to clarify the responsible chemotactic factor for neutrophils in allergic inflammation in rats. When the leukocytes collected from the pouch fluid 4 h after injection of the antigen solution into the air pouch were incubated, the neutrophil chemotactic activity in the conditioned medium increased time-dependently with higher levels for the leukocytes from the immunized rats than the nonimmunized ones. The chemotactic activity did not result from cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC) because CINC concentrations in the conditioned medium were low. Neutrophil chemotactic factors in the conditioned medium were separated by isoelectric focusing into two factors, leukocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor (LDNCF)-1 and LDNCF-2. The activity of LDNCF-2 was more than 75% of the total chemotactic activity in the conditioned medium. LDNCF-2 was purified by gel chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC. The N-terminal amino acid sequence (1-20) of the purified LDNCF-2 was identical to the 32-51 amino acid sequence of the pro-form of rat macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2. Higher levels of MIP-2 mRNA in the leukocytes from the immunized rats than that from the non-immunized rats were proved by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In vivo, concentrations of CINC in the pouch fluid were low, and did not represent the chemotactic activity in the pouch fluid. These results suggest that LDNCF-2 (MIP-2) is an important chemotactic factor for neutrophils in the allergic inflammation in rats.
