Fourteen fragments and structural analogues of chemokine MCP-1 were synthesized using the Fmoc strategy of solid phase peptide synthesis. The effect of synthesized peptides on the MCP-1-stimulated migration of mononuclear cells was examined. Both in vitro stimulants and inhibitors of the monocyte migration were found among the peptides. A possible participation of the C-terminal part of the MCP-1 molecule in the inhibition of the MCP-1-stimulated cell migration was found for the first time.
