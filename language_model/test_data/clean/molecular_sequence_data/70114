The chloramphenicol resistance gene (pp-cat) was cloned from a transferable R plasmid of Pasteurella piscicida, pSP9351, and the sequence of the gene was determined. Subcloning and deletion analysis localized the resistance gene, pp-cat, to within a 2.3 kb HincII-BamHI fragment. The fragment as a probe hybridized with the type I chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene and did not hybridize to CAT types II, III, and CAT-VA. The fragment hybridized to transferable R plasmids encoded with resistance to chloramphenicol, which were detected from P. piscicida isolated in different years. Nucleotide sequences of the coding and flanking regions of pp-cat (2031 bp) identified an open reading frame coding type I CAT of a molecular mass of about 25,000 Da. Comparison analysis of the sequences outside the cat open reading frame showed also that pp-cat has homology, in part, with the gene that coding for the endonuclease EcoRII and those that flank the cat gene derived from the Acinetobacter baumannii chromosome.
