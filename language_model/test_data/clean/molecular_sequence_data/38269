Recent progress in understanding visual signal transduction in retinal cells is summarized. The roles of particular proteins in activation, amplification and termination of the photoresponse are described. Detailed information on the structure and function of the photoreceptor protein rhodopsin is presented. The latest data on visual pigment sequences, rhodopsin mutations in the autosomal-dominant retinitis pigmentosa, and the results of site-directed mutagenesis of the rhodopsin molecule are summarized.
