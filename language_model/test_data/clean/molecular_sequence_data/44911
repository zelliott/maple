IS511 is an endogenous insertion sequence (IS) of the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus strain CB15 and it is the first Caulobacter IS to be characterized at the molecular level. We determined the 1266-bp nucleotide sequence of IS511 and investigated its genetic organization, relationship to other ISs, and transposition properties. IS511 belongs to a distinct branch of the IS3 family that includes ISR1, IS476, and IS1222, based on nucleotide sequence similarity. The nucleotide sequence of IS511 encodes open reading frames (orfs) designated here as orfA and orfB, and their relative organization and amino acid sequences of the predicted protein products are very similar to those of orfAs and orfBs of other IS3 family members. Nuclease S1 protection assays identified an IS511 RNA, and its 5' end maps approximately 16 nucleotides upstream of orfA and about six nucleotides downstream of a sequence that is similar to the consensus sequence of C. crescentus housekeeping promoters. Evidence is presented that IS511 is capable of precise excision from the chromosome, and transposition from the chromosome to a plasmid. Transpositional insertions of IS511 occurred within sequences with a relatively high G + C content, and they were usually, but not always, flanked by a 4-bp direct repeat that matches a sequence at the site of insertion. We also determined the nucleotide sequence flanking the four endogenous IS511 elements that reside in the chromosome of C. crescentus. Our findings demonstrate that IS511 is a transposable IS that belongs to a branch of the IS3 family.
