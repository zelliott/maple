The amino acid sequences of the HA(1) portion of the haemagglutinin of two equine A(H3N8) influenza viruses isolated in France in 1993 and 1998 were analysed to determine their evolutionary relationship with 51 other HA(1) amino acid sequences available in databanks. Our data show that the French strain isolated in 1993 belongs to a group of phylogenetically related viruses branched on the main trunk, illustrating the main lineage of evolution of the equine-2 H3 sequences before its split into two distinct lineages in the late 1980s. By contrast, the 1998 French isolate appears to belong to the more recent 'Eurasian' lineage. These data suggest that equine-2 strains antigenically related to old prototype viruses may cocirculate with the more recent 'Eurasian' and 'American' lineages. In conclusion, it may be necessary to include both strains representative of recent equine influenza variants and an older prototype strain in the current equine influenza vaccines.
