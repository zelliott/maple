The hereditary red cell enzymopathies are an uncommon but important cause of chronic haemolytic anaemia. Their clinical diversity is mirrored by increasingly evident heterogeneity at the molecular level. The structure, function, and expression of the genes encoding red cell enzymes and the nature of the gene defects in the deficient state are examined.
