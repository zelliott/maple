Pathogenic Yersinia express a complex array of iron-regulated functions and possess mechanisms for inorganic iron and hemin acquisition. These include a unique temperature-regulated hemin storage system, high-affinity transport processes for hemin and inorganic iron, and an iron-responsive regulatory system controlling gene expression. The genetic organization of these systems illuminates several aspects of iron metabolism in the yersiniae.
