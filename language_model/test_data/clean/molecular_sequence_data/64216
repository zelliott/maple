Valerianaceae is a relatively small (ca. 350 species), but morphologically diverse angiosperm clade. Sequence data from the entire ndhF gene, the trnL-F intergenic spacer region, the trnL intron, the matK region, the rbcL-atpB intergenic spacer region and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA were collected for 21 taxa within Dipsacaceae and Valerianaceae (1 and 20, respectively). These data were included in several phylogenetic analyses with previously published sequences from Dipsacales. Results from these analyses (maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analysis) are in strong agreement with many of the conclusions from previous studies, most importantly: (1) Valerianaceae is sister to Dipsacaceae; (2) Triplostegia is more closely related to species of Dipsacaceae than to Valerianaceae; and (3) Valeriana appears not to be monophyletic, with Valeriana celtica falling outside the remainder of the species of Valeriana sampled here (with very strong support). With the exception of V. celtica, these data support two major clades within Valeriana; one that is exclusively New World and another that is distributed in both the Old and New World. Although the species of Valerianaceae and its sister group Dipsacaceae plus Triplostegia, are widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, and the data imply that Valerianaceae diversified initially in Asia (the Himalayan Patrinia and Nardostachys falling at the base of the clade), the center of modern species diversity for the group is in the Andes of South America with as many as 175 species restricted to that region. Although the exclusively South American taxa form a clade in the chloroplast and combined ITS and chloroplast analyses, support values tend to be low. Future studies will need to include additional data, in the form of both characters and taxa, before any strong conclusions about the character evolution, diversification, and biogeography of the South American valerians can be made.
