Protein kinase C (PKC)-related cDNA clones isolated from mouse epidermis cDNA library encoded a 78-kDa protein, nPKC eta. nPKC eta contains a characteristic cysteine-rich repeat sequence (C1 region) and a protein kinase domain sequence (C3 region), both of which are conserved among PKC family members. However, nPKC eta lacks a putative Ca2+ binding region (C2 region) that is seen in conventional PKCs (alpha, beta I, beta II, gamma), but not in novel PKCs (nPKC delta, -epsilon, -zeta). nPKC eta shows the highest sequence similarity to nPKC epsilon (59.4% identity). The similarity extends to the NH2-terminal sequence (E region) which corresponds to one of the divergent regions (D1 region). Northern blot analysis showed that the mRNA for nPKC eta is highly expressed in the lung and skin but, in contrast to other members of the PKC family, only slightly expressed in the brain. nPKC eta expressed in COS cells shows phorbol ester binding activity with a similar affinity to nPKC epsilon. Antiserum raised against a COOH-terminal peptide of nPKC eta identified an 82-kDa protein in mouse lung extract as well as in an extract from COS cells transfected with the nPKC eta-cDNA expression plasmid. Autophosphorylation of nPKC eta immunoprecipitated with the specific antiserum was observed, indicating that nPKC eta is a protein kinase. These results clearly demonstrate the existence and the possible importance of nPKC eta as a member of the phorbol ester receptor/protein kinase, PKC, family.
