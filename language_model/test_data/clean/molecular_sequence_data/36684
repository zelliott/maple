A fully automated peptide synthesizer has been constructed that is capable of the synthesis of equimolar peptide mixtures and the simultaneous synthesis of 36 individual peptides. The synthesizer was constructed from a workstation of our own design utilizing a Zymark robot arm. A Macintosh II computer coordinates the movements of the robotic arm, the switching of over 40 solenoid valves and the monitoring of sensors in the workstation. The robot hands are used to deliver solvents from pressurized spigot lines and to pipet amino acid solutions from reservoirs to an array of reaction vessels. Liquid dispensing, reagent mixing and solvent removal are controlled from a multifunction I/O board in the computer. The design features of the synthesizer are presented, as well as the characterization of multiple individual peptides, a simple mixture of 19 components, and a complex mixture of 15,625 components.
