High-resolution top-down MS was used to characterize eleven integral and five peripheral subunits of the 750â€‰kDa photosystem II complex from the eukaryotic red alga, Galdieria sulphuraria. The primary separation used LC MS with concomitant fraction collection (LC-MS+), yielding around 40 intact mass tags at 100 ppm mass accuracy on a low-resolution ESI mass spectrometer, whose retention and mass were used to guide subsequent high-resolution top-down nano-electrospray FT ion-cyclotron resonance MS experiments (FT-MS). Both collisionally activated and electron capture dissociation were used to confirm the presence of eleven small subunits to mass accuracy within 5 ppm; PsbE, PsbF, PsbH, PsbI, PsbJ, PsbK, PsbL, PsbM, PsbT, PsbX and PsbZ. All subunits showed covalent modifications that fall into three classes including retention of initiating formyl-methionine, removal of methionine at the N-terminus with or without acetylation, and removal of a longer N-terminal peptide. Peripheral subunits identified by top-down analysis included oxygen-evolving complex subunits PsbO, PsbU, PsbV, as well as Psb28 (PsbW) and Psb27 ("PsbZ-like"). Top-down high-resolution MS provides the necessary precision, typically less than 5 ppm, for identification and characterization of polypeptide composition of these important membrane protein complexes.
