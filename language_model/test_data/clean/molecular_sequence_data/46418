Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules bind antigens in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and deliver them to the cell surface for immune surveillance of viruses and tumors. Whereas key steps of MHC-I assembly and its acquisition of peptides in the ER are relatively well defined, little is known about how MHC-I molecules leave the ER for cell surface expression. Here, we show that ER export of human classical MHC-I molecules (HLA-A/-B/-C) is regulated by their C-terminal single amino acid, valine or alanine. These amino acids, conserved in nearly all known human MHC-I alleles, serve as the ER export signal by binding to the Sec23/24 complex, a structural component of coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicles that mediate ER-to-Golgi trafficking. Together, our results strongly suggest that ER export of human classical MHC-I molecules can occur via a receptor-mediated process dictated by a highly conserved ER export signal.
