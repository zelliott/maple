Recent isolation of the gene for an undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase has disclosed the structures of many kinds of cis-prenyl chain elongating enzymes. Not only the primary structure but also the crystal structure of the cis-prenyltransferase is totally different from those of trans-prenyl chain elongating enzymes. This review covers up to February 2002 and contains 72 references.
