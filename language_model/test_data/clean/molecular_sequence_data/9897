Two new hopene derivatives, 3 beta,6 beta-dihydroxy-21 alpha H-24-norhopa-4(23),22(29)-diene (1) and 3 beta,5 beta-dihydroxy-6 beta-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)oxy]-21 alpha H-24-norhopa-4(23),22(29)-diene (2), together with cleomiscosin B (3) and 5,6-dimethoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin (umckalin), were isolated from the timber of Diatenopteryx sorbifolia. This is the first isolation of the norhopene skeleton from nature. The structures of the isolates were established by spectroscopic analysis.
