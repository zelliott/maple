Chum salmon (oncorhynchus keta) stanniocalcin was purified, partially identified and tested for bioactivity in an assay on the intestinal calcium uptake in a marine teleost (Gadus morhua). Basic ethanol extraction, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography resulted in the isolation of a homogeneous glycoprotein that appears as a 46-kDa product under nonreducing conditions and as a 23-kDa product under reducing conditions after sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The glycoprotein is likely to be a homodimer composed of two subunits of 23 kDa each. Further characterization indicates homology to Australian eel, sockeye salmon, coho salmon and rainbow trout stanniocalcin, and the glycoprotein is thus concluded to be stanniocalcin. Stanniocalcin-like immunoreactivity was demonstrated in the corpuscles of Stannius of the Atlantic cod, with a specific antiserum raised against purified chum salmon stanniocalcin. The physiological importance and the biological activity of chum salmon stanniocalcin was tested by evaluating its effect on intestinal calcium uptake by the Atlantic cod in vitro. The intestine was perfused, both vascularly and through the intestinal lumen, and the calcium mucosa-to-serosa flux was measured using 45Ca2+ as a tracer. Stanniocalcin decreased the intestinal calcium uptake in a dose-related manner by 13.5% and 22.4% at doses of 2.2 and 10.9 nM stanniocalcin, respectively. The results establish the intestine as a target organ for stanniocalcin in marine teleosts.
