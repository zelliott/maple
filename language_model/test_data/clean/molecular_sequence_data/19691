Proteoglycan modification is essential for development and early cell division in Caenorhabditis elegans. The specification of proteoglycan attachment sites is defined by the Golgi enzyme polypeptide xylosyltransferase. Here we evaluate the substrate specificity of this xylosyltransferase for its downstream targets by using reporter proteins containing proteoglycan modification sites from C. elegans syndecan/SDN-1. The N terminus of the SDN-1 contains a Ser-Gly proteoglycan site at Ser(71), flanked by potential mucin and N-glycosylation sites. However, Ser(71) was exclusively used as a proteoglycan site in vivo, based on mapping studies with a Ser(71) reporter protein, glycosyltransferase RNA interference, and co-expression of worm polypeptide xylosyltransferase. To elucidate the substrate requirements of this enzyme, a library of 42 point mutants of the Ser(71) reporter was expressed in tissue culture. The nematode proteoglycan modification site in SDN-1 required serine (not threonine), two flanking glycine residues (positions -1 and +1), and either one proximal acidic N-terminal amino acid (positions -4, -3, and -2) or a pair of distal N-terminal acidic amino acids (positions -6 and -5). C-terminal acidic amino acids, although present in many proteoglycan modification sites, had minimal impact on xylosylation at Ser(71). Proline inhibited glycosylation when present at -1, +1, or +2. The position of glycine, proline, and acidic amino acids allows the glycosylation machinery to discriminate between mucin and proteoglycan modification sites. The key residues that define proteoglycan modification sites also function with the Drosophila polypeptide xylosyltransferase, indicating that the specificity in the glycosylation process is evolutionarily conserved. Using a neural network method, a preliminary proteoglycan predictor has been developed.
