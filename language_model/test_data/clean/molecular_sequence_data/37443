Memory CD4 T-cell responses against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy blood donors with gamma interferon enzyme-linked immunospot (Elispot) assays. RSV-specific responses were detected in every donor at levels varying between 0.05 and 0.3% of CD4 T cells. For all donors tested, a considerable component of the CD4 T-cell response was directed against the fusion (F) protein of RSV. We characterized a set of 31 immunodominant antigenic peptides targeted by CD4 T cells in the context of the most prevalent HLA class II molecules within the Caucasian population. Most antigenic peptides were HLA-DR restricted, whereas two dominant DQ peptides were also identified. The antigenic peptides identified were located across the entire sequence of the F protein. Several peptides were presented by more than one major histocompatibility complex class II molecule. Furthermore, most donors recognized several F peptides. Detailed knowledge about immunodominant antigenic peptides will facilitate the ability to monitor CD4 T-cell responses in patients and the measurement of correlates of protection in vaccinated subjects.
