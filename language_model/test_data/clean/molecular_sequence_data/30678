Two cis-acting elements in the p120 gene play important roles in transcription; the region from -537 to -278 is necessary for initiation of transcription, and the region from -1426 to -1223 is necessary for efficient transcription. The distal element(s) which lies upstream of -278 is required for initiation of transcription.
