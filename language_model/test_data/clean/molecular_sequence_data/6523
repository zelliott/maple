We have isolated the NIL1 gene, whose product is an activator of the transcription of nitrogen-regulated genes, by virtue of the homology of its zinc-finger domain to that of the previously identified activator, the product of GLN3. Disruption of the chromosomal NIL1 gene enabled us to compare the effects of Gln3p and of Nil1p on the expression of the nitrogen-regulated genes GLN1, GDH2, and GAP1, coding respectively for glutamine synthetase, NAD-linked glutamate dehydrogenase, and general amino acid permease. Our results show that the nature of GATAAG sequence that serve as the upstream activation sequence elements for these genes determines their abilities to respond to Gln3p and Nil1p. The results further indicate that Gln3p is inactivated by an increase in the intracellular concentration of glutamine and that Nil1p is inactivated by an increase in intracellular glutamate.
