Programmed cell death is mediated by members of the interleukin 1-beta convertase family of proteases, which are activated in response to diverse cell death stimuli. However, the key substrates of these proteases that are responsible for apoptotic cell death have not been identified. Here we report that the MDM2 oncoprotein is cleaved by members of the CPP32 subfamily of interleukin 1-beta convertase proteases both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in the disappearance of MDM2 from apoptotic cells. Because MDM2 functions as a negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor and because p53 induces apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli, this cleavage of MDM2 by CPP32-like proteases may result in deregulation of p53 and contribute directly to the process of apoptotic cell death.
