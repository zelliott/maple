The headbox water is the main source of bacterial contamination of paper machines. Identification of these bacterial contaminants could be an asset in developing specific control methods. An amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) was carried out to characterize the bacterial communities associated with the headbox water of a paper machine in a Canadian mill in February and July 2006. Eight bacterial genera were identified as the main colonizers present in the headbox water. The genus Meiothermus appeared to be the dominant bacterial group in the Canadian paper machine. Some variation was observed between the February and July clone libraries. Bacterial genera such as Chelatococcus and Hydrogenophilus were only detected in February or in July, respectively. Furthermore, the proportion of Tepidimonas clones in the libraries was higher in July than in February. The metabolic profile of the February and July communities, determined using Biolog EcoPlates, also suggested that temporal variation occurred within the bacterial populations that colonized the headbox of the paper machine.
