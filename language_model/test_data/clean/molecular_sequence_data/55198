DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are cytotoxic lesions that covalently link opposite strands of the DNA helix and block DNA unwinding. ICLs are repaired during and outside S phase, and replication-independent ICL repair (RIR) is critical to maintain genomic integrity and to allow transcription in nondividing or slowly dividing cells. Here, we show that the Y family DNA polymerase kappa (Pol κ) is essential for RIR of a site-specific ICL lesion in Xenopus egg extracts, and that both its catalytic activity and UBZ domains are required for this function. We also demonstrate a requirement for PCNA and its modification on lysine 164. Finally, we show that Pol κ participates in ICL repair in mammalian cells, particularly in G0. Our results identify key components of the RIR pathway and begin to unravel its mechanism.
