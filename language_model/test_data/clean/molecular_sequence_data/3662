The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear receptors activated by fatty acids and their metabolites. The PPARdelta subtype is believed to be involved in lipoprotein regulation and may have a role in reverse cholesterol transport. While the range of biological roles of PPARdelta still remains unclear, it is of therapeutic interest in cardiovascular diseases. Here we report a homogeneous in vitro assay for studying ligand activation of PPARdelta. We surveyed a panel of peptides containing the LXXLL motifs derived from coactivator protein sequences. Peptides with the best response were used to develop a sensitive and homogeneous recruitment assay for PPARdelta. The optimized assay has a signal-to-background ratio of about 8:1 and an assay quality parameter Z'-factor value of 0.8. The assay signal generated is stable for hours to even overnight. This simple recruitment assay can provide agonist and/or antagonist information that cannot be assessed by receptor-binding assay, and can be used for characterization and screening of ligands that modulate the activation of PPARdelta.
