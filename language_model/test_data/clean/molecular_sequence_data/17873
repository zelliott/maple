The physical separation of c-myb coding exons on two different chromosomes, both in chicken and human, indicated that intermolecular recombination events might occur in higher eucaryotes. We present evidence in this paper suggesting that the expression of "antisens" mRNA species could be involved in the regulation of the intermolecular recombination process.
