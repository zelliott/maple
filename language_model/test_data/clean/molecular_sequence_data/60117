The enzyme nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.1) catalyzes the transfer of the adenylyl moiety of ATP to NMN to form NAD. A new purification procedure for NMN adenylyltransferase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae provided sufficient amounts of enzyme for tryptic fragmentation. Through data-base search a full matching was found between the sequence of tryptic fragments and the sequence of a hypothetical protein encoded by the S. cerevisiae YLR328W open reading frame (GenBank accession number U20618). The YLR328W gene was isolated, cloned into a T7-based vector and successfully expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells, yielding a high level of NMN adenylyltransferase activity. The purification of recombinant protein, by a two-step chromatographic procedure, resulted in a single polypeptide of 48 kDa under SDS-PAGE, in agreement with the molecular mass of the hypothetical protein encoded by YLR328W ORF. The N-terminal sequence of the purified recombinant NMN adenylyltransferase exactly corresponds to the predicted sequence. Molecular and kinetic properties of recombinant NMN adenylyltransferase are reported and compared with those already known for the enzyme obtained from different sources.
