During its life cycle, the hypotrichous ciliated protozoan Oxytricha nova transforms a copy of its micronucleus, which contains chromosome-sized DNA, into a macronucleus containing linear, gene-sized DNA molecules. A region of the micronuclear genome has been defined that gives rise to two distinct macronuclear DNA molecules during development. Through analysis of recombinant macronuclear and micronuclear clones, the generation of the two macronuclear DNA molecules was shown to be the result of alternative use of chromosome fragmentation sites. In addition, evidence was obtained that adjacent micronuclear precursors of macronuclear DNA molecules can overlap by a few base pairs. The significance of these findings in relation to developmental chromosome fragmentation is discussed.
