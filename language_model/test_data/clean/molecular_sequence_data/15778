The CYH2 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae containing one 510 bp intron is spliced inefficiently. We have shown previously that a non-conserved sequence within the intron is responsible for this low splicing efficiency. Using synthetic oligonucleotides comprising the identified region we show in this report that a very short region contains the specificity to act negatively on the splicing efficiency of the CYH2 gene. Furthermore, this sequence influences the splicing efficiency only when it is placed close to the 5' splice site of the gene. Investigations with chimeric CYH2/beta-actin genes show that this sequence acts independent from its natural surroundings. We propose that this sequence might interact with splicing factor(s).
