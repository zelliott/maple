The hemoglobin of the Indian false vampire Megaderma lyra contains only one component. In this paper, we are presenting its primary structure. The globin chains were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography and the sequences determined by automatic liquid and gas phase Edman degradation of the chains and their tryptic peptides, as well as of the prolyl-peptides obtained by acid hydrolysis of the Asp-Pro bond in the alpha- and beta-chains. The alpha-chains show 23 and the beta-chains 20 exchanges compared with the human alpha- and beta-chains, respectively. In the alpha-chains, three exchanges involved alpha 1/beta 1 contacts. In the beta-chains one heme-and three alpha 1/beta 1 contacts are exchanged. The functional and systematic aspects of these replacements are discussed.
