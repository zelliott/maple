This paper describes a theoretical method of isolating candidate disease-specific genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based subtractive hybridization and subsequent (Boolean) hybridization of the subtracted library to arrays of chromosome-specific cosmid clones. A specific application of this technique to isolate genes potentially related to Wilson's disease is outlined.
