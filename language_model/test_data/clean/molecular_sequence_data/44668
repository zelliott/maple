In the nontumorous pituitary, GnRH stimulates the release and synthesis of LH and FSH by gonadotroph cells via the GnRH receptor (GnRH-R). Little is known, however, about expression of GnRH and GnRH-R messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in nontumorous pituitary tissue and in adenomas. To learn more about the distribution and regulatory roles of GnRH and its receptor, we investigated the expression of both GnRH and GnRH-R mRNAs in nontumorous human pituitary and in various types of pituitary adenomas using the RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and in situ hybridization in combination with RT-PCR (in situ RT-PCR). Using RT-PCR, GnRH mRNA was found to be expressed in normal human pituitaries and in all types of adenomas. Similarly, GnRH-R mRNA was expressed in nontumorous human pituitaries and in most, but not all, adenomas. These included 5 gonadotroph adenomas, 6 null cell adenomas, 1 of 2 GH-producing tumors, and 1 of 2 ACTH-producing adenomas, but not in the 2 PRL-producing adenomas examined. In situ hybridization studies showed GnRH and GnRH-R mRNAs in all 3 nontumorous pituitaries and in 12 of 33 (36.4%) and 10 of 33 adenomas (30.3%), respectively. Using an indirect in situ RT-PCR technique to increase the sensitivity of the in situ localization, GnRH and GnRH-R mRNAs were detected in 29 (87.9%) and 25 (75.8%) of 33 adenomas, respectively. This is the first report of the localization of GnRH and GnRH-R mRNAs in individual pituitary adenoma cells using in situ RT-PCR. The frequent expression of GnRH and GnRH-R mRNAs in pituitary cells suggests that GnRH has autocrine/paracrine functions in nontumorous and neoplastic pituitary tissues.
