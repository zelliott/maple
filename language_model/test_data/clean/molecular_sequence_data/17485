The amino acid sequence Gly-Ala-Pro-Leu-Arg-Val is predicted by the anticomplementarity hypothesis to be a fibrinogen binding site on human platelet fibrinogen receptors. The peptide Ala-Pro-Leu-Arg-Val binds fibrinogen and inhibits platelet aggregation and clot retraction. The peptide Gly-Ala-Pro-Leu is the shortest sequence within the predicted sequence which potently inhibits the adhesion of platelets to fibrinogen and platelet aggregation. The sequence Gly-Ala-Pro-Leu is present as residues 309-312 in glycoprotein IIb, the alpha-subunit of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex, the fibrinogen receptor. The sequence Gly-Ala-Pro-Leu is present in 4 of 8 integrin alpha-subunits and Gly-Ala-Pro is present in 8 of 8 integrin alpha-subunits.
