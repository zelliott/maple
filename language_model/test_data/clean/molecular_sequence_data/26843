The tumor suppressor p53 regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by transactivating several genes that are critical for these processes. The transcriptional activity of p53 is often regulated by post-translational modifications and its interactions with various transcriptional coactivators. Here we report a physical interaction between the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of p53 and the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of positive cofactor 4 (PC4(CTD)). Using NMR spectroscopy, we showed that residues 35-57 (TAD2) interact with PC4. (15)N,(1)H HSQC and fluorescence competition experiments indicated that TAD binds to the DNA-binding site of PC4. Hepta-phosphorylation of the TAD peptide increased its binding affinity. Computer modeling of the p53N-PC4 complex revealed several important interactions that are reminiscent of those in the single-stranded DNA-PC4 complex. The ubiquitous nature of the acidic transactivation domain of p53 in mediating interactions with several transcription cofactors is also manifested as a DNA mimetic.
