Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are central components of signal transduction pathways induced by mitogens and stresses. They consist of a three-kinase module in which a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) activates a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAP2K), which in turn activates MAPK. The molecular determinants that underlie specific MAP3K-MAP2K interactions are poorly understood. In this study, we examined the interaction between the MAP3K MEKK1 and MKK4, a MAP2K of the JNK pathway. Select point mutations in subdomain X of the catalytic domain of MEKK1 (MEKK1delta) were found to impair the ability of MEKK1delta to bind to and activate MKK4. Such mutations were also found to impair MEKK1delta-induced activation of an AP1 reporter gene. These studies point to a critical role for subdomain X in the interaction of MEKK1 with MKK4.
