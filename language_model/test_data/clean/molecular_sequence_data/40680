The fungal genus Muscodor was erected on the basis of Muscodor albus, an endophytic fungus originally isolated from Cinnamomum zeylanicum. It produces a mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with antimicrobial activity that can be used as mycofumigants. The genus currently comprises five species. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of a new species of Muscodor on the basis of five endophytic fungal strains from leaves of Actinidia chinensis, Pseudotaxus chienii and an unidentified broad leaf tree in the Fengyangshan Nature Reserve, Zhejiang Province, Southeast of China. They exhibit white colonies on potato dextrose agar (PDA) media, rope-like mycelial strands, but did not sporulate. The optimum growth temperature is 25Â°C. The results of a phylogenetic analysis based on four loci (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2, 28S rRNA, rpb2 and tub1) are consistent with the hypothesis that these five strains belong to a single taxon. All five strains also produce volatile chemical components with antimicrobial activity in vitro, which were different from those previously described for other Muscodor species.
