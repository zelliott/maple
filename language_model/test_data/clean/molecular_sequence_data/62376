Lactobacillus plantarum CNRZ 1228 exhibited heme-dependent catalase activity under environmental conditions similar to those encountered during sausage fermentation. The 1,455-bp catalase gene (katL) was cloned and encoded a protein of 484 amino acids. Expression of katL in a heterologous host showed that katL encodes a functional catalase. PCR screening of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria for katL indicated the presence of similar genes in other strains of lactobacilli.
