We have isolated the genes encoding 11 photosystem I (PSI) subunits from Synechococcus sp., from which this reaction center has been crystallized. The recombinant DNAs, including psaA, psaB, psaC, psaD, psaE, psaF, psaI, psaJ, psaK and psaL, were obtained by heterologous hybridization with probes from appropriate cDNAs or genes from spinach and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, or with synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides. Genes psaA/psaB, psaF/psaJ and psaL/psaI are each closely linked. The open reading frames predict polypeptides of 83 kDa (subunits Ia and Ib, encoded by genes psaA and psaB, respectively), 15.4 kDa (II, psaD), 17.7 kDa (III, psaF), 8.4 kDa (IV, psaE), 8.8 kDa (VII, psaC), 4.6 kDa (VIII, psaI), 4.8 kDa (IX, psaJ), 8.5 kDa (X, psaK) and 15.5 kDa (XI, psaL). A novel subunit (XII, psaM) was also identified. Subunits II, III, IV and VII seem to be peripheral, while the others seem to be intrinsic components of the reaction center. These data imply a striking similarity of cyanobacterial and eukaryotic PSI. All subunits studied are encoded by single-copy genes which seem to be transcribed into monocistronic (psaC, psaD, psaC, psaK) or dicistronic (psaA/psaB, psaF/psaJ, psaL/psaI) RNA species. Subunit III is translated as a 17.7-kDa precursor, including a transit peptide of 23 amino acid residues. This is consistent with its location in the thylakoid lumen.
