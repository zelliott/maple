Mycetomal organs attached to the esophagus of hematophagous leeches which are known to harbor endosymbiotic bacteria were removed from three species in the leech family Glossiphoniidae. Anatomical observations indicated that placobdellid mycetomes are paired and caecate, inserting into the esophagus posterior to the proboscis. Light and electron microscopy demonstrated that there is a single layer of mycetome epithelial cells harboring gram-negative rods and that these epithelial cells are ultrastructurally distinct from neighboring esophageal epithelial cells. Fluorescent in situ hybridization with eubacterial and alphaproteobacterial probes localized the bacteria solely to the mycetomes both in adult and in unfed juvenile leeches whereas a gammaproteobacterial probe did not yield a bound fluorescencent signal. DNA was isolated from these tissues and subjected to PCR amplification using bacteria-specific primers for 16S and 23S rDNA. Results from sequencing the amplification products and phylogenetic analysis with other Alphaproteobacteria revealed that the bacteria resident in these organs comprise a new genus of Alphaproteobacteria, Reichenowia n. gen., closely related to the nitrogen-fixing, nodule-forming Rhizobiaceae. The three bacterial strains, though different from each other were each other's closest relatives, suggesting a history of close coevolution with their leech hosts.
