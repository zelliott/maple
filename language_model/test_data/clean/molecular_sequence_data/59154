Type XI collagen is present in small amounts in cartilage, together with small amounts of type IX and type V collagens and large amounts of type II collagen. Here, primers based on the nucleotide sequences of partial human cDNAs and mouse genomic DNAs that were analyzed by other investigators were used to isolate a cDNA for the mouse col11a2 gene. Cosmid clones for the mouse col11a2 gene were isolated, and 12.4 kb of the nucleotide sequences were defined. Analysis of the genomic sequences identified three exons in the mouse gene that were recently shown to undergo alternative splicing (Tsumaki and Kimura, J. Biol. Chem. 270, 2372-2378, 1995; Zhidkova et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270, 94886-9493, 1995). In addition, analysis of the cosmid clones revealed that the 5' end of the mouse col11a2 gene was located head-to-tail with the mouse retinoic X receptor beta gene. RT-PCR assays demonstrated that some transcripts from the retinoic X receptor beta gene extend into the col11a2 gene. Therefore, there may be coordinate expression of the two genes.
