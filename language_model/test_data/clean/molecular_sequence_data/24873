Screening of the TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand/Apo-2L) gene revealed three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3' UTR at nucleotides 1525G/A, 1588G/A, and 1591C/T. Over 50 individuals from each of two populations, Caucasian and African Americans, were genotyped for these three polymorphisms and allele frequencies were determined.
