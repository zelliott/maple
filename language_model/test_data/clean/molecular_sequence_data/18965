The protein nucleobindin-2 (NUCB2) was identified over a decade ago and recently raised great interest as its derived peptide nesfatin-1 was shown to reduce food intake and body weight in rodents. However, the involvement of NUCB2 in feeding behavior has not well been studied in fish. In the present study, we characterized the structure, distribution, and meal responsive of NUCB2A/nesfatin-1 in Ya-fish (Schizothorax prenanti) for the first time. The full length cDNA of Ya-fish was 2140base pair (bp), which encoded a polypeptide of 487 amino acid residues including a 23 amino acid signal peptide. A high conservation in NUCB2 sequences was found in vertebrates, however the proposed propeptide cleavage site (Arg-Arg) conserved among other species is not present in Ya-fish NUCB2A sequence. Tissue distribution analysis revealed that Ya-fish NUCB2A mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in all test tissues, and abundant expression was detected in several regions including the hypothalamus, hepatopancreas, ovary and intestines. NUCB2A mRNA expression respond to feeding status change may vary and be tissue specific. NUCB2A mRNA levels significantly increased (P<0.05) in the hypothalamus and intestines after feeding and substantially decreased (P<0.01) during a week food deprivation in the hypothalamus. Meanwhile, NUCB2A mRNA in the hepatopancreas was significantly elevated (P<0.001) during food deprivation, and a similar increase was also found after short-time fasting. This points toward a potential hepatopancreas specific local role for NUCB2A in the regulation of metabolism during food deprivation. Collectively, these results provide the molecular and functional evidence to support potential anorectic and metabolic roles for NUCB2A in Ya-fish.
