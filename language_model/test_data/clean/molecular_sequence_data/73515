In order to clarify the role of the purine 2-amino group in the recognition of DNA by small molecules we have examined the binding of actinomycin D and echinomycin to artificial DNA molecules asymmetrically substituted with inosine and/or 2,6-diaminopurine (DAP) in one of the complementary strands. These DNAs, prepared by a method based upon PCR, present various potential sites for antibiotic binding, including several containing only a single purine 2-amino group in different configurations. The results show unambiguously that the presence of two 2-amino groups is mandatory for binding of actinomycin D to double-stranded DNA. In the case of echinomycin only one purine 2-amino group is required for remarkably strong binding to the asymmetric TpDAP.TpA dinucleotide step, but the CpDAP.TpI step (which also contains only a single purine-2 amino group) does not afford a binding site. Evidently, removing a 2-amino group (G-->I substitution) is dominant over adding one (A-->DAP substitution). No sequences containing just a single guanine residue are acceptable. The possibility is raised that replacing guanosine with inosine may do more than remove a group endowed with hydrogen bonding capability and interfere with ligand binding in other ways. The new methodology developed to construct asymmetrically substituted DNA substrates for this work provides a novel strategy that should be generally applicable for studying ligand-DNA interactions, beyond the specific interest in drug binding to DNA, and may help to elucidate how proteins and oligonucleotides recognize their target sites.
