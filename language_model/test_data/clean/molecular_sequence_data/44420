Self-incompatibility in Brassica refers to the rejection of self-related pollen and is mediated by a receptor protein kinase localized to the plasma membrane of the stigma epidermis in the flower. The recessive mutation mod eliminates self-incompatibility in the stigma. In mod mutants, self-compatibility was shown to be associated with the absence of transcripts encoded by an aquaporin-related gene. This observation suggests that a water channel is required for the self-incompatibility response of Brassica, which is consistent with the concept that regulation of water transfer from the stigma to pollen is a checkpoint in the early events of pollination in the crucifer family.
