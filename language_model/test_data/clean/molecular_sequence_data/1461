In response to various mitogenic signals, serum response factor (SRF) activates cellular gene expression after binding to its cognate target sequence (CArG box) located within a serum response element (SRE). SRF is particularly important in T cell activation, and we now report that SRF activates basal transcription from the human T-cell leukemia virus-I (HTLV-I) long terminal repeat (LTR). A DNA element, with similarity to the consensus cellular CArG box found in the c-fos promoter centered approximately 120 base pairs upstream from the viral transcription start site, has been identified and named the vCArG box. SRF activation of gene expression from the LTR was localized to the vCArG box, and mutation of this site abolished SRF responsiveness. An oligonucleotide probe containing the vCArG box bound purified SRF, and a complex formed on this probe with nuclear extract was supershifted by anti-SRF antibody. Moreover, a biotinylated probe containing the vCArG box bound SRF in avidin-biotin pull-down assays. Quantitative binding analysis yielded nanomolar affinities for both the viral and cellular CArG boxes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that SRF is resident on the HTLV-I LTR in vivo. These data identify a functional serum response element in the HTLV-I LTR and suggest that SRF may play an important role in regulating basal HTLV-I gene expression in early infection and reactivation from latency.
