Novosphingobium sp. strain PP1Y is a marine bacterium specifically adapted to use fuels as an energy source. We sequenced and assembled its entire genome using the Roche 454 genome sequencer system, which led to the identification of two plasmids and one megaplasmid, besides a 3.9-Mb circular chromosome.
