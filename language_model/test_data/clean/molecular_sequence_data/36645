With direct sequencing of the amplified cDNA, we analysed the transcript and mRNA splicing defect in a common Chinese beta-thalassemia mutant (IVS-II nt. 654 C-->T). The result shows that this mutant gene would not only produce abnormally processed beta-globin mRNA, but also transcribes a small amount of normally spliced mRNA, hence leading to beta+ thalassemia. The method described herein provides a simple and sensitive approach to the studies of gene expression and molecular defects in genetic diseases at transcriptional level.
