We report the development of a new sensitive nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, using primers derived from the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSM) cDNA sequence, to detect an hematogenous spread of prostate adenocarcinoma cells. In 60 patients with a biopsy-proven prostate cancer, PSM and PSA RT-PCR detected circulating prostate cells in 40 and 20 patients, respectively. In pT4 M+ and pT3 M+ disease patients, nested PSM primers detected cells in 28 of 33 patients (85%), whereas nested PSA primers detected cells in 17 of 33 (51%). In patients with organ-confined cancer spread (pT2a and pT2b patients) before radical prostatectomy, nested PSM RT-PCR detected circulating prostatic epithelial cells in 6 of 17 patients (35%), which suggests that an hematogenous spread of prostate cells may occur early in prostate cancer history. Altogether, these results suggest that the detection of PSM-expressing cells in blood may predict the development of cancer in patients without clinically apparent prostate cancer. Nevertheless, the potential application and the clinical significance of detection of hematogenous prostate cells through the use of nested PSM primers need an extensive longitudinal study.
