Most lung cancer patients are unfortunately uncurable and die because of widespread metastases, thus indicating the importance of identification of molecules with a crucial role in this process. Our previous expression profiling analysis of a highly metastatic lung cancer cell line, NCI-H460-LNM35, and its parental low metastatic line, NCI-H460-N15, revealed significant up-regulation of both known and unknown genes in LNM35. In this study, we describe the isolation and detailed characterizations of a novel gene, named CLCP1, which corresponds to one of such expression sequence tags with up-regulated expression in LNM35. The CLCP1 gene was found to encode a protein with 775 amino acids with structural similarities to, but distinct from neuropilins, cell surface receptors for VEGF165 and semaphorins. Notably, CLCP1 was shown to be up-regulated not only in LNM35 in association with its acquisition of metastatic phenotype during in vivo selection, but also in a significant fraction of lung cancers in vivo with high frequency in metastatic lesions, warranting future studies for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of lung cancer metastasis.
