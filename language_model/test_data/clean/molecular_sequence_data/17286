Aerobic granules are self-immobilized aggregates of microorganisms and represent a relatively new form of cell immobilization developed for biological wastewater treatment. In this study, both culture-based and culture-independent techniques were used to investigate the bacterial diversity and function in aerobic phenol- degrading granules cultivated in a sequencing batch reactor. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes demonstrated a major shift in the microbial community as the seed sludge developed into granules. Culture isolation and DGGE assays confirmed the dominance of beta-Proteobacteria and high-G+C gram-positive bacteria in the phenol-degrading aerobic granules. Of the 10 phenol-degrading bacterial strains isolated from the granules, strains PG-01, PG-02, and PG-08 possessed 16S rRNA gene sequences that matched the partial sequences of dominant bands in the DGGE fingerprint belonging to the aerobic granules. The numerical dominance of strain PG-01 was confirmed by isolation, DGGE, and in situ hybridization with a strain-specific probe, and key physiological traits possessed by PG-01 that allowed it to outcompete and dominate other microorganisms within the granules were then identified. This strain could be regarded as a functionally dominant strain and may have contributed significantly to phenol degradation in the granules. On the other hand, strain PG-08 had low specific growth rate and low phenol degradation ability but showed a high propensity to autoaggregate. By analyzing the roles played by these two isolates within the aerobic granules, a functional model of the microbial community within the aerobic granules was proposed. This model has important implications for rationalizing the engineering of ecological systems.
