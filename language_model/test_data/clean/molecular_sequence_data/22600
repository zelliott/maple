Genomic DNA sequence analysis of the uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain CFT073 revealed that besides the fimB and fimE recombinase genes that control the type 1 pilus fim phase switch, there are three additional fimB- and fimE-like genes: ipuA, ipuB, and ipbA. Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences showed that the five recombinases range in sequence similarity from 63 to 70%. An epidemiological survey indicates that ipuA and ipuB are present and linked next to the dsdCXA locus in 24 of 67 uropathogenic E. coli strains but are found in only 1 of 15 normal human fecal isolates. The ipbA sequence located next to the betABIT locus was found in 42 of 67 uropathogenic isolates and 8 of 15 of the commensal strains. We show that two of these recombinases, those encoded by ipuA and ipbA, can function at the type 1 pilus fim switch. In a CFT073 deletion mutant lacking all five recombinase genes, recombinant ipuA or ipbA provided in trans inverted the fim element from the off state to the on state. When a fim OFF CFT073 DeltafimBE mutant was used to infect the urinary tracts of mice, a switch to the fim on state was detected within 24 h in bacteria recovered from urine, the bladder, and the kidneys. A fim OFF CFT073 DeltafimBE ipuB ipbA mutant also demonstrated the ability to switch from the fim off state to the on state during mouse infection. CFT073 recombinase mutants derived from isolates in either the fim on or off state showed a reciprocal relationship for motility. Switches from a nonmotile to a motile phenotype and from a fim on to off genotype were observed in fim ON CFT073 DeltafimBE ipuAB ipbA mutants when ipuA or fimB was provided in trans. Together these results indicate that ipuA has fimB-like on-to-off and off-to-on fim switching activity and that ipbA has the ability to switch fim from the off to the on orientation.
