A new PCR protocol for molecular typing of Haemophilus influenzae serotype e (Hie) was developed. To this end, the sequence of the cap region II of Hie strain ATCC8142 was identified, which was >99% identical to the recently published sequence of Hie isolate 274. The PCR using primer pair TTL63/TTL64 amplifies an internal 592-bp fragment of ecs4, an e-specific capsule synthesis gene, in 40 of 40 Hie strains. Of all non-Hie strains, there were no false positives. False-negative results of the PCR proposed by Falla et al. (1994) are explained by single nucleotide insertions in the primer sequences.
