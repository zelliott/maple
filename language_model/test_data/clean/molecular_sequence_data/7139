We examined the regulation of Neurospora crassa arg-2 and cpc-1 in response to amino acid availability.arg-2 encodes the small subunit of arginine-specific carbamoyl phosphate synthetase; it is subject to unique negative regulation by Arg and is positively regulated in response to limitation for many different amino acids through a mechanism known as cross-pathway control. cpc-1 specifies a transcriptional activator important for crosspathway control. Expression of these genes was compared with that of the cytochrome oxidase subunit V gene, cox-5. Analyses of mRNA levels, polypeptide pulse-labeling results, and the distribution of mRNA in polysomes indicated that Arg-specific negative regulation of arg-2 affected the levels of both arg-2 mRNA and arg-2 mRNA translation. Negative translational effects on arg-2 and positive translational effects on cpc-1 were apparent soon after cells were provided with exogenous Arg. In cells limited for His, increased expression of arg-2 and cpc-1, and decreased expression of cox-5, also had translational and transcriptional components. The arg-2 and cpc-1 transcripts contain upstream open reading frames (uORFs), as do their Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologs CPA1 and GCN4. We examined the regulation of arg-2-lacZ reporter genes containing or lacking the uORF start codon; the capacity for arg-2 uORF translation appeared critical for controlling gene expression.
