Anaerobic cultures capable of reductively dechlorinating 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorobiphenyl (CB) were enriched from three different sediments, one estuarine, one marine and one riverine. Two different electron donors were used in enrichments with the estuarine sediment (elemental iron or a mixture of fatty acids). The removal of doubly flanked meta and para chlorines to form 2,3,5-CB and 2,4,5-CB was observed in all cultures. Bacterial community analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments revealed different communities in these cultures, with the exception of one common population that showed a high phylogentic relatedness to Dehalococcoides species. No Dehalococcoides-like populations were ever detected in control cultures to which no PCBs were added. In addition, the dynamics of this Dehalococcoides-like population were strongly correlated with dechlorination. Subcultures of the estuarine sediment culture demonstrated that the Dehalococcoides-like population disappeared when dechlorination was inhibited with 2-bromoethanesulfonate or when 2,3,4,5-CB had been consumed. These results provide evidence that Dehalococcoides-like populations were involved in the removal of doubly flanked chlorines from 2,3,4,5-CB. Furthermore, the successful enrichment of these populations from geographically distant and geochemically distinct environments indicates the widespread presence of these PCB-dechlorinating, Dehalococcoides-like organisms.
