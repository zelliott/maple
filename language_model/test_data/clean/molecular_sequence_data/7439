Rat liver is known to contain a regulatory protein (RP) that inhibits glucokinase competitively with respect to glucose. By an immunohistochemical technique and by cell fractionation in glycerol, we investigated the distribution of RP in rat liver and its changes in response to high glucose. RP was detected almost exclusively in the nuclei of the parenchymal cells of both fed and fasted rats. In situ perfusion of the liver with 20 mM glucose for 10 min caused a marked decrease in nuclear RP and an increase in cytoplasmic RP. These results indicate that RP is present predominantly in the nuclei of hepatocytes and is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to high glucose.
