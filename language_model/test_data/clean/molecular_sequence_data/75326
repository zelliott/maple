The primary envelope (env) gene product of the polycythemia-inducing variant of Friend spleen focus-forming virus (F-SFFVP), representing a glycoprotein with an apparent Mr of 52,000 (gp52), was isolated from F-SFFVP-infected normal rat kidney cells metabolically labeled with [2-3H]mannose in the presence or absence of glucose. Structures of the oligosaccharides present were determined by micromethylation analysis, acetolysis, and digestion with exoglycosidases. Gp52 radiolabeled in the presence of glucose contains solely oligomannosidic glycans comprising 6 to 9 mannose residues (Man6-9GlcNAc2), some of which carry additional glucose. The structures of the glycans found reflect the typical intermediates of oligosaccharide processing. The glycosylation of gp52 isolated from glucose-deprived cells (-Glc), however, is characterized by increased amounts of Man5-7 species comprising other structural isomers. Only gp52 (-Glc) glycans are, in part, further processed yielding incomplete complex-type oligosaccharides. Our results demonstrate that the limited post-translational processing of the primary F-SFFVP env gene product is neither due to aberrant trimming of its oligomannosidic glycans nor due to transfer of immature lipid-linked oligosaccharide-intermediates as observed in glucose-starved cells.
