1. The leucine-rich glioma inactivated (LGI) family of genes encodes a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein, proteins that are thought to be specifically involved in protein-protein and protein-matrix interactions. Since amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) has been previously shown to induce the expression of another LRR-encoding gene in neural cells, we assessed how Abeta affects LGI gene expression in rat primary cerebral cortical cultures and astrocyte cultures. Both RT-PCR and Western Blotting analyses revealed that Abeta robustly induced the expression of LGI3 in rat astrocyte cultures.2. Western Blotting analyses also showed that both glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) significantly increased coincidentally with the Abeta-induced upregulation of LGI3. Immunocytochemistry showed that LGI3 colocalized with Abeta at plasma membranes and also with internalized Abeta in astrocytes. These findings suggest that activated LGI3 may be involved in the astroglial response against Abeta.
