We have determined the nucleotide sequence for the DNA encoding the 5.8S RNAs and downstream internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) regions for Candida albicans and the taxonomically related species C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata and C. krusei. Phylogenetic analysis of all known fungal 5.8S RNA sequences revealed a close relationship between C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis, and to a lesser extent C. albicans within the yeast-like fungi. This group can itself be delineated from predominantly filamentous species. The more distal relationships between Candida (Torulopsis) glabrata and C. krusei support previous findings based on small (18S) ribosomal RNA sequence analysis, suggesting a greater degree of evolutionary divergence of these species from the C. albicans group. Among strains of C. albicans we observed conservation of the ITS2 region at the nucleotide level. Conservation was also observed for a more limited number of C. parapsilosis strains. Although the 3' region of the ITS spacer was species specific, sequence homology was observed in the 5' end within the albicans/parapsilosis/tropicalis group. Our findings suggest a rapid approach to species identification through the use of non-conserved regions flanked by highly conserved, functional domains.
