A four-kilobase (kb) region (HindIII-N, map units 7.0-11.3) of the Orgyia pseudotsugata multinucleocapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus (OpMNPV) genome was found to contain sequences that conferred upon plasmids the ability to undergo infection-dependent replication. The plasmid DNA appeared to be replicated to form high molecular weight multimers. Plasmids with deletions of up to 1.8 kb from either end of the HindIII-N region were replication competent. However, a discrete sequence, contained within the region bracketed by the deletions, capable of specifying replication was not identified. No evidence for sequence homology was found between the OpMNPV HindIII-N region and regions elsewhere in the OpMNPV genome or to putative Autographa californica MNPV (AcMNPV) replication origins. Origin-dependent plasmid replication was shown to require the presence of the OpMNPV DNA polymerase gene. The OpMNPV origin replicated poorly in AcMNPV-infected Spodoptera frugiperda cells and, conversely, a putative AcMNPV origin (hr2) replicated at low levels in OpMNPV-infected Lymantria dispar cells.
