By using degenerate oligodeoxyribonucleotide primers for conserved regions of groEL, a 0.6-kb fragment of Pasteurella multocida genomic DNA was amplified using PCR. The amplified fragment was then used as a probe to isolate a genomic fragment containing the entire GroESL operon. The isolated genomic fragment was found to contain two open reading frames, the sequences of which were highly homologous to the prokaryotic groES and groEL families of genes.
