A protein extracted from a urate-calcium oxalate stone by electrodialysis is also excreted in the urine which served as the source material for its purification by FPLC after separation on an ACA44 column. It has an amino acid composition appropriate for a cationic protein. One peptide obtained by cyanogen bromide cleavage has significant (approximately 60%) homology with CD59 protein (protectin). Both proteins have wide distribution, the unknown having been found in bile, cholesterol gallstones, and the wall of the aorta. However, the two proteins appear to be immunologically different.
