Estrogens regulate the proliferation and differentiation of mouse vaginal epithelial cells. We examined the temporal and spatial expression of DDV10, a novel C-type lectin during stratification and cornification of the vaginal epithelium. DDV10 was expressed in vagina but not uterus in ovariectomized mice treated with 17beta-estradiol (E2). In mouse stomach, the expression of DDV10 was detected in pars proventricularis but not in pars glandularis. Furthermore, the DDV10 gene was found to possess two transcripts, a long form (DDV10) and a short form (OCILrP1, osteoclast inhibitory lectin-related protein 1). DDV10 mRNA but not OCILrP1 mRNA was expressed in the stratified and cornified epithelial tissues. DDV10 mRNA was first detected between 12 and 18 h after E2 treatment in the vaginal epithelium, and was detected in the vagina of the neonatally diethylstilbestrol (DES)-treated mouse. Recently, a unified name was registered in GenBank (C-type lectin domain family 2, member g; Clec2 g). Taken together, these data suggest that DDV10 is the long form of Clec2 g (Clec2g-L), and DDV10/Clec2g-L may play a role in the stratification and/or cornification of epithelial cells during differentiation.
