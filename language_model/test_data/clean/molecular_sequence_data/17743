All prokaryotic (NiFe)-hydrogenases so far studied at the primary sequence level appear to have evolved from a common ancestral sequence. Highly conserved cysteinyl and histidinyl residues indicate regions likely to be essential for enzyme activity, ligand and co-factor binding. There is a very highly conserved sequence over 100 basepairs (bp) in length within the intergenic region upstream of the methyl-viologen hydrogenase encoding genes in several different strains of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, indicating that a sequence of this length is needed to direct and regulate the expression of these genes.
