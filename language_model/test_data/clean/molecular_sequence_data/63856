Following the investigation of foliasalaciosides A(1), A(2), B(1), B(2), C, and D, seven new megastigmane glycosides named foliasalaciosides E(1)-I (1-7), together with four known constituents, were isolated from the leaves of Salacia chinensis LINN. collected in Thailand. The absolute stereostructures of the new compounds were characterized on the basis of chemical and physicochemical evidence, including the application of the modified Mosher's method.
