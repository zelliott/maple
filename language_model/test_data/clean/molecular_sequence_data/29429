The nucleotide sequence of the genome of the nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) from Mamestra configurata (MacoNPV, isolate 90/2), a group II NPV, was determined and analyzed. The MacoNPV DNA genome consists of 155,060 bp and has an overall G+C content of 41.7%. Computer-assisted analysis predicted 169 open reading frames (ORFs) of 150 nucleotides or greater that showed minimal overlap. BLAST searches and comparisons with completely sequenced baculoviruses indicated that there were 66 ORFs conserved among the nine baculoviruses compared and an additional 17 ORFs were conserved among the NPVs. The gene content and gene arrangement in MacoNPV were most similar to those of SeMNPV, including two putative odv-e66 and p26 gene homologues. However, in contrast to SeMNPV, 8 ORFs with homology to baculovirus repeat ORFs (bro) and single copies of enhancin and conotoxin-like protein ORFs were found in MacoNPV. The MacoNPV genome contained four homologous regions, each with 10 to 17 repeated sequences. Each repeat was 60 to 86 nucleotides in length and contained an approximately 43-bp-long imperfect palindrome. There were 13 ORFs unique to MacoNPV, ranging from a small ORF of 196 bp to larger ORFs of up to 1047 bp, and many of these contained typical early and late baculovirus consensus promoters.
