The cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity of CHO cells was unaffected by the addition of Ca2+ +calmodulin (CaM), indicating the absence of any PDE1 (Ca2+/CaM-stimulated PDE) activity. Treatment with the tumour promoting phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) led to the rapid transient induction of PDE1 activity which attained a maximum value after about 13 h before slowly decreasing. Such induction was attenuated by actinomycin D. PCR primers were designed to hybridize with two regions identified as being characteristic of PDE1 forms found in various species and predicted to amplify a 601 bp fragment. RT-PCR using degenerate primers allowed an approx. 600 bp fragment to be amplified from RNA preparations of rat brain but not from CHO cells unless they had been treated with PMA. CHO cells transfected to overexpress protein kinase C (PKC)-alpha and PKC-epsilon, but not those transfected to overexpress PKC-beta I or PKC-gamma, exhibited a twofold higher PDE activity. They also expressed a PDE1 activity, with Ca2+/CaM effecting a 1.8-2.8-fold increase in total PDE activity. RT-PCR, with PDE1-specific primers, identified an approx. 600 bp product in CHO cells transfected to overexpress PKC-alpha and PKC-epsilon, but not in those overexpressing PKC-beta I or PKC-gamma. Treatment of PKC-alpha transfected cells with PMA caused a rapid, albeit transient, increase in PDE1 activity, which reached a maximum some 1 h after PMA challenge, before returning to resting levels some 2 h later. The residual isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX)-insensitive PDE activity was dramatically reduced (approx. 4-fold) in the PKC-gamma transfectants, suggesting that the activity of the cyclic AMP-specific IBMX-insensitive PDE7 activity was selectively reduced by overexpression of this particular PKC isoform. These data identify a novel point of 'cross-talk' between the lipid and cyclic AMP signalling systems where the action of specific PKC isoforms is shown to cause the induction of Ca2+/CaM-stimulated PDE (PDE1) activity. It is suggested that this protein kinase C-mediated process might involve regulation of PDE1 gene expression by the AP-1 (fos/jun) system.
