Tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST) catalyzes the sulfation of proteins at tyrosine residues. We have analyzed the substrate specificity of TPST from bovine adrenal medulla with a novel assay, using synthetic peptides as substrates. The peptides were modeled after the known, or putative, tyrosine sulfation sites of the cholecystokinin precursor, chromogranin B (secretogranin I) and vitronectin, as well as the tyrosine phosphorylation sites of alpha-tubulin and pp60src. Varying the sequence of these peptides, we found that (i) the apparent Km of peptides with multiple tyrosine sulfation sites decreased exponentially with the number of sites; (ii) acidic amino acids were the major determinant for tyrosine sulfation, acidic amino acids adjacent to the tyrosine being more important than distant ones; (iii) a carboxyl terminally located tyrosine residue may be sulfated. Moreover, TPST catalyzed the sulfation of a peptide corresponding to the tyrosine autophosphorylation site of pp60v-src (Tyr-416) but not of a peptide corresponding to the non-autophosphorylation site of pp60c-src (Tyr-527). These results experimentally define structural determinants for the substrate specificity of TPST and show that this enzyme and certain autophosphorylating tyrosine kinases have overlapping substrate specificities in vitro.
