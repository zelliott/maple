The CONSTANS (CO) protein is a critical regulator of the photoperiodic control of flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. We isolated a cDNA PpCOL1 encoding a homolog of the CO/CO-LIKE (COL) family proteins from a cryptogam Physcomitrella patens. The predicted PpCOL1 protein has N-terminal zinc finger and C-terminal CCT domains, which are conserved in the angiosperm CO/COL proteins. Structurally, PpCOL1 is the most closely related to the Group Ia or Ic proteins, which include AtCO and AtCOL1/2, among diverged members of the family. A transient expression assay using GFP showed that the CCT domain of PpCOL1 contains a nuclear-localizing signal. Northern blotting analyses revealed that the PpCOL1 expression is controlled by the circadian clock, and moreover, it is photoperiodically regulated at a gametophore stage when the rate of sporophyte formation is affected by day length. These observations indicate a possible involvement of PpCOL1 as a nuclear factor in the photoperiodic regulation of reproduction of Physcomitrella.
