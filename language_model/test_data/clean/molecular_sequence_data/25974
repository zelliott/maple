Heparin is a mixture of linear polysaccharides of undetermined sequence. Both biosynthetic data and computer simulation studies have established that each heparin polymer chain is comprised of oligosaccharides of defined sequence, representing ordered domains. One such ordered domian is a pentasaccharide corresponding to heparin's antithrombin III binding site. Previous computer simulation studies, performed under the assumption that heparin lyase (heparinase, EC 4.2.2.7), has a random endolytic action pattern, suggested that certain of these ordered oligosaccharide domains may themselves be nonrandomly arranged in the heparin polymer. The present work presents computer simulations of alternative action patterns for heparin lyase while assuming a random distribution of these oligosaccharide units within the heparin polymer. We consider action patterns that are determined solely by the primary structure of the substrate molecules. Results of the simulations are compared to (1) the experimental measurements of product chains formed throughout the reaction and (2) the change in weight average molecular weight Mw as a function of reaction completion as determined by absorbance at 232 nm. From the simulation of 60 action patterns for heparin lyase, we infer that one of the following statements concerning heparin and heparin lyase is true: (1) Heparin is a random arrangement of a small number of structurally defined oligosaccharide units. Heparin lyase changes its action pattern during the depolymerization of heparin (perhaps influenced by the secondary structure of substrate). (2) Heparin contain clusters of oligosaccharide sequences that are present in low concentrations (overall) in the polymer. Heparin lyase has a specificity for cleaving glycosidic linkages either exolytically at the nonreducing terminus of a chain or (endolytically) at the reducing side of these rare oligosaccharide sequence.
