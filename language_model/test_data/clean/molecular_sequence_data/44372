The gene (hmgA) for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (EC 1.1.1.34) from the thermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 was cloned and sequenced. S. solfataricus HMG-CoA reductase exhibited a high degree of sequence identity (47%) to the HMG-CoA reductase of the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii. Phylogenetic analyses of HMG-CoA reductase protein sequences suggested that the two archaeal genes are distant homologs of eukaryotic genes. The only known bacterial HMG-CoA reductase, a strictly biodegradative enzyme from Pseudomonas mevalonii, is highly diverged from archaeal and eukaryotic HMG-CoA reductases. The S. solfataricus hmgA gene encodes a true biosynthetic HMG-CoA reductase. Expression of hmgA in Escherichia coli generated a protein that both converted HMG-CoA to mevalonate and cross-reacted with antibodies raised against rat liver HMG-CoA reductase. S. solfataricus HMG-CoA reductase was purified in 40% yield to a specific activity of 17.5 microU per mg at 50 degrees C by a sequence of steps that included heat treatment, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and affinity chromatography. The final product was homogeneous, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The substrate was (S)- not (R)-HMG-CoA; the reductant was NADPH not NADH. The Km values for HMG-CoA (17 microM) and NADPH (23 microM) were similar in magnitude to those of other biosynthetic HMG-CoA reductases. Unlike other HMG-CoA reductases, the enzyme was stable at 90 degrees C and was optimally active at pH 5.5 and 85 degrees C.
