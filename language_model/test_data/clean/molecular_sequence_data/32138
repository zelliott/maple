Skatole is one of the most malodorous compounds produced from the anaerobic degradation of animal waste. Little is known about the biochemistry of skatole production, the phylogeny of skatole-producing microorganisms or the conditions that favor their growth. These deficiencies hamper attempts to reduce skatole production. Our goals were to enrich for skatole producers in swine lagoon slurry (SLS) and evaluate the resulting microbial community structure using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Skatole producers were enriched by incubating dilutions of SLS with 100 muM indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). GC-MS was used to measure skatole production in the slurries after 0, 7 and 17 days' incubation. Based on most probable number analysis, skatole producers increased 100-fold in SLS samples supplemented with IAA. Based on DGGE fingerprint patterns from day 0, 7 and 17 treatments with high, mid or low levels of skatole production, changes in the SLS population occurred as skatole production increased. Changes in the bacterial community fingerprints were associated with an increase in the low-GC gram-positive and Bacteroides groups. Results from this study provides valuable new information concerning the organisms responsible for production of this odorant, a necessary first step towards controlling skatole production.
