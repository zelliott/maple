One-third of patients with breast cancer overexpress the ERBB2 receptor tyrosine kinase, which is associated not only with a more aggressive phenotype but also reduced responsiveness to hormonal therapies. Over the past two decades, many ERBB2 mouse models for breast cancer have conclusively shown that this receptor has a causal role in breast cancer development. These mouse models have also enabled the mechanisms controlling tumour growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, dormancy and recurrence in ERBB2-positive breast cancer to be elucidated. In addition, a mouse model has recently been described that accurately recapitulates many of the hallmarks associated with the early stages of the human disease.
