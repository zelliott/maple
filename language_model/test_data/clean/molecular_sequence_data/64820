Mice deficient in interleukin-2 are well suited for use as an animal model for inflammatory bowel disease. Raised under specific-pathogen-free conditions, interleukin-2-deficient mice develop an inflammatory bowel disease resembling ulcerative colitis in humans. The finding that colitis was attenuated when the mice were kept under germfree conditions implies that the resident intestinal flora is involved in the pathogenesis of colitis. The present study addresses the composition of the mucosa-associated bacterial flora in colon samples from interleukin-2-deficient mice that developed colitis. This was investigated by comparative 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization using rRNA-targeted fluorescent probes to quantify the bacterial populations of the mucosa-associated flora. The investigations revealed distinct differences in the bacterial composition of the mucosa-associated flora between interleukin-2-deficient mice and healthy controls. Fluorescence in situ hybridization identified up to 10% of the mucosa-associated flora in interleukin-2-deficient mice as Escherichia coli, whereas no E. coli was detected in the mucosa from healthy wild-type mice. This finding was consistent with the results from comparative 16S rDNA analysis. About one-third of the clones analyzed from 16S rDNA libraries of interleukin-2-deficient mice represented Enterobacteriaceae, whereas none of the clones analyzed from the healthy controls harbored 16S rDNA from Enterobacteriaceae. The abundance of E. coli in the colonic mucosa of interleukin-2-deficient mice strongly suggests a participation in the pathogenesis of colitis in the interleukin-2-deficient mouse model for inflammatory bowel disease.
