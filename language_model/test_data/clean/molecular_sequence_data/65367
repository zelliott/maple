Development of cardiac arrhythmias in several degenerative cardiac disorders such as heart failure is precipitated by abnormalities in intracellular calcium regulation. Recently, the identification of mutations in proteins responsible for the control of intracellular calcium has been associated with an inherited arrhythmogenic syndrome called catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). Here, we review the current knowledge about the molecular pathophysiology of CPVT and we discuss some potentially innovative strategies for controlling calcium-handling abnormalities in CPVT that may provide novel therapeutic options for affected patients.
