Tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome type I (TRPSI) is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary disorder characterized by sparse hair, bulbous nose, long philtrum, thin upper lip, and skeletal abnormalities including cone-shaped epiphyses, shortening of the phalanges, and short stature. TRPSI is caused by mutations in the TRPS1 gene. Herein, we report two Korean cases of TRPSI. Although both patients (a 17-year-old-female and a 14-year-old male) had typical clinical findings, Patient 1 had an additional growth hormone (GH) deficiency. Treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) 0.7 IU/kg/week led to an increase in growth velocity. Over 10 years of GH therapy, the mean growth velocity was 5.7 Â± 0.9 cm/year. However, the patient 2 did not show apparent GH deficiency by GH stimulation test, had a poor response with rhGH therapy and GH therapy was discontinued after 6 months. Upon genetic analysis of the TRPS1 gene, two mutations were found. Patient 1 had a heterozygous mutation c.2520dupT (p.Arg841LysfsX3) which had not been previously reported. Patient 2 had a known nonsense mutation c.1630C>T (p.Arg544X). In summary, we were the first to report Korean patients with mutation of TRPS1.
