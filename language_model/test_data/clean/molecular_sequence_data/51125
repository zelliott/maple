Two human Alu repeats terminating in an oligo(T) run rather than the usual A-rich 3' tail were isolated by library screening. Base sequence comparisons reveal that these unusual Alus are also exceptionally divergent from other Alu family members implying that they are evolutionarily old. Unlike other members of the family, they are not transcribed in vitro by RNA polymerase III (Pol III) suggesting a partial explanation for how Alu source genes might become inactive with age.
