Here we report the sequence of three mitochondrial genomes from yeasts of the Nakaseomyces clade that includes the pathogenic yeast Candida glabrata, namely, that of Kluyveromyces delphensis, Candida castellii and Kluyveromyces bacillisporus. The gene content is equivalent to that of C. glabrata, but reveals the existence of new group I introns in COX1 and CYTB and new potential intronic endonucleases. Gene order is highly rearranged in these genomes, which contain numerous palindromic GC clusters. The more GC nucleotides these elements contain, the longer and more AT-rich are the intergenes containing them, leading to a direct relationship between the number of Gs and Cs within the elements and the size of the genomes. Thus, there is a fivefold difference in size between the smallest and the largest mitochondrial genome, with the largest being the most AT-rich overall. Sequences are available under EMBL accession numbers FM995164, FM995165, and FM995166.
