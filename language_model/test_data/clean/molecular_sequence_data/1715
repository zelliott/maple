Rat cytomegalovirus (RCMV) possesses two adjacent genes, r131 and r129, which have the potential to encode CC chemokine homologs. Interestingly, the amino acid sequences encoded by both genes show similarity to the sequence of the murine CMV (MCMV) MCK-2 protein, which is encoded by the m131/129 gene. In order to study the significance of the r131 gene in the pathogenesis of RCMV infection, we generated two different virus strains in which the r131 open reading frame is disrupted. Replication of these null mutant strains, designated RCMVdeltar131a and RCMVdeltar131b, was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Both strains were found to replicate with a similar efficiency as wild-type (WT) RCMV in vitro. However, in contrast to WT virus, neither RCMVdeltar131a nor RCMVdeltar131b established a high-titer infection in the salivary glands of immunocompromised rats. Furthermore, in a local, rat footpad infection model, both recombinant viruses induced a significantly lower amount of paw swelling than did WT RCMV. Also, a higher number of infiltrating macrophages was observed in paws infected with WT RCMV than in those infected with the recombinants. Taken together, these results suggest that r131 (i) promotes inflammation at initial sites of inoculation and, subsequently, efficient virus dissemination to or infection of the salivary glands and (ii) might be involved in the persistence of virus infection, at least in the spleen. In addition, our data indicate that r131 represents the functional homolog of the MCMV m131/129 gene.
