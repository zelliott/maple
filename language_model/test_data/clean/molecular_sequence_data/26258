The Mycoplasma pneumoniae tuf gene, encoding the elongation factor protein Tu, was cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the mycoplasmal gene showed about 60% homology to the sequences of tuf genes of other prokaryotes, yeast mitochondria and Euglena gracilis chloroplasts, and about 75% similarity was found when comparing the deduced amino acid sequences of the various Tu proteins. The relatively low G + C content (40%) of the M. pneumoniae DNA was reflected in a low G + C content (44.6%) of the tuf gene, and in a preferential use of adenine and uracil at the third position of codons, yet codon usage analysis revealed the presence of almost all of the codons of the genetic code in the mycoplasmal gene. Southern blot hybridization of digested DNAs of 11 Mollicutes species with the entire M. pneumoniae tuf gene and with its 5' part suggested the presence of one copy only of this gene in the representative species of the Mollicutes. In this respect, the Mollicutes resemble Gram-positive bacteria and differ from the Gram-negative bacteria, which carry two copies of the tuf gene.
