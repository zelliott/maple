Lipoxins are bioactive eicosanoids that are immunomodulators. In human myeloid cells, lipoxin (LX) A4 actions are mediated by interaction with a G protein-coupled receptor. To explore functions of LXA4 and aspirin-triggered 5(S),6(R),15(R)-trihydroxy-7,9,13-trans-11-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-epi-LXA4) in vivo, we cloned and characterized a mouse LXA4 receptor (LXA4R). When expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, the mouse LXA4R showed specific binding to [3H]LXA4 (K(d) approximately 1.5 nM), and with LXA4 activated GTP hydrolysis. Mouse LXA4R mRNA was most abundant in neutrophils. In addition to LXA4 and 15-epi-LXA4, bioactive LX stable analogues competed with both [3H]LXA4 and [3H]leukotriene D4 (LTD4)-specific binding in vitro to neutrophils and endothelial cells, respectively. Topical application of LXA4 analogues and novel aspirin-triggered 15-epi-LXA4 stable analogues to mouse ears markedly inhibited neutrophil infiltration in vivo as assessed by both light microscopy and reduced myeloperoxidase activity in skin biopsies. The 15(R)-16-phenoxy-17,18, 19,20-tetranor-LXA4 methyl ester (15-epi-16-phenoxy-LXA4), an analogue of aspirin triggered 15-epi-LXA4, and 15(S)-16-phenoxy-17,18,19,20-tetranor-LXA4 methyl ester (16-phenoxy-LXA4) were each as potent as equimolar applications of the anti-inflammatory, dexamethasone. Thus, we identified murine LXA4R, which is highly expressed on murine neutrophils, and showed that both LXA4 and 15-epi-LXA4 stable analogues inhibit neutrophil infiltration in the mouse ear model of inflammation. These findings provide direct in vivo evidence for an anti-inflammatory action for both aspirin-triggered LXA4 and LXA4 stable analogues and their site of action in vivo.
