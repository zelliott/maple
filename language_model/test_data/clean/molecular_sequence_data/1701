Although the nuclear genome sequence of Cyanidioschyzon merolae 10D, a unicellular red alga, was recently determined, DNA transformation technology that is important as a model plant system has never been available thus far. In this study, improved culture conditions resulted in a faster growth rate of C. merolae in liquid medium (doubling time = 9.2 h), and colony formation on gellan gum plates. Using these conditions, spontaneous mutants (5-fluoroortic acid resistant) deficient in the UMP synthase gene were isolated. The lesions were then restored by introducing the wild-type UMP synthase gene into the cells suggesting DNA transformation by homologous recombination.
