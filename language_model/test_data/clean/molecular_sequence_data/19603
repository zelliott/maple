Pax-6 is an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor and acts high up in the regulatory hierarchy controlling eye and brain development in humans, mice, zebrafish, and Drosophila. Previous studies have shown that Pax-6 is a phosphoprotein, and its phosphorylation by ERK, p38, and homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 greatly enhances its transactivation activity. However, the protein phosphatases responsible for the dephosphorylation of Pax-6 remain unknown. Here, we present both in vitro and in vivo evidence to show that protein serine/threonine phosphatase-1 is a major phosphatase that directly dephosphorylates Pax-6. First, purified protein phosphatase-1 directly dephosphorylates Pax-6 in vitro. Second, immunoprecipitation-linked Western blot revealed that both protein phosphatase-1alpha and protein phosphatase-1beta interact with Pax-6. Third, overexpression of protein phosphatase-1 in human lens epithelial cells leads to dephosphorylation of Pax-6. Finally, inhibition of protein phosphatase-1 activity by calyculin A or knockdown of protein phosphatase-1alpha and protein phosphatase-1beta by RNA interference leads to enhanced phosphorylation of Pax-6. Moreover, our results also demonstrate that dephosphorylation of Pax-6 by protein phosphatase-1 significantly modulates its function in regulating expression of both exogenous and endogenous genes. These results demonstrate that protein phosphatase 1 acts as a major phosphatase to dephosphorylate Pax-6 and modulate its function.
