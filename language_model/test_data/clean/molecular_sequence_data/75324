An oligonucleotide probe was used to isolate a clone encoding prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase (cyclooxygenase, EC 1.14.99.1) from a sheep seminal vesicle cDNA library. The protein predicted from nucleic acid sequence contains 599 amino acids including a 23-amino acid signal sequence. Thus, the mature cyclooxygenase deduced from the cDNA compares favorably in molecular size to the 70-kDa protein determined by gel electrophoresis. A putative transmembrane region and potential carbohydrate addition sites for N-linked sugars can be inferred from the amino acid sequence. Significantly, sequence similarities exist between cyclooxygenase, myeloperoxidase, and several other heme-containing proteins. The putative glycosylation sites, transmembrane domain, and sequence similarities with functionally related enzymes have been incorporated into a model for the topology of cyclooxygenase in the endoplasmic reticulum.
