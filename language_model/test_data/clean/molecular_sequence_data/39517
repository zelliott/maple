Reciprocal signalling and gene expression play a cardinal role during pathogen-host molecular interactions and are prerequisite to the maintenance of balanced homeostasis. Gene expression repertoire changes during rickettsial infection and glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) were among the genes found up-regulated in Rickettsia-infected Dermacentor variabilis. GSTs are well known to play an important part in cellular stress responses in the host. We have cloned two full-length GSTs from D. variabilis (DvGST1 and DvGST2). Comparison of these two DvGST molecules with those of other species indicate that DvGST1 is related to the mammalian class theta and insect class delta GSTs, while DvGST2 does not seem to fall in the same family. Northern blotting analyses revealed differential expression patterns, where DvGST1 and DvGST2 transcripts are found in the tick gut, with DvGST2 transcripts also present in the ovaries. Both DvGST transcripts are up-regulated upon tick feeding. Challenge of fed adult ticks with Escherichia coli injection showed decreased transcript amounts compared with ticks injected with phosphate-buffered saline (sham) and na√Øve ticks.
