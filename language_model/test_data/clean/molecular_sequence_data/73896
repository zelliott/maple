A pre-gamma-globin species was identified by high performance liquid chromatography in platyrrhine primates. Although pre-gamma-globin has not been observed in human hemoglobin, its identification in platyrrhine hemoglobin was facilitated by the functional inactivation of one of the duplicated gamma-globin genes in platyrrhines, which simplified the high performance liquid chromatography elution pattern. Part, but not all, of the pre-gamma was glutathionyl gamma 2-globin, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry was used to demonstrate that the glutathionyl residue was located on cysteine 93. As this residue is invariant in primates, it is predicted that the formation of glutathionyl gamma-globin will be seen in all primate hemoglobins under appropriate conditions.
