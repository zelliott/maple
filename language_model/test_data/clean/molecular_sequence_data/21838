Many recombinant murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were studied under pre-clinical or clinical development and became one of the most prolific drug classes in oncology. Vascular endothelial growth factors receptor 2 (VEGFR2) has been implicated to play an important role in tumors. We have established a murine anti-VEGFR2 mAb. To reduce the shortcoming of the mAb, a murine-human chimeric Fab (cFab) named FA8H1 was constructed with gene engineering techniques and expressed as a soluble and functional protein in Escherichia coli Top10F'. Several immunological methods were used to characterize the cFab, including ELISA, affinity and kinetics assay, IP, IF, FACS, and IHC. The results illuminated that cFab maintained the specificity for the VEGFR2 antigen. The active cFab also effectively identified VEGFR2 over-expressing cells in a number of archived human cancer tissues, compared to its parental antibody. The FA8H1 provided the basis for potential therapy research against over-expressing VEGFR2 human solid tumors.
