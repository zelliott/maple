The goldfish optic nerve can regenerate after injury. To understand the molecular mechanism of optic nerve regrowth, we identified genes whose expression is specifically up-regulated during the early stage of optic nerve regeneration. A cDNA library constructed from goldfish retina 5 days after transection was screened by differential hybridization with cDNA probes derived from axotomized or normal retina. Of six cDNA clones isolated, one clone was identified as the Na,K-ATPase catalytic subunit alpha3 isoform by high- sequence homology. In northern hybridization, the expression level of the mRNA was significantly increased at 2 days and peaked at 5-10 days, and then gradually decreased and returned to control level by 45 days after optic nerve transection. Both in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining have revealed the location of this transient retinal change after optic nerve transection. The increased expression was observed only in the ganglion cell layer and optic nerve fiber layer at 5-20 days after optic nerve transection. In an explant culture system, neurite outgrowth from the retina 7 days after optic nerve transection was spontaneously promoted. A low concentration of ouabain (50-100 nm ) completely blocked the spontaneous neurite outgrowth from the lesioned retina. Together, these data indicate that up-regulation of the Na,K-ATPase alpha3 subunit is involved in the regrowth of ganglion cell axons after axotomy.
