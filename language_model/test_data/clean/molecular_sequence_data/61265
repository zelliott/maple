A novel toxin (TdK1) was purified from the venom of the scorpion Tityus discrepans, sequenced and functionally characterized. It contains 37 amino acid residues and blocks reversible the shakerB K+ channel expressed in SF9 cells with a Kd in the order of 280 nM. The proposed systematic nomenclature for this peptide is alpha-KTx4.3.
