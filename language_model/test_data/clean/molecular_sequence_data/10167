To identify a phytoplankton cell cycle marker detected by a monoclonal antibody against mammalian proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (S. Lin, J. Chang, and E. J. Carpenter, J. Phycol. 30:449-456, 1994), a PCNA gene fragment was isolated by reverse transcription-PCR from the marine unicellular alga Tetraselmis chui Butcher (Prasinophyceae). The gene fragment was 616 bp in length and contained an open reading frame of 205 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 80 and 88% similarity to human and rice PCNA, respectively. Southern hybridization indicated that the isolated gene fragment was part of the T. chui genome, with up to three copies in each haploid nucleus. Northern hybridization was used to detect a PCNA mRNA with a size of 1.2 kb from an exponentially growing algal culture. The T. chui gene fragment has been cloned into an expression vector, and a fusion protein was subsequently generated. Anti-rat PCNA simultaneously recognized the PCNA fusion protein and a single 33-kDa band in T.chui total protein extract. Our results indicate that T. chui PCNA is highly similar to its mammalian counterpart and that anti-rat PCNA is a good tool for detecting phytoplankton PCNA in general.
