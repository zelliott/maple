Herein we report the first attempt of coupling multidimensional separations to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometric imaging detection. Complex neuropeptide mixtures extracted from crustaceans were first fractionated by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), and then subjected to a capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometric imaging platform. With a specific focus on orcokinin family neuropeptides, we demonstrated that these trace-level analytes from complex neural tissue samples can be fully separated from chemical noise and interfering components and visualized as mass spectrometric imaging signals. A total of 19 putative orcokinins were detected, with highly efficient separations within the family being achieved for the first time. The results indicate that two-dimensional separation coupling to mass spectrometric imaging can serve as a novel and powerful tool in proteomics and peptidomics studies.
