Recent applications of recombinant DNA techniques have enabled the cloning of several interesting human genes, leading to the production of rare biologicals in abundant quantities. We review here the discovery, early characterization, cloning, and expression of Interferon Alfa-2B (IFN alpha-2b or Intron A) as a therapeutic at Schering-Plough Research. IFN alpha-2a is marketed by Hoffman LaRoche under the trade name Roferon. The studies on the expression, purification, biology, and clinical aspects of this interferon offer a plethora of information on one of the earliest recombinant DNA based drugs to reach the market place.
