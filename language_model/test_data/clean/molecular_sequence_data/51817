Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and FGF receptors (FGFRs) play major roles in vertebrate embryogenesis, including control of skeletal muscle growth and differentiation. Understanding their roles requires delineating the specific FGF and FGFR isoforms involved. This study analyzes the FGFR transcripts found in a model mouse skeletal myoblast cell line (MM14) during growth and terminal differentiation. MM14 cells express transcripts for FGFR1 (flg) but not FGFR2 (bek). The predominate FGFR1 transcript contains three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains in the extracellular ligand binding region. Approximately one-fourth of the three Ig-like domain transcripts possess a 6-nt deletion between the first and second Ig-like domains which after translation would result in deletion of an Arg-Arg pair. Cloning of mouse genomic DNA surrounding the region of the FGFR1 6-nt deletion indicates that the deletion is derived by alternative splicing of FGFR1 transcripts. Transcripts containing two Ig-like domains account for less than 5% of total FGFR1 mRNA in MM14 cells. A survey of RNA from mouse tissues indicated that two Ig-like domain FGFR1 transcripts are rare in all tissues except in lung, in which the two Ig-like domain form accounts for roughly 70% of the lung FGFR1 mRNA. PCR RACE cloning studies disclosed 162 nt of additional FGFR1 5'-flanking RNA which was highly GC-rich. FGFR1 transcripts decline 8- to 10-fold during low serum, (-)FGF-mediated differentiation of MM14 cultures. The kinetics of the FGFR1 mRNA decline is similar to the previously described differentiation-dependent decrease in cell surface FGF receptors.
