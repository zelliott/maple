The a-mating factor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was synthesized using both solution phase and solid phase strategies. Structure of the final peptide was confirmed using amino acid analysis, fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy and 400 MHz proton NMR. The synthetic farnesylated dodecapeptide, YIIKGVFWDPAC (S-farnesyl) OCH3, exhibited chromatographic and spectroscopic properties identical to the natural pheromone and had significant biological activity at nanomolar concentrations.
