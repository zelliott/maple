The strategy of 'complementation by functional sufficiency' was used to isolate a cDNA designated XVSAP1 from a cDNA library constructed from dehydrated Xerophyta viscosa Baker leaves. Analysis of the cDNA sequence indicated a highly hydrophobic protein with six transmembrane regions. Southern blot analysis revealed that there are at least two copies of XVSAP1 in X. viscosa. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 49% identity to WCOR413, a low-temperature-regulated protein from wheat. The protein also showed between 25% to 56% identity to WCOR413-like proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression of XVSAP1 in Escherichia coli (srl::Tn10) conferred osmotic stress tolerance when the cells were grown in 1 M sorbitol. Analysis of gene expression using semi-quantitative RT-PCR indicated that XVSAP1 is induced by dehydration, salt stress (100 mM), both low (4 degrees C) and high temperature (42 degrees C) and high light treatment (1500 micromol m(-2) s(-1)). These results suggest that XVSAP1 may have a significant role to play in the response of X. viscosa to abiotic stresses.
