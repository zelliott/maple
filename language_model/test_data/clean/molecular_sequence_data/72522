The kdsA and kdsB genes from Chlamydia trachomatis encoding 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO)-8-phosphate synthetase and CMP-KDO synthetase were identified by functional complementation of temperature-sensitive Salmonella typhimurium mutants, homology to known KDO-8-phosphate synthetase and CMP-KDO synthetase proteins, and in vitro enzyme activity. The kdsA gene was transcribed as part of a polycistronic mRNA with two downstream open reading frames (ORFs). One of these ORFs appeared to encode a membrane-anchored protein, while the second encoded a protein showing homology to the ATP-binding component of periplasmic binding protein-dependent ABC transporters. Transcription of kdsA and kdsB in C. trachomatis was evident within 4 h of initiation of the C. trachomatis infection process and continued throughout the chlamydial life cycle.
