An analysis of published nucleotide sequences of the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of 7 cardioviruses and 3 aphthoviruses has allowed us to derive a consensus secondary structure model that differs from that previously proposed for the 5'-UTR of entero- and rhinoviruses, though all these viruses belong to the same family, Picornaviridae. The theoretical model derived here was experimentally supported by investigating the accessibility of encephalomyocarditis virus RNA to modifications with dimethyl sulfate and its susceptibility to S1 and cobra venom nucleases. The possible involvement of the 5"-UTR secondary structure domains in the translational control is briefly discussed.
