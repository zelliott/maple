A high resolution structure of alpha-conotoxin EI has been determined by (1)H NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling. alpha-Conotoxin EI has the same disulfide framework as alpha 4/7 conotoxins targeting neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors but antagonizes the neuromuscular receptor as do the alpha 3/5 and alpha A conotoxins. The unique binding preference of alpha-conotoxin EI to the alpha(1)/delta subunit interface of Torpedo neuromuscular receptor makes it a valuable structural template for superposition of various alpha-conotoxins possessing distinct receptor subtype specificities. Structural comparison of alpha-conotoxin EI with the gamma-subunit favoring alpha-conotoxin GI suggests that the Torpedo delta-subunit preference of the former originates from its second loop. Superposition of three-dimensional structures of seven alpha-conotoxins reveals that the estimated size of the toxin-binding pocket in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is approximately 20 A (height) x 20 A (width) x 15 A (thickness).
