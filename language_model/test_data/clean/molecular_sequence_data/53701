The vertebrate Otx gene family is related to otd, a gene contributing to head development in Drosophila. In Xenopus, Xotx1, Xotx2, and Xotx4 have already been isolated and analyzed. Here the cloning, developmental expression and functions of the additional Otx Xenopus gene, Xotx5 are reported. This latter gene shows a greater degree of homology to Xotx2 than Xotx1 and Xotx4. Xotx5 was initially expressed in Spemann's organizer and later in the anterior region. Ectopic expression of Xotx5 had similar effects to other Xotx genes in impairing trunk and tail development, and especially similar effects to Xotx2 in causing secondary cement glands. Taken together, these findings suggest that Xotx5 stimulates the formation of the anterior regions and represses the formation of posterior structures similar to Xotx2.
