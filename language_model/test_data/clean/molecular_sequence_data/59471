The entire Escherichia coli eno gene was cloned by functional complementation of a newly isolated temperature-sensitive enolase mutant and its nucleotide sequence determined. The deduced amino acid sequence is homologous to other known prokaryotic or eukaryotic enolases and amino acid residues, assumed to be involved in substrate or cofactor binding and catalysis, were found to be strictly conserved among all enolase proteins. Expression of the eno gene under the control of the lac promoter/operator resulted in an IPTG-inducible production of enzymatically active enolase in wild-type and enolase mutant strains.
