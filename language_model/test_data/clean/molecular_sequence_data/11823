A monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody, Id8F7, previously shown to bind to a phosphatidylserine (PS)-specific binding site on protein kinase C (PKC) has been used to identify a 12-amino acid consensus sequence shared by PKC and phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD). The 14-amino acid synthetic peptide derived from the corresponding region of PSD (amino acids 351-364 of the enzyme from Chinese hamster ovary cells) bound effectively and specifically to PS, and that derived from rat PKC gamma (amino acids 227-240) bound weakly but specifically to PS. Analysis of binding of Id8F7 to various synthetic peptides revealed that the consensus sequence motif, FXFXLKXXXKXR, is responsible for the interaction with both Id8F7 and PS. The results suggest that the conserved amino acid residues represent a basic structural motif for the specific interaction with PS, and the corresponding regions of PKC and PSD form the PS-specific binding sites of these enzymes.
