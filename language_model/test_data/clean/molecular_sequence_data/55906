Variable take-off angle and cold-stage ESCA measurements were utilized to analyze the surface composition of five polyurethane block copolymers. The polymers studied included a PTMO-polyurethane control, a carboxylated version of the control polyurethane, and three different peptide grafted (GRGESY, GRGDSY, and GRGDVY) polyurethanes. On dry samples the nitrogen signal detected using ESCA decreased with increasing take-off angle (i.e. as the specimen was probed closer to the surface) for all five polymers. This was believed to be due to the depletion of nitrogen-containing urethane hard segments at the surface. For all five polymers, the surface nitrogen concentration, associated with the hard segment, increased upon hydration. A greater increase of nitrogen concentration was observed for the peptide grafted polymers which suggests that grafting of the hydrophilic peptides to the polyurethane augments the hard segment enrichment at the surface upon hydration. Upon dehydration, the nitrogen concentration decreased for all five polymers suggesting migration of the more hydrophobic PTMO soft segment to the surface. In vitro endothelial cell adhesion showed an increase of cell attachment on prehydrated RGD-containing peptide grafted polyurethanes, but not on the other polymers. This result suggests an enhancement of peptide density at the aqueous interface, in good agreement with the ESCA studies.
