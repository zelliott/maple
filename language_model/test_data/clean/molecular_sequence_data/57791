Previous studies on infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) cDNA have identified a region of about 184 bases in the 3' non-coding terminus of both the U.S. prototype strain (Beaudette) and a Japanese strain (KB8523), that was not present in an antigenically closely related U.S. strain, Massachusetts (Mass) 41 (Boursnell et al., 1985; Sutou et al., 1988). In order to investigate the origin and function of this region and its occurrence in nature, the cDNA sequences of the 3' non-coding regions of three additional strains of IBV, Gray, Arkansas (Ark) 99 and Holland (Holl) 52, were determined and compared to the sequences of the Beaudette, KB8523 and Mass41 strains. Not only was this Urich sequence absent from the 3' non-coding region of the Mass41 strain, it was also highly variable, especially in comparison to the highly conserved 3' non coding region downstream of this sequence. Computer analyses of the sequences adjacent to this hypervariable region (HVR) showed that the 3' end of the IBV genome was highly conserved downstream of this region, with 94.3 to 97.8% similarity. However, the similarities for the HVR ranged from 53.2% between Holl52 and Ark99, to 92.8% between Beaudette and Gray. The flanking sequences were not only conserved but these sequences upstream and downstream of the HVR also formed mirrored images.
