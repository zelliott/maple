Imino 15N and 1H resonances of Escherichia coli tRNA(lIle) were observed in the absence and presence of E coli isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. Upon complex formation of tRNA(lIle) with isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, some imino 15N-1H resonances disappeared, and some others were significantly broadened and/or shifted in the 1H chemical shift, while the others were observed at the same 15N-1H chemical shifts. It was indicated that the binding of tRNA(lIle) with IleRS affect the following four regions: the anticodon stem, the junction of the acceptor and T stems, the middle of the D stem, and the region where the tertiary base pair connects the T, D, and extra loops. This result is consistent with those of chemical footprinting and site-directed mutagenesis studies. Taken together, these three independent results reveal the recognition mechanism of tRNA(lIle) by IleRS: IleRS recognizes all the identity determinants distributed throughout the tRNA(lIle) molecule, which induces changes in the secondary and tertiary structures of tRNA(lIle).
