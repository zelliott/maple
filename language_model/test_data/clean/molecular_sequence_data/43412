An antiserum against the crustacean neuropeptide pigment-dispersing hormone stains a small set of neurons in the optic lobes of several hemimetabolous and holometabolous insects. These cells, the primary branches of which in the optic lobe lie in the accessory medulla, fulfill several criteria predicted for neurons of the circadian clock. For example, in fruit flies they express timeless and period, which are two molecular components of the circadian pacemaker. To test whether pigment-dispersing hormone fulfills a circadian function in the cockroach Leucophaea maderae, 150 fmol of synthetic peptide was injected into the vicinity of the accessory medulla. This resulted in a stable phase-dependent resetting of the phase of the circadian locomotor activity rhythm, which depended on the amount of pigment-dispersing hormone injected. The resulting phase-response curve differs from that obtained with light pulses, suggesting that pigment-dispersing hormone-immunoreactive neurons are not part of the visual input pathway to the pacemaker but an integral part of it and/or part of a nonphotic input into the clock. A possible role of these neurons in coupling the bilaterally paired circadian pacemakers is discussed.
