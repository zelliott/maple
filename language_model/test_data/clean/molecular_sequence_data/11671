Tissue factor (TF) is a glycoprotein which binds factor VIIa. The TF-VIIa complex serves as a potent initiator of the coagulation pathways. TF, an immediate early gene, may also play a role in cell growth. Expression of TF was correlated with some types of cancers.

Normal, immortalized, and tumor human mammary epithelial cells were used in the experiments. The differential display (DD) technique was used to identify genes differentially expressed in the cells. TF expression patterns were examined by Northern blot analysis, immunofluorescence staining of cultured cells, and immunohistochemical staining in human cryostat sections.

In a 5-way display, an amplified polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product was found in normal and immortalized human mammary epithelial cells but not in the breast cancer cells. The PCR fragment was cloned and sequenced. The result showed that the fragment was identical to human tissue factor. Northern blot analysis showed that expression level of tissue factor mRNA remained high in growing, quiescent, and senescent normal mammary epithelial cells. Immunofluorescence staining also confirmed tissue factor expression pattern in the cell lines tested. Immunohistochemical staining showed that tissue factor was expressed in the normal luminal and myoepithelial cells of some ducts but not others. No staining was observed in invasive carcinoma cells. However, myoepithelial cell staining was seen in some residual ductal structures in invasive tumors.

This study shows the use of DD to reveal the loss of TF expression pattern in human breast cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemical staining results showed breast carcinoma cells expressed little TF, if any, suggesting that TF is not required for breast tumor cell invasion. The results also indicated that TF expression was independent of the proliferation status of the expressing cells. The expression pattern of TF may be a meaningful marker in the development of breast cancer.
