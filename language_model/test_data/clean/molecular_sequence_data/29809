We saw a 17-month-old boy with moderate psychomotor retardation, and enzymatically diagnosed succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency. After extracting mRNA and genomic DNA from his cultured lymphoblasts, we analyzed the entire coding region of the ALDH5A1 gene using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and genomic PCR followed by sequencing. He was demonstrated to be a compound heterozygote with two novel mutations (103-121 del and 1460T>A). The former leads to a frameshift and premature termination, and the latter is a missense mutation, V487E. Both mutations were also detected in the genomic DNA. Taken together with previous mutation reports, genetic heterogeneity was suspected for SSADH deficiency, and may account for the wide range of its phenotype.
