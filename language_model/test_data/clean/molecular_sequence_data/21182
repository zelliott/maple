We previously cloned a molecule that interacts with angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor to exert an inhibitory function on AT1 receptor signaling that we named ATRAP/Agtrap (for AT1 receptor-associated protein). In the present study we examined the regulation of basal ATRAP gene expression using renal distal convoluted tubule cells. We found that serum starvation upregulated basal expression of ATRAP gene, a response that required de novo mRNA and protein synthesis. Luciferase assay revealed that the proximal promoter region directs transcription and that a putative binding site of runt-related transcription factors (RBE) is important for transcriptional activation. The results of RBE-decoy transfection and endogenous knockdown by small interference RNA showed that the runt-related transcription factor Runx3 is involved in ATRAP gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay also supported the binding of Runx3 to the ATRAP promoter in renal distal convoluted tubule cells. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the expression of Runx3 and ATRAP proteins in the distal convoluted and connecting tubules of the kidney in consecutive sections. Furthermore, the Runx3 immunostaining was decreased together with a concomitant suppression of ATRAP expression in the affected kidney after 7 days of unilateral ureteral obstruction. These findings indicate that Runx3 plays a role in ATRAP gene expression in renal distal tubular cells both in vitro and in vivo.
