Gel shift assays were used to examine the binding of the lactose (lac) repressor to polyoperator DNA molecules. Specific binding was differentiated from nonspecific DNA association by (i) equilibrating repressor-operator complexes below the nonspecific association constant and (ii) demonstrating the effects of the inducer isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) on the formation of repressor-operator complexes. With the linear polyoperator molecules, all eight operator sites could be simultaneously bound by distinct repressors. However, with circular molecules, the eight operator sites were saturable by repressor only in the nicked circular state and not in the covalently closed circular form. Under the experimental conditions used, there was no evidence of bifunctional repressor binding or loop formation. The results suggest that the conformational perturbation of DNA that occurs upon specific repressor binding was retained in topologically closed molecules and could modify other operator sites so as to make them unavailable for specific binding.
