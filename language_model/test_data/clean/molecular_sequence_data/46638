The group-B of genus Coltivirus encompasses isolates from humans, ticks or mosquitoes collected in Indonesia and China. Subgroup-B1 includes the strain JKT/dsR-7075 and subgroup-B2 strains JKT/dsR-6423, JKT/dsR-6969, JKT/dsR-7043 and the Banna virus. Data are described for the PCR-based diagnosis of infection by group B coltiviruses. Sets of primers were designed from the sequences of the 7th, 9th and 12th viral segments and RT PCR assays were developed. Consensus primers permitted the detection of all known isolates of subgroup 1 or 2. Viral strains could be characterised further using primers specific for type B2a or B2b, or based on the length of the amplification products. All primers gave negative results when using RNAs from Orbiviruses or Group-A coltiviruses. These primers permitted the detection of Group-B coltiviruses-RNA in infected mouse blood at the acute stage of the disease. Accordingly, they could be used for the diagnosis of infection in humans.
