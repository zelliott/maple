A full-length cDNA encoding a serine carboxypeptidase (designated SmSCP-1) was recovered from an ongoing salivary gland EST project of the wheat midge. The deduced 461-amino acid sequence had a putative signal sequence at the amino terminus, indicating it was a secreted protein. The protein shared homology with serine carboxypeptidases from other insects, mammals, plants, and yeasts. SmSCP-1 mRNA was expressed in all stages of development and detected in salivary gland and fat body tissues but not in midgut tissue. Expression analysis and quantitative real-time PCR assays in male and female wheat midges and the fat body tissue of adult midges revealed that SmSCP-1 was up-regulated nearly four-fold in the female midges compared to males and nearly two-fold in female fat body compared to male fat body. The wheat midge serine carboxypeptidase (SmSCP-1) most likely has a dual function. As a secreted digestive enzyme, it could play a role in mobilizing host-plant seed reserves for feeding larvae and as expressed in fat body could function as an exopeptidase in degradation of vitellogenin and/or in post-translational processing of other enzymes.
