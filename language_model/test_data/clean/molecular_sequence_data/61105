PA protease (pro-aminopeptidase processing protease) activates the pro-aminopeptidases from Aeromonas caviae T-64 and Vibrio proteolytica by removal of their pro-regions. Cloning and sequencing of the PA protease gene revealed that PA protease was translated as a preproprotein consisting of four domains: a signal peptide; an N-terminal propeptide; a mature region; and a C-terminal propeptide. The deduced amino acid sequence of the PA protease precursor showed significant homology with several bacterial metalloproteases. Expression of the PA protease gene in Escherichia coli indicated that the N-terminal propeptide of the PA protease precursor is essential to obtain the active form of the protease. The N- and C-terminal propeptides of the expressed pro-PA protease were processed autocatalytically.
