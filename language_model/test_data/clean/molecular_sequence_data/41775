Peptide T, the HIV envelope-derived fragment Ala-Ser-Thr-Thr-Thr-Asn-Tyr-Thr, has already been used to successfully treat psoriatic patients without major side-effects. The underlying reason for the positive effect is, however, at present unknown. In the following minireview, we summarize today's knowledge regarding peptide T's interaction with other chemical messenger molecules, such as somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), within the human skin, and, finally, speculate about their relationship to each other. In summary, we believe that the clearance effect of peptide T on psoriasis will open up new avenues with regard to the concept of the pathogenesis of as well as the clinical attendance to this disease.
