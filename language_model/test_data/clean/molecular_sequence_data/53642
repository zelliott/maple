Continuous monitoring of the enzymatic activity of newly synthesized firefly luciferase in Escherichia coli cell-free translation system was performed to record folding kinetics of this multidomain eukaryotic protein in the prokaryotic cytosol. Whereas in vitro refolding of denatured luciferase in prokaryotic cytosol occurred with a low yield of active enzyme and took about an hour, the enzyme acquired its native structure immediately upon release from the ribosome, as seen from the immediate halt of active luciferase accumulation upon blocking of translation with inhibitors. The nascent luciferase was also capable of acquiring the active conformation prior to release from the ribosome, when its C terminus was extended with a polypeptide segment. Specific enzymatic activity of the firefly luciferase was found to be equally high irrespective of whether this protein was synthesized in eukaryotic or prokaryotic translation systems. The data presented demonstrate the fundamental ability of prokaryotic cytosol to support effective co-translational protein folding in general and co-translational folding of multidomain proteins in particular.
