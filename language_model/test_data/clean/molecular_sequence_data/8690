Cowdria ruminantium causes severe, often fatal disease in domestic ruminants, whereas wildlife species usually are not affected. Blood and bone marrow samples from healthy, free-ranging Zimbabwean ungulates were taken during translocation from areas harboring Amblyomma ticks and tested for the presence of C. ruminantium, using a PCR assay based on the C. ruminantium map1 gene. Positive reactions were obtained in tsessebe (Damaliscus lunatus), waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), and impala (Aepyceros melampus). Wildlife species may therefore be a reservoir for C. ruminantium thus contributing to the spread of cowdriosis.
