The predicted full-length cDNA sequence of the porcine Sar1b gene was characterized by assembling pig ESTs from GenBank. The coding sequence (CDS) shares high sequence identity with the corresponding sequences of human (93%) and mouse (91%). The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) displayed that porcine Sar1b gene is expressed in all eight tissues (liver, small intestine, stomach, heart, lung, spleen, muscle and fat). Analysis of the somatic cell hybrid panel (SCHP) and the INRA-University of Minnesota porcine radiation hybrid (IMpRH) panel indicated the gene maps to SSC2 (1/2 q24)-q29 and most closely links to the interleukin-4 (IL4) gene. One base-pair deletion polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) detected by PCR-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis shows allele frequency differences between Meishan, Yushan Black, Dahuabai, Qingping, Tibetan, Landrace, Large White and Duroc. The association analysis using pigs of Tongcheng, Landrace x (Large White x Tongcheng) and Large White x (Landrace x Tongcheng) suggested that the deletion polymorphism was associated with the porcine muscle pH value.
