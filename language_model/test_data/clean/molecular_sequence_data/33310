The citrus disease Huanglongbing (HLB) is highly destructive in many citrus-growing regions of the world. The putative causal agent of this disease, 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus', is difficult to culture, and Koch's postulates have not yet been fulfilled. As a result, efforts have focused on obtaining the genome sequence of 'Ca. L. asiaticus' in order to give insight on the physiology of this organism. In this work, three next-generation high-throughput sequencing platforms, 454, Solexa, and SOLiD, were used to obtain metagenomic DNA sequences from phloem tissue of Florida citrus trees infected with HLB. A culture-independent, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-independent analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA sequences showed that the only bacterium present within the phloem metagenome was 'Ca L. asiaticus'. No viral or viroid sequences were identified within the metagenome. By reference assembly, the phloem metagenome contained sequences that provided 26-fold coverage of the 'Ca. L. asiaticus' contigs in GenBank. By the same approach, phloem metagenomic data yielded less than 0.2-fold coverage of five other alphaproteobacterial genomes. Thus, phloem metagenomic DNA provided a PCR-independent means of verifying the presence of 'Ca L. asiaticus' in infected tissue and strongly suggests that no other disease agent was present in phloem. Analysis of these metagenomic data suggest that this approach has a detection limit of one 'Ca. Liberibacter' cell for every 52 phloem cells. The phloem sample sequenced here is estimated to have contained 1.7 'Ca. Liberibacter' cells per phloem cell.
