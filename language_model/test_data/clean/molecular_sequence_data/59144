Helicobacter pylori is a human pathogen associated with gastritis and peptic ulcer. Adhesion properties of H. pylori to various structures have been described in the literature, including evidence for sialic acid-binding. To study the specificity and frequency of sialic acid-binding, fourteen H. pylori strains were investigated using haemagglutination with derivatized erythrocytes carrying sialic acids only on defined glycans and using haemagglutination inhibition assays. From these studies H. pylori strains can be grouped into sialic acid-dependent and sialic acid-independent classes. The sialic acid-dependent strains require alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid for haemagglutination. The potential roles of sialic acid-dependent adhesions for H. pylori-related infections are discussed.
