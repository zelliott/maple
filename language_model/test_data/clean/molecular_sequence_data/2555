In summary, evidence of the relatedness of the Class I/II A1DHs of human and horse liver and the Class III A1DH of rat liver is seen at the primary, predicted secondary, and gene structural levels. The primary structural relationships support the functional significance of some (but not all) specific amino acid residues previously indicated by other studies.
