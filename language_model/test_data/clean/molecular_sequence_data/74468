Island ecosystems provide an opportunity to examine a range of evolutionary and ecological processes. The Chatham Islands are an isolated archipelago situated approximately 800 km east of New Zealand. Geological evidence indicates that the Chatham Islands re-emerged within the last 1-4 million years, following a prolonged period of marine inundation, and therefore the resident flora and fauna is the result of long-distance overwater dispersal. We examine the origin and post-colonization evolution of the Chatham Islands skink, Oligosoma nigriplantare nigriplantare, the sole reptile species occurring on the archipelago. We sampled O. n. nigriplantare from across nine islands within the Chatham Islands group, and representative samples from across the range of its closest relative, the New Zealand mainland common skink (Oligosoma nigriplantare polychroma). Our mitochondrial sequence data indicate that O. n. nigriplantare diverged from O. n. polychroma 5.86-7.29 million years ago. This pre-dates the emergence date for the Chatham Islands, but indicates that O. n. nigriplantare colonized the Chatham Islands via overwater dispersal on a single occasion. Despite the substantial morphological variability evident in O. n. nigriplantare, only relatively shallow genetic divergences (maximum divergence approximately 2%) were found across the Chatham Islands. Our analyses (haplotypic diversity, Phi(ST), analysis of molecular variance, and nested clade phylogeographical analysis) indicated restricted gene flow in O. n. nigriplantare resulting in strong differentiation between islands. However, the restrictions to gene flow might have only arisen recently as there was also a significant pattern of isolation by distance, possibly from when the Chatham Islands were a single landmass during Pleistocene glacial maxima when sea levels were lower. The level of genetic and morphological divergence between O. n. nigriplantare and O. n. polychroma might warrant their recognition as distinct species.
