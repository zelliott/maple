We applied the improved sensitivity and soft ionization characteristics of electrospray Ionization (ESI)-MS/MS and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization(MALDI)-time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) to analysis of the GPI-anchored C-terminal peptide derived from 5'-nucleotidase. ESI-MS/MS analysis was applied to the core structure (MW, 2,743). In the collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectrum, single-charged ions such as m/z 162 (glucosamine), 286 (mannose-phosphate-ethanolamine), and 447 ([mannose-phosphate-ethanolamine]-glucosamine) were clearly detected as characteristic fragment ions of the GPI-anchored peptide. On MALDI-TOF-MS analysis, heterogeneous peaks of GPI-anchored peptides were detected as single-charged ions in the positive mode. Product ions were obtained by post-source decay (PSD) of m/z 2,905 using curved field reflectron of TOF-MS. Most of the expected product ions derived from the GPI-anchored peptide, containing the core structure and an additional mannose side chain, were successively obtained. Thus, ESI-MS/MS and MALDI-TOF-PSD-MS proved to be effective and sensitive methods for analyzing the GPI-anchored peptide structure with less than 10 pmol of sample. These characteristic fragments or fragmentation patterns seem to be very useful for identification of GPI-anchored C-terminal peptides derived from any kind of GPI-anchored protein.
