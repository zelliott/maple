Promoters of RbcS genes may contain a GS-box, which is a cis element with a core sequence related to the G-box, but split by a spacer of about 14 bp. Here we describe GSBF1, a DNA-binding protein that specifically interacts with a GS-box element located proximal to the G-box in the Brassica napus RbcS IV promoter. Sequence analysis of GSBF1 revealed a basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) domain that displays structural features distinct from that of G-box binding factors (GBFs). Gel shift experiments showed that recombinant GSBF1 does not efficiently bind to the continuous G-box motif. RNA gel blot analysis indicated that GSBF1 transcripts are cotyledon-specific and accumulate to the highest levels during late seedling development in a ligh-dependent manner. During the same time period, RbcS IV transcript levels decreased simultaneously, suggesting that GSBF1 acts as a developmental, stage-specific, negative regulator of RbcS IV gene expression in rape seedlings.
