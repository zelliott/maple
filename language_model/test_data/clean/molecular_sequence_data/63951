Chasmagnathus granulata phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) cDNA from jaw muscle was cloned and sequenced, showing a specific domain to bind phosphoenolpyruvate in addition to the kinase-1 and kinase-2 motifs to bind guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and Mg(2+), respectively, specific for all PEPCKs. In the kinase-1 motifs the GK was changed to RK. The first 19 amino acids of the putative enzyme contain hydrophobic amino acids and hydroxylated residues specific to a mitochondrial type signal. The PEPCK is expressed in hepatopancreas, muscles, nervous system, heart, and gills. Hyperosmotic stress for 24 h increased the PEPCK mRNA level, gluconeogenic and PEPCK activities in muscle.
