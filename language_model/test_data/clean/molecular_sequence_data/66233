Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the essential infectious agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). Despite first sequencing studies did not find any association between PCV2 sequences and PMWS occurrence, recent works have suggested the opposite. In the present study, 87 open reading frame 2 (ORF2) sequences obtained from pigs with different clinical conditions and coming from farms with different PMWS status were analyzed. Results further confirmed the existence of two genogroups and the definition of two PCV2 genotypes (1 and 2) is proposed. All sequences included in genotype 1 came from pigs from PMWS affected farms, while all sequences obtained from non-PMWS affected farms corresponded to genotype 2. Moreover, infection of single pigs from PMWS affected farms harbouring both genotypes is described. Present results suggest that PCV2 genotype 1 may potentially be more pathogenic than PCV2 genotype 2.
