In this paper we describe the assembly and restriction map of a 1.05-Mb cosmid contig spanning the candidate region for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), a recessively inherited disorder of inflammation localized to 16p13.3. Using a combination of cosmid walking and screening for P1, PAC, BAC, and YAC clones, we have generated a contig of genomic clones spanning approximately 1050 kb that contains the FMF critical region. The map consists of 179 cosmid, 15 P1, 10 PAC, 3 BAC, and 17 YAC clones, anchored by 27 STS markers. Eight additional STSs have been developed from the approximately 700 kb immediately centromeric to this genomic region. Five of the 35 STSs are microsatellites that have not been previously reported. NotI and EcoRI mapping of the overlapping cosmids, hybridization of restriction fragments from cosmids to one another, and STS analyses have been used to validate the assembly of the contig. Our contig totally subsumes the 250-kb interval recently reported, by founder haplotype analysis, to contain the FMF gene. Thus, our high-resolution clone map provides an ideal resource for transcriptional mapping toward the eventual identification of this disease gene.
