Expression E. coli plasmid were constructed in which the human interleukin-4 (hIL4) synthetic gene is controlled by tac promoter. The expression level of the gene depends on the distance between RBS and the initial codon ATG, with the maximal production in case of the nine base pair distance. The recombinant protein, accumulated in the inclusion bodies, was solubilized, renaturated, and purified to homogeneous, biologically active preparation, the yield being 2 mg/g wet cells.
