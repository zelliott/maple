Phylogenetic analysis of foamy virus sequences obtained from Bornean and Sumatran orangutans showed a distinct clustering pattern. One subcluster was represented by both Bornean and Sumatran orangutan simian foamy viruses (SFV). Combined analysis of host mitochondrial DNA and SFV phylogeny provided evidence for the hypothesis of the repopulation of Sumatra by orangutans from Borneo.
