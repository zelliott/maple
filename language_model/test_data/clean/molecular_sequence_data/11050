Brucella usually carry two highly homologous genes (omp2a and omp2b) for porin-like proteins. In several B. abortus biovars the omp2a gene has a large deletion compared to other Brucella omp2's. In this study we have measured Omp2 pore activity in planar bilayers. Omp2b exhibits well-defined trimeric channel activity whilst Omp2a forms monomeric pores of variable size which are smaller than Omp2b. No sequence homology exists between Omp2 and porins of known structure, so hydrophobic moment analysis has been used to model their membrane topology. From this it appears likely that the deletion removes the crucial L3 internal loop.
