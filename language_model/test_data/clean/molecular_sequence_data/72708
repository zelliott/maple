The flagellum of Salmonella typhimurium is assembled in stages, and the negative regulatory protein, FlgM, is able to sense the completion of an intermediate stage of assembly, the basal body-hook (BBH) structure. Mutations in steps leading to the formation of the BBH structure do not express the flagellar filament structural genes, fliC and fljB, due to negative regulation by FlgM (K. L. Gillen and K. T. Hughes, J. Bacteriol. 173:6453-6459, 1991). We have discovered another novel regulatory gene, flk, which appears to sense the completion of another assembly stage in the flagellar morphogenic pathway just prior to BBH formation: the completion of the P- and L-rings. Cells that are unable to assemble the L- or P-rings do not express the flagellin structural genes. Mutations by insertional inactivation in either the flk or flgM locus allow expression of the fljB flagellin structural gene in strains defective in flagellar P- and L-ring assembly. Mutations in the flgM gene, but not mutations in the flk gene, allow expression of the fljB gene in strains defective in all of the steps leading to BBH formation. The flk gene was mapped to min 52 of the S. typhimurium linkage map between the pdxB and fabB loci. A null allele of flk was complemented in trans by a flk+ allele present in a multicopy pBR-based plasmid. DNA sequence analysis of the flk gene has revealed it to be identical to a gene of Escherichia coli of unknown function which has an overlapping, divergent promoter with the pdxB gene promoter (P. A. Schoenlein, B. B. Roa, and M. E. Winkler, J. Bacteriol. 174:6256-6263, 1992). An open reading frame of 333 amino acids corresponding to the flk gene product of S. typhimurium and 331 amino acids from the E. coli sequence was identified. The transcriptional start site of the S. typhimurium flk gene was determined and transcription of the flk gene was independent of the FlhDC and sigma28 flagellar transcription factors. The Flk protein observed in a T7 RNA polymerase-mediated expression system showed an apparent molecular mass of 35 kDa, slightly smaller than the predicted size of 37 kDa. The predicted structure of Flk is a mostly hydrophilic protein with a very C-terminal membrane-spanning segment preceded by positively charged amino acids. This finding predicts Flk to be inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane facing inside the cytoplasm.
