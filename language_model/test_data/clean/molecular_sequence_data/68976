A recombinant DNA clone, pC4.H32, identifies distinguishable restriction fragment patterns from different Plasmodium falciparum clones. Analysis of these DNA fingerprint patterns from parasites cultivated over several years and from progeny of a P. falciparum cross showed the fingerprints to be mitotically and meiotically stable. Restriction fragments from the parents of the cross possessed sufficient polymorphism and number to generate 14 unique fingerprint patterns in 16 independent recombinant progeny. The pC4.H32 insert contains a 0.5-kb imperfectly repeated sequence found in subtelomeric regions of multiple chromosomes. Restriction site variations both within and outside of the 0.5-kb repeat contribute to the fingerprint polymorphisms. Fingerprint analysis can serve to type P. falciparum clones and can detect mislabeling and cross-contamination of parasite stocks.
