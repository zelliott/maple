In this review, we describe the structure and biological properties of calcitonin receptor-stimulating peptide-1 (CRSP-1), CRSP-2 and CRSP-3, the novel members of the CGRP family. CRSP-1, which has been identified in the pig, cow, dog, and horse, is a specific ligand for the calcitonin (CT) receptor, and porcine CRSP-1 elicits a 100-fold greater effect on a recombinant porcine CT receptor than porcine CT, although this peptide has high structural similarity with CGRP. CRSP-1 is expressed and synthesized mainly in the central nervous system (CNS), pituitary and thyroid gland. In an in vivo experiment, bolus administration of CRSP-1 into rats reduced the plasma calcium concentration, but did not alter blood pressure, indicating its action as a CT receptor agonist in the peripheral circulation. In the CNS, CRSP-1 is also deduced to be an endogenous agonist for the CT receptor. CRSP-2 has been identified in the pig and dog, and CRSP-3 has been identified only in the pig. They are expressed and synthesized mainly in the CNS and thyroid gland. However, their endogenous molecular forms, receptors, and biological activity remain unidentified.
