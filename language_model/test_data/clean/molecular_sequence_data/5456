For investigation of the relation of cell cycle regulation with tumorigenesis in cats, we carried out molecular cloning of feline p21WAF1 and p27Kip1 cDNAs and chromosomal mapping of these genes on the cat genome. The feline p21WAF1 cDNA clone obtained in this study encoded 164 amino acids (aa) showing 83.5% and 76.8% sequence similarity with those of the human and mouse counterparts, respectively. The cat p27Kip1 cDNA clone isolated here encoded 198 aa, showing sequence similarities of 93.4% and 90.4% with its human and mouse counterparts, respectively. Using a panel of feline x rodent somatic cell hybrids, the feline CDKN1A (p21WAF1) and CDKN1B (p27Kip1) loci were assigned to feline chromosomes B2 and B4, respectively. Southern-blot analyses of 17 feline spontaneous leukemia and lymphoma cases using these cDNAs as probes did not reveal any rearrangements in either the p21WAF1 or the p27Kip1 gene. RT-PCR/SSCP (single strand conformation polymorphism) analysis of p27Kip1 cDNA did not uncover any amino acid substitutions in the 10 feline leukemia and lymphoma cases that were examined.
