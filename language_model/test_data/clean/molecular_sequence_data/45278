Organic solvent tolerant microorganisms (OSTMs) are novel group of extremophilic microorganisms that have developed resistance to withstand solvent toxicity. These organisms play an important role in biotransformation of organic compounds. In the present study, we used an organic solvent-tolerant marine bacterium, Moraxella sp. MB1. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that the bacterium shows 98% similarity with an uncultured marine bacterium with GenBank accession no. AY936933. This bacterium was used for the transformation of a toxin, citrinin, into decarboxycitrinin in a biphasic system. This transformation was affected by decarboxylase enzyme produced by MB1. Transformation of citrinin to decarboxycitrinin was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and spectrophotometrically. Citrinin decarboxylase activity responsible for transformation was studied in cell-free growth medium and cell lysate of Moraxella sp. MB1. Citrinin decarboxylase was found to be intracellular in nature. The biotransformed product was purified and identified as decarboxycitrinin using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry. The antibiotic activity of both citrinin and decarboxycitrinin is also reported.
