We previously reported the identification of the human CAP and CAP2 genes which encode proteins related to the yeast adenylyl cyclase (CYR)-associated CAP protein. The rat CAP homolog, MCH1, has also been previously cloned. We have cloned a cDNA encoding the rat homolog of CAP2. Rat CAP/MCH1 and CAP2 are 63% identical to each other. Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, we have examined CAP/MCH1 and CAP2 mRNA levels in various adult rat tissues. Our results show a dramatic difference in the pattern of expression of these two genes. Consistent with previous reports, we detected CAP/MCH1 mRNA in all tissues examined; however, levels vary substantially between tissues. In particular, we found that CAP/MCH1 mRNA are present at relatively high levels in spleen, testes and lung, at moderate levels in brain, kidney, liver and small intestine, and at significantly lower levels in heart, skeletal muscle and skin. We have also investigated the levels of CAP/MCH1 in rat tissues by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody raised against a human CAP::GST fusion protein. In general, we find that the CAP/MCH1 mRNA levels reflect the amount of CAP/MCH1 found in different tissues. In contrast, CAP2 transcripts were present at relatively high levels in testes, at moderate levels in brain, heart and skeletal muscle, at lower levels in lung, skin, kidney and small intestine, and were undetectable in liver or spleen. The differences between the sequences and expression patterns of CAP/MCH1 and CAP2 are significant and suggest that these proteins have distinct functional roles.
