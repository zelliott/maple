The receptor for the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) associates the low affinity binding component gp190 and the high affinity converter gp130. Both are members of the hematopoietic receptors family characterized by the cytokine receptor homology (CRH) domain, which consists of two barrel-like modules of around 100 amino acids each. The gp190 is among the very few members of this large family to contain two CRH domains. The membrane-distal one (herein called D1) is followed by an immunoglobulin-like domain, a membrane-proximal CRH domain called D2, and three type III fibronectin-like repeats. A minimal D1IgD2 fragment is required for binding LIF. By using transmembrane forms of deletion mutants in gp190 ectodomain, we demonstrated that removal of D1 led to spontaneous activation of the receptor and that this property was devoted to a peptidic sequence localized within the last 42 amino acids of the carboxyl-terminal module of D2. By using soluble forms of deletion mutants made by progressive truncations from the end of the D1IgD2 fragment, we demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal module of D2 was dispensable for LIF binding and that the correct conformation of the D1Ig fragment required a full amino-terminal module of D2. Therefore, the two constitutive modules of the membrane-proximal CRH domain D2 of gp190 fulfill two distinct roles in gp190 function, i.e. in stabilizing the conformation of gp190 allowing LIF binding and in activating the receptor.
