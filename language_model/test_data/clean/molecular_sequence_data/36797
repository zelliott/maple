Oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing a mutagenic base analog, N4-aminocytosine, 5'-AATTGC(am)AATT-3' and 5'-AATTAC(am)AATT-3' (C(am); N4-aminocytosine) were prepared by chemical modification of 5'-AATTGCAATT-3' and 5'-AATTACAATT-3', respectively. The values of Tm were 29 degrees C for 5'-AATTGC(am)AATT-3' and 32 degrees C for 5'-AATTGCAATT-3'. In contrast, no melting was observed for 5'-AATTAC(am)AATT-3' and 5'-AATTACAATT-3'. These data show that the stability of C(am)-purine paris is C(am)-G > C(am)-A and that C(am)-G is less stable than C-G. This property is consistent with the incorporation specificity of N4-amino-dCTP during DNA synthesis in vitro.
