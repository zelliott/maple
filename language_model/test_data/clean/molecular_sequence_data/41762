Sequencing and computer analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the variola virus strain India-1967 (VAR) genome segment (43069 bp) from the region of HindIII C, E, R, Q, K, H DNA fragments has been carried out. Forty-three potential open reading frames (ORFs) have been identified, and the polypeptides encoded by them have been compared with the analogous proteins of vaccinia virus strain Copenhagen (COP). ORF E7R of VAR is much shorter than the COP analog. The other polypeptides coded by the potential ORFs of VAR are highly conserved in comparison with COP. Possible functions of the predicted viral polypeptides are discussed.
