During the recent cloning of the mouse Lyst gene we developed both a high-resolution genetic map and a complete YAC and BAC contig of the Lyst critical region on mouse Chromosome 13. We also report the mapping of the human homologue of the mouse Lyst gene (LYST) to 1q43. These data are consistent with LYST being the gene for the human Chediak-Higashi Syndrome and strengthen the synteny relationship between MMU13 and human 1q43.
