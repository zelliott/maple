An unknown Gram-positive, catalase-negative, facultatively anaerobic, coccus-shaped organism originating as a contaminant of snuff was characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies demonstrated that the bacterium represents a new subline within the genus Facklamia. The unknown bacterium was readily distinguished from Facklamis hominis and Facklamia ignava by biochemical tests and electrophoretic analysis of whole-cell proteins. On the basis of phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium be classified as Facklamia tabacinasalis sp. nov., the type strain of which is CCUG 30090T.
