Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is caused by expansion of a polyglutamine tract in ataxin-2, a protein of unknown function. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified a novel protein, A2BP1 (ataxin-2 binding protein 1) which binds to the C-terminus of ataxin-2. Northern blot analysis showed that A2BP1 was predominantly expressed in muscle and brain. By immunocfluorescent staining, A2BP1 and ataxin-2 were both localized to the trans -Golgi network. Immunocytochemistry showed that A2BP1 was expressed in the cytoplasm of Purkinje cells and dentate neurons in a pattern similar to that seen for ataxin-2 labeling. Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions indicated enrichment of A2BP1 in the same fractions as ataxin-2. Sequence analysis of the A2BP1 cDNA revealed an RNP motif that is highly conserved among RNA-binding proteins. A2BP1 had striking homology with a human cDNA clone, P83A20, of unknown function and at least two copies of A2BP1 homologs are found in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome database. A2BP1 and related proteins appear to form a novel gene family sharing RNA-binding motifs.
