Telomeric fragments of human DNA ranging in size from 50 to 250 kilobases were cloned into Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a yeast-artificial-chromosome (YAC) vector. Six human-telomeric YAC (HTY) strains were selected by virtue of the specific hybridization of their DNA with the human telomeric terminal-repeat sequence (TTAGGG)n, and the telomeric localization of this sequence within each YAC was demonstrated by its sensitivity to nuclease BAL-31. In situ hybridization of DNA from three of these HTY strains with human metaphase chromosomes yielded discrete patterns of hybridization signals at the telomeres of a limited number of human chromosomes, different for each clone. DNA from selected cosmid subclones of one of the HTY strains was used to localize the origin of the cloned telomeric DNA by in situ hybridization to the tip of the long arm of chromosome 7.
