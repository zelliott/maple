Phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes of 15 kDa (PEA-15) is a small protein that was first identified as an abundant phosphoprotein in brain. PEA-15 was characterised so far at the immunochemical level and by a microsequencing attempt. In order to update characterisation of this important structure by advanced methodology unambiguously identifying proteins independent of antibody availability and specificity, we used a proteomic method for this purpose: Performing protein profiling in mouse hippocampi using two dimensional gel electrophoresis with subsequent mass spectrometrical (MS/MS) identification we detected this protein and demonstrate proteomic characterisation of PEA-15 (Q62048). This study enables further specific and unambiguous determination serving as an analytical tool.
