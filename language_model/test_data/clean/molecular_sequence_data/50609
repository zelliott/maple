The genomic organization at the 3' end of canine coronavirus (CCV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) was determined by sequence analysis and compared to that of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine. Comparison of the latter two has previously revealed an extra open reading frame (ORF) at the 3' end of the FIPV genome, lacking in TGEV, which is currently designated ORF 6b. Both CCV and FECV possess 6b-related ORFs at the 3' ends of their genomes. The presence of ORF 6b in three of four viruses in this antigenic cluster strongly suggests that TGEV has lost this ORF by deletion. The CCV ORF 6b is collinear with that of FIPV, but the predicted amino acid sequences are only 58% identical. The FECV ORF 6b contains a large deletion compared to that of FIPV, reducing the collinear part to 60%. The sequence homologies were highest between CCV and TGEV on the one hand and between FECV and FIPV on the other. Previously, we showed that the expression product of the FIPV ORF 6b can be detected in infected cells by immunoprecipitation (Vennema et al., 1992). In the present study we have performed similar experiments with CCV and FECV. In infected cells both viruses produced proteins related to but different from the FIPV 6b protein.
