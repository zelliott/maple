A proteinase was isolated from calf thymus that degraded pADPRT, histone H1 and alpha-casein in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. In a five-step procedure, a homogenous proteinase was obtained with a subunit structure of 80 and 30 kDa. The amino-acid homology of an internal sequence as well as kinetic and inhibitor assays identified the proteinase as calpain I. It is suggested that even though the general substrate alpha-casein is widely used for the assaying of calpains, more appropriately physiological cellular components (pADPRT and histone H1) specify the thymus proteinase.
