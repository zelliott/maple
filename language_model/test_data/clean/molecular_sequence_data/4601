In experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), peripheral nerves are infiltrated by T-lymphocytes and macrophages. By RT-PCR and sequence analysis we characterized TCR V beta-element usage in sciatic nerve tissue of Lewis rats suffering from EAN induced by immunization with peripheral myelin antigens. Several TCR V beta-chain sequences were detected, which did not show homology to sequences of P2-reactive T cells published so far. In EAN induced with peripheral nerve myelin, but not with P2-protein or P2 peptide aa 53-78, TCR V beta 8.2 sequences identical to sequences of encephalitogenic myelin basic protein (MBP) reactive T-cells were identified. These results provide further evidence for a contribution of MBP-directed T-cell reactivity to the pathogenesis of myelin induced EAN and may have implications for the pathogenesis of human demyelinating neuropathies.
