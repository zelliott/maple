The widely conserved SUF system is involved in Fe-S cluster repair and biogenesis. In cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, transcription of the sufBCDS operon encoding the Suf complex is negatively regulated by the upstream sufR gene encoded by the complementary strand. In this report, two promoters for the sufBCDS operon (P1 and P2) and another promoter for sufR (PsufR) was identified, and it was shown that P1 was activated by a shift to high light conditions. We also showed that Thermosynechococcus SufR negatively regulated P1 and PsufR but not P2, in a reconstituted in vitro transcription system using His(6)-tagged RNA polymerase.
