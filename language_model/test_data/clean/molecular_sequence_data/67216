A cystatin alpha-sensitive cysteine proteinase that plays an important role in the lysosomal inactivation and degradation of L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was purified by column chromatography from an ammonium sulfate precipitate of lysosome extract prepared from rat livers. It was eluted with marked delay from cathepsins B and H in a Sephacryl S-200 column by its specific interaction with the gel, and then effectively separated from cathepsins B and H and other proteins. It was eluted with 0.5 M NaCl after washing with 0.2 M NaCl in a CM-Sephadex column, indicating that it showed the same elution behavior as cathepsin L from the CM-Sephadex column. It had activity to hydrolyze z-Phe-Arg-NH-Mec, a synthetic substrate for cysteine proteinases, including cathepsins B and L. The N-terminal sequences of the final preparation of LDH-inactivating enzyme were identical with those of rat cathepsin L. Inactivation and degradation of LDH by the final preparation were observed and effectively inhibited by a low level of cystatin alpha as well as a general cysteine proteinase inhibitor, leupeptin or (L-3-trans-carboxyoxirane-2-carbonyl)-L-leucine (3-methylbutyl)amide (E-64-c). From these results, it is concluded that cathepsin L plays a critical role in the lysosomal degradation of native LDH.
