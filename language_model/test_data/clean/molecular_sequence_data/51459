The preparation of 2,3,4-tri-O-benzyl- (3), 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl- (4), and 2,3,4-tri-O-benzoyl-N-(2,2-diethoxycarbonylvinyl)-6-O-trityl-beta- D-glucopyranosylamine (5) is described. The reaction of 3-5 with 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl bromide yields 2,3,4-tri-O-benzyl- (9), 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl- (10), and 2,3,4-tri-O-benzoyl-N-(2,2-diethoxycarbonylvinyl)-6-O-(2,3,4,6-tet ra-O- acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosylamine (11), respectively. 2,3,4-Tri-O-benzyl- (6), 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl- (7), and 2,3,4-tri-O- benzoyl-N-(2,2-diethoxycarbonylvinyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosylamine (8) are also described.
