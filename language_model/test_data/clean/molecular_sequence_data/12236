Four kinds of circular plasmid-like DNA, designated B1, B2, B3 and B4, have been found in the mitochondria of rice (Oryza sativa L.). We analyzed the distribution of families of plasmid-like DNAs homologous to those of O. sativa in 40 strains of the genus Oryza with AA, BB, BBCC, CC, CCDD and EE genomes. Plasmid-like DNAs were observed only strains having AA, CC and CCDD genomes. The distribution patterns of strains with AA genome were highly polymorphic. We amplified the plasmid-like DNAs from strains with the AA genome by PCR and examined restriction fragments length polymorphisms (RFLPs). RFLPs were detected among families of plasmid-like DNA amplified from different strains. This result indicated that some mutations, such as base substitutions and the insertion or deletion of a small fragment of DNA, had occurred and had accumulated during the differentiation of strains with an AA genome.
