The cDNA encoding the precursor of the pigment dispersing hormone (PDH) of the shore crab, Carcinus maenas, was isolated and sequenced. The precursor consists of a putative 22 amino acid signal peptide, a putative 33 residue peptide of unknown function, and the 18 amino acid mature PDH, followed by a Gly residue which serves as a possible amide donor. The deduced mature PDH amino acid sequence is identical to those of Uca pugilator and Cancer magister, previously determined by Edman degradation.
