Ceratotoxins are alpha-helical cationic peptides isolated from the medfly Ceratitis capitata. These amphipathic peptides were found to display strong antibacterial activity and weak hemolytic activity. When reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers, ceratotoxins developed highly asymmetric I/V curves under voltage ramps and formed, in single-channel experiments, well-defined voltage-dependent ion channels according to the barrel stave model. The antibacterial activity and pore-forming properties of these molecules were well correlated. Similar experiments performed with synthesized truncated fragments showed that the C-terminal domain of ceratotoxins is strongly implicated in the formation of helical bundles in the membrane whereas the largely cationic N-terminal region is likely to anchor ceratotoxins on the lipid surface.
