Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine mainly secreted by macrophages and T-cells that play a key role in the pathogenesis of many infectious and inflammatory diseases. The TNF gene cluster is located within the class-III region of the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex on human chromosome 6p21. A cluster of six multiallelic microsatellites has been identified in the TNF region, named TNF a-e. TNFb, TNFc, TNFd, and TNFe are (GA)n repeats, whereas TNFa and TNFf are (GT)n and (CA)n repeats, respectively. The TNFd microsatellite locus maps 8-10 kb centromeric to the TNF-alpha gene, downstream to the TNF-beta gene.
