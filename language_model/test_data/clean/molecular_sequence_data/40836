The direct observation of binding and release of spectroscopically silent metal ions such as Zn(2+) and Ca(2+) by proteins has been challenging before the advent of native electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. This report highlights the powerful capability of ESI-MS to provide insight into metalloprotein speciation that is independent of any spectroscopic property. Using the zinc-binding plant metallothionein E(C) from wheat as a study case, we show that ESI-MS is unique amongst other techniques in capturing intermediary metallospecies that evolve during the course of metal transfer to the chelator EDTA, as a model reaction to mimic the biological function of the protein as a zinc donor. Zinc release from the two-domain protein E(C) appears to be extremely rapid and non-cooperative, and progresses with loss of one zinc ion from the fully loaded Zn(6) species, and a transient build-up of Zn(5) and Zn(4) species, which further react to give species with 0-3 zinc ions bound. (1)H NMR data has provided further insights into the different behaviour of the two domains upon metal depletion.
