An antisense oligonucleotide (54 mer) from the mRNA to the midsize neurofilament protein (NFM) was labeled with 35S on the 3' end and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). In situ hybridization was performed on sections from medulla oblongata of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The slides were dipped in photographic emulsion, developed, and stained. Neurons from both nucleus hypoglossus and nucleus ambiguous showed a marked reduction of silver grains when compared to normal. This indicates a reduction of mRNA, which may precede the reduction of ribosomal RNA and the changes in neurofilament proteins that have been described by several investigators in ALS. It does not settle the question of whether the reduction of mRNA is owing to reduced transcription or increased decay of mRNA.
