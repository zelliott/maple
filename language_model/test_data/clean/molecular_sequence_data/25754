Thrombomodulin is an endothelial cell surface receptor for thrombin that acts as a physiological anticoagulant. The properties of recombinant human thrombomodulin were studied in COS-7, CHO, CV-1, and K562 cell lines. Thrombomodulin was expressed on the cell surface as shown by the acquisition of thrombin-dependent protein C activation. Like native thrombomodulin, recombinant thrombomodulin contained N-linked oligosaccharides, had Mr approximately 100,000, and was inhibited or immunoprecipitated by anti-thrombomodulin antibodies. Binding studies demonstrated that nonrecombinant thrombomodulin expressed by A549 carcinoma cells and recombinant thrombomodulin expressed by CV-1 and K562 cells had similar Kd's for thrombin of 1.3 nM, 3.3 nM, and 4.7 nM, respectively. The Kd for DIP-thrombin binding to recombinant thrombomodulin on CV-1(18A) cells was identical with that of thrombin. Increasing concentrations of hirudin or fibrinogen progressively inhibited the binding of 125I-DIP-thrombin, while factor Va did not inhibit binding. Three synthetic peptides were tested for ability to inhibit DIP-thrombin binding. Both the hirudin peptide Hir53-64 and the thrombomodulin fifth-EGF-domain peptide Tm426-444 displaced DIP-thrombin from thrombomodulin, but the factor V peptide FacV30-43 which is similar in composition and charge to Hir53-64 showed no binding inhibition. The data exclude the significant formation of a ternary complex consisting of thrombin, thrombomodulin, and hirudin. These studies are consistent with a model in which thrombomodulin, hirudin, and fibrinogen compete for binding to DIP-thrombin at the same site.
