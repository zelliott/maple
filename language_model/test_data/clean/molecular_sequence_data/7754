Human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), a myelin component of the central nervous system, is a candidate target antigen for autoimmune-mediated demyelination. We have isolated and sequenced part of a cosmid clone that contains the entire human MOG gene. The primary nuclear transcript, extending from the putative start of transcription to the site of poly(A) addition, is 15,561 nucleotides in length. The human MOG gene contains 8 exons, separated by 7 introns; canonical intron/exon boundary sites are observed at each junction. The introns vary in size from 242 to 6484 bp and contain numerous repetitive DNA elements, including 14 Alu sequences within 3 introns. Another Alu element is located in the 3'-untranslated region of the gene. Alu sequences were classified with respect to subfamily assignment. Seven hundred sixty-three nucleotides 5' of the transcription start and 1214 nucleotides 3' of the poly(A) addition sites were also sequenced. The 5'-flanking region revealed the presence of several consensus sequences that could be relevant in the transcription of the MOG gene, in particular binding sites in common with other myelin gene promoters. Two polymorphic intragenic dinucleotide (CA)n and tetranucleotide (TAAA)n repeats were identified and may provide genetic marker tools for association and linkage studies.
