Recently, a procedure for detecting ROS-sensitive proteins that contain active cysteine residues was devdoped. The method is based on the fact that biotin-conjugated iodoacetamide (BIAM) and ROS competitively and selectively react with the active cysteine residues in ROS-sensitive proteins. To investigate the role of ROS in cervical cancer, BIAM labeling on cytosolic proteins in normal and cancer tissues was performed, respectively. The BIAM labeling proteins are separated by 2-dimensional electrophoresis, and then identified by MALDI-TOF mass analysis. ROS-sensitive protein is identified as creatine kinase B containing cysteine residue in active center. Activity of creatine kinase B in normal tissue is higher than that of oxidized form in cervical cancer tissues. The result suggests that ROS play an important role in metabolic regulation in cervical cancer cells. However, molecular mechanisms that ROS and creatine kinase B are integrated into a physiological signal leading to the cellular transformation remain to be elucidated.
