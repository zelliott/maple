Conventional PCR-based direct sequencing of candidate genes for a family with X-linked leucoencephalopathy with unknown aetiology failed to identify any causative mutations.

To carry out exome sequencing of entire transcripts of the whole X chromosome to investigate a family with X linked leucoencephalopathy.

Next-generation sequencing of all the transcripts of the X chromosome, after liquid-based genome partitioning, was performed on one of the two affected male subjects (the proband) and an unaffected male subject (his brother). A nonsense mutation in MCT8 (c.1102Aâ†’T (p.R368X)) was identified in the proband. Subsequent PCR-based direct sequencing of other family members confirmed the presence of this mutation, hemizygous in the other affected brother and heterozygous in the proband's mother and maternal grandmother. MCT8 mutations usually cause abnormal thyroid function in addition to neurological abnormalities, but this proband had normal thyroid function.

Single-lane exome next-generation sequencing is sufficient to fully analyse all the transcripts of the X chromosome. This method is particularly suitable for mutation screening of X-linked recessive disorders and can avoid biases in candidate gene choice.
