Differential regulation of genetic resistance to infectious disease may partially be explained by variation in the binding affinity and the repertoire of pathogen-derived antigenic peptides associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. In this study, we investigated characteristics of peptides that bind to the bovine MHC allele BoLA-DRB3*2703, which is associated with occurrence of clinical mastitis in Holstein dairy cattle, and assigned a putative peptide-binding motif to this allele. This was achieved by in vitro expression of allele *2703 as well as a control allele, BoLA-DRB3*1201 which is present at high frequency in Holsteins. Transfected cell lines alone (for allele *1201) or in combination with blood mononuclear cells from an animal homozygous for allele *2703 were used as the source of naturally processed and presented peptides. Subsequent to elution of peptides from BoLA-DR+ cells, their sequences were determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Eluted peptides were between 13 and 20 amino acids long and the majority were in sets of overlapping sequences. These peptides were derived from intra- and extracellular proteins, as well as foreign proteins present in the culture medium. Some peptides had originated from molecular chaperones present in the endoplasmic reticulum, such as ER-60 and GRP78, pointing to some degree of overlap and cross-sampling between MHC class I and class II antigen presentation pathways. Consistent with reports of human and mouse MHC class II-associated peptides, putative peptide-binding motifs could be assigned to alleles *2703 and *1201, comprising a hydrophobic or an aromatic residue at relative position 1, a hydrophobic residue at position 4 and a small residue at position 6 of the eluted peptides. These findings provide the foundation for future studies of molecular mechanisms of MHC-disease associations of cattle.
