The toluene dioxygenase genes derived from Pseudomonas putida NCIMB 11767 were subcloned from a previously constructed recombinant plasmid, pIG, using pUC18 as the cloning vector and E. coli TG2 as the host strain. The resulting strain, E. coli TG2 (p1/1), produced toluene cis-glycol when grown in LB broth or minimal medium in the presence of toluene. Restriction mapping and partial DNA sequencing provided evidence for the presence of ORFs with extensive homology to parts of the tod operon from P. putida F1. The clones exhibited some residual toluene cis-glycol dehydrogenase activity which resulted in the formation of small amounts of 3-methylcatechol. Expression of the dioxygenase was induced by toluene, but was not directed by the lac promoter within the cloning vector. The clones were assessed for toluene cis-glycol production in pH-controlled batch cultures, and the maximum product concentration obtained was 1.02 g l-1. Product formation was dependent upon the presence of glucose in the culture medium. Although the substrate was toxic, the biotransformation was apparently limited by the supply of toluene. The results suggest that it should be possible to improve toluene cis-glycol production by recombinants substantially by improving both the strain and fermentation process.
