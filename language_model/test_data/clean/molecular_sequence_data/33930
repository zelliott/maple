Glaciecola sp. strain 4H-3-7+YE-5 was isolated from subseafloor sediments at Suruga Bay in Japan and is capable of efficiently hydrolyzing cellulose and xylan. The complete genome sequence of Glaciecola sp. 4H-3-7+YE-5 revealed several genes encoding putatively novel glycoside hydrolases, offering a high potential for plant biomass degradation.
