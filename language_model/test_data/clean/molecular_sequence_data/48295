There is increasing evidence suggesting that dysregulation of certain microRNAs (miRNAs) may contribute to tumor progression and metastasis. Previous studies have shown that miR-409-3p is dysregulated in some malignancies, but its role in bladder cancer is still unknown. Here, we find that miR-409-3p is down-regulated in human bladder cancer tissues and cell lines. Enforced expression of miR-409-3p in bladder cancer cells significantly reduced their migration and invasion without affecting cell viability. Bioinformatics analysis identified the pro-metastatic gene c-Met as a potential miR-409-3p target. Further studies indicated that miR-409-3p suppressed the expression of c-Met by binding to its 3'-untranslated region. Silencing of c-Met by small interfering RNAs phenocopied the effects of miR-409-3p overexpression, whereas restoration of c-Met in bladder cancer cells bladder cancer cells overexpressing miR-409-3p, partially reversed the suppressive effects of miR-409-3p. We further showed that MMP2 and MMP9 may be downstream effector proteins of miR-409-3p. These findings indicate that miR-409-3p could be a potential tumor suppressor in bladder cancer.
