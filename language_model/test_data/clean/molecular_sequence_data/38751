The expression of bone sialoprotein (BSP) is normally restricted to mineralized connective tissues of bones and teeth where it has been associated with mineral crystal formation. However, recent studies have revealed ectopic expression of BSP in various lesions, including oral and extraoral carcinomas, in which it has been associated with the formation of microcrystalline deposits and the metastasis of cancer cells to bone. To develop a model to study the induction of BSP in carcinoma development, BSP expression in squamous-cell carcinomas induced by chemical carcinogen in the hamster cheek-pouch epithelium was investigated. Hamster BSP cDNA was first isolated and characterized, then used to prepare probes for Northern and in situ hybridization. The protein sequence of hamster BSP displayed 86% amino acid identity with a consensus mammalian BSP sequence and retained polyglutamate sequences, the RGD sequence and sites of phosphorylation, glycosylation and sulphation. The tissue-specific expression of hamster BSP mRNA and protein was confirmed by in situ hybridization and immunolocalization in developing tissues. Squamous-cell carcinomas induced in the buccal pouches of 5-week-old male Syrian golden hamsters treated with chemical carcinogen had BSP mRNA and BSP in the proliferating neoplastic epithelium. In contrast, neither BSP mRNA nor the protein could be detected in the stroma within which islands of the transformed tissue had formed. Thus, the hamster cheek pouch is a well-characterized model that can be used to study the induced expression of BSP in association with the development of squamous-cell carcinomas.
