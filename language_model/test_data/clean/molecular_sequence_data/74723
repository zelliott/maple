Three strains of anaerobic, variably pigmenting, Gram-negative bacilli isolated from human oral mucosal tissue were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests and were found to comprise a homogeneous group. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization revealed that the strains constituted a novel group within the genus Prevotella, being most closely related to Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella veroralis. A novel species, Prevotella histicola sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate these strains. Prevotella histicola is saccharolytic and produces acetic acid and succinic acid as major end products of fermentation and trace to minor amounts of isovaleric acid and lactic acid. The G+C content of the DNA of the type strain is 43 mol%. The type strain of Prevotella histicola is T05-04T (=DSM 19854T=CCUG 55407T).
