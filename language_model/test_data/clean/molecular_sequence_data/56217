Expression of the rat preproenkephalin (ppENK) gene involves transsynaptic cholinergic mechanisms. We evaluated the effects of cholinergic agonist treatments in vivo on the expression of adrenomedullary ppENK RNA. Cholinergic treatment with nicotinic + muscarinic receptor agonists resulted in a synergistic 100-fold rise in steady-state ppENK messenger RNA levels, but only a 30- to 35-fold rise in initiation of steady-state ppENK RNA transcripts. The levels of initiated ppENK steady-state RNA peaked at two days, whereas mature (1.45 kb) ppENK mRNA levels continued to rise, peaking at four days. This suggested that other transcriptional (attenuation or alternative splicing) or post-transcriptional (RNA stabilization) regulatory mechanisms must be operative. As multiple ppENK RNA start sites exist, we examined how usage of multiple sites was altered by cholinergic treatments. The predominant start site changed from E2 in the basal state, to E4 after primary cholinergic stimulation, to E3 after re-treatment. This represents novel example of differential usage of multiple RNA initiation start sites in vivo. Differences in initiated and mature transcripts are consistent with at least four mechanisms involved in control of cholinergic-induced ppENK RNA expression: (i) simply new initiation of RNA transcripts, (ii) differential usage of the multiple RNA start sites, (iii) stabilization of mRNA transcripts, and (iv) attenuation and/or alternative RNA splicing of RNA transcripts.
