The blood-brain barrier restricts the passage of many pharmacological agents into the brain parenchyma. Bacterial glycopeptides induce enhanced blood-brain barrier permeability when they are present in the subarachnoid space during meningitis. By presenting such glycopeptides intravenously, blood-brain barrier permeability in rabbits was enhanced in a reversible time- and dose-dependent manner to agents < or = 20 kD in size. Therapeutic application of this bioactivity was evident as enhanced penetration of the antibiotic penicillin and the magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent gadolinium-diethylene-triamine-pentaacetic acid into the brain parenchyma.
