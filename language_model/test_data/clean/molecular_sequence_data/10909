A water-soluble chlorophyll protein (WSCP) in cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L.) was purified and its N-terminal sequence was determined. Forty-six of 48 residues of the sequence completely matched those of the drought-induced 22-kD protein (BnD22) in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). All 40 sequenced residues of WSCP from rapeseed were perfectly matched to those of BnD22. Thus, WSCP may be identical to BnD22. The abundance of WSCP was increased in detached cauliflower leaves.
