Infrared spectra of hydrated dimyristoylphosphatidyl glycerol (DMPG) and of aqueous dispersions of melittin and DMPG at peptide:lipid molar ratios of 1:10 and 1:4 were recorded as a function of pressure from atmospheric to 22 kbar. Spectral features corresponding to vibrations of the amide linkages in melittin and to various functional groups in DMPG (carbonyl, methlylene, phosphate) were monitored in order to investigate the structure and dynamics of melittin:DMPG dispersions. Melittin was found to cause conformational and orientational disordering of the acyl chains in DMPG bilayers. The magnitude of these disorders was higher for higher concentration of melittin in DMPG. The higher concentration of melittin was also found to disrupt the DMPG bilayers through interactions with the lipid head groups. Such disruption may be related to some of the biological properties of melittin.
