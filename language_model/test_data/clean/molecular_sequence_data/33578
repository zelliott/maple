PvFKBP35 is a member of the FK506 binding protein family (FKBP) from Plasmodium vivax. The FK506-binding domain of PvFKBP35 shows a canonical peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity. To understand the role of PvFKBP35 in the parasite, we have performed NMR studies. Here, we report the assignment of the FK506-binding domain of PvFKBP35.
