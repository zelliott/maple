The nucleotide and inferred amino acid sequence of a DRw10 beta chain was obtained from cDNA clones isolated from a DR1, DRw10 heterozygous cell line. The sequence of this beta chain gene was distinctive, differing from those of all other defined DR types. The DRw10 beta chain gene was shown by transfection experiments to encode a polymorphic epitope recognized by mAb 109d6 that is also encoded by the DRw53 beta 2 chain gene. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of both genes revealed that their third D regions (amino acids 67 to 73) were identical. This suggested first that the 109d6 epitope could be encoded by residues of this region, and second, that a putative gene conversion event transferred this sequence along with the information encoding the 109d6 epitope from a donor gene such as DRw53 beta 2. The sequence of the DRw10 beta chain gene was observed to be identical to that of clone pII beta 4 derived from the non-DR3 haplotype in the Raji cell line, which was also demonstrated to express the determinant recognized by antibody 109d6, suggesting that the typing of this cell line is HLA-DR3/DRw10. No evidence was found for the existence of a DR beta 2 chain gene product encoded by the DRw10 haplotype. The DRw10 haplotype was of particular interest because it was present along with a DR1 haplotype in the propositus who had rheumatoid arthritis, and was shared by the DR4-positive son of the propositus, who also had rheumatoid arthritis. This raised the possibility that the DRw10 haplotype, and most probably one or more specific conformations encoded by the DR beta chain, are involved in the definition of the disease susceptibility phenotype.
