A fully active analog of human parathyroid hormone (hPTH) has been produced by recombinant expression in Escherichia coli. Initially, a nucleotide sequence encoding hPTH(1-34)-Asp-Pro was ligated to a proinsulin gene in the plasmid pUC8, for the eventual expression of a fusion protein of 137 amino acids. Unexpectedly, the proinsulin gene and 340 bp downstream were deleted by an unknown mechanism during transformation of the E. coli. This resulted in a new plasmid encoding a small (72-amino acid) fusion product of hPTH(1-34)-Asp35-Pro36-X, where X is a 36-residue "arbitrary" downstream sequence of pUC8. The fusion product was efficiently expressed and the hPTH analog, [Asp35]hPTH-(1-35), was readily released by acid cleavage, with a yield of 100 mg/L. This analog had an effective concentration for half-maximal adenylyl cyclase stimulation (EC50) in rat osteosarcoma cells of 14 nM, which was identical to that for hPTH-(1-34). In the ovariectomized rat model of osteoporosis, [Asp35]hPTH-(1-35) was fully active as a bone anabolic agent.
