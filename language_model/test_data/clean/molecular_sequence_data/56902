We produced rabbit antibodies against mutated thyrotropin (TSH) receptor peptide TSH-R-HIS17 in comparison with non-mutated TSH receptor peptide TSH-R-ASP17. All the antibodies raised against TSH-R-HIS17 showed thyroid stimulating antibody (TSAb), thyroid stimulation blocking antibody (TSBAb) and/or TSH binding inhibiting immunoglobulin (TBII) activities and also those serum T3 levels were all in thyrotoxic levels associated with TSAb activities. However, all the antibodies raised against TSH-R-ASP17 had no activities of TSAb, TSBAb and/or TBII and those serum T3 levels were all within normal range. The data suggest that the mutation in the TSH receptor gene may have a possible relevance for the pathogenesis of Graves' disease.
