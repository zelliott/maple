The inverse relationship between serum levels of high density lipoproteins (HDL) and risk of coronary heart disease is well established. The phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) promotes the transfer of phospholipids between lipoproteins and modulates HDL size and composition. It thus plays a central role in HDL metabolism. Serum PLTP activity was measured in 400 healthy Finnish individuals in order to determine normal PLTP serum values. PLTP activity increased with age (P<0.001), so that the PLTP activity was 3.81+/-0.84 micromol/ml per h (mean +/- S.D., n = 52) for men and 3.97+/-0.11 micromol/ml per h (n = 52) for women in the youngest age group (25-35 years), while it was 6.77+/-0.17 micromol/ml per h (n = 45) for men and 6.68+/-0.15 micromol/ml per h (n = 40) for women in the oldest age group (56-65 years). PLTP activity correlated significantly (P<0.001) with body mass index (r = 0.22), serum total cholesterol (r = 0.17), the ratio of HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol (r = -0.20), triglycerides (r = 0.20), apo A-II (r = 0.20), and gamma glutamyl transferase (r = 0.22) values. Serum PLTP activity correlated negatively (r = -0.20, P<0.001) with levels of apolipoprotein A-I in HDL particles that contained only apo A-I [Lp(A-I) particles]. The allelic frequencies of six intragenic polymorphisms, -79G/T, -56G/A, -37T/C, -31A/G, Phe2Leu, Arg121Trp, and two neutral polymorphisms, located in the immediate vicinity of the PLTP gene were determined. There were no significant associations between these polymorphisms and serum PLTP activity.
