We previously reported that peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HLA-DRB1*0101 Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were highly reactive to 256-271 peptide of type II collagen (CII). In this report, we tried to regulate the CII reactivity of T cells from RA patients with HLA-DRB1*0101 by altered peptide ligand (APL), which is a single amino acid substitution of the T-cell epitope on CII 256-271 peptide. Antagonistic activity of 21 APLs was assessed using three different T-cell lines. Results showed that 262 (G-->A) APL of CII 256-271 exhibited antagonistic activity in all T-cell lines and it was suggested that the application of CII APL might be a new therapeutic strategy in the regulation of RA.
