A full-length cDNA clone of a rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Mx gene was obtained using RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of RNA extracted from poly (I).(C)-induced rainbow trout gonad cells (RTG-2). Mx was previously identified in rainbow trout by Staeheli et al. by hybridization with a partial perch genomic Mx probe to induced rainbow trout mRNA. The 2.5 kb rainbow trout cDNA clone contains an open reading frame of 1863 nt (nucleotides) encoding a 621 amino acid protein. The deduced rainbow trout Mx protein is 70.6 kD and contains the characteristic tripartite GTP binding motif common to all Mx protein. Southern blot analysis with the rainbow trout Mx probe demonstrated the presence of Mx homologous genes in four other salmonid fish species, including chinook, coho, and kokanee salmon and brook trout. Poly (I).(C) treatment of both RTG-2 and chinook salmon cells (CHSE-214) induced two transcripts whose appearance was observed first at 24 h and as long as 72 h after treatment. Infection of rainbow trout with the salmonid rhabdovirus, IHNV (infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus), also induced the synthesis of Mx mRNA. A comparison of the rainbow trout Mx protein with other reported Mx proteins indicates that the piscine Mx is highly homologous to the mammalian Mx proteins.
