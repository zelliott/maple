To establish the significance of cell wall invertase in grain filling of rice (Oryza sativa L.), we cloned a cDNA for a cell wall invertase from developing grains of rice. The cDNA, designated OsCIN1, contains an open reading frame of 1731 bp encoding a polypeptide of 577 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence showed typical features of the cell wall invertases, including a beta-fructosidase motif and a cysteine catalytic site, and shared 78.6 and 73.7% identity with maize cell wall invertases, Incw1 and Incw2, respectively. OsCIN1 is expressed in roots, in sink- and source-leaves, and in panicles. During the course of grain filling in the caryopses, OsCIN1 transcript is detectable only in the very early stage of their development, 1-4 d after flowering, when the cell wall invertase activity is the highest and the increase in caryopsis length is rapid. In situ localization of the mRNA revealed that OsCIN1 is expressed preferentially in the vascular parenchyma of the dorsal vein, integument and its surrounding cells, and is expressed weakly in the nucellar projection and nucellar epidermis. These results suggest that, during the early stage of caryopsis development, OsCIN1 is important for supplying a carbon source to developing filial tissues by cleaving unloaded sucrose in the apoplast.
