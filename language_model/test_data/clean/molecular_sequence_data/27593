The chemical-enzymatic synthesis of a gene for IgG-binding fragment of the staphylococcal protein A has been carried out. The design of the gene, which consists of signal peptide and modified E and B domains, and strategy of the synthesis provided possibility of various degrees of polymerization of the gene fragment coding for B domain and of the whole gene. Several protein A-like polypeptides composed of the leader sequence, E domain and 1 to 4 copies of B domain were produced in E. coli cells under the lac promoter control.
