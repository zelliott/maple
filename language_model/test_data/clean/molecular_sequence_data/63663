Serine proteases HtrA1 and HtrA2 are involved in cellular stress response and development of several diseases, including cancer. Our aim was to examine the involvement of the HtrA proteins in acute oxidative stress response induced in hamster kidney by estrogen treatment, and in nephrocarcinogenesis caused by prolonged estrogenization of male Syrian hamster. We used semi-quantitative RT-PCR to estimate the HtrA1 and HtrA2 mRNA levels in kidney tissues, and Western blotting to monitor the amount of the HtrA proteins. Within the first five hours following estrogen administration both HtrA1 mRNA and the protein levels were increased significantly. No changes in the expression of HtrA2 were observed. This indicates that HtrA1 may be involved in the response against oxidative stress induced by estrogen treatment in hamster kidney. During prolonged estrogenization, a significant reduction of the HtrA1 mRNA and protein levels was observed after 6 months of estradiol treatment, while the expression of HtrA2 was significantly elevated starting from the third month. This suggests an involvement of the HtrA proteins in estrogen-induced nephrocarcinogenesis in hamster. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization we localized the HtrA1 gene at the qb3-4 region of Syrian hamster chromosome 2, the region known to undergo a nonrandom deletion upon prolonged estrogenization. It is possible that the reduced level of HtrA1 expression is due to this chromosomal aberration. A full-length cDNA sequence of the hamster HtrA1 gene was obtained. It codes for a 50 kDa protein which has 98 and 96% identity with mouse and human counterparts, respectively.
