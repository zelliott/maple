To study structure-functional relationship in the series of DSIP, eleven DSIP analogues varying in positions 1, 2 and 6 were synthesized by the solid-phase method using both Boc- and Fmoc-approaches. The antiepileptic action of these analogues was compared with that of DSIP. The seizure activity was induced by the corazol or picrotoxin i. p. injection. Some analogues proved more efficient as antiepileptic agents than DSIP after their central (50 micrograms/kg in rats) and peripheral (1.0 mg/kg in mice) administration.
