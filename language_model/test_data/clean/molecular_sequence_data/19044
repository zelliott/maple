A novel actinomycete strain designated CN-207(T) was isolated from northern Tunisian soil. This strain exhibited potent broad spectrum antibacterial activity against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus species and several other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Strain CN-207(T) developed greyish aerial mycelium and pale grey substrate mycelium on yeast extract/malt agar. The isolate produced branching vegetative mycelia with sporangiophores bearing sporangia developing at a late stage of growth. The sporangia contained smooth, non-motile spores. Chemotaxonomic characteristics of strain CN-207(T) were typical of the Streptomyces genus. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain CN-207(T) belonged to the genus Streptomyces, and was most closely related to Streptomyces griseoincarnatus DSM 40274(T), Streptomyces variabilis DSM 40179(T), Streptomyces labedae DSM 41446(T) and Streptomyces erythrogriseus DSM 40116(T). Low DNA-DNA relatedness values were recorded between strain CN-207(T) and its closest phylogenetic neighbours. Strain CN-207(T) was also distinguished from the nearest phylogenetic neighbours using a combination of morphological and phenotypic characteristics. On the basis of its phenotypic and molecular properties, strain CN-207(T) is considered as a novel species of the Streptomyces genus, for which the name Streptomyces tunisiensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CN-207(T) (=JCM 17589(T) = DSM 42037(T)).
