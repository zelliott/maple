Monitoring the distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants among infected individuals has become a priority in HIV therapy. A laboratory analysis of samples collected from HIV-positive patients attending an STI clinic in Nairobi was done between March and May 2004. PCR was carried out on pol (intergrase) and env (C2V3) regions and resulting data on the 54 samples successfully analyzed revealed the following as circulating subtypes: 35/54(65%) were A1/A1, 5/54(9%) were A/C, 4/54 (7%) were A1/D, 1/54 (2%) was C/D, 1/54 (2%) was D/D, 1/54 (2%) was A1/A2, 1/54 (2%)was G/G, 1/54 (2%) was A2/D, 1/54 (2%) was C/C, and 4/54 (7%) were CRF02_ AG. The results show an increase in HIV-1 recombinants with the emergence of A1/A2 and an increase in CRF02_AG recombinants. Subtype diversity in the advent of ARV use will impact negatively on treatment outcomes. As such, increased viral evolution and recombination will call for continuous evaluation of available anti-HIV regimens for better management of those infected with HIV-1.
