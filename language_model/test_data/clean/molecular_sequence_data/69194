Monoclonal antibody (MAb) 1G12 binds the uncleaved HIV-1 Gag polypeptide (p55), but fails to recognize the final products of the proteolytic processing [Sarubbi, E. et al. (1991) FEBS Lett. 279, 265-269]. In this report we show that binding of MAb 1G12 to a 110-residue Gag fragment containing the p17-p24 cleavage site prevents proteolysis of this site by the HIV-1 protease. Competition studies with synthetic peptides have been performed to map the binding site of MAb 1G12 on Gag. The antibody recognizes a sequential epitope that spans the HIV-1 protease cleavage site; determinants located on both p17 and p24 are required for antibody binding. MAb 1G12 is also shown to lack any cross-reactivity with other HIV-1 protease cleavage sites.
