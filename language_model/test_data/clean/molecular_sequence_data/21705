The importance of ncRNAs in biological processes makes their annotation an essential component of any genome-sequencing project. The identification of ncRNAs in genomes requires specific expertise and tools that are distinct from the traditional protein gene annotation tools. Here, we describe the assembly of two automatic annotation pipelines, integrating publicly available tools, for homology and de novo ncRNA search in genomes. We applied both pipelines to 10 Saccharomycotina genomes and were able to find and annotate 693 ncRNA genes, corresponding to 81% of the ncRNAs expected for those genomes assuming the number of ncRNAs in SaccharomycesÂ cerevisiae (86) as a reference. Several new ncRNAs, not yet known in the Saccharomycotina clade, were also detected. The results show the feasibility of automatic search for ncRNAs in full genomes and the utility of such approaches in large multi-genome sequencing and annotation projects.
