Glutathione synthetase catalyses the ATP-dependent ligation of gamma-glutamylcystene with glycine to form glutathione. Amino acid sequence comparisons between the Arabidopsis and the Escherichia coli proteins suggested that a region, identified as a small flexible loop that covers the active site of the E. coli protein, might be conserved in the eukaryotic protein. Three site-directed mutations in the Arabidopsis protein were generated to test this hypothesis. Two mutations within the conserved region (Lys367/ Pro368-->Asn/Ser and Gly374-->Val) inactivated the enzyme in an in vivo assay based on cadmium resistance in S. pombe, and in an in vitro assay of the activity of the enzyme expressed in E. coli. A third mutation outside of this conserved region (Leu363-->Glu) had a smaller effect in both assays. These results are consistent with the idea that this glycine-rich loop in the Arabidopsis and E. coli proteins might serve the same function in covering the active site of the enzyme.
