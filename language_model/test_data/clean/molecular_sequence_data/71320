To study the molecular mechanism of neuronal cell death, we carried out the screening of genes which were induced during the neuronal cell death of neuronal PC12. We cloned the cDNA of rat GADD45gamma, the third member of the GADD45 family. Induction of GADD45gamma mRNA was observed in the neuronal cell death caused by depletion of neurotrophic factor and Ca2+ ionophore treatment. Overexpression of GADD45gamma in superior cervical ganglion neurons caused cell death. These results suggest that GADD45gamma plays an important role in neuronal cell death.
