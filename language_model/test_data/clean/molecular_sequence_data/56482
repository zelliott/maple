Autolysis of the Ca(2+)-dependent cysteine protease m-calpain involves cleavage of the large (80 kDa) and small (30 kDa) subunits of the enzyme, and an increase in Ca2+ sensitivity. The appearance of increased Ca2+ sensitivity was found to correlate with the cleavage of the large subunit after residue 9.
