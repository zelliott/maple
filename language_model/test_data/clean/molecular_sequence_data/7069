A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used to diagnose a young adult with tuberculous meningitis who presented with unusual clinical symptoms of an acute illness. He had repeated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples taken, and the PCR assay for detecting mycobacterial deoxyribonucleic acid was negative for the first two CSF specimens, but was positive in the third. He was then treated with antituberculous drugs and had complete restoration three months later. A follow-up PCR of the CSF was still positive after one month of therapy using antituberculous drugs, but converted to a negative result one month later. It is concluded that it is valuable to repeatedly sample CSF specimens for PCR study in patients with clinically suspected tuberculous meningitis.
