A convenient method for the preparation of cellooligosaccharide derivatives has been developed that uses beta-lactosyl fluoride as the glycosyl donor. The reaction consists of the following enzymatic processes; (1) a cellulase-catalyzed regio- and stereo-selective lactosylation of a beta-cellobioside as the glycosyl acceptor, utilizing the transglycosylating ability of an enzyme-substrate complex formed from beta-lactosyl fluoride and cellulase; (2) beta-D-galactosidase-catalyzed regioselective cleavage of the terminal D-galactose unit from the lactosylated product, giving rise to a beta-cellotrioside derivative. A cellotetraoside derivative has successfully been prepared in a stereo- and regio-selective manner by repeating these enzymatic reactions and using the resulting beta-cellotrioside as starting material.
