Streptomyces strains were isolated from soil samples of Tibet, five small linear plasmids were detected by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.

Cloning, sequencing and analysis of telomeres of these plasmids.

The telomeres were cloned by a modified procedure--"alkaline treatment and enzyme digestion in gels".

Telomeres of five linear plasmids were cloned and sequenced. Compared with the typical Streptomyces telomeres, the newly identified telomeres contained multiple palindromes, but some could not "fold-back" of their first conserved palindrome I with the internal palindromes to form a "super-hairpin", and palindromes of some telomeres did not contain the 3-nt "loop".

New telomere sequences were cloned by a modified procedure. Both folding-back of the telomere palindromes and 3-nt loop of palindromes varied among telomeres.
