An important consideration in the design of vaccines to prevent HIV-1 infection effective against different strains is the amino acid sequence conservation of antigenic determinants. Even one amino acid change can destroy the antigenicity of a site for the antibody or T-cell receptor. The comparisons of predicted T- and B-cell epitopes between human HIV-1, HIV-2 and monkey SIVMAC AIDS viruses are presented. The three major gene products (env, gag and pol) were examined. A number of epitopes were identical between strains of HIV-1. Our analysis highlights the problem of designing an effective HIV-1 and HIV-2 vaccine and also the problem of testing human vaccines in monkey models.
