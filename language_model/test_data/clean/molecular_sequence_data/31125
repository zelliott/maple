A high-copy-number plasmid, pLink, was constructed to allow the direct selection in Escherichia coli of a neo fusion gene capable of conferring Geneticin (G418) resistance on mouse L cells. pLink was derived from pdMmtneo by insertion of a KpnI linker within the 5'-coding region of the neo gene. This created a minus-one frameshift mutation resulting in a translational termination within the N-terminal region of the protein. The Neo activity was restored by insertion into the modified neo gene of a piece of coding sequence derived from human HPRT cDNA. The resulting plasmid, pAH, was microinjected into mouse A9 cells and shown to confer resistance to G418.
