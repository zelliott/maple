We report the identification of a novel B*40 allele, officially named B*400204, found in a Martinican prospective bone marrow donor by means of sequence-based typing techniques. This novel allele differs from the B*400201 allele by a synonymous nucleotide exchange at codon 31 in exon 2 (ACG --> ACC).
