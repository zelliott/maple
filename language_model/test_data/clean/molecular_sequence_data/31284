We have studied the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) system in the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis. Southern hybridization to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ADH2 gene indicates four probable structural ADH genes in K. lactis. Two of these genes have been isolated from a genomic bank by hybridization to ADH2. The nucleotide sequence of one of these genes shows 80% and 50% sequence identity to the ADH genes of S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe respectively. One K. lactis ADH gene is preferentially expressed in glucose-grown cells and, in analogy to S. cerevisiae, was named K1ADH1. The other gene, homologous to K1ADH1 in sequence, shows an amino-terminal extension which displays all of the characteristics of a mitochondrial targeting presequence. We named this gene K1ADH3. The two genes have been localized on different chromosomes by Southern hybridization to an orthogonal-field-alternation gel electrophoresis-resolved K. lactis genome. ADH activities resolved by gel electrophoresis revealed several ADH isozymes which are differently expressed in K. lactis cells depending on the carbon source.
