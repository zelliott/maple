The disulfide bond pattern of Trimeresurus stejnegeri lectin (TSL), a new member of the C-type lectin family, was determined by mass spectrometry. Four intrachain disulfide bonds of TSL, Cys(3)-Cys(14), Cys(31)-Cys(131), Cys(38)-Cys(133) and Cys(106)-Cys(123), and two interchain linkages, Cys(2)-Cys(2) and Cys(86)-Cys(86), were determined. Three strategies were used in this work. One intrachain (Cys(106)-Cys(123)) and one interchain (Cys(86)-Cys(86)) disulfide linkages were detected by standard MS methods. The disulfide bonds Cys(2)-Cys(2) and Cys(3)-Cys(14) were analyzed using a modified partial reduction procedure and MS/MS. The last two disulfide bonds were characterized by a MS/MS/MS technique. The strategies developed in this work could be applied more generally to detection of disulfide bond patterns.
