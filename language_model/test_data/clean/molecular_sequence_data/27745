Pseudomonas cepacia strain AC1100, capable of growth on 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), was mutated to the 2,4,5-T- strain PT88 by a ColE1::Tn5 chromosomal insertion. Using cloned DNA from the region flanking the insertion, a 1477-bp sequence (designated RS1100) was identified which was repeated several times on the wild-type chromosome and was also present on AC1100 plasmid DNA. Various chromosomal fragments containing this sequence were cloned and their nucleotide sequence was determined. Examination of RS1100 revealed the presence of 38-39-bp terminal inverted repeats immediately flanked by 8-bp direct repeats. The translated sequence of the single large open reading frame of RS1100 showed structural similarity to the phage Mu transposase and other DNA-binding proteins. Thus the AC1100 repeated sequence has several structural features in common with insertion sequence elements. Three copies of RS1100 were mapped near 2,4,5-t genes encoding degradation of 5-chloro-1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene, an intermediate in 2,4,5-T degradation. Neither RS1100 nor the 2,4,5-t genes hybridized to DNA isolated from Pseudomonas strains, including P. cepacia, suggesting that both gene fragments may be of foreign origin recruited in strain AC1100. The origin of these two DNA segments as well as the role played by RS1100 in the recruitment of 2,4,5-t genes in AC1100 are presently under investigation.
