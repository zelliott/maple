In the Soybean mosaic virus (SMV)-soybean pathosystem, three independent genes (Rsv1, Rsv3, and Rsv4) conferring resistance to SMV have been identified. Recently, we constructed infectious cDNA clones of SMV G7H and G5H strains and found that these two strains differ in their ability to infect soybean genotypes possessing different SMV resistance genes despite a difference of only 33 amino acids. In particular, pSMV-G7H induced mosaic symptoms systemically in L29 (Rsv3) and provoked a lethal systemic hypersensitive response (LSHR) in Jinpumkong-2, whereas pSMV-G5H could not infect these soybean genotypes. To identify the responsible pathogenic determinants of SMV, we exploited the differential responses of pSMV-G7H- and pSMV-G5H-derived chimeric viruses and amino acid substitution mutant viruses in several soybean genotypes and demonstrated that cylindrical inclusion (CI) protein is the elicitor of Rsv3-mediated extreme resistance and a pathogenic determinant provoking LSHR in Jinpumkong-2. A single amino acid substitution in CI was found to be responsible for gain or loss of elicitor function of CI. Our finding provides a role for CI as a pathogenic determinant in the SMV-soybean pathosystem, and increases the understanding of the basis of the different disease responses of SMV strains.
