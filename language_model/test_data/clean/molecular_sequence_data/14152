The translation elongation factor EF-1 alpha appears to play a major role in the control of cell proliferation and ageing in higher eukaryotes. Here we report the cloning of the TEF1 gene encoding the elongation factor 1 alpha of the dimorphic yeast Arxula adeninivorans Ls3. The gene is localized on chromosome 2 from Arxula adeninivorans, comprises 1380 bp and encodes a protein containing 459 amino acids. In contrast to other fungi, a second TEF gene encoding an identical, or nearly identical, polypeptide could not be identified. The transcriptional activity of the TEF1 gene did not change during mycelial growth, whereas a slight decrease could be detected during the yeast growth.
