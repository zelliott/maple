The psychrophilic bacterium Moritella dasanensis strain ArB 0140 was isolated near a glacier in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard Archipelago, Norway. Here we report a 4.89-Mb draft genome sequence of Moritella dasanensis ArB 0140, which could provide comprehensive information on a psychrophilic mechanism in extreme environments.
