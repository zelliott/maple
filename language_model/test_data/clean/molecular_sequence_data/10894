The nucleotide sequences of the 16S rDNA in 17 strains of 16 taxa of the genus Staphylococcus were determined. The sequences were compared phylogenetically together with the gene sequences of 10 (including 7 other species) Staphylococcus species retrieved from the DNA Data Bank of Japan. Although the primary and secondary structures of most of Staphylococcus species were very similar (homology values 96.4% or more) except for S. caseolyticus MAFF 911387T (homology values 95.4% or less), the 23 staphylococcal species were divided into 10 groups based on similarity, evolutionary distance and phylogenetic tree analysis. Nucleotide stretches in several variable domains in the 16S rDNA sequences appeared to be specific for the bacterial groups or the species. By comparing such characteristics in the sequence and phylogenies of 5 staphylococcal clinical isolates from bovine mastitis, canine and feline pyoderma, and feline urogenital syndrome with the information obtained in this study, the species level of each organism was identified.
