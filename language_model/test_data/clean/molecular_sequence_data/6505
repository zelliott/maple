A toxic substance was purified from larvae of the antilion, Myrmeleon bore, by DEAE Sephacel and Phenyl Superose column chromatography. The substance was a large polypeptide with a molecular weight of about 165-167 kDa. Its paralytic activity measured by injection against German cockroaches was about 130 times higher than that of tetrodotoxin on a molar basis.
