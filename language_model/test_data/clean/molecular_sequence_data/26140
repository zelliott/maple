A proteinase is essential for replication of HIV. Cloning and chemical synthesis have provided a sufficient supply of HIV-1 proteinase for the determination of its three-dimensional structure. Analogies between the structures of HIV-1 proteinase and the mammalian enzyme renin, which is involved in the control of blood pressure, have given important clues concerning the design of specific inhibitors that have antiviral activity.
