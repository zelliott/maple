We have analyzed a series of recombinational events at the IgH chain locus of the B cell lymphoma, NFS-5. Each of these recombinational events results in the replacement of the VH gene segment of the rearranged H chain gene (VhDJh) with that of an upstream germline gene segment. Replacements on the productive and nonproductive alleles have been observed. In each case, the recombination occurs in close proximity to a highly conserved heptameric sequence (5'TACTGTG3') which is located at the 3' end of the VH coding region. In the two examples of recombination on the productive allele that have been analyzed, the initial VHQ52 gene is replaced by different VH7183 genes. On the non-productive allele, sequential replacement events have been analyzed: the initial VHQ52 rearrangement is first replaced by a closely related VHQ52 gene, followed by a second replacement using a VHQ52 pseudogene. Southern blot analysis using VH probes indicates that these recombinations may be accompanied by the deletion of germline VH genes belonging to both the VHQ52 and VH7183 families, suggesting that these gene families are interspersed in the NFS/N mouse.
