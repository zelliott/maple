Many cytokines exert their biological effect through members of the hemopoietin receptor family. Using degenerate oligonucleotides to the common WSXWS motif, we have cloned from human hemopoietic cell cDNA libraries various forms of the receptor that was recently shown to bind the obesity hormone, leptin. mRNAs encoding long and short forms of the human leptin receptor were found to be coexpressed in a range of human and murine hemopoietic organs, and a subset of cells from these tissues bound leptin at the cell surface. Ectopic expression in murine Ba/F3 and M1 cell lines revealed that the long, but not the short, form of the leptin receptor can signal proliferation and differentiation, respectively. In cultures of murine or human marrow cells, human leptin exhibited no capacity to stimulate cell survival or proliferation, but it enhanced cytokine production and phagocytosis of Leishmania parasites by murine peritoneal macrophages. Our data provide evidence that, in addition to its role in fat regulation, leptin may also be able to regulate aspects of hemopoiesis and macrophage function.
