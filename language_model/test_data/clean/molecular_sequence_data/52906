The commercial availability of peptides and proteins and their advantages as therapeutic agents have been the basis for tremendous efforts in designing delivery systems for such agents. The protection of these agents from biological fluids and physiological interactions is crucial for the treatment efficacy. One such agent is salmon calcitonin, a 32 amino-acid polypeptide hormone used in the treatment of bone diseases such as Paget's disease, hypercalcemia and osteoporosis. Researchers have studied different routes to deliver salmon calcitonin more effectively, including nasal, oral, vaginal and rectal delivery. These systems are designed to protect the polypeptide from the biological barriers that each delivery route imposes. Oil-based and polymer-based delivery systems are discussed.
