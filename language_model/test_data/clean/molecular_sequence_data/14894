High-level constitutive expression of xylanase GH11 from Penicillium occitanis Pol6 termed PoXyn2 was achieved using the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The PoXyn2 cDNA encoding for a mature xylanase of 320 amino acids was subcloned into the pGAPZαA vector, to construct recombinant xylanse with six histidine residues at the N-terminal and further integrated into the genome of P. pastoris X-33 under the control of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP) constitutive promoter. Activity assay and SDS-PAGE demonstrate that the His-tagged xylanase was extracellularly expressed in P. pastoris and purified to homogeneity by a simple, one-step purification protocol using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Ni-NTA resin). The purified PoXyn2 showed a single band on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular weight of 30 kDa. The xylanase activity was optimal at pH 3.0 and 50°C. The specific activity measured for Oat Spelt Xylan was 8549.85 U mg(-1). The apparent The K(M) and V(max) values were 8.33±0.7 mg ml(-1)and 58.82±0.9 μmol min(-1) ml(-1), respectively, as measured on Oat Spelt Xylan. This is the first report demonstrating the possibility of mass production of P. occitanis xylanase using P. pastoris.
