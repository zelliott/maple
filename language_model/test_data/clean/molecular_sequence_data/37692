Azotobacter vinelandii produces two polymers: the extracellular polysaccharide alginate and the intracellular polyester poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB). A cosmid clone (pSMU588) from an A. vinelandii gene library diminished alginate production by A. vinelandii mucoid strain ATCC 9046. The nucleotide sequence and predicted amino acid sequence of the locus responsible for the mucoidy suppression revealed 65% identity to Pseudomonas GacS, a transmembrane sensor kinase of the two-component regulators, whose cognate response regulator, GacA, is a global activator regulating several products and virulence factors. Plasmid pMC15, harboring gacS, and a strain carrying a gacS nonpolar mutation were constructed. Either pMC15 or the gacS mutation significantly reduced alginate production and transcription of algD, the gene coding for the key enzyme GDP-mannose dehydrogenase of the alginate biosynthetic pathway. We found that the gacS mutation also reduced PHB accumulation and impaired encystment. Taken together, these data indicate that in A. vinelandii the gacSA global system regulates polymer synthesis.
