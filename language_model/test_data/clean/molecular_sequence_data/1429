An Arabidopsis expressed sequence tag clone, 221D24, encoding a lipase has been characterized using an antisense approach. The lipase gene is expressed during normal growth and development of Arabidopsis rosette leaves but is down-regulated as the leaves senesce. When plants are exposed to sublethal levels of UV-B radiation, expression of the lipase is strongly up-regulated. The lipase protein is localized in the cell cytosol and is present in all organs of Arabidopsis plants. Recombinant lipase protein produced in Escherichia coli preferentially hydrolyzed phospholipids, indicating that the gene encodes a phospholipase. Transgenic plants in which lipase expression is suppressed showed enhanced tolerance to UV-B stress but not osmotic stress and were unable to up-regulate PR-1 expression when irradiated with UV-B. The observations collectively indicate that the lipase is capable of deesterifying membrane phospholipids and is up-regulated in response to UV-B irradiation.
