The aim of this study was the isolation and characterization of the culturable bacteria inhabiting the leaves of transgenic white poplars (Populus alba L. 'Villafranca') engineered with the StSy gene for the production of resveratrol-like compounds. Resveratrol glucosides are available in small amounts from natural sources or by expensive chemical synthesis procedures. An alternative approach for the large-scale production of these relevant pharmaceuticals is the use of transgenic plants as bioreactors, although the occurrence of novel molecules in plants growing under field conditions might interfere, to some extent, with the associated microbial population. Both epiphytes and endophytes were isolated from the leaves of 2 StSy transgenic lines producing resveratrol glucosides and from an untransformed plant line grown in a greenhouse. Eleven isolates were recovered and classified as members of the genus Bacillus by 16S rDNA-based analysis. In addition, 2 isolates were classified as members of the Curtobacterium and Kocuria genera, respectively. Tolerance to hydrogen peroxide, UV-C, and paraquat was evaluated, as were the swimming and swarming motility of the leaf-associated bacteria. Interestingly, the isolates recovered from transgenic tissues showed the ability to withstand oxidative stress compared with isolates recovered from the untransformed poplar line. In vitro bioassays showed that trans-resveratrol inhibited both the swarming and swimming motilities in all the tested bacteria. The effects of trans-resveratrol on flagellin production, required for motility, were also investigated by immunoblot analysis.
