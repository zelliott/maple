During a retrospective study on cryptococcosis carried out in Bangalore, Karnataka, India, four Cryptococcus gattii strains were isolated from one HIV-positive and three HIV-negative patients, two of which had unknown predisposing conditions. Serotyping and genotyping showed that the isolates were C. gattii serotype C, mating-type Î± and genotype VGIV. All the isolates were identical by multilocus sequence typing, but presented a low similarity compared with a set of 17 C. gattii global control strains. The comparison with a larger number of previously reported C. gattii strains, including African isolates, revealed a close relationship between Indian and African serotype-C isolates.
