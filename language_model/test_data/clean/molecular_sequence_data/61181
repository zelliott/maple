Deuterolysin (EC 3.4.24.39; formerly designated as neutral proteinase II) from Aspergillus oryzae, which contains 1 g atom of zinc/mol of enzyme, is a single chain of 177 amino acid residues, includes three disulfide bonds, and has a molecular mass of 19,018 Da. Active-site determination of the recombinant enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli was performed by site-directed mutagenesis. Substitutions of His(128) and His(132) with Arg, of Glu(129) with Gln or Asp, of Asp(143) with Asn or Glu, of Asp(164) with Asn, and of Tyr(106) with Phe resulted in almost complete loss of the activity of the mutant enzymes. It can be concluded that His(128), His(132), and Asp(164) provide the Zn(2+) ligands of the enzyme according to a (65)Zn binding assay. Based on site-directed mutagenesis experiments, it was demonstrated that the three essential amino acid residues Glu(129), Asp(143), and Tyr(106) are catalytically crucial residues in the enzyme. Glu(129) may be implicated in a central role in the catalytic function. We conclude that deuterolysin is a member of a family of Zn(2+) metalloendopeptidases with a new zinc-binding motif, aspzincin, defined by the "HEXXH + D" motif and an aspartic acid as the third zinc ligand.
