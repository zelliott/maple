Two full copy cDNA sequences encoding chalcone synthase (CHS) were selected from a yellow lupin (Lupinus luteus L.) root and nodule cDNA library, and sequenced. Analysis of their open reading frames gave evidence that both encode the functional enzyme. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic studies on the DNA and protein level of these clones compared to the sequences of chalcone synthases from 54 other plant species reveal the possibility that lupin chalcone synthase is encoded by a multigene family consisting of at least two distinct genes that probably diverged by gene duplication. The duplication event is estimated to have taken place about 16 million years ago.
