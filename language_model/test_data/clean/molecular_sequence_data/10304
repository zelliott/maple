Recently, it was shown that a significant number of erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes strains contain a determinant that mediates resistance via a putative efflux pump. The gene encoding the erythromycin-resistant determinant was cloned and sequenced from three strains of S. pneumoniae bearing the M phenotype (macrolide resistant but clindamycin and streptogramin B susceptible). The DNA sequences of mefE were nearly identical, with only 2-nucleotide differences between genes from any two strains. When the mefE sequences were compared to the mefA sequence from S. pyogenes, the two genes were found to be closely related (90% identity). Strains of S. pneumoniae were constructed to confirm that mefE is necessary to confer erythromycin resistance and to explore the substrate specificity of the pump; no substrates other than 14- and 15-membered macrolides were identified.
