The ubiquitous glyoxalase system, which is composed of two enzymes, removes cellular cytotoxic methylglyoxal (MG). In an effort to identify critical residues conserved in the evolution of the first enzyme in this system, glyoxalase I (GlxI), as well as the structural implications of sequence alterations in this enzyme, a search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database of unfinished genomes was undertaken. Eleven putative GlxI sequences from pathogenic organisms were identified and analyses of these sequences in relation to the known and previously identified GlxI enzymes were performed. Several of these sequences show a very high similarity to the Escherichia coli GlxI sequence, most notably the 79% identity of the sequence identified from Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague. In addition to the conservation of residues critical to binding the catalytic metal in all of the proposed GlxI enzymes, four regions in the Homo sapiens GlxI enzyme are absent in all of the bacterial GlxI sequences, with the exception of Pseudomonas putida. Removal of these regions may alter the active-site conformation of the bacterial enzymes in relation to that of the H. sapiens. These differences may be targeted for the development of inhibitors selective to the bacterial enzymes.
