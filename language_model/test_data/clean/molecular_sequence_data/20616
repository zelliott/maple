The genes required for tetralin biodegradation by Sphingomonas macrogolitabida strain TFA are clustered in two divergent and closely linked operons. ThnR, a LysR-type regulator, activates transcription from each operon in response to tetralin. The regulatory thnR gene is co-transcribed with the catabolic genes thnC, thnA3 and thnA4, resulting in positive autoregulation. ThnR binds with different affinity to two primary binding sites, designated B and C, in the intervening region between the two operons and makes additional contact with secondary sites that extend towards the promoters. In addition, ThnR may interact with itself when bound to each site via the formation of a DNA loop, as evidenced by the distortion of the DNA between the primary binding sites and the elimination of the higher-order complexes following the introduction of a half-turn of the DNA helix between the primary binding sites. Transcription from each promoter is not fully independent since mutations in each binding site affected transcription from both promoters. Based on these results, we propose a model of transcription activation that involves the formation of a complex structure by interactions between ThnR molecules bound to distant binding sites and favours transcription from one promoter to the detriment of the other.
