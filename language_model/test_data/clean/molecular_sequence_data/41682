Fibulins are evolutionarily conserved extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that assemble in elastic fibers and basement membranes. Caenorhabditis elegans has a single fibulin gene that produces orthologs of vertebrate fibulin-1 C and D splice forms. In a structure-function analysis of fibulin-1 domains, a series of deletion constructs show that EGF repeats 4 and 5 are required for the hemicentin-dependent assembly and function of fibulin-1D in native locations. In contrast, constructs missing the second EGF repeat of fibulin-1D (EGF2D) assemble in ectopic locations in a hemicentin dependent manner. Constructs that contain EGF2D are cleaved into two fragments, but constructs with EGF2D missing are not, suggesting that a protease binds and/or cleaves fibulin-1D at a site that is likely within EGF2D. Together, the data suggests that EGF repeats 4 and 5 promote interaction with hemicentin while a region within EGF2D suppresses ectopic interactions with hemicentin and this suppression may be protease dependent.
