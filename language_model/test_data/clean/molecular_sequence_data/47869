We report here the isolation of a new member of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-like family (ARL-6) present in the J2E erythroleukemic cell line, but not its myeloid variants. Consistent with this lineage-restricted expression, ARL-6 mRNA increased with erythropoietin-induced maturation of J2E cells, and decreased with interleukin 6-induced differentiation of M1 monoblastoid cells. In tissues, ARL-6 mRNA was most abundant in brain and kidney. While ARL-6 protein was predominantly cytosolic, its membrane association increased following exposure to GTP-gammaS, like many members of the ARF/ARL family. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, six molecules which interact with ARL-6 were identified including SEC61beta, a subunit of the heterotrimeric protein conducting channel SEC61p. Co-immunoprecipitation of ARL-6 confirmed a stable association between ARL-6 and SEC61beta in COS cells. These results demonstrate that ARL-6, a novel member of the ADP-ribosylation factor-like family, interacts with the SEC61beta subunit.
