A cDNA encoding osteonectin was isolated from a human bone cell cDNA library and used to examine osteonectin protein structure, mRNA structure and expression in human tissue. The deduced protein sequence shows complete identity with a recently isolated placental form and extensive homology to mouse and bovine counterparts. The protein is rich in cysteine residues, which are conserved between species except for cys 194 which is only present in the bovine. In the human, osteonectin mRNA is of two sizes, 2.3 and 3.0 kb, the former being dominant in all tissues studied. Human mRNA was detected in the Ewing sarcoma and in non-bone cell and tissue sources. The potential folded structure of osteonectin mRNA was estimated, based on computer predictions, and indicates the presence of a bulge at the 5' end of the message which includes the start of translation. Southern analysis of human genomic DNA using radiolabeled osteonectin cDNA as probe demonstrates a simple banding pattern confirming earlier studies that the osteonectin gene is present in one copy per haploid human genome.
