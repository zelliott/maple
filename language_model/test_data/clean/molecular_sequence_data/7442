PIG-A is an X-linked gene that encodes a synthetic element required to initiate glycoinositol phospholipid (GPI) anchor assembly. In this study we characterized genomic sequence flanking the previously identified 5' end of the murine PIG-A gene and analyzed constitutive levels of PIG-A gene expression in vivo in different tissues. We found that the 5'-flanking sequence contains 1) alternative transcriptional start sites at -154 and -34/-33 relative to previously known exon 1 sequence, 2) an MRE and multiple GRE, Ap-2 and Sp-1 consensuses, and 3) a 100-bp-long GC-rich segment bounded by NF-IL6 sites. Our survey of PIG-A mRNA levels in vivo unexpectedly revealed that PIG-A expression levels are 2-4 fold higher in the brain than in other tissues.
