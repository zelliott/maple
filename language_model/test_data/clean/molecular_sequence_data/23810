The complete nucleotide sequence of the Poplar mosaic virus (PopMV) genome was determined. The genomic RNA of PopMV is 8,742 nucleotides in length. Comparative sequence analysis supports earlier research suggesting that this virus is a member of the genus Carlavirus. For example, as is the case for all carlaviruses, there are 6 predicted ORFs in the PopMV genome. The first ORF, ORF1, encodes a predicted helicase/replicase, which corresponds to ORF1 from other carlaviruses, while ORF2, ORF3, ORF4, ORF5 and ORF6 encode the three triple block proteins, the coat protein, and a putative nucleic acid-binding protein respectively.
