A functional cDNA clone for a human pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptor was isolated from a human pituitary cDNA library. The cDNA encoded a polypeptide consisting of 525 amino acids with putative seven hydrophobic domains. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells transfected with the cDNA specifically bound PACAP and mediated PACAP-triggered intracellular accumulation of cAMP, indicating that this cDNA encoded a functional human PACAP Type I receptor. This receptor was structurally related to the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), secretin, calcitonin and parathyroid hormone receptors and is much more homologous to a rat PACAP receptor. Northern blot analysis revealed that PACAP receptor mRNAs were expressed mainly in the brain and widely distributed in the central nervous system.
