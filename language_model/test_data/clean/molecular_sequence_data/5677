Substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine at codon 809 (Y809F) of the human colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) receptor (CSF-1R) impairs ligand-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity, prevents induction of c-MYC and cyclin D1 genes, and blocks CSF-1-dependent progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. We devised an unbiased genetic screen to isolate genes that restore the ability of CSF-1 to stimulate growth in cells that express mutant CSF-1R (Y809F). This screen led us to identify a truncated form of the murine type Ibeta phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (mPIP5K-Ibeta). This truncated protein lacks residues 1 to 238 of mPIP5K-Ibeta and is catalytically inactive. When we transfected cells expressing CSF-1R (Y809F) with mPIP5K-Ibeta (delta1-238), CSF-1-dependent induction of c-MYC and cyclin D1 was restored and ligand-dependent cell proliferation was sustained. CSF-1 normally triggers the rapid disappearance of CSF-1R (Y809F) from the cell surface; however, transfection of cells with mPIP5K-Ibeta (delta1-238) stabilized CSF-1R (Y809F) expression on the cell surface, resulting in elevated levels of ligand-activated CSF-1R (Y809F). These results suggest a role for PIP5K-Ibeta in receptor endocytosis and that the truncated enzyme compensated for a mitogenically defective CSF-1R by interfering with this process.
