Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a T-cell derived cytokine which stimulates eosinophil production and activation in human, mice and sheep. IL-5 is active as a growth factor for mouse but not human B cells. The role of IL-5 on ruminant B cells has not been clearly defined. By hybridisation with human IL-5 cDNA, the ovine IL-5 gene was isolated from a liver genomic library. The IL-5 cDNA was obtained by reverse-transcriptase PCR using primers designed from the 5' and 3' coding sequence derived from the ovine IL-5 gene. The sequences of the cDNA shows that there is 79% and 73% nucleotide homology with the human and mouse sequences. The ovine IL-5 cDNA encoded a protein of 132 amino acids and the level of amino acid homology with human and mouse IL-5 is 64% and 56%, respectively. Two cysteine residues are conserved in ovine, human and mouse IL-5. There are two potential N-linked glycoyslation sites in ovine IL-5.
