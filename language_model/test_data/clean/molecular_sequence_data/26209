Nodulin genes are plant genes specifically activated during the formation of nitrogen-fixing nodules on leguminous plants. These genes are interesting to study since they are not only induced in a specific developmental fashion by signals coming directly or indirectly from the rhizobial symbiont, but are also expressed in a tissue-specific manner. By examining the expression of chimeric nodulin-reporter genes in transgenic legume plants it has been shown that nodule specific expression is mediated by DNA sequences present in the 5 upstream region of several nodulin genes. Here we summarize the available data on these cis-acting elements and the trans-acting factors interacting with them. We also review experiments designed to identify rhizobial "signals" which may play a role in nodule specific gene expression.
