The synthesis of the repeating unit of the major O-antigen component from Pseudomonas syringae pv. ribicola NVPPB 1010 is reported. The strategy used was based on the successive coupling of a trisaccharide rhamnosyl trichloroacetimidate with a rhamnosyl acceptor with a free hydroxyl group on C-2. The pentasaccharide was then obtained by coupling with a N-Troc-tri-O-acetyl-glucosamine trichloroacetimidate. The synthesis allowed the oligomerisation of the repeating unit.
