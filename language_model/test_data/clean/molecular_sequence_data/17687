The haemagglutinating activity of Bacteroides gingivalis 381 was significantly inhibited by the synthetic peptide, Asp-Ser-His-Ala-Lys-Arg-His-His-Gly-Tyr-Lys-Arg-Lys-Phe-His- Glu-Lys-His-His-Ser-His-Arg-Gly-Tyr. However, bradykinin potentiator C, which does not contain cationic amino acids such as L-histidine, L-arginine and L-lysine, had no inhibitory effect.
