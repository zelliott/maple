In this paper, we present a review of sperm nuclear basic proteins (SNBPs) in teleost fish. The distribution of the three basic groups of SNBPs [histone (H)-type, protamine-like (PL)-type and protamine (P)-type], their evolution and possible relation to the mode of fertilization are described. In this regard, we have characterized the SNBPs from two closely related species of Scorpaeniform fish: internally fertilizing Sebastes maliger and externally fertilizing Sebastolobus sp., both in the family Scorpaenidae. Despite the different reproductive behavior of these two closely related rockfish species, in both instances the SNBP consists of protamines. However, there is a significant increase in the arginine content of the protamine in the internally fertilizing rockfish. The relevance of this observation is discussed within the context of the P-type SNBP in teleosts. The rapid evolution of teleost protamines, including those in rockfish, has also allowed us to obtain a molecular phylogeny for this group of bony fish that is almost indistinguishable from that currently available from the use of conventional anatomical/paleontological markers.
