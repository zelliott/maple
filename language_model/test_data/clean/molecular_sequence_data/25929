A xylanase encoded by the xynA gene of the extreme thermophile "Caldocellum saccharolyticum" was overexpressed in Escherichia coli by cloning the gene downstream from the temperature-inducible lambda pR and pL promoters of the expression vector pJLA602. Induction of up to 55 times was obtained by growing the cells at 42 degrees C, and the xylanase made up to 20% of the whole-cell protein content. The enzyme was located in the cytoplasmic fraction in E. coli. The temperature and pH optima were determined to be 70 degrees C and pH 5.5 to 6, respectively. The xylanase was stable for at least 72 h if incubated at 60 degrees C, with half-lives of 8 to 9 h at 70 degrees C and 2 to 3 min at 80 degrees C. The enzyme had high activity on xylan and ortho-nitrophenyl beta-D-xylopyranoside and some activity on carboxymethyl cellulose and para-nitrophenyl beta-D-cellobioside. The gene was probably expressed from its own promoter in E. coli. Translation of the xylanase overproduced in E. coli seemed to initiate at a GTG codon and not at an ATG codon as previously determined.
