Major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are implicated in protective Th1 immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. We report the identification of three novel HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes within mycobacterial superoxide dismutase (SodA), L-alanine dehydrogenase (AlaDH), and L-glutamine synthetase (GlnS) proteins.
