A new family of human endogenous retroviruses has recently been discovered. The best known example of a full length member of this family, HERV-W/7q, is located on chromosome 7. HERV-W/7q is characterized by a long open reading frame within its env gene which is expressed in various tissues, and mainly in placenta, as a protein that we called enverin. A search for new retroviral sequences related to the HERV-W/7q family allowed the characterization of such elements in chromosome 6. A novel full length HERV with an env gene of the HERV-W/7q type, potentially encoding a truncated form of enverin has been identified on chromosome 10. The distribution of HERV-W/7q related sequences close to or within genes offers the possibility that the expression of these genes may be regulated by their companion retroviral sequences.
