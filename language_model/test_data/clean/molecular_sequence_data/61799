Aldehyde oxidoreductase of Eubacterium acidaminophilum was purified to homogeneity under strict anaerobic conditions using a four-step procedure. The purified enzyme was present as a monomer with an apparent molecular mass of 67 kDa and contained 6.0 +/- 0.1 iron, 1.1 +/- 0.2 tungsten, about 0.6 mol pterin cofactor and zinc, but no molybdenum. The enzyme activity was induced if a molar excess of electron donors, such as serine and/or formate, were supplied in the growth medium compared to readily available electron acceptors such as glycine betaine. Many aldehydes served as good substrates, thus enzyme activity obtained with acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, isovaleraldehyde and benzaldehyde differed by a factor of less than two. Kinetic parameters were determined for all substrates tested. Oligonucleotides deduced from the N-terminal amino acid sequence were used to isolate the encoding aorA gene and adjacent DNA regions. The deduced amino acid sequence of the aldehyde oxidoreductase exhibited high similarities to other tungsten-containing aldehyde oxidoreductases from archaea. Transcription of the aorA gene was monocistronic and started from a sigma 54-dependent promoter. Upstream of aorA, the gene aorR is localized whose product is similar to sigma 54-dependent transcriptional activator proteins and, thus, AorR is probably involved in the regulation of aorA expression.
