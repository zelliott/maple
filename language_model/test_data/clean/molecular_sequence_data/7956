A B-cell lymphoma cell line, designated KML-1, was established from pleural effusion of a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of large-cell type. The lymphoma arose in the pelvis and ran an aggressive clinical course. Chromosome analysis of the cell line exhibited a complex karyotype including the loss of chromosome 18. To evaluate the molecular events in the cell line that may be associated with the development of the lymphoma, we investigated the expression and/or alterations of several classes of human genes, including oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and cytokine genes. The expression of the DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) gene, located on the chromosome 18q21, was extremely reduced in KML-1 cell line, as compared with that in a normal spleen tissue and other 4 lymphoma cell lines by the reverse transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) method. This finding suggests that inactivation of the DCC gene might play a role in the pathogenesis of the case of lymphoma.
