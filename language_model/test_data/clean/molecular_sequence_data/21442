Legume-nodulating rhizobia use N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) to regulate several physiological traits related to the symbiotic plant-microbe interaction. In this work, we show that Sinorhizobium fredii SMH12, Rhizobium etli ISP42 and Rhizobium sullae IS123, three rhizobial strains with different nodulation ranges, produced a similar pattern of AHL molecules, sharing, in all cases, production of N-octanoyl homoserine lactone and its 3-oxo and/or 3-hydroxy derivatives. Interestingly, production of AHLs was enhanced when these three rhizobia were grown in the presence of their respective nod-gene-inducing flavonoid, while a new molecule, C14-HSL, was produced by S. fredii SMH12 upon genistein induction. In addition, expression of AHL synthesis genes traI from S. fredii SMH12 and cinI and raiI from R. etli ISP42 increased when induced with flavonoids, as demonstrated by qRT-PCR analysis.
