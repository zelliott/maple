Dendroaspis natriuretic peptide (DNP), recently isolated from the venom of the green Mamba snake Dendroaspis angusticeps, is a 38 amino acid peptide containing a 17 amino acid disulfide ring structure similar to that of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). DNP-like immunoreactivity (DNP-LI) was reported to be present in human plasma and atrial myocardium and to be elevated in human congestive heart failure. Although previously named DNP, it remains unknown if DNP is natriuretic or if is it present in canine plasma, urine, and atrial myocardium.

Studies were performed in vivo in anesthetized dogs (N = 6) using intravenous infusion of synthetic DNP at 10 and 50 ng/kg/min. Employing a sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay for DNP, the presence of DNP-like peptide was assessed in the canine plasma and urine before, during, and following the administration of exogenous synthetic DNP. Additionally, we performed immunohistochemical studies using the indirect immunoperoxidase method with polyclonal DNP antiserum in normal atrial myocardium (N = 10). Atrial concentrations of DNP-LI were also assessed.

We report that DNP is markedly natriuretic and diuretic, which, like ANP and BNP, is associated with the increase in urinary and plasma cGMP. DNP-like peptide is also detected in canine plasma, urine, and atrial myocardium.

These studies establish that DNP is a potent natriuretic and diuretic peptide with tubular actions linked to cGMP and that DNP may play a physiological role in the regulation of sodium excretion.
