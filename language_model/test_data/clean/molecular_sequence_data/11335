Fifteen sequences belonging to the Chinese hamster genome were isolated from a library of sequences preferentially binding to the nuclear matrix (matrix attachment regions, MAR), sequenced, and characterized. Fourteen of the 15 sequences (> 90%) bound to the nuclear matrix with affinities 2.5-60 times higher than those of control DNA fragments containing no MARs. One clone displayed a considerable homology to the ORF1 region of the mouse LINE repeat. Such MARs within LINE repeats may considerably alter the activities of some genes and the transcription status of chromatin domains upon the LINE repeat propagation in the genome over the course of evolution.
