A cloned rat gro gene encoding the neutrophil chemo-attractant Gro was isolated from a lambda Charon4A rat genomic library, and the nucleotide (nt) sequence of a 2500-bp fragment encompassing the coding region and 3'- and 5'-flanking regions was determined. The gene consisted of four exons separated by three introns. The transcription start point was determined by primer-extension analysis and found to be a G located 72 nt upstream from the start codon. The 5'-flanking region of the gene contained a 'TATA'-like structure and an NF-kappa B-binding sequence.
