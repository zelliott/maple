A new method of monitoring the rate of reactions in solid-phase peptide synthesis is described. A conductivity detector in the reaction cell (patent applied for) enables the deprotection, washing and subsequent coupling stages to be examined in detail. The half-lives of the reactions can be calculated and hence the optimum reaction times can be predicted. Difficult sequences are sensed and appropriate action taken completely automatically.
