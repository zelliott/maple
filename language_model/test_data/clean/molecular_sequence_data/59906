Sulfated sialyl Le(x) ganglioside analogues at C-6 of D-galactose, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, and of both D-galactose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues have been synthesized, in order to clarify the structure of the real carbohydrate ligand of L-selectin. Coupling of the suitably protected N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-beta (1-->3)-lactose derivatives 13 and 16 with the sialyl alpha(2-->3)-D-galactopyranosyl trichloroacetimidates 10 and 12 (glycosyl donors), via glycosylation of 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl 4,6-O-benzylidene-beta-D-galactopyranoside (1) with the phenyl 2-thioglycoside derivative (2) of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) using N-iodosuccinimide/TfOH, O-benzoylation, removal of the benzylidene group affording 5, selective 6-O-levulinoylation, O-benzoylation, removal of the 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl group, and imidate formation, or via O-acetylation of 5, removal of the 2-trimethylsilyl)ethyl group, then imidate formation, gave the pentasaccharides 18-20. The glycosylation of the pentasaccharide acceptors (21-23) derived from 18-20 by removal of the 4-methoxybenzyl group, with phenyl 1-thioglycoside derivative 27 of L-fucose using dimethyl(methylthio)sulfonium triflate (DMTST) afforded the corresponding hexasaccharides 28-30, which were transformed in good yields, via reductive removal of their benzyl groups, O-acetylation, selective removal of the 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl group, imidate formation, coupling with (2S,3R,4E)-2-azido-O-benzoyl-4-octadecene-1,3-diol (35) in the presence of boron trifluoride etherate, selective reduction of the azido group, coupling with octadecanoic acid, selective removal of the levulinoyl groups, treatment with sulfur trioxide-pyridine complex, then removal of the protecting groups, into the desired sulfated sialyl Le(x) ganglioside analogues 50-52.
