Pseudogulbenkiania ferrooxidans strain 2002 was isolated as a lithoautotrophic, Fe(II)-oxidizing, nitrate-reducing bacterium. Phylogenetically, it is in a clade within the family Neisseriaceae in the order Nessieriales of the class Betaproteobacteria. It is anticipated that comparative genomic analysis of this strain with other nitrate-dependent, Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria will aid in the elucidation of the genetics and biochemistry underlying this critically important geochemical metabolism.
