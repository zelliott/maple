The non-classical human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I locus, HLA-G, shows a low protein polymorphism and a more varied DNA (eight proteins and 28 alleles). HLA-G DNA polymorphism accounts mainly for changes at third codon bases of the protein coding exons; this does not imply amino acid change in most cases. This relatively high HLA-G DNA polymorphism in comparison with their protein polymorphism suggests that evolutionary forces are acting upon HLA-G for invariance. This may be related to the immunotolerogenic function postulated for HLA-G.
