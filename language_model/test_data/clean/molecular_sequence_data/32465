Two small cryptic plasmids, pTJ86-1 and pTJ86-2, identified in Cupriavidus taiwanensis strain TJ86, were detected and characterized. Complete sequencing of pTJ86-1 and pTJ86-2 revealed these plasmids to be 2221 and 2229bp in length with a GC content of 61.7% and 61.6%, respectively. Both plasmids harbored four open reading frames (ORF1, 2, 3 and 4). Only the predicted ORF1 gene product of both plasmids (436 amino acids) was homologous to Rep proteins previously identified on plasmids replicated using a rolling-circle replication (RCR). A double-stranded origin (DSO) of replication, highly conserved in the group III (cluster III) RCR plasmids, was identified and located immediately upstream of this putative Rep gene. In addition, both plasmids contained a putative single-stranded origin of replication (SSO) exhibiting similarity to the ssoA-type. Detection of single-stranded plasmid DNA by Southern analysis and S1 nuclease digestion confirmed that the cryptic plasmid replicated via an RCR mechanism. A potential shuttle vector, pS4-tet(R), was constructed by ligation of pTJ86-1 to the cloning vector pBluescript II SK(+) along with the insertion of a tetracycline-resistance (tet(R)) gene. It was successfully used for the transformation of genera Burkholderia and Cupriavidus.
