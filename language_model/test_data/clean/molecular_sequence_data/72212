We report a high-resolution genetic map of 21 genes on the central region of mouse Chr 11. These genes were mapped by segregation analysis of more than 1650 meioses from three interspecific backcrosses. The order of these genes in mouse was compared to the previously established gene order in human. Eighteen of the 21 genes map to human Chr 5, and 2 of the genes define a proximal border for the region of homology between mouse Chr 11 and human Chr 17. Our results indicate a minimum of four rearrangements within the 10-cM region of synteny homology between mouse Chr 11 and human Chr 5. In addition, the linkage conservation is disrupted by groups of genes that map to mouse Chrs 13 and 18. These data demonstrate that large regions of conserved linkage can contain numerous chromosomal microrearrangements that have occurred since the divergence of mouse and human ancestors. Comparison of the mouse and human maps with data for other species provides an emerging picture of mammalian chromosome evolution.
