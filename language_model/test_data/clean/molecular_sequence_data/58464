The mitochondrial FAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mtGPD) plays an important role in the regulation of insulin secretion and has been postulated as a candidate responsible for the pathogenesis of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in humans as well as in rodent models of NIDDM. Recent molecular genetic studies of the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat model of NIDDM have identified loci linked to NIDDM. To elucidate whether rat mtGPD might play a role in the pathogenesis of NIDDM, the rat mtGPD gene (Gpd2) was cloned, and a genetic marker for Gpd2 was developed. The gene mapped to the region of rat chromosome 3 that contains a region linked to NIDDM in the GK rat. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was also carried out to verify the map position.
