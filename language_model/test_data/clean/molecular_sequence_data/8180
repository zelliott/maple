We have predicted a structure for the three A domains of blood coagulation factor VIII by virtue of their homology to blue copper-binding proteins. This structure, consisting of six beta-barrels, is arranged in a triangular configuration with a single type II copper-binding site linking the A1 and A3 domains.
