Exposure of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to the stilbene derivative DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid) (60 microM and above) significantly increased the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), as determined by TNF-alpha activity in the incubation media. When the TNF-alpha message was analyzed in PBMC by a reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR)-based procedure, it was found that incubation with DIDS (60 microM) was followed by a time-dependent accumulation of TNF-alpha mRNA. Measurements of intracellular pH showed that the presence of increasing concentrations of DIDS resulted in a progressive intracellular alkalinization of PBMC. It is suggested that the known DIDS effect of inhibiting transmembrane anion exchange, i.e., chloride/bicarbonate exchange, might play a role in the stimulation of TNF-alpha production by PBMC exposed to DIDS.
