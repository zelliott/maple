The v-cbl oncogene is the transforming gene of the murine Cas NS-1 retrovirus which induces pre-B cell lymphomas and myeloid leukaemias. Sequencing of c-cbl has revealed that v-cbl was generated by a large truncation that removed 60% of the C-terminus of the corresponding protein. In this study we prepared antibodies to cbl and found that c-cbl encodes a 120 kDa protein which is localized in the cytoplasm with a cytosolic and cytoskeletal distribution. Immunofluorescence studies show a striking pattern of brightly staining vesicles in mitotic cells similar to that observed with cytokeratin antibodies. In contrast to p120c-cbl, which is exclusively cytoplasmic, the p100gag-v-cbl encoded by Cas NS-1 is localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This redistribution to the nucleus correlates with the ability of cbl to induce acute transformation. Furthermore the truncated protein encoded by v-cbl can bind DNA, unlike the full-length protein. These results suggest that the C-terminus of cbl is involved in the retention of p120c-cbl in the cytoplasm and the inhibition of DNA binding. The findings also suggest that a truncated protein encoded by c-cbl exists in the nucleus of normal cells.
