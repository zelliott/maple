1. Several residues critically involved in AT1 receptor ligand-binding and activation have now been identified based on mutational and biochemical studies. 2. Asp281 and Lys199 of the rat AT1 receptor ion-pair with Arg2 and the Phe3 alpha-COOH of angiotensin II (AngII), respectively, and the Asp281/Arg2 interaction is critical for full agonist activity. 3. Agonist activity of AngII also requires an interaction of the Phe8 side chain with His256, which is achieved by docking of the alpha-COOH with Lys199. Non-peptide agonists interact with Lys199 and His256 in a similar fashion. 4. The crucial acid pharmacophores of AngII and the non-peptide antagonist, losartan, appear to occupy the same space within the receptor pocket. Binding of the tetrazole anion moiety of losartan involves multiple contacts, such as Lys199 and His256. However, this interaction does not involve a conventional salt bridge, but rather an unusual lysine-aromatic interaction. 5. Asp1 of AngII forms an ion-pair with His183, which stabilizes the receptor-bound conformation of AngII but is not critical for receptor activation. 6. These interactions and the involvement of other residues in stabilizing the wild-type receptor conformation or in receptor/G-protein coupling are considered here. 7. Despite these insights, considerable effort is still needed to elucidate how ligand binding induces receptor activation, what determines the specificity of AT1 receptor coupling to multiple G-proteins and the in vivo role of receptor down-regulation.
