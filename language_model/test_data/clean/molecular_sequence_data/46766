Allantoin pathway gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae responds to two different environmental stimuli. The expression of these genes is induced in the presence of allantoin or its degradative metabolites and repressed when a good nitrogen source (e. g. asparagine or glutamine) is provided. Three types of cis-acting sites and trans-acting factors are required for allantoin pathway gene transcription as follows: (i) UAS(NTR) element associated with the transcriptional activators Gln3p and Gat1p, (ii) URS(GATA) element associated with the repressor Dal80p, and (iii) UIS(ALL) element associated with the Dal82 and Dal81 proteins required for inducer-dependent transcription. Most of the work leading to the above conclusions has employed inducer-independent allantoin pathway genes (e.g. DAL5 and DAL3). The purpose of this work is to extend our understanding of these elements and their roles to inducible allantoin pathway genes using the DAL7 (encoding malate synthase) as a model. We show that eight distinct cis-acting sites participate in the process as follows: a newly identified GC-rich element, two UAS(NTR), two UIS(ALL), and three URS(GATA) elements. The two GATA-containing UAS(NTR) elements are coincident with two of the three GATA sequences that make up the URS(GATA) elements. The remaining URS(GATA) GATA sequence, however, is not a UAS(NTR) element but appears to function only in repression. The data provide insights into how these cis- and trans-acting factors function together to accomplish the regulated expression of the DAL7 gene that is observed in vivo.
