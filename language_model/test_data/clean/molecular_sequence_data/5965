A reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification assay was developed to detect infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) gene sequences in clinical samples, infected cell cultures and chicken embryos. Two pairs of primers were designed to amplify the 5'- and 3'-termini of segment A genes that partially code for the IBDV proteins VP2 and VP3, respectively. One primer pair specifies a 309-bp fragment, the other a 520-bp fragment. Direct RT-PCR analysis of 5 bursal samples of chickens derived from a suspected first outbreak of infectious bursal disease in New Zealand yielded the 309-bp and 520-bp by fragments. The identity of both amplified fragments was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis, chemiluminescence Southern blot hybridization and direct cycle sequencing. RT-PCR amplification of RNAs extracted from 4 out of 5 IBDV isolates propagated in Vero cells, chicken embryo fibroblasts and specific pathogen-free chicken embryos yielded IBDV-specific fragments of unpredicted small sizes.
