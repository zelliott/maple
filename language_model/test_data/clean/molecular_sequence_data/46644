We detected a missense mutation in exon 10 of tau that causes a substitution at codon 279 (N279K) in a Japanese patient with a familial background of parkinsonism and dementia originally described as pallido-nigro-luysian degeneration. This mutation is the same as one seen in a Caucasian family with pallido-ponto-nigral degeneration. The similarities between these two families suggest a common genetic mechanism that may account for the peculiar distribution of neuroglial degeneration with tauopathy.
