The 5' untranslated region of human FMR1 mRNA is highly conserved, including a 26 nucleotide sequence containing a tandem 12 nucleotide repeat of (G/C)CU(C/G)CCGG(G/A)G(G/C)(G/C) which predates the evolutionary divergence between birds and mammals. We show here that this 12 nucleotide sequence in FMR1 mRNA is a specific binding site for small (< 20 kDa) cytosolic proteins of rat brain. Point mutation analysis identified two guanine residues in this 12 nucleotide repeat which are essential for protein binding. The 12 nucleotide motif sequence was found in the 5'UTR of at least 15 other genes and could be a common target site for these cytosolic RNA-binding proteins.
