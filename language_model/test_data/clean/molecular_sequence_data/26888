Second messenger-induced Ca(2+)-release from intracellular stores plays a key role in a multitude of physiological processes. In addition to 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP(3)), Ca(2+), and cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR) that trigger Ca(2+)-release from the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) has been identified as a cellular metabolite that mediates Ca(2+)-release from lysosomal stores. While NAADP-induced Ca(2+)-release has been found in many tissues and cell types, the molecular identity of the channel(s) conferring this release remained elusive so far. Here, we show that TPCN2, a novel member of the two-pore cation channel family, displays the basic properties of native NAADP-dependent Ca(2+)-release channels. TPCN2 transcripts are widely expressed in the body and encode a lysosomal protein forming homomers. TPCN2 mediates intracellular Ca(2+)-release after activation with low-nanomolar concentrations of NAADP while it is desensitized by micromolar concentrations of this second messenger and is insensitive to the NAADP analog nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). Furthermore, TPCN2-mediated Ca(2+)-release is almost completely abolished when the capacity of lysosomes for storing Ca(2+) is pharmacologically blocked. By contrast, TPCN2-specific Ca(2+)-release is unaffected by emptying ER-based Ca(2+) stores. In conclusion, these findings indicate that TPCN2 is a major component of the long-sought lysosomal NAADP-dependent Ca(2+)-release channel.
