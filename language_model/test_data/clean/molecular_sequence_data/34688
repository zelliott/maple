White-rot fungi have the following enzyme systems for lignin degradation: laccase, lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase. There are other types of peroxidases related to lignin degradation, one of which we have cloned a cDNA gene of manganese-repressed peroxidase (MrP) in Trametes versicolor isolated in South Korea. The mrp transcript level has been decreased by 1 micrometer of Mn(2+).
