Using Zn2+ ions as new method, several FUs have been isolated from molluscan Hc Rapana venosa without formation of non-functional proteolytic side products. N-terminal sequences of these fragments in comparison with FUS from other gastropodan Hcs show a very high degree of structural identity. Four Fus, purified from enzyme-treated structural subunits RvH1 and RvH2 (RvH1-a, RvH1-f, RvH2-a and RvH2-e) show identical N-terminal sequences compared to fragments isolated after treatment with Zn2+ ions. However, in some cases trypsin cleaves RvH chains at different positions if compared to the Zn2+ treatment. To analyze the oligosaccharide composition of two FUS from the first structural subunit of Rapana Hc, RvH1-a and RvH1-f, several techniques were applied: capillary electrophoresis, MALDI-MS, ESI-MS in combination with glycosidase digestions. On basis of these results and the determined amino acid sequence two N-linkage sites were identified in the FU RvH1-a, but only one in the FU RvH1-f.
