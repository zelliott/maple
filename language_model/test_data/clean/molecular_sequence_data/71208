We isolated and characterized the rat gene encoding phosducin-like protein (PhLP), a putative heterotrimeric G protein modulator. The transcription start site was mapped by primer extension. The putative promoter region lacked a TATA sequence but contained a potential initiator element. Two splice variants were identified by RT-PCR of rat brain RNA, potentially generating either the full length or an amino-truncated protein. Only the full-length protein was immunodetected in all mouse tissues surveyed. Comparison of the conceptual translation product of the rat PhLP gene with those from human and Drosophila clones shows a striking conservation in the amino-terminal region of PhLP from these species. This contrasts with the relatively low degree of homology between PhLP and phosducin in this region, suggesting a functional role for this portion of the PhLP protein. Finally, we mapped the human PhLP gene by PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrids and the Stanford G3 radiation hybrid panel. The human PhLP gene (PDCL) is located on chromosome 9, linked to the polymorphic markers D9S1876 and D9S1674 (66-71 cM).
