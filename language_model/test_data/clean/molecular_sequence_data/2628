Five clones that hybridized weakly with the human retinoblastoma (Rb) gene were obtained by screening a human genomic library in a non-stringent condition. The DNAs of two of these clones were partially sequenced and found to contain a region with considerable homology to part of the Rb gene. These two clones were found to contain L1 family repeating sequences. This finding is discussed in relation with possible functions of the L1 family. As the L1 family is transposable, the Rb gene may be inactivated by recombination at this homologous region. Another possibility related with the DNA binding properties of Rb and L1 family proteins is also discussed.
