The supramolecular assembly of Helicobacter pylori urease was studied by nanoflow electrospray ionization orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The measured molecular mass of the urease complex of 1.06 MDa corresponds to a dodecameric (alphabeta)(12) assembly of urease alpha (26 kDa) and beta (61 kDa) subunits. The dodecamer disassembles readily into (alphabeta)(3) subunits in solution and under controlled collisional-induced dissociation in the gas phase. This is in strong support of an ((alphabeta)(3))(4) architecture consistent with the recently published x-ray structure. In vitro, the alpha and beta subunits are capable of re-assembling to (alphabeta)(3), but not further to the dodecameric complex.
