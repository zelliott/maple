The Drosophila lark gene encodes an essential RNA-binding protein of the RNA recognition motif (RRM) class that is required during embryonic development. Genetic analysis demonstrates that it also functions as a molecular element of a circadian clock output pathway, mediating the temporal regulation of adult emergence in the fruitfly. We now report the molecular characterization of a human gene with significant similarity to lark. Based on fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid mapping, the human gene has been localized to chromosome region 11q13; it is closely linked to several identified genes including the locus of Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 1. The lark-homologous human gene expresses a single 1.8-kb size class of mRNA in most or all tissues including brain. Additional database searches have identified a mouse counterpart that is virtually identical to the human protein. Similar to lark protein, both mammalian proteins contain two copies of the RRM-type consensus RNA-binding motif. Unlike most RRM family members, however, the Drosophila and mammalian proteins also contain a retroviral-type (RT) zinc finger that is situated 43 residues C-terminal to the second RRM element. Within a 184-residue segment spanning the RRM elements and the RT zinc finger, the human and mouse proteins are 61% similar to the Drosophila lark sequence. These common sequence features and comparisons among a large collection of RRM proteins suggest that the human and mouse proteins represent homologues of Drosophila lark.
