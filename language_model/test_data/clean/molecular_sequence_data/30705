Recent advances have challenged classical notions regarding the nature of steroid hormone receptors in the cell including localization, activation, configuration, and stability. Molecular biology has revealed a remarkable similarity in the primary structure of a wide variety of receptor classes that goes beyond steroid action. Post-translational modification of a primary unit, expressed in response to genetic conservatism, would appear to assure receptor dynamics specific to hormone-, organ-, and tissue-dependent processes, and may even lead to toxicity and oncogenicity.
