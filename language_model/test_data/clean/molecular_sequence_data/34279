Nitazoxanide (NTZ) exhibits potent antiviral activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV) in cell culture. Previously, HCV replicon-containing cell lines resistant to NTZ were selected, but transfer the HCV NTZ-resistance phenotype was not observed following transfection of whole cell RNA. To further explore the nature of the resistance of HCV to NTZ, full length HCV replicon sequences were obtained from two NTZ-resistant (NTZ-11, TIZ-9), and the parental (RP7) cell lines. Numerous nucleotide changes were observed in individual HCV genomes relative to the RP7 HCV consensus sequence, but no common mutations in the HCV non-structural genes or 3'-UTR were detected. A cluster of single nucleotide mutations was found within a 5-base portion of the 5'-UTR in 20/21 HCV replicon sequences from both resistant cell lines. Three mutations (5'-UTR G17A, G18A, C20U) were individually inserted into CON1 ('wild-type') HCV replicons, showed reduced replication (5 to 50-fold), but none conferred resistance to NTZ. RP7, NTZ-11, and TIZ-9 were cured of HCV genomes by serial passage under interferon. Transfection of cured NTZ-11 and TIZ-9 with either whole cell RNAs from RP7, NTZ-11, or TIZ-9, 'wild-type' or the 5'-UTR mutation-containing replicon RNAs exhibited an NTZ-resistance phenotype. TIZ (the active metabolite of NTZ) was found to be inactive against the activity of HCV polymerase, protease, and helicase in enzymatic assays. These data confirm previous speculations that HCV resistance to NTZ is not due to mutations in the virus, and demonstrate that HCV resistance and most likely the antiviral activity of TIZ are due to interactions with cellular target(s).
