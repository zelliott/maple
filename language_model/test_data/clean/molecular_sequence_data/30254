The nucleotide sequence of a 6156 bp segment of the circular 73 kb DNA from Astasia longa resembling the chloroplast DNA of Euglena was determined. The genes for the plastid elongation factor Tu (tufA) and the ribosomal protein S7 (rps7), six tRNA genes (trnQ, trnS, trnG, trnM, trnT, trnR), and three open reading frames were identified. These genes show a high degree of sequence similarity (73%-99%) to the corresponding genes on the Euglena chloroplast genome. The tufA gene contains two small AT-rich introns within its coding region. Northern analysis revealed the in vivo transcription of the tufA gene and of a reading frame of 456 codons into monocistronic mRNAs of 1.3 and 1.4 kb, respectively. The arrangement and organization of the genes on the 73 kb DNA of the colourless heterotrophic flagellate Astasia and the chloroplast DNA of autotrophic Euglena are compared.
