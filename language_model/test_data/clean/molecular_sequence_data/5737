The kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) plays an important role in the regulation of renal function. Endogenous kinins modulate renal microvascular resistance, medullary blood flow, and distal nephron sodium and water reabsorption. All the components of the KKS, including tissue kallikrein, kininogen, kininase II, and kinin receptors are expressed within the kidney, establishing a paracrine system capable of controlling local nephron functions. In this review, data will be presented demonstrating that the developing kidney expresses an endogenous, functionally active KKS. Molecular studies have shown that gene expression of the renal KKS in the rat is activated postnatally, and that the intrarenal distribution of KKS components is subject to developmental control. Furthermore, the developmental expression of KKS appears to be regulated primarily at the transcriptional level. Ontogenetic studies have also revealed that the bradykinin B-2 receptor gene is overexpressed in the developing rat kidney. As kinins are potent vasoactive and growth-promoting factors, it is proposed that endogenous kinins mediate developmental renal growth and differentiation, and modulate the maturational changes which occur in renal hemodynamics.
