The results of a phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic analysis of the genus Micrococcus indicated that it is significantly heterogeneous. Except for Micrococcus lylae, no species groups phylogenetically with the type species of the genus, Micrococcus luteus. The other members of the genus form three separate phylogenetic lines which on the basis of chemotaxonomic properties can be assigned to four genera. These genera are the genus Kocuria gen. nov. for Micrococcus roseus, Micrococcus varians, and Micrococcus kristinae, described as Kocuria rosea comb. nov., Kocuria varians comb. nov., and Kocuria kristinae comb. nov., respectively; the genus Nesterenkonia gen. nov. for Micrococcus halobius, described as Nesterenkonia halobia comb. nov.; the genus Nesterenkonia gen. nov. for Micrococcus halobius, described as Nesterenkonia halobia comb. nov.; the genus Dermacoccus gen. nov. for Micrococcus nishinomiyaensis, described as Dermacoccus nishinomiyaensis comb. nov.; and the genus Kytocossus  gen. nov. for Micrococcus sedentarius, described as Kytococcus sedentarius comb. nov. M. luteus and M. lylae, which are closely related phylogenetically but differ in some chemotaxonomic properties, are the only species that remain in the genus Micrococcus Cohn 1872. An emended description of the genus Micrococcus is given [corrected].
