The characterization of the cross-reactive antigens of two closely related apicomplexan parasites, Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii, is important to elucidate the common mechanisms of parasite-host interactions. In this context, a gene encoding N. caninum ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (NcP0) was identified by immunoscreening of a N. caninum tachyzoite cDNA expression library with antisera from mice immunized with T. gondii tachyzoites. The NcP0 was encoded by a gene with open reading frame of 936 bp, which encoded a protein of 311 amino acids. The NcP0 gene existed as a single copy in the genome and was interrupted by a 432 bp intron. The NcP0 showed 94.5% amino acid identity to T. gondii P0 (TgP0). Anti-recombinant NcP0 (rNcP0) sera recognized a native parasite protein with a molecular mass of 34 kDa in Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the NcP0 was localized to the surface of N. caninum tachyzoites. A purified anti-rNcP0 IgG antibody inhibited the growth of N. caninum and T. gondii in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner. These results indicate that P0 is a cross-reactive antigen between N. caninum and T. gondii and a potential common vaccine candidate to control both parasites.
