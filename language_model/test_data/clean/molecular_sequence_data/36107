The highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to search for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-I) or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in the DNA extracted from postmortem temporal cortex samples of 8 schizophrenic subjects, 8 nonschizophrenic suicide victims and 8 normal controls. HSV-I or VZV-specific DNA amplification was not detected in any of the samples studied.
