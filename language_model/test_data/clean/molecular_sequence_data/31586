Class II major histocompatibility molecules (MHC) confer disease risk for multiple autoimmune disorders including type 1 diabetes. The interaction between the components of the trimolecular complex (CD4(+) T cell receptors, self-peptide, and MHC class II molecules) plays a pivotal role in autoimmune disease pathogenesis. The development of therapies targeting various components of the trimolecular complex for the prevention of type 1 diabetes is actively being pursued. This review focuses on the components of the anti-insulin trimolecular complex, registers of insulin peptide binding to 'diabetogenic' MHC class II molecules, and therapies targeting each component of the trimolecular complex.
