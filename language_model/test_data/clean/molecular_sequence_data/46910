Satellite DNA sequences are known to be important components required for the construction of centromeres and are common to all higher eukaryotes. Nevertheless, their nucleotide sequences vary significantly, even in evolutionarily related species. In order to elucidate how the nucleotide sequences define the conformational character of centromeric satellite DNA, an evolutionary path toward repetitive units has been hypothesized. In that context, the DNA conformation of fish satellite DNA was evaluated in two ways: the organization of subrepeats and sequence characteristics were compared, and the differences in stacking energies between A-helix and B-helix and the sequence-dependent bendability of the helices were evaluated. Our findings suggest that the monomeric units making up currently observed repetitive sequences have evolved through stepwise amplification of shorter, ancestral sequences by increasing the length of the units. In addition, we suggest that potentially key sequences required for DNA amplification comprise highly flexible structures. Thus flexibility of the DNA structure may be a primary prerequisite for DNA amplification.
