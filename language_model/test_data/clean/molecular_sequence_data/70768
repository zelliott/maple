Dictyostelium plasmids Dgp1 and Dfp1, two members of the Ddp2 plasmid family, are 86% identical in nucleotide sequence. These small (4481 and 5015 bp), high copy number, nuclear plasmids carry both a gene homologous to the Ddp2 rep gene and a long 0.47- to 0. 48-kb inverted repeat region. Their Rep proteins are 82.8% identical in amino acid sequence and carry all 10 of the conserved peptide sequence motifs found in the Ddp2 family Rep proteins. Unlike other members of this family, Dgp1 carries two copies and Dfp1 carries four copies of a 162- to 166-bp direct repeat element. Both the direct and inverted repeat elements, as well as the promoter of the rep gene, are highly conserved (81 to 90% identical) between Dgp1 and Dfp1. In contrast, these regions are not highly conserved and the Rep proteins are only about 40% identical among the other known members of the plasmid family.
