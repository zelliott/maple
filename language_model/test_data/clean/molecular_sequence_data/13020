Regulatory light chain (RLC) phosphorylation is necessary to activate smooth muscle myosin, unlike constitutively active striated muscle myosins. Here we show that an actin-binding surface loop located at the 50/20-kDa junction contributes to this fundamental difference between myosins. Substitution of the native actin-binding loop of smooth muscle heavy meromyosin (HMM) with that from either skeletal or beta-cardiac myosin caused the chimeric HMMs to become unregulated like the myosin from which the loop was derived. Dephosphorylated chimeric HMMs gained the ability to move actin in a motility assay and had 50-70% of the actin-activated ATPase activity of phosphorylated wild-type HMM. Direct binding measurements showed that the affinity of HMM for actin in the presence of MgATP was unaffected by loop substitution; thus the rate of a step other than binding is increased. Phosphorylation of the chimeras did not lead to a higher Vmax than obtained for wild-type HMM. In the absence of actin, a foreign loop did not affect nucleotide trapping. Native regulated molecules have thus evolved a loop sequence which prevents rapid product release by actin when the RLC is dephosphorylated, thereby allowing activity to be controlled by RLC phosphorylation.
