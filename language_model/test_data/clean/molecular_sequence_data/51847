Methionine-enkephalin (Met-Enk) has been detected in the testis of the frog, Rana esculenta, using a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography system coupled with a specific radioimmunoassay. By means of immunocytochemical techniques Met-Enk positive cells have been localized in interstitial and germinal compartments. Particularly, spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatozoa were stained in seminiferous tubules, and numerous interstitial cells showed strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in summer animals. Variations in the concentration of Met-Enk immunoreactive material occurred during the annual cycle. Our data show that Met-Enk is present in testes of nonmammalian vertebrate species. These results suggest that autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms may regulate testicular activity in amphibians.
