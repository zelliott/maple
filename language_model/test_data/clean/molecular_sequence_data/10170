Removal of a methyl group of the allosamizoline moiety of allosamidin decreases the inhibitory effect on family 18 chitinases from three different species (a bacterium, Serratia marcescens, a crustacean, Artemia salina, and an insect cell line, Chironomus tentans). Loss of a second methyl group weakens enzyme inhibition further. This is in agreement with the highly conserved catalytic centre of these enzymes.
