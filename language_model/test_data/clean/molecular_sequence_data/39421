The RPE65 protein is located in the retinal pigment epithelial cells and plays an important role in the visual cycle. Although numerous experimental results demonstrate that it participates in the visual cycle, its detailed structure and function are not clear yet because of difficulties in isolation and crystallization. This paper describes a computational modeling study to propose a three-dimensional (3D) structure and suggest a possible mechanism for the function of the protein. The 3D-PSSM server is used to obtain the preliminary 3D structural model of the RPE65 protein. The coordinates of the side chains are obtained from the SCWRL program. Finally, two software packages, Jackal and Tinker with the CHARMM force field are used to fix and refine the preliminary structural model. Based on the obtained 3D structural model, a possible mechanism for the protein function is discussed.
