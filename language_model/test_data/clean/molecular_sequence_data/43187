Automated Edman degradation was used to obtain N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences from a 26-kDa protein in isolated Treponema pallidum outer membranes (OMs). The resulting sequences enabled us to PCR amplify from T. pallidum DNA a 275-bp fragment of the corresponding gene. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene was determined from fragments amplified by long-distance PCR. Primer extension verified the assigned translational start of the open reading frame (ORF) and putative upstream promoter elements. The ORF encoded a highly basic (pI 9.6) 26-kDa protein which contained an N-terminal 25-amino-acid leader peptide terminated by a signal peptidase I cleavage site. The mature protein contained seven tandemly spaced copies (as well as an eighth incomplete copy) of a leucine-rich repeat (LRR), a motif previously identified in a number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins. Accordingly, the polypeptide was designated T. pallidum leucine-rich repeat protein (TpLRR). Although Triton X-114 phase partitioning showed that TpLRR was hydrophilic, cell localization studies showed that most of the antigen was associated with the peptidoglycan-cytoplasmic membrane complex rather than being freely soluble in the periplasmic space. Immunoblot studies showed that syphilis patients develop a weak antibody response to the antigen. Lastly, the lrr(T. pallidum) gene was mapped to a 60-kb SfiI-SpeI fragment of the T. pallidum chromosome which also contains the rrnA and flaA genes. The function(s) of TpLRR is currently unknown; however, protein-protein and/or protein-lipid interactions mediated by its LRR motifs may facilitate interactions between components of the T. pallidum cell envelope.
