Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 are genetically distinct viruses that each can cause AIDS. Approximately 1 million people are infected with both HIV-1 and HIV-2. Additionally, these two viruses use the same receptor and coreceptors and can therefore infect the same target cell populations. To explore potential genetic interactions, we first examined whether RNAs from HIV-1 and HIV-2 can be copackaged into the same virion. We used modified near-full-length viruses that each contained a green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) with a different inactivating mutation. Thus, a functional gfp could be reconstituted via recombination, which was used to detect the copackaging of HIV-1 and HIV-2 RNAs. The GFP-positive (GFP(+)) phenotype was detected in approximately 0.2% of the infection events, which was 35-fold lower than the intrasubtype HIV-1 rates. We isolated and characterized 54 GFP(+) single-cell clones and determined that all of them contained proviruses with reconstituted gfp. We then mapped the general structures of the recombinant viruses and characterized the recombination junctions by DNA sequencing. We observed several different recombination patterns, including those that had crossovers only in gfp. The most common hybrid genomes had heterologous long terminal repeats. Although infrequent, crossovers in the viral sequences were also identified. Taken together, our study demonstrates that HIV-1 and HIV-2 can recombine, albeit at low frequencies. These observations indicate that multiple factors are likely to restrict the generation of viable hybrid HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses. However, considering the large coinfected human population and the high viral load in patients, these rare events could provide the basis for the generation of novel human immunodeficiency viruses.
