The genes encoding Ig chains in elasmobranchs are arranged in clusters or cassettes, an organizational pattern dramatically different from the mammalian translocon gene arrangement. Cluster gene arrangements, which have now been found in non-elasmobranchs as well, pose interesting dilemmas for understanding the mechanisms of Ig gene expression and regulation in terms of allelic exclusion and clonal selection. We have sequenced five lambda genomic clones encoding complete sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) lambda L chain gene loci. While the coding regions among all five clones are highly homologous, the noncoding regions have significant differences that allowed us to identify two types of lambda L chain clusters. The noncoding regions are < 60% identical between groups, while the three clones belonging to the first group share > 95% identity in their noncoding regions. The second group is more diverse and may be comprised of several related subgroups. The two clones in this group share approximately 85% identity in the noncoding regions. Variations in the promoter region, including octamer and TATA box orientation and position, are identified between the two groups and may have implications for the molecular regulation of Ab production. Our results show the sandbar shark lambda L chain family to be a complex and diverse system.
