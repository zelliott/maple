Cytochrome P450s constitute a superfamily of hemoproteins, important in the metabolism of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds. The full-length cDNA of a novel cytochrome P450, CYP9G2, was isolated from a cDNA library. The cDNA is 2143 bp in length and contains an open reading frame from 50 to 1615 bp, encoding a protein of 521 amino acid residues. The putative P450 protein contains a highly hydrophobic N terminus and a P450 protein signature motif, FG/S*G*R*C*G***A/G, known as the important ligand for heme binding, analysis of the NH2-terminal sequence indicated that CYP9G2 is a microsomal P450. Using polymerase chain reaction with primers specific to CYP9G2, the genomic structure of CYP9G2 was analyzed, and it was found that the gene contains seven introns and eight exons within the coding region, all the sequences of the exon-intron junctions are consistent with the AG-GT rule. Multiple alignment indicated that CYP9G2 is most similar to CYP9E2 from the Blattella germanica (42.7% identity), it is also similar to the insect P450s in family 9, including CYP9L1 from Anopheles gambiae (38.7%) and CYP9A1 from Heliothis virescens (39.5%).
