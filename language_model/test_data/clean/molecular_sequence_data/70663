The primary structure is known for at least 29 thymidylate synthases and the crystal structure is known for several from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. All these are markedly similar making thymidylate synthase one of the most highly conserved enzymes known. There are, however, two surface loops, one near the active site and the other near the dimer interface, which exist in distinctly prokaryotic and eukaryotic versions. Specifically, in eukaryotes these two surface loops have small peptide inserts conserved in size and partly conserved in sequence, that are not present in the prokaryotic thymidylate synthases. To address the possibility that these inserts provide eukaryote-specific functions the Saccharomyces cerevisiae loops were individually modified to mimic their prokaryotic counterparts. Altering the surface loop near the active site increased Km for the nucleotide substrate and decreased apparent Vmax. Mutant variants with alterations in the other surface loop were unable to dimerize. Therefore these surface loops have acquired, perhaps by way of the eukaryotic inserts, characteristics that are important for catalytic activity and quaternary structure respectively.
