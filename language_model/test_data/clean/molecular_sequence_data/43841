Two distinct cDNAs encoding troponin C (TnC) isoforms were isolated from the ascidian, Halocynthia roretzi. One is expressed in adult body wall smooth muscle and heart muscle, and the other in larval striated muscle. The H. rorezti gene is composed of 7 exons separated by 6 introns, and Southern blot analysis showed that TnC is a single copy gene product. The two isoforms of TnC were derived through the alternative splicing of the third exon.
