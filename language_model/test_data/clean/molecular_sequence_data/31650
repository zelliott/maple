Tubby-like proteins (TLPs) have been associated with hormone signaling and responses to abiotic and biotic stress in plants. Recently, Arabidopsis thaliana TLP3 was found to translocate from the plasma membrane of cells in response to distinct abiotic stresses, thereby activating cellular signaling. In addition, several AtTLPs were demonstrated to be necessary for normal colonization of roots by the mutualistic fungus Piriformospora indica. Here, we present evidence for the involvement of another two AtTLPs in this interaction. Furthermore, we show that plasma membrane targeting of TLPs might be conserved in other plant species, although we did not find it for all members of the protein family. Finally, the position of a GFP-tag influences the localization of AtTLP3, which needs to be considered when working with TLPs.
