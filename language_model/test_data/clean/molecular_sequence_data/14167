Two faces for one matrix: A single bifaceted cyclopeptide block forms highly branched, porous, and intricate fibrillar networks, which span microscopic dimensions and mimic the extracellular matrix to support cell growth and proliferation. The peptide block has two domains connected with triglycine linkers (GGG); the domains consist of positively (blue) and negatively (red) charged heptads that provide interactions between different blocks.
