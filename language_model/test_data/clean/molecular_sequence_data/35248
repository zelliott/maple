Maltogenic amylase from Bacillus sp. US149 (MAUS149) is a cyclodextrin (CD)-degrading enzyme with a high preference for CDs over maltooligosaccharides. In this study, we investigated the roles of residue Asp46 in the specificity and catalytic properties of MAUS149 by using site-directed mutagenesis. Three mutated enzymes (D46V, D46G and D46N) were constructed and studied. The three mutants were found to be similar to the wild-type MAUS149 regarding thermoactivity, thermostability and pH profile. Nevertheless, the kinetic parameters for all the substrates of the mutant enzymes D46V and D46G were altered enormously as compared with those of the wild type. Indeed, the K(m) values of MAUS149/D46G for all substrates were strongly increased. Nevertheless, the affinity and catalytic efficiency of MAUS149/D46V toward Î²-CD were increased fivefold as compared with those of MAUS149. Molecular modelling suggests that residue D46 forms a salt bridge with residue K282. This bond would maintain the arrangement of side chains of residues Y45 and W47 in a particular orientation that promotes access to the catalytic site and maintains the substrate therein. Hence, any replacement with uncharged amino acids influenced the flexibility of the gate wall at the substrate binding cleft resulting in changes in substrate selectivity.
