P84 is a neuronal membrane glycoprotein that promotes the attachment and neurite outgrowth of cultured murine cerebellar cells. The heterophilic adhesive properties of P84 and its localization at sites of synaptogenesis suggest that it may be involved in regulation of synapse formation or maintenance. P84 is expressed in subsets of neurons throughout the CNS. By cloning the cDNA encoding murine P84, we have discovered that this molecule is a member of a family of phosphatase-binding proteins and is identical to the murine SHPS-1 cDNA. Here we report the cloning of two alternatively spliced forms of P84 and describe its localization within the CNS by in situ hybridization.
