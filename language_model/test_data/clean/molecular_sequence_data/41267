Turicella otitidis is an unusual corynebacterium with a controversial role in otitis media in children. Metabolic capabilities deduced from the draft genome indicate its adaptation to habitats on the human skin and in the intestine. The lack of candidate virulence factors implies that T. otitidis has a low pathogenic potential.
