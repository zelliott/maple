The development of specific agents against amyloidoses requires an understanding of the conformational behavior of fibrillogenic peptides in different environments on the microscopic level. We present extensive molecular dynamics simulations of the fibrillogenic Bindin (103-120) B18 fusion peptide for several different environments: a water-trifluorethanol (TFE) mixture, pure water, aqueous buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, and a buffer-vapor interface. The peptide was studied as an isolated molecule in solution or at an interface. In the simulations, the conformational behavior of the peptide was found to strongly depend on the environment in agreement with experimental data. Overall, large portions of the peptide were unstructured. Preformed alpha-helical conformations were least stable in pure water and most stable in the water-TFE mixture and the buffer-vapor interface. In all environments, the alpha-helical conformation was most stable in the region around residues 113-116, which are mainly hydrophilic. Extended configurations in water or buffer folded into structures containing beta-sheets in agreement with data from circular dichroism spectroscopy. In buffer, the beta-sheet content was larger than in water and alpha-beta transitions were observed at elevated temperature. Beta-sheets were formed by hydrophobic residues; turns were formed by hydrophilic residues. A few typical beta-sheets that contain different residues are suggested. A B18 molecule in a strand-loop-strand conformation placed in buffer in contact with vapor was spontaneously adsorbed to the buffer-vapor interface with its hydrophobic side pointing toward the vapor phase. The adsorption induced the formation of turns at positions 108-119 and alpha-helical conformations in the region around residues 114-117. Alpha-helices were parallel to the interface plane in agreement with data from IR reflection absorption spectroscopy.
