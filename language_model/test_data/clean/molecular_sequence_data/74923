The locus SU(Lv)-ets-2 of the sea urchin Lytechinas variegatus related to the oncogene v-ets of avian erythroblastosis virus E26 has been molecularly cloned. The cloned DNA was found to contain a region with a high degree of homology to E26 v-ets. The sea urchin homology with v-ets starts at a consensus splice acceptor sequence and stops at the point where homology between v-ets and human c-ets ends. This region corresponds to the Hu-ets-2 homologous sequences defined by Watson et al. (1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA 82, 7294-7298). Ninety-one out of 97 (or 94%) predicted amino acids are identical between sea urchin c-ets and E26 v-ets over the region of homology. This degree of homology exceeds the maximum homology previously found between any oncogene and an invertebrate homolog. A somewhat weaker homology with the Hu-ets-2 sequences continues beyond, for 13 codons, ending at a common termination codon. Northern blot analysis of mature unfertilized eggs and early embryos from sea urchins of the species Strongylocentrotus purpuratus revealed a single 6.8-kb ets-related RNA that is expressed at a maximum level during the early stages of embryonic development. This RNA species is polyadenylated indicating that it is the message for the sea urchin ets-2 gene.
