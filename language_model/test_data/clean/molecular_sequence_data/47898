This past year has produced determinations of X-ray crystal structures for three metallo-beta-lactamases and the elucidation of the catalytic mechanisms for a monozinc and a dizinc enzyme. These advances shed light on how such a diverse group of enzymes are evolving to inactivate so efficiently a broad spectrum of beta-lactam antibiotics.
