The delta-receptor selective dermorphin gen associated peptide (DGAP) and five of its analogues having structural modifications at positions 2, 4 and 5 were synthesized by the solid phase method using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl amino acid trichlorophenyl esters as coupling agents and rho-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol resin as the solid support. The delta-receptor selectivity of these peptides was determined by guinea pig ileum and mouse vas deferens assays. The latter assay was carried out using modified Kreb's solution aerated with pure oxygen instead of carbogen. All the synthetic peptides were found to be delta-receptor selective.
