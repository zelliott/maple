cDNA clones were prepared from poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from a population enriched in postmeiotic rooster testes spermatogenic cells. A series of clones was sequenced at random and two partial sequences corresponding to the C-terminal coding and 3' untranslated region of the chicken protamine mRNA were obtained. The deduced amino acid sequence of this C-terminal coding region corresponds to the sequence previously described at the protein level for the chicken protamine, galline [Nakano, M., Tobita, T., and Ando, T. (1976), Int. J. Peptide Prot. Res. 8, 565-578]. To study the expression of this protamine gene, RNA was prepared from chicken testes at different stages of development, electrophoresed in formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with a rooster protamine cDNA probe. Two populations of mRNA of sizes ranging between 420 and 465 bases are expressed in postmeiotic rooster testis cells. To determine if there was a differential expression of the two populations of mRNA in the final postmeiotic haploid stages of spermatogenesis, RNA was purified from adult rooster cells separated at unit gravity according to their differences in size by the Staput technique. The RNA was similarly analyzed by Northern blots. The results indicate that round spermatids are enriched in the 465-nucleotide mRNA species, whereas in the final stage of elongated spermatids the 420-nucleotide species is the only one present, suggesting either post-transcriptional processing, the presence of two different sets of genes that are differentially expressed, or a single set of genes with differential promoter usage.
