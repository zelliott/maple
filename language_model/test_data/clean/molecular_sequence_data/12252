A procedure for isolation in preparative amounts of 15 individual proteins from ribosomal 30S subparticles of Thermus thermophilus under non-denaturing conditions, has been developed. The amino acid composition and molecular masses of the proteins have been determined and the UV absorption spectra and extinction coefficients measured. A homology of 13 proteins to corresponding ribosomal proteins of E. coli has been established.
