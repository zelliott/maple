The degradability of pivalic acid was established by the isolation of several facultative denitrifying strains belonging to Zoogloea resiniphila, to Thauera and Herbaspirillum, and to Comamonadaceae, related to [Aquaspirillum] and Acidovorax, and of a nitrate-reducing bacterium affiliated with Moraxella osloensis. Pivalic acid was completely mineralized to carbon dioxide. The catabolic pathways may involve an oxidation to dimethylmalonate or a carbon skeleton rearrangement, a putative 2,2-dimethylpropionyl coenzyme A mutase.
