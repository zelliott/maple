Overlapping cDNAs encoding the entire heavy chain of cytoplasmic dynein (MAP 1C) have been obtained. A 4644 amino acid polypeptide containing four ATP-binding consensus sequences is predicted. Homology with the sea urchin flagellar outer arm dynein beta heavy chain is observed within the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein. The N-terminal third of the two polypeptides shows no clear relationship, suggesting that this region of MAP 1C is responsible for its association with retrograde organelles and other functions. Northern blot analysis reveals a 16.5 kb band in brain and other tissues. Southern blot analysis is consistent with a single cytoplasmic dynein gene. Thus, in contrast with cilia and flagella, which contain numerous forms of dynein, our results are consistent with the existence of only a single cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain gene, which appears to produce only a single transcript.
