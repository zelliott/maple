Mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (mMnSOD) plays a vital role in the defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS) in eukaryotic mitochondria. In this study, we isolated and identified a mMnSOD gene from Apis cerana cerana, which we named AccSOD2. Several putative transcription factor-binding sites were identified within the 5'-flanking region of AccSOD2, which suggests that AccSOD2 may be involved in organismal development and/or environmental stress responses. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that AccSOD2 is highly expressed in larva and pupae during different developmental stages. In addition, the expression of AccSOD2 could be induced by cold (4 °C), heat (42 °C), H2O2, ultraviolet light (UV), HgCl2, and pesticide treatment. Using a disc diffusion assay, we provide evidence that recombinant AccSOD2 protein can play a functional role in protecting cells from oxidative stress. Finally, the in vivo activities of AccSOD2 were measured under a variety of stressful conditions. Taken together, our results indicate that AccSOD2 plays an important role in cellular stress responses and anti-oxidative processes and that it may be of critical importance to honeybee survival.
