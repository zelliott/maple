The oncogene v-myb and its cellular progenitor c-myb encode nuclear, DNA binding phosphoproteins that control the expression of certain target genes in immature hematopoietic cells. Here, we report the isolation of a myb-related chicken gene, chicken B-myb. We show that expression of B-myb, unlike that of c-myb, is not restricted to hematopoietic cells, suggesting that B-myb functions in a broader spectrum of cell types than c-myb. We have identified the authentic chicken B-myb protein as a nuclear protein of approximately 110 kDa. We show that the B-myb protein specifically recognizes v-myb binding sites in vitro and that binding is mediated by an N-terminally located DNA binding domain. Although B-myb protein recognizes myb binding sites, B-myb fails to transactivate several myb-responsive gene constructs as well as the endogenous myb-responsive gene mim-1. Instead, we find that B-myb represses v-myb- and c-myb-mediated activation of the mim-1 gene, most likely by competing with other myb proteins for binding sites. Our results raise the possibility that B-myb is an inhibitory member of the myb family.
