In the experiment of mouse transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) gene expression in mammary tumors, various sizes of amplified products by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using mouse TGF alpha primers were detected in addition to a predicted size in four strains of mice. During the further analysis of these RT-PCR products in mouse mammary tumors, the transcript of neurocan gene was detected in the mammary tumor from SHN mice by the cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis after RT-PCR reaction using mouse TGF alpha primers. The 5'-nucleotide sequence of sequential 246bp in the amplified cDNA of 527bp was completely identical to a middle part of mouse neurocan cDNA sequence, one of the chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycan expressed in the nervous tissue.
