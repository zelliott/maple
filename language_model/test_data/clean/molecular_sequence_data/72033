The FinO protein regulates the transfer potential of F-like conjugative plasmids through its interaction with FinP antisense RNA and its target, traJ mRNA. FinO binds to and protects FinP from degradation and promotes duplex formation between FinP and traJ mRNA in vitro. The FinP secondary structure consists of two stem-loop domains separated by a 4-base spacer and terminated by a 6-base tail. Previous studies suggested FinO bound to the smooth 14-base pair helix of stem-loop II. In this investigation, RNA mobility shift analysis was used to study the interaction between a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-FinO fusion protein and a series of synthetic FinP and traJ mRNA variants. Mutations in 16 of the 28 bases in stem II of FinP that are predicted to disrupt base pairing did not significantly alter the GST-FinO binding affinity. Removal of the single-stranded regions on either side of stem-loop II led to a dramatic decrease in GST-FinO binding to FinP and to the complementary region of the traJ mRNA leader. While no evidence for sequence-specific contacts was found, the results suggest that FinO recognizes the overall shape of the RNA and is influenced by the length of the single-stranded regions flanking the stem-loop.
