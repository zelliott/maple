The actinomycete strain YIM 90462T was isolated from a salt mine sample collected from Yunnan province, south-west China. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis demonstrated that the isolate, which had sequence similarities of more than 97 % to Thermobifida alba, Thermobifida fusca and Thermobifida cellulosilytica, was a candidate member of the genus Thermobifida. Subsequently, a polyphasic approach was used to clarify the taxonomic position of strain YIM 90462T. Its diagnostic diamino acid was meso-diaminopimelic acid and whole-cell sugars contained galactose, xylose and glucose. The predominant menaquinones were MK-10(H6) and MK-10(H8). The major fatty acids were iso-C16:0 and anteiso-C17:0. Results of DNA-DNA hybridizations and physiological and biochemical tests enabled genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strain YIM 90462T from the three Thermobifida species with validly published names. Consequently, it is proposed that strain YIM 90462T should be recognized as a representative of a novel species of Thermobifida, Thermobifida halotolerans sp. nov. The type strain is YIM 90462T (=KCTC 19123T =DSM 44931T). In addition, an emended description of the genus Thermobifida is presented.
