The increasing size of protein sequence databases is straining methods of sequence analysis, even as the increased information offers opportunities for sophisticated analyses of protein structure, function, and evolution. Here we describe a method that uses artificial intelligence-based algorithms to build models of families of protein sequences. These models can be used to search protein sequence databases for remote homologs. The MEME (Multiple Expectation-maximization for Motif Elicitation) software package identifies motif patterns in a protein family, and these motifs are combined into a hidden Markvov model (HMM) for use as a database searching tool. Meta-MEME is sensitive and accurate, as well as automated and unbiased, making it suitable for the analysis of large datasets. We demonstrate Meta-MEME on a family of dehydrogenases that includes mammalian 11 beta-hydroxysteroid and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and their homologs in the short chain alcohol dehydrogenase family. We chose this dataset because it is large and phylogenetically diverse, providing a good test of the sensitivity and selectivity of Meta-MEME on a protein family of biological interest. Indeed, Meta-MEME identifies at least 350 members of this family in Genpept96 and clearly separates these sequences from non-homologous proteins. We also show how the MEME motif output can be used for phylogenetic analysis.
