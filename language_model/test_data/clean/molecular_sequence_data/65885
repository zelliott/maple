The amylose content of the mutant of autotetraploid indica rice D4063-1 is 5.23% anout, which was half of its origin diploid rice Minghui 63. The whole sequence of Waxy gene of D4063-1 was amplified and sequenced. A base was absent on the Wx of D4063-1 in exon sequence, which resulted in frameshift mutation and terminating codon occurred ahead in the 9 exon. The mutation of Wx also led to the change of some mutation in the 9 exon and terminating codon occurred early. The change of Wx also led to changes of the sites of common restriction endonuclease. The results showed that D4063-1 added two sph sites compared to indica and japonica rice; Compared to japonica rice, D4063-1decreased six Acc sites, and added 4 Xba, a Pst and a Sal restriction sites. Phylogenic analysis showed that the DNA sequence of Waxy gene of D4063-1 was closer to indica rice. We supposed that the Waxy gene of D4063-1 originated from genotype of Wxa. According to the differences of Wx in D4063-1, we deduced the absent base led to RNA splicing obstacle, which was the main cause of low amylose content and it might be related to the soft rice phenotype. Based on analysis of Wx of D4063-1, indica and japonica and according to the special sites of the three species, primers as markers-AUT4063-I were designed to distinguish D4063-1 from other rice. Combining with primer pair F5, dominant and codominant ways were established for discriminating them, and rapid and correct identification of D4063-1 from other rice could be done.
