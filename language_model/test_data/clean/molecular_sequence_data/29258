The structure of intracellular third loop peptide (betaIII-2: RRSSKFCLKEKKALK) was studied by CD and NMR spectroscopy. According to the CD study, this peptide forms a helix in the TFE solution. The three-dimensional molecular structure in TFE was determined by the 2D (1)H NMR spectroscopy. The structure consists of a positive charge cluster on the C-terminal side of the peptide chain. This part will be an active site of the peptide interacting with the G-protein.
