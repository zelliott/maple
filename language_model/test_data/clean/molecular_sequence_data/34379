Twenty five rhizobial isolates were obtained from root nodules of Medicago sativa inoculated with soil samples collected from the Sapporo region and Ishigaki Island in Japan. To study their diversity and characterize them in relation to the climatic conditions of their soils of origin, a polyphasic approach analyzing stress tolerance, symbiotic and genetic properties was used. Stress tolerance assays revealed marked variations in salinity, pH and temperature tolerance. Isolates originating from a sub-tropical climate in alkaline soil (Ishigaki Island) tolerated high temperature, salinity and pH levels. Moreover, isolates recovered from a temperate climate in acidic soil (Sapporo) were sensitive to high temperature and salinity, and tolerated acidic pH. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved 16S rRNA and recA genes, and symbiotic nodA and nifDK revealed 25 isolates to be closely related to Ensifer meliloti. Furthermore, the branch patterns of phylogenetic trees constructed from different genes revealed the existence of at least two E. meliloti types in the soils studied. These results may be relevant to programs directed towards improving crop productivity through biofertilization with locally adapted and genetically defined strains.
