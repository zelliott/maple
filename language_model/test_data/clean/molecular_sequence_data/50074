Na+,K(+)-ATPase is a ubiquitous plasmalemmal membrane protein essential for generation and maintenance of transmembrane Na+ and K+ gradients in virtually all animal cell types. Activity and polarized distribution of renal Na+,(+)-ATPase appears to depend on connection of ankyrin to the spectrin-based membrane cytoskeleton as well as on association with actin filaments. In a previous study we showed copurification and codistribution of renal Na+,K(+)-ATPase not only with ankyrin, spectrin and actin, but also with two further peripheral membrane proteins, pasin 1 and pasin 2. In this paper we show by sequence analysis through mass spectrometry as well as by immunoblotting that pasin 2 is identical to moesin, a member of the FERM (protein 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) protein family, all members of which have been shown to serve as cytoskeletal adaptor molecules. Moreover, we show that recombinant full-length moesin as well as its FERM domain bind to Na+,K(+)-ATPase and that this binding can be inhibited by an antibody specific for the ATPase activity-containing cytoplasmic loop (domain 3) of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase alpha-subunit. This loop has been previously shown to be a site essential for ankyrin binding. These observations indicate that moesin might not only serve as direct linker molecule of Na+,K(+)-ATPase to actin filaments but also modify ankyrin binding at domain 3 of Na+,K(+)-ATPase in a way similar to protein 4.1 modifying the binding of ankyrin to the cytoplasmic domain of the erythrocyte anion exchanger (AE1).
