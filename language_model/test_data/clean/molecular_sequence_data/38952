The Hopi gene is a member of the maize r1 gene family. By genetic and molecular analyses we report that Hopi consists of a single gene residing on chromosome 10 approximately 4.5 cM distal to r1. Hopi conditions anthocyanin deposition in aleurone, scutellum, pericarp, root, mesocotyl, leaves, and anthers, thus representing one of the broadest specifications of pigmentation pattern reported to date of all the r1 genes. A unique feature of the Hopi gene is that seeds are completely devoid of pigment at maturity but show a photoinducible germination-dependent anthocyanin accumulation in aleurone and scutellum. Our analysis has shown that the Hopi transcript is not present in scutellum of developing seeds but is induced only upon germination and that the simultaneous presence of both C1 and Hopi mRNAs is necessary to achieve A1 activation in scutella. We conclude that the expression pattern of the Hopi gene accounts for the germination-dependent anthocyanin synthesis in scutella, whereas the developmental competence of germinating seeds to induce anthocyanin production in scutella results from the combination of the light-inducible expression of C1 and the developmentally regulated expression of the Hopi gene.
