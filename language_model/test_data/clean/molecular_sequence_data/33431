A squalene synthase gene cloned (GuSQS1, accession number in GenBank database: AM182329) from Glycyrrhiza uralensis was transferred into G. uralensis via Agrobacterium rhizogenes A4 for investigating biosynthesis pathway and enhancing synthesis of glycyrrhizic acid (GA). Hypocotyl explants from G. uralensis were infected with A. rhizogenes A4 containing GuSQS1 gene to induce the hairy roots. The hairy root lines established were selected in medium containing 0.8 mg x L(-1) phosphinothricin (PPT) and analyzed by PCR and southern blotting. The transgenic hairy roots were cultured in liquid MS medium. GA contents in transgenic hairy roots were detected by HPLC. Results showed that maximal GA content in transgenic hairy root lines was 3.6 times as high as in wild type hairy roots.
