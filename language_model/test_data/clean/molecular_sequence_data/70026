Thiosphaera pantotropha grows on methanol as carbon and energy source following spontaneous mutation to a Mox+ phenotype after incubation in media containing methanol. Acquisition of ability to grow on methanol correlates with the appearance of a c-type cytochrome, molecular mass 26 kDa, which is suggested to substitute for the product of the moxG gene, which is the electron acceptor from methanol in related bacteria, but which is absent from T. pantotropha. Mutation leading to growth on methylamine as carbon and energy source was not observed despite the presence of in vitro methylamine dehydrogenase activity in cells grown on choline. Lack of growth on methylamine may correlate with the absence of amicyanin, which is the obligatory electron acceptor from methylamine dehydrogenase in other organisms.
