The topology of bacterial DNA varies in response to extracellular environmental stimuli, providing a possible mechanism for environmental control of gene expression during bacterial pathogenesis. The contribution of DNA topology to the control of transcription is complex, but an appreciation of the distinction between local and global DNA topological effects is helping to clarify this complexity.
