A novel human gene (named hrhAMR) encoding a seven transmembrane receptor which shares a homology of 73% on the amino acid level with the rat adrenomedullin (AM) receptor has been isolated by a polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) cloning strategy. Southern- and Northern-blot analysis suggest a single hrhAMR gene, which is highly expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, immune system, adrenal gland and liver, an expression pattern being quite different to that found in rat tissues with the homologue rat probe. Because of its homology with the rat AM receptor, we speculate that potential ligands may be members of the calcitonin-gene-related-peptide/amylin/adrenomedullin peptide family.
