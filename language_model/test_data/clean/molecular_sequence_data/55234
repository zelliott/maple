Deriving structural information about a protein from NMR experimental data is still a non-trivial challenge to computational biochemistry. This is because of the low ratio of the number of independent observables to the number of molecular degrees of freedom, the approximations involved in the different relationships between particular observable quantities and molecular conformation, and the averaged character of the experimental data. For example, protein (3)J-coupling data are seldom used for structure refinement because of the multiple-valuedness and limited accuracy of the Karplus relationship linking a (3)J-coupling to a torsional angle. Moreover, sampling of the large conformational space is still problematic. Using the 99-residue protein plastocyanin as an example we investigated whether use of a thermodynamically calibrated force field, inclusion of solvent degrees of freedom, and application of adaptive local-elevation sampling that accounts for conformational averaging produces a more realistic representation of the ensemble of protein conformations than standard single-structure refinement in a non-explicit solvent using restraints that do not account for averaging and are partly based on non-observed data. Yielding better agreement with observed experimental data, the protein conformational ensemble is less restricted than when using standard single-structure refinement techniques, which are likely to yield a picture of the protein which is too rigid.
