Defective-interfering (DI) RNAs of RNA viruses, in general, are generated and continue to evolve in size during serial undiluted passages of viruses. This evolution was thought to occur by independent generation of DI RNAs during virus passages and subsequent selection of new DI RNAs under new cellular conditions. Here we demonstrate that recombination between the old DI RNA and the helper viral RNA can be one of the mechanisms for natural DI RNA evolution. A mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) DI RNA, DIssE RNA, was transcribed in vitro and transfected into a mouse cell line infected with a different MHV strain (A59), which is distinguishable from the original natural helper MHV (JHM). During subsequent serial undiluted passages of the harvested virus, several novel DI RNA species were generated, while the original DIssE RNA disappeared by passage 11. cDNA cloning and sequence analysis of one of these novel DI RNAs, designated DI-2, revealed that it is composed of four discontinuous regions of the genomic sequence and is different from the structure of the original DIssE RNA. Sequence comparison among DI-2, DIssE, and helper MHV-A59 RNAs showed that DI-2 sequence is similar to DIssE in the first and second regions, but similar to the helper A59 virus in the third and last regions. Thus, this DI RNA was generated by RNA recombination between the original DIssE RNA and the helper viral RNA. These results indicate that recombination between DI RNA and helper virus RNA can be involved in the natural evolution of DI RNAs.
