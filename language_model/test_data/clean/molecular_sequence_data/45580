Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 subtype C (HIV-1C) accounts for about 50% of all HIV infections in the pandemic and is the predominant subtype in the heavily burdened region of southern Africa. HIV-1C possesses unique genetic and phenotypic features that might be associated with biological differences compared to other subtypes. Here, we generated virus isolates from individuals at different stages of HIV-1C infection and investigated the chemokine receptor repertoire that the derived HIV-1C isolates may utilize for entry. Our results show that the R5 phenotype predominates among viruses in Botswana, with a lesser contribution of viruses showing the dualtropic X4R5 phenotype. No viruses of pure X4 phenotype were found, which suggests no discernable evolution of HIV-1C to a monotropic X4 phenotype as the epidemic ages in Botswana. Usage of other coreceptors was rare and apparently insignificant. These results enhance our understanding of HIV-1C biology, with implications for designing and testing therapeutic and prophylactic agents.
