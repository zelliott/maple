Endothelium-derived mediators are released in response to shear stress and a variety of endogenous substances including bradykinin and angiotensins. They may contribute to the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system in the vascular wall and in the kidney. Bradykinin is a powerful agonist at endothelial cells, and the actions of this peptide, which is generated by components of the vascular wall, during angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may determine some of the vascular effects of ACE inhibitors. In vitro studies demonstrate that the relaxations to bradykinin are mostly endothelium dependent and are mediated by nitric oxide, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, and/or vasodilator prostaglandins; however, these endothelium-derived relaxing factors do not always contribute simultaneously to the relaxations in every artery. The contribution of ACE in the termination of bradykinin action, relative to the other inactivation processes (including carboxypeptidases and internalization) also may determine the ability of ACE inhibitors to augment the effects of the kinin. Furthermore, it appears that the level of ACE activity and the potency of bradykinin, respectively, are not uniform in all preparations. In arteries in which bradykinin is very efficacious and in which ACE activity may be relatively low, ACE inhibitors may prolong but not amplify the responses to the peptide. The pharmacologic characteristics of the responses of the different vascular beds to bradykinin, together with the modulation of endothelium-dependent responses to other agonists (including purines), may be of importance in the heterogeneity of the vasodilator actions of ACE inhibitors.
