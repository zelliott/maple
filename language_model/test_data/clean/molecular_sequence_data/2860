The expression of oLpLN region of the plasmid pNT6 causes the high instability of the plasmid. Mutations in the promoter pL region and lesions in the structural part of the N gene result in the stable inheritance of the plasmid. The plasmids pNT6::IS1 containing the IS1-element inserted into the different loci of oLpLN region restore the high instability of the plasmid inheritance in the strain 4830 coding for oLpLN. The plasmids pIG3 and pIG4 of the series pNT6: :IS1 permit one to obtain the collection of random deletions in the cloned fragments induced by IS1-element.
