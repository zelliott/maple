Reactive oxygen species, such as H2O2, have been recognized as intracellular messengers involved in several cell functions. Here we report the activation of the tyrosine kinase pp60(src) by H2O2, a mechanism required for the activation of store-mediated Ca2+ entry (SMCE) in human platelets. Treatment of platelets with H2O2 resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent activation of pp60(src). Incubation with GF 109203X, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, prevented H2O2-induced pp60(src) activation. In contrast, dimethyl-BAPTA loading did not affect this response, suggesting that activation of pp60(src) by H2O2 is independent of increases in [Ca2+](i). Cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, significantly reduced H2O2-induced pp60(src) activation. We found that platelet stimulation with thapsigargin (TG) plus ionomycin (Iono) or thrombin induced rapid H2O2 production, a mechanism independent of elevations in [Ca2+](i). Treatment of platelets with catalase attenuated TG plus Iono- and thrombin-induced activation of pp60(src). In addition, catalase as well as the pp60(src) inhibitor, PP1, reduced both the activation of SMCE and the coupling between the hTrp1 and the IP(3)R type II without having any effect on the maintenance of SMCE. Consistent with the role of PKC in the activation of pp60(src) by H2O2, the PKC inhibitors GF 109202X and Ro-31-8220 were found to reduced SMCE in platelets. This study suggests that platelet activation with TG plus Iono or thrombin is associated with H2O2 production, which acts as a second messenger by stimulating pp60(src) by a PKC-dependent pathway and is involved in the activation of SMCE in these cells.
