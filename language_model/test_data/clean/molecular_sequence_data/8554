DNAdraw is a Macintosh program designed to prepare DNA and protein data for publication. In additional to providing standard ways of highlighting data, e.g., fonts, styles and shading, DNAdraw has special features for formatting sequence data and for handling aligned sequence data. Output for the program is to a PostScript printer. A simple example is presented to illustrate DNAdraw formatting and highlighting, and an example for aligned data is given. This new version of the program that has been written for other machines is the first to run under a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and incorporates many new features.
