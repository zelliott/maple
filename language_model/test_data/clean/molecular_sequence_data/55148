To study the functions of RNA-binding proteins independent of their RNA-binding activity, tethering methods have been developed, based on the use of the RNA-binding domain of a well-characterized RNA-binding protein and its target RNA. Two bacteriophage proteins have mainly been used as tethers: the MS2 coat protein and the lambda N protein. Here we report an alternative system using the Tat (trans-activator) peptide from the bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), which binds to BIV-TAR (trans-activation response) RNA. We demonstrate the usefulness of this system by applying it to the analysis of the TNRC6B protein, a component of the microRNA-induced silencing complex.
