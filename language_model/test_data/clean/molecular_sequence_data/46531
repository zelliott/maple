The submaxillary gland of the adult male mouse contains a number of serine proteases, several of which are involved in the proteolytic processing of precursors to growth factors and other biologically active polypeptides. Here we report the isolation and identification of a cDNA clone corresponding to one of the proteases, the type B of the epidermal growth factor-binding protein. A pronounced sequence homology was found between the predicted activation peptide of this protease and the NH2-terminal extension of the nerve growth factor alpha subunit, suggesting that the latter protein has an uncleaved activation peptide attached to its NH2 terminus.
