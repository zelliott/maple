Previous studies in transgenic mice and cultured cells have indicated that the major enhancer function for erythroid cell expression of the globin genes is provided by the heterodimeric basic-leucine zipper transcription factor NF-E2. Globin gene expression within cultured mouse erythroleukemia cells is highly dependent on NF-E2. To examine the requirement for this factor in vivo, we used homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to generate mice lacking the hematopoietic-specific subunit, p45 NF-E2. The most dramatic aspect of the homozygous mutant mice was an absence of circulating platelets, which led to the death of most animals due to hemorrhage. In contrast, the effect of loss of NF-E2 on the erythroid lineage was surprisingly mild. Although neonates exhibited severe anemia and dysmorphic red-cell changes, probably compounded by concomitant bleeding, surviving adults exhibited only mild changes consistent with a small decrease in the hemoglobin content per cell. p45 NF-E2-null mice responded to anemia with compensatory reticulocytosis and splenomegaly. Globin chain synthesis was balanced, and switching from fetal to adult globins progressed normally. Although these findings are consistent with the substitution of NF-E2 function in vivo by one or more compensating proteins, gel shift assays using nuclear extracts from p45 NF-E2-null mice failed to reveal novel complexes formed on an NF-E2 binding site. Thus, regulation of globin gene transcription through NF-E2 binding sites in vivo is more complex than has been previously appreciated.
