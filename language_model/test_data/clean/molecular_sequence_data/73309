The plant pathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae produced extracellular alkaline protease activity when grown in liquid medium supplemented with a protein source. A serine protease was purified 80-fold in a single step, using cation-exchange chromatography, from the filtrate of cultures grown with skim milk as a protein source. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the 30-kDa protein (VDP30) that copurified with the serine protease activity suggested that VDP30 is a trypsin-like protein. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed the synthetic substrate N alpha-benzoyl-DL-arginine p-nitroanilide hydrochloride (BAPNA), and the activity on BAPNA was inhibited by leupeptin, further verifying the trypsin-like nature of the enzyme.
