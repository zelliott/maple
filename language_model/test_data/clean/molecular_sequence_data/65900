Limited actin proteolysis is the hallmark of bacterial metalloprotease ECP32. While ECP32 has long been considered an Escherichia coli protein, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the active enzyme described previously, could not been retrieved in the E. coli genome. We cloned, sequenced and characterized Serratia grimesii protease grimelysin and show that grimelysin is similar to the previously described protease ECP32.
