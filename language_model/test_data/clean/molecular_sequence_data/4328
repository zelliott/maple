The optimal conditions capable of inducing an increase in HSP70 neosynthesis during development of the urodele amphibian Pleurodeles waltl were determined in this study. These conditions depend on temperature, heat shock duration and recovery duration. In oocytes, a heat shock response was repeatedly obtained at 37 degrees C for 15 min followed by 1 h recovery. These results provided evidence for heat shock response at every stage considered. An increase in HSP70 synthesis was noted throughout oogenesis, but it did not lead to an increase in the amount of soluble HSP70, except for stage VI oocytes. Such results suggest that from stage II to stage IV oocytes, an equilibrium occurs between the HSP70 used and the HSP70 neosynthesized. In contrast, in stage VI oocytes, heat shock led to overproduction of HSP70. During early development, the heat shock response was repeatedly obtained only from the gastrula stage with a 37 degrees C shock and a 15 min duration of treatment. Surprisingly, during cleavage stage, the soluble HSP70 total amount increased after heat shock at a time when no HSP70 neosynthesis occurred.
