This report presents an overview of human enterovirus B species in Henan Province. A total of 14 isolates of HEV-B species isolated under HFMD surveillance network during the six months in 2010 were examined. Based on molecular typing results targeting VP1 region, 14 isolates were classified into 6 serotypes of HEV-B. Furthermore, comparison of these 14 isolates with reference strains and strains in mainland China was conducted. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that E25, E11 and E6 showed homology with those from Shandong Province which adjoins Henan Province. E1 and E13 showed homology with those from Yunnan Province, and E30 showed homology with Henan strain isolated in 2008. Cocirculation of two lineages of echovirus 6 was observed.
