Recently we reported the presence of both the guanylyl cyclase-linked (116 kDa) and the ANF-C (66 kDa) atrial natriuretic peptide receptors in the rat liver. Since ANF 103-125 (atriopeptin II) stimulates cGMP production in livers and because cGMP has previously been shown to mimic the actions of cAMP in regulating hepatic carbohydrate metabolism, studies were performed to investigate the effects of atriopeptin II on hepatic glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Additionally, employing analogs of atrial natriuretic hormone [des-(Q116, S117, G118, L119, G120) ANF 102-121 (C-ANF) and des-(C105,121) ANF 104-126 (analog I)] which bind only the ANF-C receptors, the role of the ANF-C receptors in the hepatic actions of atriopeptin II was evaluated. In perfused livers of fed rats atriopeptin II, but not C-ANF and analog I, inhibited hepatic glycolysis and stimulated glucose production. Moreover, analog I did not alter the ability of atriopeptin II to inhibit hepatic glycolysis. Atriopeptin II, but not C-ANF and analog I, also stimulated cGMP production in perfused rat livers. Furthermore, while atriopeptin II inhibited the activity ratio of pyruvate kinase by 30%, C-ANF did not alter hepatic pyruvate kinase activity. Finally, in rat hepatocytes, atriopeptin II stimulated the synthesis of [14C]glucose from [2-14C]pyruvate by 50% and this effect of atriopeptin II was mimicked by the exogenously supplied cGMP analog, 8-bromo cGMP. Thus atriopeptin II increases hepatic gluconeogenesis and inhibits glycolysis, in part by inhibiting pyruvate kinase activity, and the effects of atriopeptin II are mediated via activation of guanylyl cyclase-linked ANF receptors which elevate cGMP production.
