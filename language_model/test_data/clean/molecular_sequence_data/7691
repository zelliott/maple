In this chapter we review recent molecular knowledge on two structurally related mammalian triglyceride lipases which have evolved from a common ancestral gene. The common property of the lipase family members is that they interact with non-polar substances. Pancreatic lipase hydrolyzes triglycerides in the small intestine in the presence of many dietary components, other digestive enzymes and high concentrations of detergents (bile salts). Lipoprotein lipase acts at the vascular side of the blood vessels where it hydrolyses triglycerides and some phospholipids of the circulating plasma lipoproteins. A third member of the gene family, hepatic lipase, is found in the liver of mammals. Also, this lipase is involved in lipoprotein metabolism. The three lipases are distantly related to some non-catalytic yolk proteins from Drosophila (Persson et al., 1989; Kirchgessner et al., 1989; Hide et al., 1992) and to a phospholipase A1 from hornet venom (Soldatova et al., 1993).
