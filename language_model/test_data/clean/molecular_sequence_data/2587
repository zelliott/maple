In an investigation of viroid replication and pathogenesis, we have assessed the effect of sequence duplication of the upper central conserved region (CCR) of the molecule on the infectivity of RNAs transcribed in vitro from partial dimers of wild-type and mutant viroid cDNAs. In one set of experiments, the relative infectivities of one monomeric potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTV) and five oligomeric SP6 transcripts [PSTV or PSTV-TASV (tomato apical stunt viroid) chimeras] were compared. With one exception, the extent of sequence duplication in the CCR, and thus the length of the so-called palindrome, does correlate with an increase in specific infectivity. In a second set of experiments, in vitro generated site-specific mutations in cloned PSTV were used as markers to determine if a cleavage/ligation at sites other than the palindrome could generate infectious molecules in vivo. The creation of a novel PSTV-TPMV (tomato planta macho viroid) chimera in these experiments provides evidence that multimeric RNAs can be processed at sites other than the CCR to yield monomeric progeny.
