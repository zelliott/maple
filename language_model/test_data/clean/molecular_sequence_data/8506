We have evaluated the importance of the OCTA site in both the promoter and enhancer regions for the induction of enhancement of IgH chain gene transcription after B cell activation. These studies show that although occupancy of the OCTA site in the promoter is critical for basal transcription of the mu gene, it is not necessary for the increase in transcription induced by in vivo activation. On the other hand, the OCTA site in the enhancer is necessary for neither basal transcription nor in vivo activation of transcription; however, occupancy of this site is required for further up-regulation in transcription of the mu gene in pre-activated cells. These results indicate that different mechanisms may be involved in the activation of resting versus in vivo stimulated B lymphocytes. The findings are discussed in relation to the phenotype described for Oct-2-deficient mice.
