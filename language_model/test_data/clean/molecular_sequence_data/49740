The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptors (IP(3)Rs) are IP(3)-gated Ca(2+) channels on intracellular Ca(2+) stores. Herein, we report a novel protein, termed IRBIT (IP(3)R binding protein released with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate), which interacts with type 1 IP(3)R (IP(3)R1) and was released upon IP(3) binding to IP(3)R1. IRBIT was purified from a high salt extract of crude rat brain microsomes with IP(3) elution using an affinity column with the huge immobilized N-terminal cytoplasmic region of IP(3)R1 (residues 1-2217). IRBIT, consisting of 530 amino acids, has a domain homologous to S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase in the C-terminal and in the N-terminal, a 104 amino acid appendage containing multiple potential phosphorylation sites. In vitro binding experiments showed the N-terminal region of IRBIT to be essential for interaction, and the IRBIT binding region of IP(3)R1 was mapped to the IP(3) binding core. IP(3) dissociated IRBIT from IP(3)R1 with an EC(50) of approximately 0.5 microm, i.e. it was 50 times more potent than other inositol polyphosphates. Moreover, alkaline phosphatase treatment abolished the interaction, suggesting that the interaction was dualistically regulated by IP(3) and phosphorylation. Immunohistochemical studies and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed the relevance of the interaction in a physiological context. These results suggest that IRBIT is released from activated IP(3)R, raising the possibility that IRBIT acts as a signaling molecule downstream from IP(3)R.
