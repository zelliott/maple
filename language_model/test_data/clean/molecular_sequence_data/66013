In silico, physiological and in planta analyses were used to characterize pBTAi1, a 229-kb accessory plasmid from Bradyrhizobium sp. strain BTAi1, and assess its potential ecological function under free-living and symbiotic growth conditions. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of an uptake hydrogenase system, a repABC family plasmid replication module and open reading frames encoding type IV secretion system, TraI and TraR autoinducer proteins and several copper resistance-related proteins. Bradyrhizobium sp. BTAi1 was capable of growing in 200 mg l(-1) CuCl2. In contrast, the closely related, plasmid-free Bradyrhizobium sp. strain ORS278 could not grow at copper concentrations exceeding 100 mg l(-1). The plasmid-localized hydrogenase genes were phylogenetically distinct from those typically found in other rhizobial species, and were most related to hup genes from Thiobacillus denitrificans. The induction of the plasmid-borne hydrogenase genes during symbiosis was significantly lower than the two chromosomal-borne hydrogenase clusters. CHEF-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used for a comprehensive analysis of the diversity, abundance and genetic composition of accessory plasmids in other Bradyrhizobium strains. Plasmids were detected in 11 of 46 (23.9%) geographically diverse Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Bradyrhizobium elkanii strains, isolated from the United States, China and Thailand. Plasmid size was heterogeneous, ranging from 75 to 330 kb, with only two strains (DASA01244 and DASA01265) harboring plasmids with identical (240 kb) size. None of the plasmids harbored nodulation or hydrogenase genes. Taken together, our results indicate that while plasmids having ecologically significant functions may be detected in Bradyrhizobium sp. strains, they lack genes necessary for symbioses with legumes.
