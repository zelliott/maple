Besides natural peptide ligands, screening of random peptide libraries has yielded novel bioactive peptides for cell surface receptors. A method is described that uses a modified bacteriophage as a detection reagent to monitor the expression of receptor channels in mammalian cells and to probe the molecular interaction between phage-tethered peptides (phi T-peptides) and specific receptor targets. By taking advantage of a specific multivalent interaction between phi T-peptides and the receptor target, assays have been developed that use phi T-peptides specific for the N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor, an important ligand-gated ion channel in the nervous system, to monitor the receptor expression in cultured mammalian cells. Combining these phi T-peptide binding assays with fluorescence-activated cell sorting, 10(4) random glutamate receptor mutants were screened and candidate interaction residues were identified. This dual heterologous expression system offers a powerful approach to the molecular studies of protein-protein interactions.
