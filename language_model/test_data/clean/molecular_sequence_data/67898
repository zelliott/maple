Isolated cleft palate (CP) is common in humans and has complex genetic etiologies. Many genes have been found to contribute to CP, but the full spectrum of genes remains unknown. PCR-sequencing of the entire coding regions and the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRa) and the microRNA (miR), miR-140 identified seven novel single base-pair substitutions in the PDGFRa in 9/102 patients with CP (8.8%), compared with 5/500 ethnic-matched unaffected controls (1%) (the two-tailed P-value<0.0001). Of these seven, four were missense mutations in the coding regions and three in the 3'UTR. Frequencies of four changes (three in coding, one in 3'UTR) were statistically different from those of controls (P-value<0.05). The c.*34G>A was identified in 1/102 cases and 0/500 controls. This position is conserved in primates and located 10â€‰bp away from a predicted binding site for the miR-140. Luciferase assay revealed that, in the presence of miR-140, the c.*34G>A significantly repressed luciferase activity compared with that of the wild type, suggesting functional significance of this variant. This is the first study providing evidence supporting a role of PDGFRa in human CP.
