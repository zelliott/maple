We have previously shown that purified T4 DNA topoisomerase promotes illegitimate recombination between two lambda DNA molecules, or between lambda and plasmid DNA in vitro (Ikeda, H. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 922-926). Since the recombinant DNA contains a duplication or deletion, it is inferred that the cross-overs take place between nonhomologous sequences of lambda DNA. In this paper, we have examined the sequences of the recombination junctions produced by the recombination between two lambda DNA molecules mediated by T4 DNA topoisomerase. We have shown that there is either no homology or there are 1-5-base pair homologies between the parental DNAs in seven combinations of lambda recombination sites, indicating that homology is not essential for the recombination. Next, we have shown an association of the recombination sites with the topoisomerase cleavage sites, indicating that a capacity of the topoisomerase to make a transient double-stranded break in DNA plays a role in the illegitimate recombination. A consensus sequence for T4 topoisomerase cleavage sites, RNAY decreases NNNNRTNY, was deduced. The cleavage experiment showed that T4 topoisomerase-mediated cleavage takes place in a 4-base pair staggered fashion and produces 5'-protruding ends.
