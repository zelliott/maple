Adenoviruses (Ad) synthesize serine-center endoproteinases (AdEPs) responsible for maturation cleavages within the virus particle. Many questions regarding these enzymes remain unanswered because previous studies utilized crude cells or viral lysates as the enzyme source. Here, we report on the comparison of the amino acid (aa) sequences of several AdEPs and on the expression of the cDNA of the Ad2Ep in Escherichia coli. The AdEPs consist of about 200 aa and their size is around 23 kDa. Among the seven sequences known, 60% of aa were strictly conserved. The usual serine proteinase active site sequence, GDSGG, is absent. The recombinant Ad2EP, produced by an inducible vector as a protein-A fusion product is capable of autocatalytic cleavage, and of cleaving its natural viral substrates as well as foreign proteins. Therefore, other viral proteins or mammalian specific post-translational modifications are not required for enzyme activity.
