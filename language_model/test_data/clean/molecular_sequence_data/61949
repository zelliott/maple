Many aquatic microorganisms use gas vesicles to regulate their depth in the water column. The molecular basis for the novel physical properties of these floatation organelles remains mysterious due to the inapplicability of either solution or single crystal structural methods. In the present study, some folding constraints for the approximately 7-kDa GvpA building blocks of the vesicles are established via matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry studies of intact and proteolyzed vesicles from the cyanobacterium Anabaena flos-aquae and the archaea Halobacterium salinarum. The spectra of undigested vesicles show no evidence of posttranslational modification of the GvpA. The extent of carboxypeptidase digestion shows that the alanine rich C-terminal pentapeptide of GvpA is exposed to the surface in both organisms. The bonds that are cleaved by Trypsin and GluC are exclusively in the extended N-terminus of the Anabaena flos-aquae protein and in the extended C-terminus of the Halobacterium salinarum protein. All the potentially cleavable peptide bonds in the central, highly conserved portion of the protein appear to be shielded from protease attack in spite of the fact that some of the corresponding side chains are almost certainly exposed to the aqueous medium.
