Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay we have analysed the binding of rat liver nuclear proteins to the fragments from -466 to -292 and from -292 to -178 relative to the transcriptional start site of the rat tryptophan oxygenase gene. Studies of the competition with a synthetic consensus sequence for the NF 1 recognition site have shown that the liver nuclear proteins, responsible for the formation of specific complexes with these fragments belong to the family of the nuclear factor 1 (NF 1). We have also found that the trans-acting factors of the NF 1 family form several complexes with each of the two tested fragments of the tryptophan oxygenase gene.
