The complete amino acid sequence of an important toxin (toxin 14) from the venom of a Vietnamese scorpion (Buthus occitanus sp.) has been determined, which includes 35 amino acid residues and three disulfide bridges (molecular weight, 3843 Da). The comparison of the sequence with sequences of short scorpion toxins led us to conclude that toxin 14 belongs to a novel group of toxins affecting the excitability of myelinated nerves.
