The nucleotide sequence of mitochondrial ribosomal protein rps13 gene from wild perennial grass Elymus sibiricus is presented. It was determined by the method of PCR amplification with specific oligonucleotide primers and the direct sequencing of the amplification product. The sequence of E. sibiricus mitochondrial gene for S13 predicts a hydrophobic ribosomal protein of 116 amino acids that shows strong similarity to those of wheat (99.7% identity) and maize (98%). The deduced amino acid sequence of S13 protein from E. sibiricus and homologous plant's (Zea mays, Daucus carota, Nicotiana tabacum, Marchantia polymorpha) and nonplant's (Escherichia coli) proteins shows the presence of hydrophobic amino acids' motif -L-X10-L-X10-M-X10-L-X10-L-. Slightly modified it can be found in many other ribosomal proteins. This conserved motif is presumed to be particularly important for association of the ribosomal S13 protein with other proteins in the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome.
