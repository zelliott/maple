Characterization of the SRS murine retrovirus complex, derived from the TSZ system of murine leukemia developed in China, was carried out. The initial stock contained XC+, NB-tropic virus (and possibly other viruses), and induced several neoplastic diseases in neonatally inoculated NIH Swiss mice: erythroid leukemia, myeloid leukemia (acute myeloblastic leukemia), and lymphoblastic lymphoma (both B- and T-lymphoid). In addition, approximately 30% of inoculated animals developed central nervous system disease--hindlimb paralysis or semilateral paralysis. Rescue of virus from the spleen of an animal with combined erythroid/myeloid leukemia, followed by endpoint dilution gave two stocks: 19-6 (XC+, NB-tropic) and 19-7 (XC-, NB-tropic). Both stocks induced erythroid and myeloid leukemia, and 19-6 induced CNS symptoms as well. Southern blot analysis indicated that the predominant viruses from the 19-6 and the 19-7 cultures were related, but different in the env region. An infectious virus molecular clone of provirus from 19-6 cells was obtained. The resulting cloned virus [SRS 19-6 murine leukemia virus (MuLV)] induced four kinds of leukemia: erythroid, myeloid, B-lymphoma, and T-lymphoma; in many cases, more than one tumor type was identified in the same animal. Such a broad spectrum of leukemias induced by a cloned MuLV is unusual. Flaccid hindlimb paralysis induced by SRS 19-6 MuLV could be attributed to meningeal B-lymphoma. Immunofluorescent staining with a panel of env-specific monoclonal antibodies confirmed that the 19-6 and 19-7 viral stocks contained different viruses, which differed from previously characterized MuLVs. The viruses of the SRS complex may provide interesting reagents for investigations of MuLV-induced disease.
