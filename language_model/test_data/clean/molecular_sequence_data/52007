Seven genes and two anonymous markers were mapped to a single linkage group on rat chromosome 10 using progeny of an F2 intercross of Fischer (F344/N) and Lewis (LEW/N) inbred rats. Two genes, the neu oncogene or cellular homologue of the viral oncogene erbb2 (ERBB2) and growth hormone (GH) were mapped by Southern blot analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Five genes, embryonic skeletal myosin heavy chain (MYH3), androgen binding protein/sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), asialoglycoprotein receptor (hepatic lectin)-1 (ASGR1), ATP citrate lysase (CLATP), and pancreatic polypeptide (PPY), and two anonymous markers, F16F2 and F10F1, were mapped using PCR amplification techniques. The PCR-typable polymorphic markers for the five genes were also highly polymorphic in 10 other inbred rat strains (SHR/N, WKY/N, MNR/N, MR/N, LOU/MN, BN/SsN, BUF/N, WBB1/N, WBB2/N, and ACI/N). These markers should be useful in genetic analysis of traits described in inbred rat strains, as well as in genetic monitoring of such strains. The loci in this linkage group covered 50 cM of rat chromosome 10 with the following order: MYH3, SHBG/ASGR1 (no recombinants detected), F16F2, ERBB2, CLATP, PPY, GH, and F10F1. Comparative gene mapping analysis indicated that this region of rat chromosome 10 exhibits linkage conservation with regions of human chromosome 17 and mouse chromosome 11.
