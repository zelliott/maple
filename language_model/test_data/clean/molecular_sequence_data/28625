Gram-negative bacteria that are pathogenic for animals or plants utilise a specialised Type III secretion system to inject effector proteins into their eukaryotic target cells. The basis for selection of the proteins to be translocated via type III systems is still enigmatic. No clearly defined consensus amino acid sequence that could serve as a specific secretion signal has been identified, and the hypothesis that an mRNA secondary structure acts as the signal has several shortcomings. We have localised a secretion signal that is sufficient to ensure the secretion of the pilin HrpA, a substrate and an indispensable extracellular component of the type III secretion machinery of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, to the first 15 codons. Transcription of hrpA starts at a single site 42 bp upstream of the first codon. Gene swapping experiments revealed that altering the continuity of the 5' non-translated leader with the region including the secretion signal radically decreased accumulation of the hrpA transcript. These results indicate that an mRNA secondary structure, possibly formed in this region, is important for efficient expression of the gene. The proposed secondary structure is not, however, indispensable for the secretion of HrpA and it does not couple secretion and translation.
