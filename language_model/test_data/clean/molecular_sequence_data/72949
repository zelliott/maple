The complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pLA106 (2862 bp) from Lactobacillus acidophilus TK8912 was determined. Based on this sequence, the location of the genes for mobilization-plasmid recombination protein (mob), replication origin (ori), transcriptional repressor protein (repA) and replication initiation protein (repB) were predicted. Deletion analysis showed that the 1.4-kb PstI-EcoRV fragment carrying the ori, repA and repB genes is able to replicate in Lactobacillus and Escherichia coli cells. The plasmid pLA106 appears to have most features of the pLS1/pE194 plasmid family.
