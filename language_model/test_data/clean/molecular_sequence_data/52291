Several receptors for the extracellular matrix protein collagen have been described which belong to the superfamily of receptors collectively known as integrins. Although several integrins have been shown to interact with extracellular matrix molecules via a common recognition site, arginine-glycine-aspartic Acid (RGD), within the beta 1 integrin subfamily, only the fibronectin receptor (alpha 5 beta 1) has been convincingly shown to interact with RGD. In the present study, we tested whether a collagen receptor could interact with RGD. Adhesion of an osteosarcoma cell line, MG-63, to immobilized collagen I was inhibited by the cyclic RGD-containing peptide, C*GRGDSPC* (where C* indicates that Cys participates in disulfide), and not by the linear GRGDSP or the non-RGD-containing cyclic peptide, C*GKGESPC*. Similarly, using collagen-Sepharose affinity chromatography, a heterodimeric protein could be specifically eluted from the column by the cyclic RGD peptide. Immunoprecipitations of the eluted material with monoclonal antibodies showed reactivity with the collagen receptor alpha 2 beta 1 and not alpha 3 beta 1. Our data demonstrate that RGD peptides can interact with the collagen receptor, and the differences seen with the linear and cyclic peptide suggest that the cyclic C*GRGDSPC* has a higher avidity for the receptor than the more flexible linear GRGDSP. In this paper, we provide supportive evidence that one possible mode of collagen interaction with alpha 2 beta 1 is via the RGD recognition sequence.
