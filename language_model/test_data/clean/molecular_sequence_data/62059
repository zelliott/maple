Interferon (IFN) exerts its antiviral effects mainly through activation of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG), but relatively few of fish ISGs have been isolated and characterized so far. Here, we report two fish ISGs, termed CaIFI58 and CaIFI56, cloned from a subtractive cDNA library constructed with mRNAs obtained from crucian carp (Carassius auratus L.) blastulae embryonic (CAB) cells infected by UV-inactivated GCHV and mock-infected cells. Database search revealed that both ISGs had a high-level homology with all members of a well conserved gene family with multiple tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, including human IFI60, IFI58, IFI56, IFI54 and their homologues in some other mammalian species. The transcripts of CaIFI58 and CaIFI56 were undetectable in CAB cells but could be induced by active GCHV, UV-inactivated GCHV or CAB IFN. Analysis of expression difference between them and IFN signal factors, CaSTAT1 and CaIRF7, indicated that their transcriptions were mediated possibly through JAK-STAT signal pathway, which was further supported by the induction analysis in UV-inactivated GCHV infected, IFN-treated and untreated cells in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (CHX), a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis. In addition, a pufferfish (Fugu rubrides) DNA sequence representing putative FrIFI56 was also revealed when CaIFI58 and CaIFI56 were used to search the pufferfish genome database. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these fish ISGs form a unique clad independent of mammalian homologues, reflecting a distant evolutionary relationship from mammals. These studies identified the first teleost IFI56 and IFI58 orthologues.
