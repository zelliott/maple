We show that integration host factor (IHF) is required for the activation of transcription of the cobalamin biosynthetic (cob) and 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDL) utilization (pdu) operons in Salmonella typhimurium LT2. A lack of IHF affected transcription of the cob/pdu regulon in at least two ways. First, the level of the regulatory protein PocR was decreased in ihfB (formerly himD) mutants, as judged by Western blot analysis with polyclonal antiserum raised against PocR. Second, even when PocR was available, in the absence of IHF, PocR was unable to activate transcription of cob/pdu in response to 1,2-PDL. This result suggested an additional role for IHF in PocR-dependent transcription activation. Consistent with these findings, ihfB mutants of this bacterium were unable to use 1,2-PDL as a carbon or energy source.
