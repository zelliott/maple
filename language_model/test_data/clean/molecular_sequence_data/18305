An enhancer-like element of 1.0kb (JM103-M) from E. coli JM103 chromosome was isolated using an enhancer-probing vector. The JM103-M fragment was shown to stimulate the nearby CAT or beta-galactosidase gene expression in E. coli in both directions at a stimulation rate of 3-6. The same fragment was also demonstrated to have promoter function when a promoter-probing vector was tested. Results obtained from sequencing data showed that a sequence TGACTAA homologous to the AP-1 binding DNA motif of SV40 and two GC boxes were present.
