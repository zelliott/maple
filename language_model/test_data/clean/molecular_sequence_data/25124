There is differential regulation of liver mRNA levels of rat (r) and mouse (m) plasma kallikrein (PK), as observed on Northern blots. Affinity purification of mPK and rPK, microsequencing, and radioimmunoassay in either rat or mouse showed that the difference in mRNA levels does not appreciably affect the circulating PK concentration. Nuclear run-off assays demonstrated that the regulation of the mRNA level of PK is post-transcriptionally controlled. Complete cDNA sequence determination of mPK was achieved using a combination of polymerase chain reaction and lambda gt11 library screening procedures. Within the coding region, the overall sequence homology between mPK and rPK is about 91-92% in amino acid and nucleotide sequence. Although the 3' noncoding segment of mPK is shorter than that of rPK, we calculate a 53% homology with a 5% higher A/T content for mPK. The largest difference is found at the 5' end of the mRNAs: whereas rPK is predicted from its gene structure to have a 167-nucleotide leader sequence, mPK is expected to have more than 605 nucleotides, of which the last 291 are very similar to those found in the rPK gene. The regulation of the mRNA stability and/or turnover rate of PK may possibly be affected by its 5' end in a species-dependent manner.
