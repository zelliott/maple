We have prepared a model receptor containing a Lys cluster (320-340) in the collagen-like domain of the bovine macrophage scavenger receptor, and have shown that it has a similar binding specificity to the native scavenger receptor. The native scavenger receptor is reported to bind the quadruplex structure of nucleotides. In this study, we analyzed the model receptor binding of nucleotides with various structures, random, parallel or antiparallel quadruplex and aggregate forms. This was carried out by direct binding assays using labeled oligonucleotides or surface plasmon resonance, and by an inhibition assay using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the scavenger receptor. The results showed that the nucleotides forming the quadruplex structure did not exhibit any binding. Only the aggregate forms of the nucleotide could bind to the model receptor. They also inhibited the degradation of acetylated low density lipoprotein by CHO cells expressing the native scavenger receptor, whereas nucleotides that did not bind to the model receptor had no effect on cellular acetylated low density lipoprotein degradation. Our results suggest that the quadruplex structure is not essential but may be required for the formation of the nucleotide aggregates, which can interact with the scavenger receptor.
