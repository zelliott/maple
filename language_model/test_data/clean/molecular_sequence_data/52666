The orphan G protein-coupled receptor APJ has been shown to be a coreceptor for human and simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV and SIV) strains. We have determined that some HIV and SIV strains use APJ as a coreceptor to infect the brain-derived NP-2/CD4 cells. Because apelin is an endogenous ligand for the APJ receptor, we examined the inhibitory effects of apelin peptides on HIV infection, and found that the apelin peptides inhibit the entry of some HIV-1 and HIV-2 into the NP-2/CD4 cells expressing APJ. The inhibitory efficiency has been found to be in the order of apelin-36>apelin-17>apelin-13>apelin-12.
