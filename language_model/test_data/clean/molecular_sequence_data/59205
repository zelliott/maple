A cDNA coding for a rat urea transporter is described. The 1242 bp open reading frame codes for a 414 amino acids protein with 77.0% and 60.7% identity with the human UT11 and the rat UT2, respectively. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the protein induces a 10-fold rise in urea permeability, inhibited by mercurial reagents and phloretin. The rUT11 mRNA is massively expressed in the brain.
