Cycad leaf lectin (CRLL), a mannose-recognizing jacalin-related lectin (mJRL), was first cloned as a gymnosperm lectin and expressed. The cDNA sequence of CRLL (DDBJ, accession no. AB198328), coding 291 amino acid residues, has a tandem repeat of about 150 amino acids divided into N- and C-terminal domains as Japanese chestnut mJRL. Sequence alignment showed deletion and insertion of the sequence, and its putative carbohydrate-binding sites showed some differences from other JRLs. PCR analysis showed that this lectin was expressed in the cycad leaf but not in the root or seed. Recombinant CRLL (rCRLL) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography after refolding procedures. Properties of active rCRLL appeared to be almost the same as those of native CRLL.
