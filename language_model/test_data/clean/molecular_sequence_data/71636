A 5000-rad whole genome radiation hybrid panel is described for the domestic cat, derived from irradiated male feline fibroblasts fused to a recipient hamster cell line. A panel of 93 cell lines has an estimated retention frequency of 0.39 (range 0.13-0.71) based upon PCR typing of 54 feline markers. To test the panel's utility, we determined the order of 16 Type I (coding gene) loci, 14 Type II (microsatellite) loci, and 1 endogenous retroviral element on feline chromosomes B4 and D3. Assessment of marker order derived from the RH panel was compared to assignments of the same loci using interspecies backcross mapping data, human homologue positions, and human-cat chromosome painting homologies. Assessment of concordant and discordant marker order for these loci provides improved resolution into the evolution of subchromosomal genome organizations and the methods to track them in these species.
