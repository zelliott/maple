Inhibition of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (5-HT(3)R), a member of the Cys-loop superfamily of Ligand-Gated Ion Channels (LGICs), has been recognized to have important antiemetic effects. With respect to the many other drugs already in use, such as the first generation 5-HT(3)R antagonist granisetron, palonosetron, a second generation antagonist, clearly demonstrates superior inhibition potency towards the 5-HT(3)Rs. Five different receptor monomers, the 5-HT(3)R A-E, have been identified although the A and B subunits are the only known to build functional receptors, the homopentameric 5-HT(3A)R and the heteropentameric 5-HT(3B-A)R (with BBABA subunit arrangement). At present, however, no three-dimensional structure has been reported for any of the 5-HT(3)R subunits. To understand the binding properties of agonists and antagonists, models of the extracellular portion of the 5-HT(3)R A and B subunits are built and assembled into the receptor (homo- and hetero-) pentameric structure on the basis of the known three-dimensional structure of the nicotinic-acetylcholine receptor (nACh-R). The results of docking studies of the natural agonist serotonin and the antagonists palonosetron and granisetron into the modelled homomeric and heteromeric 5-HT(3)R binding interfaces, provide a possible rationalization both of the higher potency of palonosetron with respect to other antagonists, and of its previously reported allosteric binding and positive cooperativity properties.
