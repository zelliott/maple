The upstream activation site of the pyruvate decarboxylase gene, PDC1, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains an RPG box, and mediates the increase in expression of a PDC1-lacZ fusion gene during growth on glucose. Oligonucleotide replacement experiments indicate that the RPG box functions as an absolute activator of expression, but other elements (possibly CTTCC repeats) are required for carbon source regulation, and maximal expression. Gel retardation and oligonucleotide competition experiments suggest that the DNA binding factor TUF interacts with the RPG box in the upstream region of PDC1. Binding of TUF factor is not carbon source dependent in in vitro experiments, and is probably not responsible for glucose induction of PDC1 expression.
