A single Klebsiella pneumoniae strain isolated in a Bulgarian hospital was found to produce CTX-M-71, a new CTX-M variant characterized by one amino acid substitution from glycine to cysteine at position 238 in comparison to CTX-M-15. This exchange decreased the hydrolytic activity of the beta-lactamase for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime.
