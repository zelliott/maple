Two proteins, in previous work labeled by affinity markers derived from taurocholic acid, were purified and partially sequenced. Antibodies were raised against purified proteins, and cross-reactions were carefully checked. The influence of these antibodies upon taurocholic acid import into vesicles from rat liver plasma membranes was measured, and showed a distinct inhibition of transport in the case of the 54 kD protein.
