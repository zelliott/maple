Repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) is a process that efficiently detects DNA duplications prior to meiosis in Neurospora crassa and peppers them with G:C to A:T mutations. Cytosine methylation is typically associated with sequences affected by RIP, and methylated cytosines are not limited to CpG dinucleotides. We generated and characterized a collection of methylated and unmethylated amRIP alleles to investigate the connection(s) between DNA methylation and mutations by RIP. Alleles of am harboring 84 to 158 mutations in the 2.6-kb region that was duplicated were heavily methylated and triggered de novo methylation when reintroduced into vegetative N. crassa cells. Alleles containing 45 and 56 mutations were methylated in the strains originally isolated but did not become methylated when reintroduced into vegetative cells. This provides the first evidence for de novo methylation in the sexual cycle and for a maintenance methylation system in Neurospora cells. No methylation was detected in am alleles containing 8 and 21 mutations. All mutations in the eight primary alleles studied were either G to A or C to T, with respect to the coding strand of the am gene, suggesting that RIP results in only one type of mutation. We consider possibilities for how DNA methylation is triggered by some sequences altered by RIP.
