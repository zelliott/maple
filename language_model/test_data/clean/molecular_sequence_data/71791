A cDNA clone specific for cytochrome b5 was isolated from Helicoverpa armigera. This sequence corresponded to a mRNA of an estimated 544 nucleotides in length excluding the poly A tail. The mRNA contained an open reading frame of 381 nucleotides encoding a protein of 127 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 14,564 Daltons. The encoded protein sequence showed 51% protein sequence identity with cytochrome b5 from M. domestica and 36-37% identity with mammalian and avian cytochrome b5 sequences. Northern analysis of larval RNA using this cDNA as probe, revealed that cytochrome b5 mRNA expression is tissue specific with the mRNAs being expressed in abundance in the midguts of larvae, at a lower level in fatbody but is not detectable in larval integument. During normal development this mRNA was undetectable in eggs but was present at similar levels from first to fifth instar larvae. The mRNA was expressed at very low levels in pupae and adult moths. The cytochrome b5 mRNA was found to be inducible by treatment with the monoterpene, a-pinene, and to be over-expressed in some individuals of a pyrethroid resistant population of H. armigera. The induction and over-expression patterns were identical to the cytochrome P450, CYP6B7 mRNA. The present data suggests that cytochrome b5 may be involved in CYP6B7 mediated pyrethroid resistance in H. armigera.
