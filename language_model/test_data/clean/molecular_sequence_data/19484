The number of vertebrae in pigs varies and is associated with meat productivity. Wild boars, which are ancestors of domestic pigs, have 19 vertebrae. In comparison, European commercial breeds have 21-23 vertebrae, probably owing to selective breeding for enlargement of body size. We previously identified two quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the number of vertebrae on Sus scrofa chromosomes (SSC) 1 and 7. These QTL explained an increase of more than two vertebrae. Here, we performed a map-based study to define the QTL region on SSC1. By using three F2 experimental families, we performed interval mapping and recombination analyses and defined the QTL within a 1.9-cM interval. Then we analyzed the linkage disequilibrium of microsatellite markers in this interval and found that 10 adjacent markers in a 300-kb region were almost fixed in European commercial breeds. Genetic variation of the markers was observed in Asian local breeds or wild boars. This region encoded an orphan nuclear receptor, germ cell nuclear factor (NR6A1, formerly known as GCNF), which contained an amino acid substitution (Pro192Leu) coincident with the QTL. This substitution altered the binding activity of NR6A1 to its corepressors, nuclear receptor-associated protein 80 (RAP80) and nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCOR1). In addition, somites of mouse embryos demonstrated expression of NR6A1 protein. Together, these results suggest that NR6A1 is a strong candidate for one of the QTL that influence number of vertebrae in pigs.
