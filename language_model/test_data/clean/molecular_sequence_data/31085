Modified bases were introduced into pre-tRNAs during in vitro RNA synthesis or by chemical modification. These RNAs were used as substrates for the catalytic M1 RNA and the RNase P holoenzyme from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The synthetic approach permitted the insertion of 100% m7GTP into pre-tRNAs and this resulted in complete inhibition of the specific 5' processing reactions. Partially modified RNAs were obtained by chemical modifications of purines and uridines in the pre-tRNAs. This allowed detailed analyses of specific bases excluded in the products. With pre-tRNA(Ser) and initiator pre-tRNA(Met), strong effects were observed in the T arm and weaker effects in the anticodon stem. Only minor base exclusions were detected in the acceptor stem of pre-tRNA(Ser) and in the D arm of pre-tRNA(Met).
