A new design of binary hammerhead ribozymes displaying high catalytic activity and nucleolytic stability is described. These catalytic structures consist of two partially complementary oligoribonucleotides, capable of assembling into the hammerhead-like structure without tetraloop II on binding to the RNA target. A series of these binary ribozymes targeting the translation initiation region of multiple drug resistance gene mdr1 mRNA was synthesized and assessed in terms of catalytic activity under single and multiple reaction turnover conditions. Enhanced nuclease resistance of the binary ribozymes was achieved by incorporation of 2'-modified nucleotides at selected positions, along with addition of a 3'-3'-linked thymidine cap. The new binary ribozymes exhibit higher RNA cleavage activity than their full-length analogs because of faster dissociation of cleavage products. Furthermore, an excess of one of the ribozyme strands provides the possibility to unfold structured regions of the target RNA and facilitate productive complex formation.
