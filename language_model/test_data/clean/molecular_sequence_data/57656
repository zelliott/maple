A number of reversed-phase (RP) HPLC systems for the separation of gonadorelin (gonadoliberin, LHRH) and five therapeutically important analogues have been systematically examined. The selectivity of RP-HPLC has been compared with several micellar electrokinetic chromatographic (MEKC) systems and free solution capillary electrophoresis. RP-HPLC exhibits greater selectivity towards structural differences, but complete separation of the peptides in one isocratic analytical run is tedious due to the large differences in retention. Gradient elution gives satisfactory separation in an acceptable time span. Of the micellar systems examined (sodium dodecyl sulphate, cetrimide, 3-[(cholamidopropyl)dimethylamino]-1-propanesulphonate and Triton X-100) only MEKC with cetrimide micelles gave a complete separation showing selectivity similar, but not identical, to RP-HPLC, and providing a complete separation of all six compounds as rapidly as gradient RP-HPLC.
