Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene segments was used to examine the distributions of bacterial populations within a hot spring microbial mat (Octopus Spring, Yellowstone National Park). Populations at sites along the thermal gradient of the spring's effluent channel were surveyed at seasonal intervals. No shift in the thermal gradient was detected, and populations at spatially or temperature-defined sites exhibited only slight changes over the annual sampling period. A new cyanobacterial 16S rRNA sequence type was detected at temperatures from 63 to 75 degrees C. A new green nonsulfur bacterium-like sequence type was also detected at temperatures from 53 to 62 degrees C. Genetically unique though closely related cyanobacterial and green nonsulfur bacterium-like populations were successively distributed along the thermal gradient of the Octopus Spring effluent channel. At least two cyanobacterial populations were detected at each site; however, a limited ability to detect some cyanobacterial populations suggests that only dominant populations were observed.
