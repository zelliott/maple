Rhizobial bacteria almost exclusively nodulate members of the families Fabaceae, Mimosaceae and Caesalpiniaceae, but are found on a single non-legume taxon, Parasponia (Ulmaceae). Based on their host-range, their nitrogen-fixing ability and strain competition experiments, bacterial strains isolated from Parasponia were thought to constitute a separate lineage that would account for their exceptional host affinity. This hypothesis was investigated by focusing on four isolates that are representative of the morphological and cultural types of Parasponia-nodulating bradyrhizobia. Their evolutionary relationships with other rhizobia were analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequences and their nodulation properties were explored using the nodA gene as a proxy for host-range specificity. Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA and nodA gene sequences revealed that bacterial isolates from Parasponia species are embedded among other bradyrhizobia. They did not cluster together in topologies based on the 16S rRNA or nodA gene sequences, but were scattered among other bradyrhizobia belonging to either the Bradyrhizobium japonicum or the Bradyrhizobium elkanii lineages. These data suggest that the ability of some bradyrhizobia to nodulate species of the genus Parasponia does not represent a historical relationship that predates the relationship between rhizobia and legumes, but is probably a more recent host switch for some rhizobia.
