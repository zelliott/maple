RADARADARADARADA (RADA 16-I) is a synthetic amphiphilic peptide designed to self-assemble in a controlled way into fibrils and higher ordered structures depending on pH. In this work, we use various techniques to investigate the state of the peptide dispersed in water under dilute conditions at different pH and in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid. We have identified stable RADA 16-I fibrils at pH 2.0-4.5, which have a length of ∼200-400 nm and diameter of 10 nm. The fibrils have the characteristic antiparallel β-sheet structure of amyloid fibrils, as measured by circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. During incubation at pH 2.0-4.5, the fibrils elongate very slowly via an end-to-end fibril-fibril aggregation mechanism, without changing their diameter, and the kinetics of such aggregation depends on pH and anion type. At pH 2.0, we also observed a substantial amount of monomers in the system, which do not participate in the fibril elongation and degrade to fragments. The fibril-fibril elongation kinetics has been simulated using the Smoluchowski kinetic model, population balance equations, and the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental data. It is also found that the aggregation process is not limited by diffusion but rather is an activated process with energy barrier in the order of 20 kcal/mol.
