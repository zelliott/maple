Sin Nombre virus (SNV) causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), with a high rate of mortality in humans who are infected by the transmission of virus from the natural rodent host. In humans, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for SNV appear to play an important role in the pathogenicity of HPS. There is a correlation between the frequencies of SNV-specific CTLs and the severity of HPS disease. In order to create a mouse model to study the role of SNV-specific T cells in vivo, T cell responses to SNV nucleocapsid (N) protein in B6.PL Thy1(a)/Cy mice (H-2(b)) immunized with plasmid DNA or recombinant vaccinia virus expressing SNV N protein were examined. Four peptides, NC94-101, NC175-189, NC217-231 and NC331-345, were recognized by CD8(+) T cells in CTL and ELISPOT assays in SNV N-immunized mice. Interestingly, two of these epitopes are located in the central region of the SNV N protein, where several human CD8(+) T-cell epitopes have been defined in Puumala virus and SNV. CTL lines specific for these four epitopes were cross-reactive to corresponding Puumala virus peptides, but only one of them was cross-reactive to Hantaan virus peptides. These results will enable the analysis of the roles of CTL in immunopathology of HPS in experimental mouse models of HPS.
