A new HPLC method has been developed to assay tyrosine protein kinase activity. Using hydrophilic interaction chromatography, it is possible to resolve the four components of the incubation medium: substrate peptide, [32P]phosphorylated peptide, unreacted [gamma-32P]ATP, and 32P-labelled inorganic phosphate. ATP interacts so strongly with the stationary phase material that it can be removed selectively from the incubation medium with solid-phase extraction cartridges packed with the same type of material. The three remaining components of interest can then be resolved by reversed-phase or hydrophilic interaction HPLC. This procedure permits the evaluation of almost every type of peptide as a substrate of tyrosine protein kinase.
