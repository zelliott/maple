Transformer-2 (Tra2), an RNA-binding protein, is an important regulator in Drosophila sex determination. In vertebrates, however, the role of Tra2 homologues is not known. We identified two teleost homologues of Tra2, which we named Tra2a and Tra2b, in medaka (Oryzias latipes). Furthermore, we demonstrated that both Tra2 mRNAs were predominantly expressed in germ cells of both sexes before the onset of sex differentiation, suggesting that both Tra2 homologues might be involved in the sex differentiation in medaka.
