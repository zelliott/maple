The importance of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in basic physiological processes such as cardiac and neurological function has generated intense interest in these proteins as targets of pharmacological intervention. N-type calcium channels are a subset of VGCCs distinguished by their physiology, pharmacology and significance to the pathology of chronic pain. Despite decades of investigation, only a single drug targeting N-type channel function has entered the marketplace. This review will summarize our current understanding of the biology, physiology and pharmacology of N-type calcium channels and the implication of these features for therapeutic intervention. From this basis of understanding, recent efforts to discover and develop peptide based and small molecule modulators of N-type calcium channel function will be discussed.
