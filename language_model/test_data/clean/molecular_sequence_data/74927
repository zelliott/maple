Neisseria meningitidis class 5 proteins are major outer membrane proteins that share many properties with the proteins II (P.II) of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. We generated two bactericidal monoclonal antibodies, each of which bound specifically to one of the two identified class 5 proteins produced by N. meningitidis FAM18. The monoclonal antibodies also bound to class 5 proteins of a limited number of other meningococcal strains. Using the bactericidal activity of the monoclonal antibodies, we demonstrated that expression of both class 5 proteins was subject to reversible phase variation in vitro. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of a purified class 5 protein revealed striking similarity to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of gonococcal P.II proteins. Using a cloned class 5 gene, we identified three potential class 5 gene loci in N. meningitidis FAM18. These class 5 sequences also had homology with gonococcal P.II gene sequences and contained the CTCTT repeat sequence believed to be important in the regulation of gonococcal P.II expression.
