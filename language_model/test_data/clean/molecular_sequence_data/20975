IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) promotes apoptosis by both IGF-dependent and -independent mechanisms. We have previously reported that phosphorylation of IGFBP-3 (S156) by DNA-dependent protein kinase enhances its nuclear accumulation and is essential for its ability to interact with retinoid X receptor-alpha and induce apoptosis in cultured prostate cancer cells. Using specific chemical inhibitors and small interfering RNA, we demonstrate that preventing casein kinase 2 (CK2) activation enhanced the apoptotic potential of IGFBP-3. We mapped potential CK2 phosphosphorylation sites in IGFBP-3 to S167 and S175 and identified that wild-type IGFBP-3- and IGFBP-3-S175A-induced apoptosis to a comparable extent. In contrast, IGFBP-3-S167A was far more potently apoptosis inducing due to inability to undergo CK2 phosphorylation. Pretreatment of 22RV1 cells with IGFBP-3 small interfering RNA also limits the ability of high doses of CK2 inhibitor to induce apoptosis. These effects can be reversed by the addition of exogenous IGFBP-3 protein, suggesting reciprocal regulation of cell survival and apoptosis by IGFBP-3 and CK2. These studies reveal multisite phosphorylation of IGFBP-3 that both positively and negatively regulate its apoptotic potential. Understanding such intrinsic regulation of IGFBP-3 action may enhance the development of potential cancer therapies.
