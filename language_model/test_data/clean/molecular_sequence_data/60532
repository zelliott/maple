A novel GATA factor in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Gaf1, containing one zinc-finger motif was studied for conformational change that was induced by DNA-binding. Gaf1 was shown to bind to the upstream activation sequence of a gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae containing GATA element by gel mobility shift assay. Circular dichroism spectra of Gaf1 indicated an increase of alpha-helix content of Gaf1 occurred upon binding to the upstream activation sequence. These results suggest that the binding of Gaf1 to the GATA element is required for the conformational change that may precede transactivation of the target gene(s).
