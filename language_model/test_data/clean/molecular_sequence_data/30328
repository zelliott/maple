Lesion of the sciatic nerve caused a rapid increase in c-fos and c-jun mRNA that was followed about 2 hr later by an increase in nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA. To evaluate whether the initial increase in c-fos mRNA is causally related to the subsequent increase in NGF mRNA, we performed experiments with fibroblasts of transgenic mice carrying an exogenous c-fos gene under the control of a metallothionein promoter. In primary cultures of these fibroblasts, CdCl2 evoked a rapid increase in exogenous c-fos mRNA, followed immediately by an increase in endogenous c-jun mRNA and with a slight delay by an increase in NGF mRNA. In fibroblasts of C3H control mice, CdCl2 had no effect on the mRNA levels of the protooncogenes c-fos and c-jun or of NGF. Additional evidence for a causal relationship between c-fos induction and the subsequent increase in NGF mRNA was obtained in cotransfection experiments. Fibroblasts of C3H control mice were cotransfected with a metallothionein-promoter-driven c-fos expression vector and a NGF promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene construct. Induction of the exogenous c-fos by CdCl2 resulted in increased activity of the NGF promoter. DNase I footprint experiments demonstrated that a binding site for transcription factor AP-1 (Fos/Jun heterodimer) in the first intron of the NGF gene was protected following c-fos induction. That this protected AP-1 site indeed was functional in the regulation of NGF expression was verified by deletion experiments and by a point mutation in the corresponding AP-1 binding region in the NGF promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct.
