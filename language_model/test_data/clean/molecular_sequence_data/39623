A new Arg-Phe-NH(2) (RFamide) peptide has been discovered in the amphibian hypothalamus. The cell bodies and terminals containing this peptide were localized in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and median eminence, respectively. This peptide was further revealed to have a considerable growth hormone (GH)-releasing activity in vitro and in vivo and hence designated as frog GH-releasing peptide (fGRP). Molecular cloning of cDNA encoding the fGRP precursor polypeptide revealed that it encodes fGRP and its putative gene-related peptides (fGRP-RP-1, -RP-2, and -RP-3). Subsequently, we identified these putative fGRP-RPs as mature peptides and analyzed their hypophysiotropic activities. Only fGRP-RP-2 stimulated the release of GH and prolactin (PRL) in vitro and in vivo. Thus, in addition to fGRP, fGRP-RP-2 acts as a hypothalamic factor on the frog pituitary to stimulate the release of GH and PRL.
