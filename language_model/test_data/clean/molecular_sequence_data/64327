The heterocystous cyanobacteria are currently placed in subsections IV and V, which are distinguished by cellular division in one plane (false branching) and in more than one plane (true branching), respectively. Published phylogenies of 16S rRNA gene sequence data support the monophyly of the heterocystous cyanobacteria, with members of subsection V embedded within subsection IV. It has been postulated that members of subsection V arose from within subsection IV. Therefore, phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences of the nitrogen-fixation gene nifD from representatives of subsections IV and V was performed by using maximum-likelihood criteria. The heterocystous cyanobacteria are supported as being monophyletic, with the non-heterocystous cyanobacteria as their closest relative. However, neither subsection IV nor subsection V is monophyletic, with representatives of both subsections intermixed in two sister clades. Analysis of nifD does not support recognition of two distinct subsections.
