AtUBC2 of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a structural homolog of the RAD6 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with approximately 65% identical amino acids. Like structural homologs from other organisms, AtUBC2 lacks the carboxyl-terminal extension of mostly acidic amino acids which is present in Rad6p. AtUBC2 was expressed in S. cerevisiae rad6 mutants. It was found to partially complement the UV sensitivity and reduced growth rate of rad6 mutants at elevated temperatures. AtUBC2 however, has no apparent influence on the degradation of N-end rule substrates in the heterologous host.
