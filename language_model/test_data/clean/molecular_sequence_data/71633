Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, a major research model in developmental molecular biology, has been inbred through six generations of sibling matings. Though viability initially decreased, as described earlier, the inbred line now consists of healthy, fertile animals. These are intended to serve as a genomic resource in which the level of polymorphism is decreased with respect to wild S. purpuratus. To genotype the inbred animals eight simple sequence genomic repeats were isolated, in context, and PCR primers were generated against the flanking single-copy sequences. Distribution and polymorphism of these regions of the genome were studied in the genomes of 27 wild individuals and in a sample of the inbred animals at F2 and F3 generations. All eight regions were polymorphic, though to different extents, and their homozygosity was increased by inbreeding as expected. The eight markers suffice to identify unambiguously the cellular DNA of any wild or F3 S. purpuratus individual.
