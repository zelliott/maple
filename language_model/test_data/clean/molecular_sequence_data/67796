A novel gene named TaSC was cloned from salt-tolerant wheat. Northern blot showed that the expression of TaSC in salt-tolerant wheat was up-regulated after salt stress. Real-time quantitative PCR analyses showed that TaSC expression was induced by salt and ABA in wheat. Localization analysis showed that TaSC proteins were localized to the plasma membrane in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana. The overexpression of TaSC in Col-0 and atsc (SALK_072220) Arabidopsis strains resulted in increased salt tolerance of the transgenic plants. TaSC overexpression in Col-0 and atsc signiÔ¨Åcantly up-regulated the expression of AtFRY1, AtSAD1, and AtCDPK2. AtCDPK2 overexpression in atsc rescued the salt-sensitive phenotype of atsc. The TaSC gene may improve plant salt tolerance by acting via the CDPK pathway.
