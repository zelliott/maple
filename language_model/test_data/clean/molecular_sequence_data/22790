The lateral assembly of transmembrane (TM) helices gives rise to membrane proteins with complex folds, which play important roles in biochemical processes. Therefore, the assembly of surface-supported bilayers containing TM helices is the first step toward the development of functional biomembrane mimetics. Here we report novel directed assembly of surface-supported lipid bilayers with laterally mobile TM helices. The TM helices were incorporated into lipid monolayers at the air/water interface, and the monolayers were then transferred onto glass substrates using Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) deposition. Finally, bilayers were assembled using lipid vesicle fusion on top of the LB monolayers. The novelty is the incorporation of the peptides into the monolayer at the first step of bilayer assembly, which allows control over the peptide concentration and orientation. The transmembrane orientation of the peptides was confirmed using oriented circular dichroism (OCD), lateral mobility was assessed using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), and diffusion coefficients were determined using a novel boundary profile evolution (BPE) method. The described directed-assembly approach can be used to develop versatile bilayer platforms for studying membrane proteins interactions in native bilayer environments.
