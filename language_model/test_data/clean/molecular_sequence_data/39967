Using serum from guinea-pigs immunized with a DeltaAFMP1DeltaAFMP2 deletion mutant of Aspergillus fumigatus to screen a cDNA library of A. fumigatus, we cloned a novel immunogenic 57-kDa protein in A. fumigatus. We also cloned its 55-kDa homologue in Penicillium marneffei, which was possibly related to amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism, with homologues present only in the subphylum Pezizomycotina of Ascomycota. The recombinant 55-kDa protein of P. marneffei reacted strongly with guinea-pig serum immunized with P. marneffei and with the sera of patients with P. marneffei infection. A similar approach could be applied to immunogenic protein screening in other microorganisms for serological diagnosis, epidemiological studies and the study of vaccines.
