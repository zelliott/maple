Recently it was demonstrated that Shigella dysenteriae type 1, a cause of severe dysentery epidemics, gained its O-specific polysaccharide (O-SP) from Escherichia coli O148. The O-SPs of these bacteria differ only by a galactose residue in the repeat unit of S. dysenteriae type 1 in place of a glucose residue in E. coli O148. Herein, we analyzed the core structure and its linkage to the O-SP in E. coli O148 LPS. Both were found to be identical to those of S. dysenteriae type 1 structures, further supporting the relatedness of these two bacteria. The following structure of the core with one repeat unit of the O-SP has been assigned (all have d-configuration except l-Rha):
