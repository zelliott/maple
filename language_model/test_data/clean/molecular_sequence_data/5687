The mouse M-lysozyme downstream enhancer has been previously characterized on several levels of gene regulation. The enhancer was co-localized with a DNase I hypersensitive site in the chromatin of mature macrophages, the in vivo interaction of transcription factor GABP with the enhancer core (MLDE) demonstrated binding being restricted to mature macrophage cells, and analysis of the MLDE methylation state revealed a correlation between demethylation of CpG dinucleotides and the in vivo GABP binding. Here, we analyzed in detail the full-length enhancer in addition to the core element. We identified a total of nine binding sites for nuclear factors. Most of these factors are found ubiquitously in all cell types tested. These factors include several unknown proteins as well as the transcription factor NF-Y. In addition, three binding sites for a new single-stranded DNA binding protein were found. The presence of this factor in mature macrophages correlates with the in vivo DNA melting of one of the binding sites and with the enhancer strength.
