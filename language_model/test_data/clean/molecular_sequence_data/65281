The first observation of chromosomally encoded small antisense RNA in Corynebacterium glutamicum is reported. Transcription oriented in the reverse direction to the transcription of the genes cg1934 and cg1935 was demonstrated within the chromosomal cg1934-cg1935 intergenic region. The transcription was found to be increased after heat shock. The transcriptional start point of this RNA designated ArnA was localized 21 bp upstream of the cg1935 translational start point by primer extension analysis, when the total RNA was isolated from cells grown at 30 degrees C. After heat shock, the transcriptional start point of an additional species of ArnA RNA was detected 19 bp upstream of the cg1935 translational start point. The stress-response sigma factor SigH was found to be involved in the synthesis of ArnA RNAs. The 3' end of the ArnA RNAs was identified using the 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique. The length of the two ArnA RNA species was thus determined to be 129 and 131 nt, respectively. The ArnA RNAs were found to overlap the 5'-untranslated region of the transcript of the cg1935 gene coding for a transcriptional regulator of the GntR family. These results suggest that the noncoding ArnA RNAs have a regulatory function.
