Genetic studies in chickens and receptor interference experiments have indicated that avian leukosis virus (ALV)-E may utilize a cellular receptor related to the receptor for ALV-B and ALV-D. Recently, we cloned CAR1, a tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-related protein, that serves as a cellular receptor for ALV-B and ALV-D. To determine whether the cellular receptor for ALV-E is a CAR1-like protein, a cDNA library was made from turkey embryo fibroblasts (TEFs), which are susceptible to ALV-E infection, but not to infection by ALV-B and ALV-D. The cDNA library was screened with a radioactively labeled CAR1 cDNA probe, and clones that hybridized with the probe were isolated. A 2.3-kb cDNA clone was identified that conferred susceptibility to ALV-E infection, but not to ALV-B infection, when expressed in transfected human 293 cells. The functional cDNA clone is predicted to encode a 368 amino acid protein with significant amino acid similarity to CAR1. Like CAR1, the TEF protein is predicted to have two extracellular TNFR-like cysteine-rich domains and a putative death domain similar to those of TNFR I and Fas. Flow cytometric analysis and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated specific binding between the TEF CAR1-related protein and an immunoadhesin composed of the surface (SU) envelope protein of subgroup E (RAV-0) virus fused to the constant region of a rabbit immunoglobulin. These two activities of the TEF CAR1-related protein, specific binding to ALV-E SU and permitting entry only of ALV-E, have unambiguously identified this protein as a cellular receptor specific for subgroup E ALV.
