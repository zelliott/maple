We cloned the glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) gene (CvGPD1) from salt-tolerant yeast Candida versatilis. When CvGPD1 was expressed in glycerol synthesis-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, the salt tolerance of the recombinant strain was enhanced, and NADP(+)-dependent GPDH (EC 1.1.1.94), Cvgpd1p synthesis and recovery of glycerol synthesis were confirmed. The transcription of CvGPD1 in C. versatilis cells was stimulated by high concentrations of NaCl. The relationship between expression of CvGPD1 and growth of C. versatilis cells in the mash of Japanese seasonings (miso- and shoyu-moromi) is also discussed.
