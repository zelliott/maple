Cytochrome P450 proteins, widely distributed multifunctional enzymes, are mainly involved in biosynthetic and degradative pathways of endogenous compounds and the detoxification of xenobiotics in insects. Moreover, these enzymes exhibit peroxidase-like activity, therefore they may be involved in protecting organisms against the toxicity of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the present study, we cloned a CYP4G11 gene--AccCYP4G11--from the Chinese honey-bee (Apis cerana cerana). The open reading frame of the cDNA was 1656 bp long and encoded a 551 amino acids polypeptide, which shared high sequence identity with homologous cytochrome P450 proteins. In the genomic DNA sequence, a 5'-flanking region consisting of 1168 bp was obtained, and some putative transcription factor binding sites were predicted. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) revealed that the level of AccCYP4G11 was higher in the epidermis than in other tissues, and AccCYP4G11 was expressed in all stages with the highest level in two-week-old adult worker honey-bees. Moreover, the expression patterns under oxidative stress indicated that AccCYP4G11 transcription was significantly influenced by external factors, such as temperature challenges, ultraviolet (UV) light, and insecticide treatment. AccCYP4G11 was regulated differentially in response to oxidative stress and may be involved in protecting honey-bees from oxidative injury.
