Phospholipase activity is important in bacterial pathogenicity and could contribute to the pathogenic role of Helicobacter pylori by degradation of the gastric mucus, and in maintaining long-term colonisation. Our aim was to determine the degree of variation in the phospholipase A gene (pldA) of H. pylori from different geographic locations, and to investigate links between pldA genotype and clinical disease severity, as well as with variation in cagA status and vacA genotypes. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with MboI and HaeIII was used to study 124 isolates from 10 countries that included the two genome-sequenced strains (26695 and J99), as well as Tx30a and NCTC 11637 (type strain). The 925-bp pldA fragment was amplified with a frequency of 90%. The presence of pldA was confirmed in the other strains using an alternative forward primer. Isolates were distinguished by PCR-RFLP analysis with 10 MboI and four HaeIII restriction patterns that combined to give 25 distinct pldA RFLP types. The pldA M2H2 strain genotype was most common (20%) in the UK but similar strains came from several other countries. Microdiversity was evident in pldA sequences of strains representing different RFLP types, and five M2H2 strains each had a distinct pldA sequence type. Intragenic variation was independent of gastric disease severity as well as strain cagA status and vacA genotype, with the exception of eight geographically diverse strains all with the pldA M4H3/cagA+/vacA s1m1 genotype predominantly from peptic ulcer patients. The study indicated a spectrum of genotypic variants and was supportive of a pldA function in H. pylori colonisation and persistence rather than in chronicity of infection.
