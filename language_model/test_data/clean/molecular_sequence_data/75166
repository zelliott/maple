The DNA sequences of the spo0H genes from Bacillus licheniformis and B. subtilis are described, and the predicted open reading frames code for proteins of 26,097 and 25,447 daltons, respectively. The two spo0H gene products are 91% identical to one another and about 25% identical to most of the procaryotic sigma factors. The predicted proteins have a conserved 14-amino-acid sequence at their amino terminal end, typical of sigma factors. Antibodies raised against the spo0H gene product of B. licheniformis specifically react with RNA polymerase sigma factor protein, sigma 30, purified from B. subtilis. We conclude that the spo0H genes of B. licheniformis and B. subtilis code for sigma 30, now known as sigma H.
