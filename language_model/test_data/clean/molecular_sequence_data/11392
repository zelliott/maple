Defined segments of the gag polyprotein and transmembrane envelope glycoprotein from Maedi-visna virus were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and evaluated singly and in combination for use in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Two hundred sixty field serum specimens from 15 sheep flocks were tested in parallel with recombinant and whole-virus antigens, and the relative sensitivities and specificities of the recombinant antigens were calculated. When the recombinant gag and transmembrane proteins were used in combination, a sensitivity of 97.4% and a specificity of 99.4% relative to whole-virus antigen were observed, indicating the utility of these proteins in diagnostic testing.
