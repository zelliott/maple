A new triterpenoid saponin, patrinia saponin H3 (3), was isolated from the aerial parts of Patrinia scabiosaefolia Fisch. and determined to be 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->3)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1-->2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl hederagenin 28-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1-->4)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester on the basis of NMR and FAB MS experiments and acid hydrolysis.
