The facilitated diffusion of D-glucose across the plasma membrane is carried out by a set of stereospecific transport proteins known as the glucose transporters. These integral membrane proteins are members of a gene family where tissue-specific expression of one or more members will determine in part the net rate of glucose entry into the cell. The regulation of glucose transporter gene expression is a critical feature of cellular homeostasis, as defects in specific transporter expression can lead to profound alterations in cellular physiology. In this review, we provide a brief descriptive background on the family of glucose transporters and examine in depth the regulation of the two transporters expressed in adipose tissue, GLUTI, a basal growth-related transporter and GLUT4, the insulin-responsive glucose transporter.
