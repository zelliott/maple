A clone isolated from a purple podded pea (Pisum sativum L.) cDNA library was shown to contain the complete coding sequence of a polypeptide with considerable homology to various members of the ras superfamily. The ras superfamily are a group of monomeric GTP-binding proteins of 21-25 kDa found in eukaryotic cells. Conserved sequences in the isolated clone include the GTP-binding site, GDP/GTP hydrolysis domain and C-terminal Cys residues involved in membrane attachment. Comparisons of the predicted amino acid sequence with those of other ras proteins show significantly higher homologies (ca. 70%) to two mammalian gene products, those of the BRL-ras oncogene, and the canine rab7 gene, than to any of the plant ras gene products so far identified (< 40% homology). The high percentage of amino acid identity suggests that this cDNA may be the product of a gene, designated Psa-rab, which is the plant counterpart of rab7. Rab/ypt proteins are a subfamily of the ras superfamily thought to be involved in intracellular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and in vesicular transport. Northern blot hybridisation analysis of total RNA from green and purple podded pea revealed a mRNA species of approximately the same size as the isolated cDNAs.
