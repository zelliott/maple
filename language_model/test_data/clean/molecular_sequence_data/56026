Haemonectin, a protein present in rabbit bone marrow extracellular matrix extracts, has been reported to bind granulocytes in a developmentally regulated manner. We have purified haemonectin from such extracts and determined the partial amino-acid sequence. The sequence obtained shows 60-70% similarity with the sequence of the plasma glycoprotein fetuin from other mammal species. This difference is consistent with the difference between fetuins from different species. We conclude that the rabbit haemonectin molecule is related to fetuin. The similarity between haemonectin and fetuin is reinforced by analysis with Western blots of one- and two-dimensional gels. These show that haemonectin, like fetuin, is present in serum and that migration of haemonectin from serum and extracellular matrix extracts, on two-dimensional gels, co-incides with that of human fetuin (alpha 2HS-glycoprotein) from serum, extracellular matrix extracts and in purified form. Also, antihaemonectin antibodies cross react with human fetuin. These data imply that the rabbit haemonectin molecule is closely related to fetuin, but do not rule out the possibility that these molecules are functionally distinct.
