Goose VLDV-neurophysin (mesotocin-associated neurophysin) has been purified from posterior pituitary glands through molecular sieving on Sephadex G-75 and high-pressure reverse-phase liquid chromatography on Nucleosil C-18 columns. Despite apparent molecular mass of unreduced VLDV-neurophysin measured by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with sodium dodecylsulfate appeared near 17 kDa, this value fell to 11 kDa after reduction with mercaptoethanol, suggesting the existence of a homodimer. Complete amino acid sequence (93 residues) of goose VLDV-neurophysin has been determined. N- and C-terminal sequences of the protein have been established by Edman degradation (microsequencing) and use of carboxypeptidase Y, respectively. Peptides derived from oxidized or carboxamidomethylated neurophysin by trypsin or staphylococcal proteinase hydrolyses have been isolated by high-pressure liquid chromatography and microsequenced, allowing determination of the complete sequence. Comparison within the vertebrate VLDV-neurophysin lineage, namely goose VLDV-neurophysin to mammalian VLDV-neurophysins and to deduced toad VLDV-neurophysin, reveals a residue insertion between positions 66 and 67 in the nonmammalian VLDV-neurophysins. When goose MSEL-neurophysin (vasotocin-associated neurophysin) and goose VLDV-neurophysin are compared to their bovine counterparts, identical substitutions are found in positions 17 (Asn in both goose neurophysins instead of Gly in both ox neurophysins), 18 (Arg instead of Lys), 35 (Tyr instead of Phe), and 41 (Thr instead of Ala). Identity of the sequences 10-74 in both ox neurophysins has been explained by partial gene conversion between oxytocin and vasopressin genes, and identical substitutions in both goose neurophysins might reveal a similar gene conversion between mesotocin and vasopressin genes in birds.
