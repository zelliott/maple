The first trkA gene homolog in the phylogenetic domain Archaea is reported. The gene is located near the dnaK-dnaJ gene cluster in the genome of Methanosarcina mazei S-6, and encodes a protein homologous to the only other TrkA known, i.e., that of the bacterium Escherichia coli, involved in K+ transport. This finding supports an essential, evolutionarily early, and conserved role for this gene in cell survival and adaptation.
