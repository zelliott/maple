The upstream region of the pcbAB gene from Penicillium chrysogenum was screened for protein-binding sites using an electromobility shift assay. A specific protein/DNA interaction was detected within a fragment covering the region -387 to -242 relative to the pcbAB translational start codon. The appearance of this protein and pcbAB mRNA in culture extracts occurred at the same time point in fermentations, suggesting that the protein might be a transcription activator. The putative upstream activating sequence was located more precisely using cross-competition assays. These indicated the involvement of the 7-bp motif TGCCAAG in the binding of the protein.
