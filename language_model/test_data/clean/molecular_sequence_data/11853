Podocytes are responsible in part for maintaining the size and charge filtration characteristics of the glomerular filter. The major sialoprotein of the podocyte foot process glycocalyx is a 140-kDa sialoprotein named podocalyxin. Monoclonal antibodies raised against isolated rabbit glomeruli that recognized a podocalyxin-like protein base upon size, Alcian blue staining, wheat germ agglutinin binding, and distribution in renal cortex were used to expression clone cDNAs from a rabbit glomerular library. On Northern blot the cDNAs hybridized to a 5.5-kilobase pair transcript predominantly present in glomerulus. The overlapping cDNAs spanned 5,313 base pairs that contained an open reading frame of 1,653 base pairs and were not homologous with a previously described sequence. The deduced 551-amino acid protein contained a putative 21-residue N-terminal signal peptide and a 26-amino acid transmembrane region. The mature protein has a calculated molecular mass of 55 kDa, an extracellular domain that contains putative sites for N- and O-linked glycosylation, and a potential glycosaminoglycan attachment sites. The intracellular domain contains potential sites for phosphorylation. Processing of the full-length coding region in COS-7 cells resulted in a 140-kDa band, suggesting that the 55-kDa core protein undergoes extensive post-translational modification. The relationship between the cloned molecule and the monoclonal antibodies used for cloning was confirmed by making a fusion protein that inhibited binding of the monoclonal antibodies to renal cortical tissue sections and then raising polyclonal antibodies against the PCLP1 fusion protein that also recognized glomerular podocytes and endothelial cells in tissue sections in a similar distribution to the monoclonal antibodies. We conclude that we have cloned and sequenced a novel transmembrane core glycoprotein from rabbit glomerulus, which has many of the characteristics of podocalyxin. We have named this protein podocalyxin-like protein 1.
