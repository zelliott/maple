In many instances, multidrug resistance (MDR) is mediated by increasing the expression at the cell surface of the MDR1 gene product, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a 170-kD energy-dependent efflux pump. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential benefit of combination therapy with magnetic Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticle [MNP (Fe(3)O(4))] and MDR1 shRNA expression vector in K562/A02 cells. For stable reversal of "classical" MDR by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) aiming directly at the target sequence (3491-3509, 1539-1557, and 3103-3121 nucleotide) of MDR1 mRNA. PGC silencer-U6-neo-GFP-shRNA/MDR1 called PGY1-1, PGY1-2, and PGY1-3 were constructed and transfected into K562/A02 cells by lipofectamine 2000. After transfected and incubated with or without MNP (Fe(3)O(4)) for 48 hours, the transcription of MDR1 mRNA and the expression of P-gp were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and Western-blot assay respectively. Meanwhile intracellular concentration of DNR in K562/A02 cells was detected by flow cytometry (FCM). PGC silencer-U6-neo-GFP-shRNA/MDR1 was successfully constructed, which was confirmed by sequencing and PGY1-2 had the greatest MDR1 gene inhibitory ratio. Analysis of the reversal ratio of MDR, the concentration of daunorubicin (DNR) and the transcription of MDR1 gene and expression of P-gp in K562/A02 showed that combination of DNR with either MNP (Fe(3)O(4)) or PGY1-2 exerted a potent cytotoxic effect on K562/A02 cells, while combination of MNP (Fe(3)O(4)) and PGY1-2 could synergistically reverse multidrug resistance. Thus our in vitro data strongly suggested that a combination of MNP (Fe(3)O(4)) and shRNA expression vector might be a more sufficient and less toxic anti-MDR method on leukemia.
