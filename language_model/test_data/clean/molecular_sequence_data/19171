A novel avian polyomavirus was detected in peri-ocular skin lesions collected from a grey butcherbird (Cracticus torquatus), using a combination of multiply primed rolling circle amplification, nested PCR and long range PCR. The sequence of Butcherbird polyomavirus was determined by combining next generation sequencing and primer walking techniques. The circular double-stranded DNA genome of Butcherbird polyomavirus consisted of 5084 bp, and encoded six open reading frames (ORF-X, VP2, VP3, VP1, small T-antigen and large T-antigen). Phylogenetic analysis placed it amongst other members of the genus Avipolyomavirus, most closely related to Crow polyomavirus. Next generation sequencing enabled the detection of DNA fragments similar to, but distinct from, Canarypox virus within the same lesion from which Butcherbird polyomavirus was amplified, thus confirming an avipolyomavirus-avipoxvirus co-infection in the peri-ocular skin lesions of this grey butcherbird.
