A glucose transporter cDNA (GLUT) clone was isolated from mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes and sequenced. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were, respectively, 95 and 99% homologous to those of the rat brain transporter. The mouse cDNA and a polyclonal antibody recognizing the corresponding in vitro translation product were used to compare changes in transporter mRNA and protein levels during differentiation, glucose starvation, and chronic insulin exposure of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The respective cellular content of transporter mRNA and protein were increased 6.6- and 7.8-fold during differentiation, and 3.8- and 2.5-fold from chronic insulin exposure of differentiated adipocytes. Glucose starvation increased transporter mRNA and protein levels 2.2- and 3.5-fold in undifferentiated preadipocytes and 1.8- and 3.1-fold in differentiated adipocytes. Starvation of undifferentiated cells completely converted the native transporter to an incompletely glycosylated form, while increasing basal transport rates 4.5-fold. Either full glycosylation is not required to produce a functionally active transporter, or starvation causes a unique predifferentiation induction of the normally absent "responsive" transporter. The changes in transporter protein expression elicited by differentiation were attributed primarily to increased rates of transporter synthesis, while the disproportionate changes in mRNA and protein expression from chronic insulin treatment and starvation suggested these conditions increase synthesis and decrease turnover rates in regulating transporter protein expression. Although chronic insulin exposure and glucose starvation each raised the expression of transporter protein greater than 3-fold and basal transport rates 2.5- to 4.5-fold, no significant increase in the insulin responsiveness of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or differentiated adipocytes was observed. Thus, the changes in the transporter mRNA and protein expression observed in this study were most consistent with their being associated with the regulated expression of a basal or low level insulin-responsive transporter.
