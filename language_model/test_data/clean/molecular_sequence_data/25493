Eukaryotic nuclear RNA binding proteins share a common sequence motif thought to be implicated in RNA binding. One of the two domains present in A1 hnRNP protein, has been modelled by homology in order to make a prediction of the main features of the RNA binding site. Acylphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.7) was selected as template for the modeling experiment. The predicted RNA binding site is a beta-sheet containing the two RNP consensus sequences as well as lysines and arginines conserved among the family.
