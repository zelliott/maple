Synthetic peptides containing amino acid sequence 218-238 of the core protein p24 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and progressively shorter sequences at its C-terminus, were tested for their effect on antigen dependent in vitro responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from normal human donors. A peptide as short as 7 amino acids, corresponding to a highly conserved sequence, was able to inhibit in a dose-dependent manner the induction of a specific primary antibody response to the sheep red cell (SRC) antigen, as well as the proliferative response to recall microbial antigens. The results of this study constitute additional evidence of the immunoinhibitory effects of HIV components and may help to unravel some of the pathogenic mechanisms of AIDS. Moreover, they are of potential relevance for the development of immunoprophylactic and therapeutic strategies.
