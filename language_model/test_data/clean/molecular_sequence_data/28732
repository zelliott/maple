When the cultured cells of Glycine max (soybean) were treated with 5 mM geraniol as a chemical stress, an mRNA level was elevated in a rapid but transient increase. The mRNA was cloned and sequenced, and found to correspond to the mRNA encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST). The GST mRNA level and GST activity were elevated to maxima at 4-6 h and 8 h, respectively, after treatment of the cultures with geraniol. These indicate that GST is one of the geraniol-responsive factors in soybean cells.
