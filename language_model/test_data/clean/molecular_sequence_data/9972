Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells require two genes, CSG1/SUR1 and CSG2, for growth in 50 mM Ca2+, but not 50 mM Sr2+. CSG2 was previously shown to be required for the mannosylation of inositolphosphorylceramide (IPC) to form mannosylinositolphosphorylceramide (MIPC). Here we demonstrate that SUR1/CSG1 is both genetically and biochemically related to CSG2. Like CSG2, SUR1/CSG1 is required for IPC mannosylation. A 93-amino acid stretch of Csg1p shows 29% identity with the alpha-1, 6-mannosyltransferase encoded by OCH1. The SUR1/CSG1 gene is a dose-dependent suppressor of the Ca(2+)-sensitive phenotype of the csg2 mutant, but overexpression of CSG2 does not suppress the Ca2+ sensitivity of the csg1 mutant. The csg1 and csg2 mutants display normal growth in YPD, indicating that mannosylation of sphingolipids is not essential. Increased osmolarity of the growth medium increases the Ca2+ tolerance of csg1 and csg2 mutant cells, suggesting that altered cell wall synthesis causes Ca(2+)-induced death. Hydroxylation of IPC-C to form IPC-D requires CCC2, a gene encoding an intracellular Cu2+ transporter. Increased expression of CCC2 or increased Cu2+ concentration in the growth medium enhances the Ca2+ tolerance of csg1 mutants, suggesting that accumulation of IPC-C renders csg1 cells Ca2+ sensitive.
