Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5), the major bone IGFBP, modifies the biological activity of IGFs within the osteoblastic pericellular environment. Because glycosaminoglycans modulate IGFBP-5 binding to osteoblast organic extracellular matrix (ECM), we assessed whether the heparin binding domain of IGFBP-5, IGFBP-5-(102-218), modifies the interaction of IGFBP-5 with the inorganic bone ECM hydroxyapatite (HA). Synthetic IGFBP-5-(201-218) peptide increased the binding of IGFBP-5 to HA as well as the binding of IGF-I to HA-bound IGFBP-5. This action was specific for the heparin-binding domain, because IGFBP-5-(130-138), IGFBP-5-(138-152), and IGFBP-5-(1-169) were without effect. IGFBP-5-(201-218) was found to bind directly to IGFBP-5 and cause a threefold enhancement of the IGF-I binding affinity for IGFBP-5, whether IGFBP-5 was bound to HA or was in a matrix-free fluid phase. Heparin inhibited the binding of IGFBP-5 to HA and blocked the interaction of IGFBP-5 with IGFBP-5-(201-218) in the fluid phase, suggesting that the primary heparin-binding domain of IGFBP-5 specifically enhances the binding of IGFBP-5 to HA and increases IGF-I binding to IGFBP-5.
