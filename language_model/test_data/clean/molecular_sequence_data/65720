The phylogenetic diversity and species richness of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) were examined with aquarium biofiltration systems. Species richness, deduced from rarefaction analysis, and diversity indices indicated that the phylogenetic diversity and species richness of AOA are greater than those of AOB; the diversity of AOA and of AOB is minimized in cold-water aquaria. This finding implies that temperature is a key factor influencing the population structure and diversity of AOA and AOB in aquarium biofiltration systems.
