Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) causes a highly lethal, economically important disease of salmon and trout. The virus is enzootic throughout western North America, and has been spread to Asia and Europe. The nucleotide sequences of the glycoprotein (G) and non-virion (NV) genes of 12 diverse IHNV isolates were determined in order to examine the molecular epizootiology of IHN, the primary structure and conservation of NV, and the evolution of the virus. The G and NV genes and their encoded proteins were highly conserved, with a maximum pairwise nucleotide divergence of 3.6 and 4.4%, and amino acid divergence of 3.7 and 6.2%, respectively. Conservation of NV protein sequence (111 amino acids in length) confirms that the protein is functional and plays an important role in virus replication. The phylogenetic relationship of viruses was found to correlate with the geographic origin of virus isolates rather than with host species or time of isolation. These data are consistent with stable maintenance of virus in enzootic foci. Two main IHNV genetic lineages were identified; one in the Columbia River Basin (Oregon, Washington and Idaho), the other in the Sacramento River Basin (California). The first major IHNV outbreak in chinook salmon in 1973 in the Columbia River was genetically linked to importation of virus-infected fish eggs from the Sacramento River where outbreaks in chinook salmon are common. However, the introduced virus apparently did not persist, subsequent virus outbreaks in Columbia River chinook salmon being associated with Columbia River genetic lineages. In general, virus monoclonal antibody reactivity profiles and phylogenetic relationships correlated well.
