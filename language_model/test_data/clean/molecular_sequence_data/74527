Oxalate decarboxylases (OXDCs) (E.C. 4.1.1.2) are enzymes catalyzing the conversion of oxalate to formate and CO2 The OXDCs found in fungi and bacteria belong to functionally diverse protein superfamily known as the cupins. Fungi-originated OXDCs are secretory enzymes. However, most bacterial OXDCs are localized in the cytosol, and may be involved in energy metabolism. In Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58, a locus for a putative oxalate decarboxylase is present. In the study reported here, an enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and showed oxalate carboxylase activity. Computational analysis revealed the A. tumefaciens C58 OXDC contains a signal peptide mediating translocation of the enzyme into the periplasm that was supported by expression of signal-peptideless and full-length versions of the enzyme in A. tumefaciens C58. Further site-directed mutagenesis experiment demonstrated that the A. tumefaciens C58 OXDC is most likely translocated by a twin-arginine translocation (TAT) system.
