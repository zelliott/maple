An analogue of "HIV-1 protease" was designed in which the ability to donate important water-mediated hydrogen bonds to substrate was precisely and directly deleted. Chemical ligation of unprotected peptide segments was used to synthesize this "backbone-engineered" enzyme. The functionally relevant amide -CONH- linkage between residues Gly49-Ile50 in each flap of the enzyme was replaced by an isosteric thioester -COS- bond. The backbone-engineered enzyme had normal substrate specificity and affinity (Km). However, the catalytic activity (kcat) was reduced approximately 3000-fold compared to the native amide bond-containing enzyme. Inhibition by the reduced peptide bond substrate analogue MVT-101 was unaffected compared with native enzyme. By contrast, the normally tight-binding hydroxyethylamine inhibitor JG-365 bound to the backbone-engineered enzyme with an approximately 2500-fold reduction in affinity. The reduced catalytic activity of the -Gly49-psi(COS)-Ile50-backbone-engineered enzyme analogue provides direct experimental evidence to support the suggestion that backbone hydrogen bonds from the enzyme flaps to the substrate are important for the catalytic function of the HIV-1 protease.
