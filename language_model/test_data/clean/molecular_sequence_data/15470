The taxonomic position of a novel bacterial strain, YC6269(T), isolated from the rhizosphere of rice (Oryza sativa L.) managed under no-tillage practice in Jinju, South Korea, was studied using polyphasic approach. Cells of the strain were Gram-negative, rod-shaped and facultatively anaerobic. The novel strain grew at a temperature of 15-42 degrees C (optimum at 28 degrees C). Growth of the strain occurred between pH 5.5 and 11.0, with an optimum at pH 7.0-8.0. The G+C content of the total DNA was 67.4 mol%. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the strain was most closely related to species of the genus Lysobacter, Lysobacter yangpyeongensis DSM 17635(T) (98.6 %), Lysobacter niabensis GH34-4(T) (97.2 %), Lysobacter enzymogenes DSM 2043(T) (96.9 %), Lysobacter daejeonensis DSM 17634(T) (96.3 %) and Lysobacter niastensis GH41-7(T) (96.2 %). The novel strain showed <96.0 % similarity with other species of the genus Lysobacter. Chemotaxonomic data (major quinone, Q-8; major polar lipids, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine, and major fatty acids, C(15 : 0) iso, C(16 : 0) iso, C(17 : 0) iso and C(17 : 1) iso omega9c) supported the affiliation of strain YC6269(T) to the genus Lysobacter. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences, DNA-DNA hybridization data and biochemical and physiological characteristics strongly supported the genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strain YC6269(T) from recognized species of the genus Lysobacter. Strain YC6269(T), therefore, represents a novel member of the genus Lysobacter, for which the name Lysobacter oryzae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YC6269(T) (=KCTC 22249(T)=DSM 21044(T)).
