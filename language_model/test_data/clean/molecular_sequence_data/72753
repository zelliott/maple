The mycolate pattern of a recently recognized mycobacterial pathogen, Mycobacterium mucogenicum (formerly Mycobacterium chelonae-like organism), was established for the first time. The reference strains, together with 31 environmental and clinical isolates belonging to this species, were examined for their mycolate composition by thin-layer chromatography. All strains tested exhibited the same mycolate profile. Mycolates were identified as belonging to the type without additional oxygenated chemical groups (mycolate I) and the type with a dicarboxylic group (mycolate VI); the identification of the latter was reinforced by the presence of 2-octadecanol, as seen by gas-liquid capillary chromatography. This mycolate profile permits the clear differentiation of M. mucogenicum from other related species, as members of the Mycobacterium fortuitum complex. This fact is especially important-because strains of M. mucogenicum are very difficult to differentiate from other species of the M. fortuitum complex by means of conventional biochemical tests. Moreover, the characteristic mycolate profile exhibited by the strains of M. mucogenicum supports the recent proposal which considers them as members of a new species.
