A nitroreductase enzyme has been isolated from Walker 256 rat carcinoma cells which can convert 5-(aziridin-1-yl)-2,4-dinitrobenzamide (CB 1954) to a cytotoxic DNA interstrand crosslinking agent by reduction of its 4-nitro group to the corresponding hydroxylamino species (Roberts JJ et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun 140: 1073-1078, 1986; Knox RJ et al., Biochem Pharmacol 37: 4661-4669, 1988). The enzyme has now been identified as a form of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) (DT diaphorase, menadione reductase (NMOR), phylloquinone reductase, quinone reductase, EC 1.6.99.2) by comparison of partial protein sequences, coenzymes, substrate and inhibitor specificities, and spectroscopic data. 2-Phenyl-5(4)-aminoimidazole-4(5)-carboxamide and 5(4)-aminoimidazole-4(5)-carboxamide were shown to be inhibitors of the isolated Walker cell enzyme. This observation could explain the reported antagonistic action of the aminoimidazole carboxamides to the antitumour effects of CB 1954.
