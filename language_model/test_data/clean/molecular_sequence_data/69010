A Sulfolobus solfataricus genomic library cloned in the EMBL3 phage was screened using as probes synthetic oligonucleotides designed from the known amino acid sequence of a peptide obtained from the purified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (aGAPD) protein. The screening led to the isolation of six recombinant phages (lambda G1-lambda G6) and one of them (lambda G4) contained the entire GAPD gene. The deduced amino acid sequence accounts for a protein made of 341 amino acids and the initial methionine is encoded by a GTG triplet. Alignment of the S. solfataricus aGAPD sequence versus GAPD from archaea, eukarya, and bacteria showed that aGAPD is very similar to other archaebacterial but not to eukaryotic or eubacterial GAPD. For known archaebacterial GAPD sequences, the rate of nucleotide substitutions per site per year showed that these sequences are homologous not only at the amino acid but also at the nucleotide level. The evolutionary rates are nearly similar to those reported for other eukaryotic genes.
