We describe a 25-year-old black woman who presented with a long history of anemia requiring transfusions during childhood and adolescence. Molecular analysis revealed her to be a compound heterozygote for the sickle mutation and the approximately 22.7 kb deletion associated with hemoglobin Kenya. This patient's clinical course was more severe than previously reported for the Hb S/Hb Kenya genotype, a probable consequence of concomitant iron deficiency.
