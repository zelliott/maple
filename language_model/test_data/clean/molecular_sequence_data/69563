HLA-A and -B transplantation antigens can be expressed differentially at the basal level and in response to interferons (IFNs). To determine which DNA control elements and nuclear factors are responsible for these differences, HLA-A and -B upstream regulatory regions were used in expression and mobility-shift analyses. The HLA-A enhancer was found to contain two Rel (KBF/NF-kappa B) binding motifs, while the HLA-B enhancer has only one and is transactivated less well by overexpression of the NF-kappa B p65 subunit. On the other hand, the HLA-B IFN response element mediates a much stronger induction by IFNs and has a higher affinity for IRF-1 and -2, which are transcription factors implicated in the regulation of major histocompatibility complex class I genes. These results suggest a molecular basis for the way in which HLA-A and -B loci have adapted to be differentially expressed and to respond to different sets of cytokine signals.
