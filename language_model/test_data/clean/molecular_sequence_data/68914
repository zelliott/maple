A rat anti-mouse CD40 antiserum has been prepared by hyperimmunisation of Lewis rats with a highly purified preparation of the recombinant extracellular domain of murine CD40. This antiserum specifically binds CD40-expressing L cell transfectants, but not untransfected L cells, and induces vigorous proliferation of highly purified small dense B cells obtained from the spleens of unstimulated mice. Anti-CD40-induced B cell proliferation can be augmented by the addition of IL-4 and is inhibited by purified recombinant soluble mouse CD40. Interestingly the same anti-CD40 antiserum specifically inhibits the in vitro growth of A.20 murine B lymphoma cells. The specificity of this inhibition can be demonstrated by reversing the effect with purified recombinant soluble mouse CD40. These data implicate CD40 as a possible target for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of B lymphomas.
