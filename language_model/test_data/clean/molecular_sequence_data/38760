Anew sequence, which encoded a novel G protein-coupled receptor, was disclosed by two different groups, using the nucleic acid probes based on the delta opioid receptor, first cloned in 1992. The new receptor, which Meunier called opioid-receptor-like 1 (ORL-1), was shown to share high homology with the opioid receptors and therefore thought to be a potential target for new analgesics. In this respect, the present review reports on the literature referring to ORL-1, to its natural ligand (nociceptin or orphanin FQ) and to several synthetic analogues recently described, both as agonists or antagonists at the receptor.
