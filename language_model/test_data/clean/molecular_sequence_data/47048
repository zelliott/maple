We investigated protein/DNA interactions, using molecular dynamics simulations computed between a 10 Angstom water layer model of the 434 cI Repressor protein DNA binding domain (DBD) amino acids (R1-69) and DNA of operator (OR1) and its flanks consisting of 28 nucleotide base pairs. Hydrogen bonding interactions were monitored. In addition, van der Waals and electrostatic interaction energies were calculated. Amino acids of the 434 cI repressor DNA recognition helix 3 formed both direct and water mediated hydrogen bonds at cognate codon-anticodon nucleotide base and backbone sites within the OR1 DNA major groove halfsites and flanking regions. In addition, hydrophilic amino acids within the loop between helix 3 and helix 4 have strong electrostatic attraction to codon-anticodon nucleotides located within the central nucleotides of the minor groove between the OR1 major groove halfsites. These interactions together induced significant structural changes in the operator DNA manifested by overtwisting of the central nucleotide base pairs and narrowing of the minor groove between the DNA major groove halfsites. Finally, these findings offer a code for site specific DNA recognition by the 434 cI repressor protein.
