We present the genome sequence of Alishewanella aestuarii B11(T) (=KCTC 22051(T)=DSM 19476(T)). This species, isolated from tidal flat sediment, was reported to be a novel species. A. aestuarii is known to degrade pectin, an important component of plant cell wall. The presence of the genes related to pectin metabolism in this strain indicates its capability to utilize pectin.
