Protein synthesis in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells is a complex process requiring a large number of macromolecules: initiation factors, elongation factors, termination factors, ribosomes, mRNA, amino-acylsynthetases and tRNAs. This review focuses on our current knowledge of protein synthesis in higher plants.
