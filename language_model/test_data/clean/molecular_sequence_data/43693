The mouse RNA-binding protein, TB-RBP, suppresses translation in vitro and attaches mRNAs to microtubules by binding to conserved elements in the 3' untranslated regions of specific mRNAs. We have now purified TB-RBP from testicular and brain cytoplasmic extracts and cloned its cDNA. We find that the mouse TB-RBP cDNAs contain an open reading frame of 228 amino acids with a leucine zipper domain within its C terminus, a transmembrane helix, and a group of putative phosphorylation sites. TB-RBP shows 99% identity to the human protein, translin, a recombination hotspot-binding protein associated with chromosomal translocations [Aoki, K., Suzuki, K., Sugano, T., Tasaka, T., Nakahara, K., Kuge, O., Omori, A. & Kasai, M. (1995) Nat. Genet. 10, 167-174]. As shown for translin, TB-RBP also binds to single-stranded DNAs containing a broad range of consensus sequences, many of which are similar to the Y and H RNA-binding sequences. Recombinant TB-RBP was synthesized and an antiserum was prepared against the recombinant protein. The identity between translin and TB-RBP was confirmed by demonstrating that immunoprecipitation of TB-RBP from testicular extracts abolished formation of the RNA-TB-RBP complex. Based upon its DNA binding to target sequences in clustered breakpoint regions, we propose that TB-RBP may be involved in DNA recombination or DNA repair in male germ cells.
