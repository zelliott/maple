Entamoeba histolytica obtains its energy mainly from glucose fermentation. Enzymes involved in this pathway could be potential targets for antiparasite drugs. Here we report the molecular characterization of the E. histolytica enolase gene (Ehenl-I), which in a single copy is located on the 1.6 Mb chromosome. It is transcribed into a 1.4 kb mRNA which starts 13 nucleotides upstream of the ATG start codon. The sequence TATAAG, at -31, interacted with nuclear proteins suggesting that it has a TATA box function. Protein modelling allowed us to identify a putative specific region that differs from human enolase and could be a good target for the design of novel drugs against E. histolytica.
