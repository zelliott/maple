The structural gene encoding the 70-kDa outer membrane protein FrpB of Neisseria meningitidis was cloned and sequenced. A mutant lacking FrpB was constructed. No difference in iron utilization between the mutant and the parental strain was observed. A minor effect of the mutation on serum resistance was observed. A topology model for FrpB in the outer membrane is proposed.
