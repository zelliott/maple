A novel Gram-negative, rod shaped, motile, non-sporing strictly aerobic bacterium, designated strain AK5(T), was isolated from a sea water sample collected near Visakhapatnam coast, Bay of Bengal, India. Colonies on marine agar were circular, 3-4 mm in diameter, creamish and rose with entire margin. Growth occurred at 10-40°C, 0.5-12% (w/v) NaCl and pH of 7-11. Strain AK5(T) was oxidase and catalase positive. The fatty acids were dominated by iso-branched saturated and unsaturated fatty acids with a high abundance of iso-C(15:0), iso-C(17:0) and summed feature 9 (as defined by MIDI). Q8 was found to be the major respiratory quinone and diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and four unidentified phospholipids as polar lipids. The DNA G+C content of strain AK5(T) was 54.7 ± 0.2 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that strain AK5(T) was a member of the genus Aliidiomarina and closely related to Aliidiomarina taiwanensis with a phylogenetic distance of 5.3% (94.7% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and clustered with the same species. Results from the polyphasic taxonomy study support the conclusion that strain AK5(T) represents a novel Aliidiomarina species, for which the name Aliidiomarina haloalkalitolerans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of A. haloalkalitolerans is AK5(T) (= MTCC 11064(T) = JCM 17359(T)).
