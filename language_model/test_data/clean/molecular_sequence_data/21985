Immunoscreening of an Ewing's family of tumour (EFT)-derived cDNA library using formerly described EFT-specific antibodies led to the isolation of a 3.5 kb cDNA, named Ewing's tumour-associated antigen 16 (ETAA16). The ETAA16 cDNA shows no homology to any functionally characterised human gene. Only a bovine cDNA expressed in bovine testis and hepatocytes is functionally characterised as it encodes for a junction plaque associated protein and showed a homology of 69.9% at amino acid level to ETAA16. The human cDNA encodes for a 926 amino acid tumour antigen with a calculated molecular weight of 103 kDa. The epitope of the ETAA16-specific antibody, Ak16, covers the central region of the protein which is part of an extra cellular domain. The human ETAA16 gene locus has been assigned to chromosome 2p13-15 by FISH analyses and is confirmed by the human genome sequencing project. As demonstrated by flow cytometry, the cell surface expression of ETAA16 antigen is restricted to ET cell lines and not expressed on other small blue round cell tumours or other kind of tumour. RT-PCR analysis revealed a high expression of ETAA16 in brain, liver and kidney while lung and heart were negative. Immunohistochemistry showed an intracellular expression of ETAA16 in different kind of non-Ewing tumour tissues. These results suggest that ETAA16 may function as a tumour-specific cell surface antigen in EFTs.
