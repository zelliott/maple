Complement system activation within the central nervous system (CNS) is involved in demyelinating and neurodegenerative disorders, but the role of complement in the pathogenic process or in the repair remains unclear. Besides the direct lytic effects of complement on target cells (oligodendrocytes or neurons), complement can exert other functions through interaction of complement fragments with specific receptors. The C5a anaphylatoxin, an inflammatory peptide which is formed during complement activation, might play a role in the CNS pathogenesis, and activation and recruitment of glial cells by binding to its receptor (C5aR) on CNS cells. Using degenerate primers corresponding to homologous regions between human and mouse C5aR cDNAs, we have cloned a rat C5aR cDNA probe from rat monocytes RNAs after RT-PCR experiment. The rat C5aR probe isolated by this procedure allowed us to clone the rat C5aR cDNA-coding sequence using a library screening cloning strategy. This probe was also used to study the expression of the C5aR mRNA in the rat CNS. Northern blotting and RT-PCR experiments demonstrated the constitutive expression of C5aR mRNA in brain, spleen, kidney and lung. This transcript was also observed in primary culture of rat astrocytes. Microfluorimetry experiments demonstrated that C5aR expressed by astrocytes in culture is functional since the addition of C5a induced a dose-dependent increase of intracellular calcium concentration. The expression of the C5aR by astrocytes suggests new roles for the C5a anaphylatoxin in reactive astrogliosis to CNS injuries.
