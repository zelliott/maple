Rhes, the Ras Homolog Enriched in Striatum, is a GTP-binding protein whose gene was discovered during a screen for mRNAs preferentially expressed in rodent striatum. This 266 amino acid protein is intermediate in size between small Ras-like GTP-binding proteins and α-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. It is most closely related to another Ras-like GTP-binding protein termed Dexras1 or AGS1. Although subsequent studies have shown that the rhes gene is expressed in other brain areas in addition to striatum, the striatal expression level is relatively high, and Rhes protein is likely to play a vital role in striatal physiology and pathology. Indeed, it has recently been shown to interact with the Huntingtin protein and play a pivotal role in the selective vulnerability of striatum in Huntington's disease (HD). Not surprisingly, Rhes can interact with multiple proteins to affect striatal physiology at multiple levels. Functional studies have indicated that Rhes plays a role in signaling by striatal G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), although the details of the mechanism remain to be determined. Rhes has been shown to bind to both α- and β-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins and to affect signaling by both Gi/o- and Gs/olf-coupled receptors. In this context, Rhes can be classified as a member of the family of accessory proteins to GPCR signaling. With documented effects in dopamine- and opioid-mediated behaviors, an interaction with thyroid hormone systems and a role in HD pathology, Rhes is emerging as an important protein in striatal physiology and pathology.
