Differential screening of a cDNA library was used to isolate probes for mRNAs that are induced in simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed human keratinocytes. Several of these cDNAs hybrid select mRNAs which encode transformation-induced proteins found in the cytoskeletal component of SV40-transformed keratinocytes. One of these cDNAs was used to study the phenotype of normal and transformed cell lines derived from various tissues. We found that mRNA encoding the novel transformation-induced proteins is expressed in two squamous carcinoma cell lines derived from the oral epithelium, four SV40-transformed keratinocyte cell lines, and two SV40-transformed fibroblasts. Normal or transformed lymphoid cells or cell lines derived from carcinoma of the cervix do not express mRNAs which hybridize to these probes. The results from this study suggest that these probes may be used to detect markers of transformation in certain cell types.
