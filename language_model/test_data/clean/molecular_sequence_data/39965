A partial gene for eel (Anguilla japonica) vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been cloned and an endothelial-cell-enriched primary culture derived from rete mirabile established to study regulation of the expression of the eel VEGF gene. Cells were cultured in M199 medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum (FCS) and serum-free M199 medium for long-and short-term experiments, respectively. Cells were separately treated with cobalt ions (Co2+), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and estradiol (E2), which have been demonstrated to stimulate mammalian VEGF A expression, followed by quantification of the VEGF mRNA levels by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Our results show that: (1) the deduced eel VEGF protein encoded by the cloned gene is about 130 amino acids in length, and is closely related to a zebrafish (Danio rerio) VEGF A; (2) the endothelial-cell-enriched rete mirabile primary culture containing mainly (over 70%) the capillary endothelial cells; (3) the expression levels of the eel VEGF transcript were increased by Co2+, bFGF, and E2 treatments in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Our data demonstrate that an eel partial VEGF gene has been cloned and its regulation of expression in endothelial-cell-enriched rete mirabile cell culture is similar to that in higher vertebrates.
