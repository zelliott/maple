The yeast Arxula adeninivorans provides an attractive expression platform and can be exploited as gene source for biotechnologically interesting proteins. In the following study, a striking example for the combination of both aspects is presented. The transaldolase-encoding A. adeninivorans ATAL gene, including its promoter and terminator elements, was isolated and characterized. The gene includes a coding sequence of 963 bp encoding a putative 321 amino acid protein of 35.0 kDa. The enzyme characteristics analyzed from isolates of native strains and recombinant strains overexpressing the ATAL gene revealed a molecular mass of ca. 140 kDa corresponding to a tetrameric structure, a pH optimum of ca. 5.5, and a temperature optimum of 20 degrees C. The preferred substrates for the enzyme include D-erythrose-4-phosphate and D-fructose-6-phosphate, whereas D-glyceraldehyde is not converted. The ATAL expression level under salt-free conditions was observed to increase in media supplemented with 5% NaCl rendering the ATAL promoter attractive for moderate heterologous gene expression under high-salt conditions. Its suitability was assessed for the expression of a human serum albumin (HSA) reporter gene.
