The successful establishment of a postcrisis SV-40 T antigen transformed epithelial cell line, 1HAEo-, which retains tight junctions and vectorial ion transport, is described. Immunocytochemical analysis of 1HAEo- cells shows a defined pattern of cytokeratin staining and a characteristic pericellular localization of the adhesion molecule cellCAM 120/80, indicating the presence of junctional complexes. The presence of both tight junctions and desmosomes has been confirmed by electron microscopy. Cell monolayers have good transepithelial resistance measured in Ussing chambers. Cells increase chloride ion transport in response to addition of agents that raise either intracellular cAMP or calcium, measured either by 36Cl- efflux or whole-cell patch clamp. An increase in short-circuit current, in response to these agents, can be measured in Ussing chambers. The presence of a depolarization-induced outwardly rectifying 45 pS chloride channel has been demonstrated in single cell detached membrane patches. In addition, the cells have been found to express mucin mRNA. These cells therefore demonstrate that it is possible to select transformed cell clones with particular morphologic characteristics, i.e. the presence of tight junctions and cell polarity, which also retain useful epithelial cell-specific functions, including vectorial ion transport. They also provide a major resource for the study of the structure and function of human epithelia.
