Recently, there have been indications of participation of mitochondria in the carcinogenic process and the role of polymorphisms in increasing the risk of cancer. The aim of the study was to detect possible changes in the sequence of 22 genes encoding mitochondrial tRNA in breast cancer carcinoma, which take part in protein synthesis in the translation process. The analysis of tumour tissue and blood material sampled from 50 patients revealed that few mutations have been found. It cannot be excluded that, through their impact on the secondary and tertiary tRNA structure, polymorphisms may cause mitochondrial dysfunction and contribute to appearance of other changes in mtDNA. Mutations in tRNA genes in breast cancer may affect the cell and cause its dysfunction, as in mitochondrial diseases.
