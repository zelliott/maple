Semliki Forest virus vectors were applied for the evaluation of 101 G protein-coupled receptors in three mammalian cell lines. Western blotting demonstrated that 95 of the 101 tested GPCRs showed positive signals. A large number of the GPCRs were expressed at high levels suggesting receptor yields in the range of 1 mg/L or higher, suitable for structural biology applications. Specific binding assays on a selected number of GPCRs were carried out to compare the correlation between total and functional protein expression. Ligands and additives supplemented to the cell culture medium were evaluated for expression enhancement. Selected GPCRs were also expressed from mutant SFV vectors providing enhanced protein expression and reduced host cell toxicity in attempts to further improve receptor yields.
