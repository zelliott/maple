A simple, efficient method has been developed for detecting retroviral RNAs expressed in cells. In this method, total RNAs or poly A+ RNAs extracted from various human cells are separated by electrophoresis and hybridized with synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the 3'-terminal 18 nucleotides of various tRNAs. Genomic and subgenomic RNAs of HTLV-I and HTLV-II in virus-infected cells and of xenotropic murine leukemia virus expressed in human lung cancer cells were easily detected with the tRNA(Pro)-derived oligonucleotide probe. This technique can be used to search for unidentified retroviruses expressed in human cancer cells and tissues.
