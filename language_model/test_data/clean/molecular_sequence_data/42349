A five generation family with an X linked ocular disorder has been investigated. The major clinical features were reduced visual acuity, nystagmus, and myopia. Although impaired night vision was not a symptom, using psychophysical and electrophysiological testing both rod and cone function were found to be abnormal in all affected males. No abnormality was detected in carrier females. Gene location studies showed X linked transmission of a gene that maps to proximal Xp11. The findings observed in this cohort are similar to those previously reported in both congenital stationary night blindness type 2 (CSNB2) and Aland Island eye disease (AIED). This study addresses whether CSNB2 and AIED are a single entity or whether the latter is a subset of the former.
