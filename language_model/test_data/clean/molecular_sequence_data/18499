A Gram-negative, aerobic, motile by single polar flagellum, short rod-shaped bacterium was isolated from a deep-seawater sample of the Southeastern Pacific Ocean. Growth was found to occur at 10-40 °C, at pH 4.0-10.0 and in the presence of 0-9.0 % (w/v) NaCl. The phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain JLT2013(T) fell within a clade comprising species of the genus Parvularcula and formed a coherent cluster with Parvularcula lutaonensis CC-MMS-1(T) (neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree) or Parvularcula dongshanensis SH25(T) (maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony phylogenetic trees). Sequence similarity analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain JLT2013(T) shows high sequence similarity to P. lutaonensis CC-MMS-1(T) (96.7 %), P. dongshanensis SH25(T) (96.0 %) and Parvularcula bermudensis HTCC2503(T) (95.2 %). The major cellular fatty acids were identified as C12:0 (34.3 %), summed feature 8 (C18:1 ω7c and/or C18:1 ω6c) (10.9 %), C16:0 (10.0 %) and C17:1 ω6c (7.2 %). The polar lipids were found to include diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, three sphingoglycolipids and three unknown glycolipids. Strain JLT2013(T) was found to contain Q-10 as the predominant quinone. The DNA G+C content was determined to be 66.3 mol%. In the light of the phenotypic characteristics, chemotaxonomic features and phylogenetic evidence gathered in this study, strain JLT2013(T) (=LMG 27362(T) = CGMCC 1.12400(T)) should be classified as a novel species in the genus Parvularcula, for which the name Parvularcula oceani [corrected] sp. nov. is proposed.
