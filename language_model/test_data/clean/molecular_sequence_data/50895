Even though thymulin was isolated, sequenced and characterised some 20 years ago and later identified as a thymic hormone involved in immunomodulation, much more work is still required to further understanding of the mechanisms of action(s) of this peptide. Since the observation, by a semiquantitative bioassay, of diminished levels of thymulin in immunodeficiency and autoimmune disease, new data obtained by radioimmunoassay have not only confirmed previous observations but also demonstrated that thymulin plays a role in the interaction between the immune system and the neuro-endocrine system. In this paper we give an up to date account of recent developments in research into the role of thymulin in immunomodulation.
