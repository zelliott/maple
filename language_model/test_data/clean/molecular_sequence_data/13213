Transgenic mice carrying heterologous genes directed by a 670-bp segment of the regulatory sequence from the human transferrin (TF) gene demonstrated high expression in brain. Mice carrying the chimeric 0.67kbTF-CAT gene expressed TF-CAT in neurons and glial cells of the nucleus basalis, the cerebrum, corpus callosum, cerebellum, and hippocampus. In brains from two independent TF-CAT transgenic founder lines, copy number of TF-CAT mRNA exceeded the number of mRNA transcripts encoding either mouse endogenous transferrin or mouse endogenous amyloid precursor protein. In two transgenic founder lines, the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) protein synthesized from the TF-CAT mRNA was estimated to be 0.10-0.15% of the total soluble proteins of the brain. High expression observed in brain indicates that the 0.67kbTF promoter is a promising director of brain expression of heterologous genes. Therefore, the promoter has been used to express the three common human apolipoprotein E (apoE) alleles in transgenic mouse brains. The apoE alleles have been implicated in the expression of Alzheimer disease, and the human apoE isoforms are reported to interact with different affinities to the brain beta-amyloid and tau protein in vitro. Results of this study demonstrate high expression and production of human apoE proteins in transgenic mouse brains. The model may be used to characterize the interaction of human apoE isoforms with other brain proteins and provide information helpful in designing therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer disease.
