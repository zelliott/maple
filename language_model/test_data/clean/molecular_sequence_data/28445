A restriction fragment length polymorphism within the human alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor gene has been detected by Southern blot hybridization using an alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor cDNA probe. This restriction fragment length polymorphism can be attributed to the presence of two alleles, A and B, that are distributed in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with frequencies of 73.5% and 2.65%, respectively, in 66 unrelated Caucasian individuals or with frequencies of 51.0% and 49.0%, respectively, in 50 unrelated Japanese individuals. The minor allele, B, is due to a deletion of about 720 base pairs in intron 8 of the alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor gene. Sequence analysis of the deletion junction in allele B and the corresponding regions of allele A demonstrated the presence of oppositely oriented Alu sequences at the 5' and 3' deletion boundaries. These data suggest that this restriction fragment length polymorphism was caused by intrastrand recombination between Alu sequences.
