A novel Bacillus isolate from raw milk and four strains from diverse origins that were identified previously as Bacillus lentus, Bacillus firmus and Bacillus circulans showed a high degree of similarity in amplified rDNA restriction analysis, SDS-PAGE and routine phenotypic tests, whilst 16S rDNA sequence comparisons and DNA relatedness data showed that this taxon was different from related Bacillus species. On the basis of these data, Bacillus galactosidilyticus sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain LMG 17892(T) (=DSM 15595(T)=Logan B2188(T)=MB 800(T)).
