We show that a mutation in bacteriophage Mu transposase (pA) which was isolated as a deletion of the C-terminal end of the protein actually consists of the replacement of the last 16 amino acids (which are mostly hydrophilic) by 26 mostly hydrophobic amino acids. This change almost completely inactivates the in vivo enzyme activity as well as its capacity to bind Mu ends in vitro, although the end-binding domain of the protein resides at least 150 amino acids from the C-terminus. This sharply contrasts with the properties of a series of missense mutations and short C-terminal deletions in pA described earlier which only slightly decrease the overall transposase activity.
