The "Vibrio fischeri species group" recently was reclassified as a new genus, Aliivibrio, comprising four species, Aliivibrio fischeri, Aliivibrio logei, Aliivibrio salmonicida, and Aliivibrio wodanis. Only limited phylogenetic analysis of strains within Aliivibrio has been carried out, however, and taxonomic ambiguity is evident within this group, especially for phenotypically unusual strains and certain strains isolated from bioluminescent symbioses. Therefore, to examine in depth the evolutionary relationships within Aliivibrio and redefine the host affiliations of symbiotic species, we examined several previously identified and newly isolated strains using phylogenetic analysis based on multiple independent loci, gapA, gyrB, pyrH, recA, rpoA, the luxABE region, and the 16S rRNA gene. The analysis resolved Aliivibrio as distinct from Vibrio, Photobacterium, and other genera of Vibrionaceae, and resolved A. fischeri, A. salmonicida, A. logei, and A. wodanis as distinct, well-supported clades. However, it also revealed that several previously reported strains are incorrectly identified and that substantial unrecognized diversity exists in this genus. Specifically, strain ATCC 33715 (Y-1) and several other strains having a yellow-shifted luminescence were not members of A. fischeri. Furthermore, no strain previously identified as A. logei grouped with the type strain (ATCC 29985(T)), and no bona-fide strain of A. logei was identified as a bioluminescent symbiont. Several additional strains identified previously as A. logei group instead with the type strain of A. wodanis (ATCC BAA-104(T)), or are members of a new clade. Two strongly supported clades were evident within A. fischeri, a phylogenetic structure that might reflect differences in the host species or differences in the ecological incidence of strains. The results of this study highlight the importance of basing taxonomic conclusions on examination of type strains.
