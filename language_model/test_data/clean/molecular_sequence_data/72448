To identify the bovine mannan-binding protein (MBP), a search for the cDNA homologue of human MBP was carried out. cDNA clones encoding bovine MBP were isolated from a bovine liver cDNA library using a cDNA fragment encoding a short collagen region, neck domain and carbohydrate recognition domain of human MBP. The cDNA carried an insert of 747 bp encoding a protein of 249 amino acid (aa) residues with a signal peptide of 19 aa. The mannan-binding protein fraction of bovine serum that eluted with 100 mM mannose from a mannan-Sepharose column was analyzed under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE. The major band of 33 kDa obtained reacted with anti-human MBP rabbit serum. The partial aa sequence of the purified 33-kDa protein was identical to the aa sequence deduced from the obtained cDNA. Results of the passive hemolysis experiment using sheep erythrocytes coated with yeast mannan suggest that this MBP has the ability to activate complement. Northern blot analysis showed a 1.8-kb mRNA that was expressed only in the liver. Based on results of genomic analysis, this bovine MBP is likely to be a homologue of human MBP and to also have homology to rat and mouse MBP-C which are localized in liver cells rather than to rat and mouse MBP-A found in serum. Alignments of bovine collectins show that bovine MBP cannot be included among the other bovine collectins, such as bovine SP-D, conglutinin and CL-43. Finally, these genomic and biological analyses indicate that the cDNA obtained here encoded a bovine serum MBP.
