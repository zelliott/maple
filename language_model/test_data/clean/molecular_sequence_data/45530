During the febrile illness epidemic in Bangladesh in 2002, 58 people died out of the 6,132 affected. Two hundred hospitalized patients were analyzed clinically, serologically and virologically to determine the features of this dengue infection. Among the 10- to 70-year-old age group of the 200 clinically suspected dengue patients, 100 (50%) were confirmed as dengue cases by virus isolation and dengue IgM-capture ELISA. Of the 100 dengue-confirmed cases, the mean age was 29.0 (+/-12.4). The possible dengue secondary infection rate determined by Flavivirus IgG-indirect ELISA was 78% in 2002. Eight dengue virus strains were isolated, representing the first dengue virus isolation in the country, and all of the strains were dengue virus type-3 (DEN-3). Sequence data for the envelope gene of the DEN-3 Bangladeshi isolates were used in a phylogenetic comparison with DEN-3 from other countries. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that all 8 strains of DEN-3 were clustered within a well-supported independent sub-cluster of genotype II and were closely related to the Thai isolates from the 1990s. Therefore, it is likely that the currently circulating DEN-3 viruses entered Bangladesh from neighboring countries.
