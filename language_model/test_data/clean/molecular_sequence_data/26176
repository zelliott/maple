In studies of DNA replication in Escherichia coli, an important question concerns the role of the initiator protein DnaA. This protein is known to bind to a specific 9-bp sequence in the origin of replication, but it is not understood how it can recognize another, relatively distant, 13-bp sequence that has no homology to the binding site but is where the DnaA protein serves its catalytic function in the initiation of DNA replication. This effect of DnaA might be achieved by bending of DNA in this region. I have searched for putative binding sites for integration host factor (IHF), a protein known to bend DNA. Here I report the finding of an IHF binding site in the E. coli origin and present direct evidence that IHF binds and causes DNA bending in this region. On the basis of these results I propose a model wherein formation of a higher-order nucleoprotein structure would facilitate the action of DnaA protein in the initiation events.
