Two genes encoding ribosomal protein YL41 were cloned from Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomal DNA. Both genes contain an uninterrupted region of only 75 nucleotides coding for a protein of 3.3 kD. Within the coding regions the nucleotide sequences are virtually identical, whereas in both the 5'- and 3'-flanking regions the two genes differ significantly from each other. The deduced protein shows an arginine and lysine content of 68 percent, i.e., 17 out of 25 residues, and the basic residues are evenly distributed over the molecule. When compared to the ribosomal protein sequences currently available no counterpart to YL41 could be found in prokaryotes and it seems likely that YL41 is a eukaryote-specific ribosomal protein.
