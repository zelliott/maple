Several miRNA family and their targets in cotton had been identified by computational methods based on the conserved characterization of miRNAs. So far, there are no experiments to validate the existence of miRNAs in cotton. In this study, to analyze the miRNAs in cotton, a small RNA library of sequences from 18 to 26 nt of Gossypium hirsutum seedling has been built by high-throughput sequencing. In this library, 34 conserved miRNA families were identified by homology search and the miRNA sequences of them were also found in the library. Furthermore, potential targets of these conserved miRNA families were predicted in cotton TC library. However, based on the mature miRNAs and their miR sequences, only 8 conserved miRNA encoding loci (miR156, miR157a, miR157b, miR162, miR164, miR393, miR399, miR827) were identified from cotton EST sequences. Multiple encoding loci of some miRNAs were identified by comparing the cloned miRNA and miR sequences.
