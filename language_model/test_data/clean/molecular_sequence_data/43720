Group I introns are proposed to have become mobile following the acquisition of open reading frames (ORFs) that encode highly specific DNA endonucleases. This proposal implies that intron ORFs could behave as autonomously mobile entities. This was supported by abundant circumstantial evidence but no experiment of ORF transfer from an ORF-containing intron to its ORF-less counterpart has been described. In this paper we present such experiments, which demonstrate the efficient mobility of the mitochondrial nad1-i4-orf1 between two Podospora strains. The homing of this mobile ORF was accompanied by a bidirectional co-conversion that did not systematically involve the whole intron sequence. Orf1 acquisition would be the most recent step in the evolution of the nad1-i4 intron, which has resulted in many strains of Podospora having an intron with two ORFs (biorfic) and four splicing pathways. We show that two of the splicing events that operate in this biorfic intron, as evidenced by PCR experiments, are generated by a 5'-alternative splice site, which is most probably a remnant of the monoorfic ancestral form of the intron. We propose a sequential evolution model that is consistent with the four organizations of the corresponding nad1 locus that we found among various species of the Pyrenomycete family; these organizations consist of no intron, an intron alone, a monoorfic intron, and a biorfic intron.
