Pseudomonas putida PRS2000 degrades the aromatic acids benzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate via two parallel sequences of reactions that converge at beta-ketoadipate, a derivative of which is cleaved to form tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. Structural genes (pca genes) required for the complete degradation of 4-hydroxybenzoate via the protocatechuate branch of the beta-ketoadipate pathway have been characterized, and a specific transport system for 4-hydroxybenzoate has recently been described. To better understand how P. putida coordinates the processes of 4-hydroxybenzoate transport and metabolism to achieve complete degradation, the regulation of pcaK, the 4-hydroxybenzoate transport gene, and that of pcaF, a gene required for both benzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate degradation, were compared. Primer extension analysis and lacZ fusions showed that pcaK and pcaF, which are adjacent on the chromosome, are transcribed independently. PcaR, a transcriptional activator of several genes of the beta-ketoadipate pathway, is required for expression of both pcaF and pcaK, and the pathway intermediate beta-ketoadipate induces both genes. In addition to these expected regulatory elements, expression of pcaK, but not pcaF, is repressed by benzoate. This previously unrecognized layer of regulatory control in the beta-ketoadipate pathway appears to extend to the first two steps of 4-hydroxybenzoate degradation, since levels of 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase and protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase activities were also depressed when cells were grown on a mixture of 4-hydroxybenzoate and benzoate. The apparent consequence of benzoate repression is that cells degrade benzoate in preference to 4-hydroxybenzoate. These findings indicate that 4-hydroxybenzoate transport is an integral feature of the beta-ketoadipate pathway in P. putida and that transport plays a role in establishing the preferential degradation of benzoate over 4-hydroxybenzoate. These results also demonstrate that there is communication between the two branches of the beta-ketoadipate pathway.
