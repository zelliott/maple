The study of several human breast cancer cell lines containing oestrogen receptors has allowed characterization of a number of oestrogen-induced proteins (e.g. progesterone receptor, cathepsin D, pS2, Hsp27, c-Myc). In primary tumours these markers have different prognostic significance for predicting whether the tumour will be hormone responsive (e.g. pS2, progesterone receptor) and whether it will metastasize (e.g. cathepsin D). The mechanism of regulation of gene expression by oestrogens and anti-oestrogens in breast cancer is complex and varies according to the nature of both the gene and the cell in which it is transcribed. Our laboratory has identified the sequences mediating oestrogen activity in the proximal region of cathepsin D, including a non-consensus oestrogen-responsive element located at -260 which acts in synergy with other regulatory elements. In addition to the classical effect of oestrogen receptor in stimulating transcription of genes controlled by the oestrogen-responsive element, we found that estrogen receptor is able to modulate transcription of AP-1-responsive genes without interacting directly with DNA. Cross-talk between oestrogen receptor and members of the Fos/Jun family via protein-protein interactions may explain how anti-oestrogens inhibit the mitogenic effect of growth factors in the apparent absence of oestrogens and why tamoxifen is able to stimulate cathepsin D gene expression and induce apoptosis in certain oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells. The nature and degree of this cross-talk appears to vary according to the gene, the cell type and the type of oestrogen receptor ligand involved. Studies of oestrogen-regulated genes are not only useful for classifying breast cancers according to their ability to metastasize and respond to therapies, but also should lead to new therapeutic approaches for hormone-dependent and hormone-resistant cancers.
