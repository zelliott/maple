A novel Gram-positive-staining, catalase- and oxidase-positive, non-motile, non-spore-forming coccus, designated YIM-Y21(T), was isolated from a salt mine in Yunnan, south-west China. The strain was moderately halophilic, facultatively alkaliphilic and obligately aerobic. Colonies were white. Growth occurred with 1.0-30.0 % NaCl (optimum, 10.0 % NaCl), at pH 6.0-10.0 (optimum, pH 8.5) and at 5-40 degrees C (optimum, 25 degrees C). The major amino acid constituents of the cell wall were glycine and lysine. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C(15 : 0), anteiso-C(17 : 0) and iso-C(15 : 0). MK-6 was the predominant respiratory quinone, with MK-7 present in minor amounts. The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and an unidentified phospholipid. The DNA G+C content was 46.1 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons revealed that strain YIM-Y21(T) was most closely related to the type strains of the nine recognized species of the genus Salinicoccus. The sequence similarities between the isolate and the type strains of members of this genus were in the range of 90.6-93.8 %, which indicated that strain YIM-Y21(T) is a representative of a novel species within the genus Salinicoccus. Together with the phenotypic characteristics and chemotaxonomic differences, these results support the proposal of a novel species of the genus Salinicoccus, Salinicoccus albus sp. nov., with YIM-Y21(T) (=CCTCC AA 207024(T) =DSM 19776(T) =KCTC 13192(T)) as the type strain.
