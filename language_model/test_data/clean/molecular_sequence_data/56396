The survival of Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida was investigated in sterile and untreated lake water. In sterile lake water (filtered and autoclaved), it was found that cells of A. salmonicida entered a nonculturable but viable condition. Viability was determined by flow cytometry with the dye rhodamine 123, which is taken up and maintained within cells with a membrane potential. For survival studies in untreated lake water, A. salmonicida was marked with the xylE gene by using the plasmid pLV1013. Marked cells were detected by growth on tryptone soy agar and tryptone soy agar supplemented with kanamycin. Cells were also detected by polymerase chain reaction DNA amplification of the xylE gene and a chromosomal DNA fragment specific for A. salmonicida (pLV1013). The results indicated that A. salmonicida entered a nonculturable condition in untreated lake water over a 21-day study. The viability of nonculturable cells could not be determined in mixed samples; however, the presence of nonculturable cells containing both chromosomal and plasmid DNA was confirmed.
