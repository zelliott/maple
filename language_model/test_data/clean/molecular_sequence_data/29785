Hyperthermophilic archaea show important metabolic adaptations for growth on carbohydrates under hostile conditions. For carbohydrate uptake so far only ABC-type transporters have been described that are equipped with a uniquely high affinity as compared to mesophilic bacterial systems. This allows these organisms to efficiently scavenge all available carbohydrates from the extreme environment.
