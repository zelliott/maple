DNA fragments from the temperate lactococcal bacteriophage BK5-T were cloned into the promoter-detecting plasmid pMU1328. Five DNA fragments conferring promoter activity were selected by transformation of Streptococcus sanguis and were functional in Escherichia coli, S. sanguis, and Lactococcus lactis subspp. lactis and cremoris. The nucleotide sequences of these fragments were determined, and primer extension analysis was used to locate the site of initiation of transcription from each promoter in both E. coli and S. sanguis. Transcription was initiated from the same nucleotide in these two organisms, and the promoters contained -10 and -35 regions similar to the consensus sequence for E. coli promoters. The activities of three of the five promoters were decreased two- to threefold when a compatible plasmid containing a 3.8-kilobase-pair EcoRI fragment (EcoRI-f) of BK5-T was coresident with the promoter-containing plasmid in either L. lactis subsp. cremoris or E. coli. Data from Tn5 mutagenesis, subcloning experiments, and DNA sequence analysis indicate that this decrease in promoter activity requires a region of EcoRI-f that contains a 621-base-pair open reading frame. This region has been designated bpi (for BK5-T promoter inhibitor).
