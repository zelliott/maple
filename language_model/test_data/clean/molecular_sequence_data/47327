The capsid protein of Australian feline calicivirus (FCV) isolates is demonstrably different from the prototype strain F9. Five Australian isolates of FCV, dating from 1970 to 1989, were analysed by western blotting and immunoprecipitation. Varying reactivity to a panel of F9 specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was observed. DNA sequencing of RT-PCR generated clones supported the observation of variation between capsid proteins. Predicted amino acid sequences varied by 11 to 17.5% across the whole capsid when compared to the published F9 sequence. Differences in amino acid sequence were most apparent in previously described hypervariable regions (C and E). Within hypervariable region E differences of 22 to 34% were observed compared to F9. The observed lack of reactivity to F9 MAbs correlated with amino acid changes within previously characterized binding sites within region E.
