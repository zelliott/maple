Spermadhesins, 12,000-14,000 M(r) mammalian proteins, include lectins involved in sperm-egg binding and display a single CUB domain architecture. We report the crystal structures of porcine seminal plasma PSP-I/PSP-II, a heterodimer of two glycosylated spermadhesins, and bovine aSFP at 2.4 A and 1.9 A resolution respectively.
