An inducible NADP(+)-dependent D-phenylserine dehydrogenase [EC 1.1.1.-], which catalyzes the oxidation of the hydroxyl group of D-threo-beta-phenylserine, was purified to homogeneity from a crude extract of Pseudomonas syringae NK-15 isolated from soil. The enzyme consisted of two subunits identical in molecular weight (about 31,000). In addition to D-threo-beta-phenylserine, it utilized D-threo-beta-thienylserine, D-threo-beta-hydroxynorvaline, and D-threonine as substrates but was inert towards other isomers of beta-phenylserine and threonine. It showed maximal activity at pH 10.4 for the oxidation of D-threo-beta-phenylserine, and it required NADP+ as a natural coenzyme. NAD+ showed a slight coenzyme activity. The enzyme was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate, HgCl2, and monoiodoacetate but not by the organic acids such as tartronate. The Michaelis constants for D-threo-beta-phenylserine and NADP+ were 0.44 mM and 29 microM, respectively. The N-terminal 27 amino acids sequence was determined. It suggested that the NADP(+)-binding site was located in the N-terminal region of the enzyme.
