The nucleotide sequence of the sheep mitochondrial DNA displacement-loop (D-loop) region and its flanking tRNA genes has been determined. Several conserved motifs among mammals have been identified along the 1189-bp sequence of the sheep control region: ten termination-associated sequences (TASs) and one conserved sequence block (CSB-1). CSB-2 and CSB-3, which are frequently found in most species, are not present in the sheep D-loop, which shows instead a short direct repeat at their usual localization. A long polypyrimidine tract between CSB-1 and the tRNA(Phe) gene is also present. Furthermore, the sheep mtDNA D-loop region displays tandem repeats in the left domain (adjacent to the tRNA(Pro) gene) comprising three different termination-associated sequences (TAS-5, TAS-6 and TAS-7).
