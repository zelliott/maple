The Escherichia coli rnpA gene encodes C5 protein, the protein component of RNase P. The rnpA49 mutation renders the C5 protein thermosensitive, which results in thermosensitivity of RNase P function. The chromosomal DNA region from Brevibacterium albidum that complements the rnpA49 mutation was analysed. The gene capable of complementing the growth defect of an rnpA49 mutant strain at nonpermissive temperature was identified as the gene for an arginine tRNA with anticodon CCG by a deletion analysis combined with complementation assays. Transcription of the arginine tRNA gene carried on a multicopy plasmid was correlated with the complementation of the rnpA49 mutation, indicating that the gene product is indeed responsible for complementation of the rnpA49 mutation.
