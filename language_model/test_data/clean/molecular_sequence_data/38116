Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play a major role in excitatory synaptic transmission in insects and are also the target site for chloronicotinyl insecticides such as imidacloprid. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel nAChR beta subunit, Mpbeta1, from the aphid Myzus persicae, an economically important pest species. Sequence analysis has identified an open reading frame of 509 amino acids with features typical of nAChR subunits. The Mpbeta1 gene is expressed as a single major transcript of 4.6 kb, considerably larger than the predicted length of the Mpbeta1 open reading frame (1527 bp). By heterologous expression in Drosophila S2 cells, the Mpbeta1 subunit has been shown to co-assemble with the previously cloned nAChR subunits Mpalpha1 and Mpalpha2. In contrast, no co-assembly of Mpbeta1 could be detected with either Mpalpha3 or Mpalpha4. With the aim of gaining a clearer insight into the influence of subunit composition upon assembly, the ability of M. persicae nAChR subunits to co-assemble with vertebrate nAChR subunits has also been examined.
