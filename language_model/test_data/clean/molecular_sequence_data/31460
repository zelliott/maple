Twelve strains of iron-oxidizing acidithiobacilli isolated from acidic sites throughout the world, including some previously shown by multi-locus sequence analyses and DNA-DNA hybridization to comprise a distinct species, were characterized in terms of their physiologies. The bacteria were shown to be obligately chemolithotrophic, acidophilic and mesophilic, and grew in both oxic and anoxic environments, using ferrous iron, reduced sulfur or hydrogen as electron donors and oxygen or ferric iron as electron acceptors. Some of the strains grew at lower pH than those reported for the two recognized iron-oxidizing Acidithiobacillus species, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans. Tolerance of transition metals and aluminium, and also specific rates of iron oxidation and reduction, were more similar to those of A. ferrooxidans (to which the strains are more closely related) than to A. ferrivorans. The name Acidithiobacillus ferridurans sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate the 12 strains, with the type strain being JCM 18981(T) ( = ATCC 33020(T)).
