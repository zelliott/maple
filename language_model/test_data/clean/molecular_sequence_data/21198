The aims of this study were to investigate yeast diversity in the plateau lake and to explore the value of these yeasts in such ecological environment.

Yeasts were isolated from 9 water and 4 soil samples collected in Chenghai lake in Yunnan province. The isolates were identified by using large-subunit (26S) rDNA gene D1/ D2 domain sequence analysis and traditional methods. The ability of the yeast strains to produced various enzymes was tested.

In total 64 yeast strains were isolated, these strains were identified as 22 species in 8 genera, including 4 suspected new species or variety. Genera Cryptococcus and Geotrichum were shared in the water and soil samples. Nine strains with secreted enzyme activities were selected. One of them could produce both protease and amylase.

The preliminary result showed the biodiversity of yeasts in Chenghai lake and the application potential of the yeasts isolated.
