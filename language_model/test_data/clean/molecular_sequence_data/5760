Chitin oligosaccharides of degree of polymerization 2-4 were deacetylated by purified chitin deacetylase isolated from Colletotrichum lindemuthianum to give their corresponding breakdown products after purification by liquid chromatography. Data from FABMS analyses suggested that N,N',N",N"'-tetraacetylchitotetraose and N,N',N"-triacetylchitotriose were converted into fully-deacetylated corresponding chitosan oligomers. Conversely, N,N'-diacetylchitobiose [(GlcNAc)2] was deacetylated to give a product which showed an [M + H]+ pseudomolecular ion at m/z 383, suggesting that either of the two acetyl groups were removed. Further data from 1H NMR analyses confirmed that the reaction product was 2-acetamido-4-O-(2-amino-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-2-deoxy-D-glucos e [GlcN-GlcNAc]. The enzymatic method has three advantageous characteristics over chemical methods: (i) it does not cause unexpected degradation of the sugar chain, (ii) it is highly reproducible, and (iii) unique compounds such as GlcN-GlcNAc may be produced.
