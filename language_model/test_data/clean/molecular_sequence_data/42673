Pit-1, a member of the POU family of homeo-domain transcription factors, activates prolactin and GH gene expression but also has a role in pituitary cell differentiation and proliferation. Expression of Pit-1 may therefore be of central importance in the function and phenotype of human pituitary adenomas. We have found evidence that, in addition to Pit-1 mRNA, Pit-1-like immunoreactivity and DNA-binding activity are readily detectable in a series of human pituitary adenomas. Gel mobility shift assays using adenoma protein extracts with two Pit-1-binding sites from the human prolactin gene promoter demonstrated the formation of several DNA sequence-specific protein-DNA complexes; some of these could be accounted for by Oct-1-binding activity. Pit-1 activity was anticipated in prolactin- and GH-secreting adenomas, but was also detected in a proportion of endocrine-inactive (non-secreting) adenomas that did not express Pit-1 target genes. The data demonstrate the presence of Pit-1 in a range of pituitary adenomas. Different adenomas generated slightly differing patterns of DNA-binding activity, though Pit-1 mRNA and protein size appeared normal in all tumours so far examined.
