Nucleotide sequence analysis of PCR fragments corresponding to the TSH-receptor (TSHR) amplified from genomic DNA collected from the four members of a family, two of which had Graves' thyrotoxicosis, revealed a nucleotide substitution in the first position of codon 36 of the TSH-receptor gene in the two patients. The nucleotide substitution was from G to C, leading to a 36D-->36H change (D36H) in the predicted amino acid sequence of the receptor. The altered sequence was also found in DNA obtained from their mother, but not in DNA from their father. We stably expressed the two receptor variants in NIH 3T3 cells, by transfection of cDNA encoding the wildtype (WT) and D36H variants of the TSHR. Neither the binding of 125I-TSH nor the responsiveness to TSH measured as cAMP formation, appeared to be different in the TSHR-D36H compared to the TSHR-WT. Furthermore, the D36H-receptor also became desensitized when exposed to TSH as did the WT-receptor.
