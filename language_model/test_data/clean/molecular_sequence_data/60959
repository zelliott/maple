bves is a novel mRNA expressed in the developing heart in chick and mouse. Here we describe hbves, the human homolog of chick and mouse bves. Northern and dot blot analyses reveal restricted expression in the heart and skeletal muscle in the embryo and adult. BLAST searches of the NCBI databases confirm that hbves is novel. Portions of the sequence are an exact match with genomic PAC 52202, which localizes to Chromosome (Chr) 6q21. Presumably, these matches and intervening sequences match the intron-exon borders of the gene. Computer conformation analysis of the derived amino acid predicts three transmembrane helices with an extracellular C-terminus that is conserved in chick, mouse, and human. bves is highly conserved among all three species at the amino acid level with 75% identity and 92% similarity.
