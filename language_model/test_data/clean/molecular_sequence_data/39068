Three differential cDNAs of Dictyostelium, not detected in the mod B mutant defective in O-glycosylation, were isolated by using an mRNA differential display. These cDNAs encode a protein tyrosine kinase, an adenylyl cyclase and a putative protein kinase C inhibitor whose expression is developmentally regulated.
