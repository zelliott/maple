We report the amplification of bacterial genes from uninoculated surface and subsurface sediments by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR amplification of indigenous bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA genes was unsuccessful when subsurface sediment containing approximately 10(7) cells.g-1 was added directly to a PCR mixture. However, when 10 mg of sediment was inoculated with approximately 10(5) cells of Pseudomonas putida G7, the nahAc naphthalene dioxygenase gene characteristic of the P. putida G7 NAH7 plasmid was detected by PCR amplification. Southern blotting of the PCR amplification product improved sensitivity to 10(3) to 10(4) cells from samples inoculated with P. putida G7, but controls with no sediment added showed that the PCR was partially inhibited by the sediments. Lysozyme-sodium dodecyl sulfate-freeze-thaw DNA extraction was combined with gel electrophoretic partial purification in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone to render DNA from indigenous bacteria in surface or subsurface sediment samples amplifiable by PCR using eubacterial 16S ribosomal DNA primers. The nahAc gene could also be amplified from indigenous bacteria by using nahAc-specific primers when PCR conditions were modified by increasing Taq and primer concentrations. Restriction digests of the nahAc amplification products from surface and subsurface sediments revealed polymorphism relative to P. putida G7. The procedures for DNA extraction, purification, and PCR amplification described here demonstrate that the PCR is a potentially useful tool in studies of function- and taxon-specific DNA from indigenous microbial communities in sediment and groundwater environments.
