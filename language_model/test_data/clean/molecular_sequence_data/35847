We report here the sequence of a 9.3 kb DNA segment of chromosome XI of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, located between the MAK11 locus and the centromere. This sequence contains four long open reading frames (ORFs), YKL160, YKL162, YKL164, YKL165 and part of another ORF, YKL166, covering altogether 90% of the entire sequence. One of these ORFs, YKL164, corresponds to CCE1. Translation products of two other ORFs, YKL160 and YKL165, exhibit homology with previously known S. cerevisiae proteins: the ribosomal protein L10, and the MYO2 gene product, respectively.
