The gene coding for the major sigma factor of Rickettsia prowazekii, an obligate intracellular parasitic bacterium, has been isolated utilizing an oligodeoxyribonucleotide as a probe to a conserved region of major sigma factors. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1905 bp that could encode a protein of 635 amino acids (aa) with a calculated molecular size of 73 kDa (sigma 73). R. prowazekii sigma 73 displayed extensive homology with major sigma factors from a variety of eubacteria. Comparison of the major sigma factors from Escherichia coli and R. prowazekii revealed 44.9% aa identity. R. prowazekii sigma 73 produced in E. coli minicells migrated as a 85-kDa protein when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. This anomalous migration is characteristic of eubacterial major sigma factors and agrees with the migration noted for the purified rickettsial sigma protein. Despite a similarity to the E. coli sigma 70 encoded by rpoD, R. prowazekii sigma 73 did not complement E. coli rpoD temperature-sensitive mutants.
