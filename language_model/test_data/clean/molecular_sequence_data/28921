Using a functional genomic approach, we have identified and characterized a cytosolic form of aminopeptidase P from Drosophila melanogaster. This study represents the first characterization of an insect aminopeptidase P. The complete sequence of a 12.5 kbp genomic clone from D. melanogaster showed the presence of a 1,839 bp ORF, encoding a protein of 613 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 68.5 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence was 48% identical and 66% similar to rat and human cytosolic aminopeptidase P. Amino acids important for catalytic activity and the metal binding ligands were found to be conserved between Drosophila AP-P and its mammalian homologues. The recombinant enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli hydrolyzed the amino terminal Xaa-Pro bond of substance P and bradykinin, revealing its functional identity. Further enzyme characterization showed the enzyme to be a manganese-dependent metallopeptidase. Immunoblot analysis showed that DAP-P is located exclusively in the cytosol and is temporally regulated during Drosophila development. In the adult fly, the protein could be detected in gut, testis and ovary, with a high level of expression in brain.
