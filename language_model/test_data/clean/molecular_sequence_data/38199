The human COX6A1 gene encodes the ubiquitous isoform of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit VIa (VIa-L), and is located in a CpG island on chromosome 12q24.2. We compared the COX6A1 gene with the published cDNA and several ESTs and concluded that subunit COX VIa-L is synthesized as a preprotein, as are other COX subunits. The same transcription start sites were identified by primer extension analysis of human brain and lymphoblastoid RNA. Analysis of the COX6A1 promoter revealed several conserved sequence elements found in other COX genes, namely binding sites for nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), nuclear respiratory factor 2/GA binding protein (NRF-2/GABP), and ying-yang protein 1 (YY1). These conserved elements were shown to bind nuclear proteins from HeLa nuclear extracts. COX6A1 cDNA was isolated from a human brain cDNA library, and the sequence was identical to that of human liver. The expression of this gene was demonstrated by in-situ hybridization in monkey brain sections with our human brain cDNA. Monocular impulse blockade in adult monkeys induced a downregulation of COX6A1 expression in deprived visual neurons, suggesting that this subunit gene is regulated by neuronal activity.
