Brome mosaic virus (BMV) purified from systemically infected barley leaves 8 weeks post-inoculation (p.i.) contained defective RNAs (D-RNAs). The D-RNAs were detected in total and virion RNAs extracted from infected plants at 8 weeks p.i. or later, but not before, when barley plants had been inoculated with virions either containing or lacking D-RNA. The D-RNAs were derived from genomic RNA3 by double or mainly single deletions in the 3a protein ORF, and formed a heterogeneous population. By using in vitro transcripts of D-RNA synthesized from full-length cDNA clones, the D-RNAs were shown to replicate in a helper virus-dependent manner and to be packaged into virions in barley protoplasts. Subgenomic RNA4 was produced from the D-RNA and the coat protein was also expressed. Existence of the D-RNAs together with BMV genomic RNAs in inoculated protoplasts decreased the accumulation of 3a protein but it had no apparent effect on the accumulation of BMV genomic RNA3 or the coat protein. This is the first report of naturally occurring D-RNAs generated during prolonged infection with BMV.
