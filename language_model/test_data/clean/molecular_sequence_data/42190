A database of DNA fingerprint profiles from permanently established human and animal cell lines was prepared with a computer program originally designed for numerical taxonomy of bacteria. Identifications of cell line DNA profiles were performed, both by the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and by band matching. Under the conditions used the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was consistently more reliable.
