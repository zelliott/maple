We have recently shown that atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) inhibits adenylate cyclase activity in rat platelets where only one population of ANF receptors (ANF-R2) is present, indicating that ANF-R2 receptors may be coupled to the adenylate cyclase/cAMP system. In the present studies, we have used ring-deleted peptides which have been reported to interact with ANF-R2 receptors also called clearance receptors (C-ANF) without affecting the guanylate cyclase/cGMP system, to examine if these peptides can also inhibit the adenylate cyclase/cAMP system. Ring-deleted analog C-ANF4-23 like ANF99-126 inhibited the adenylate cyclase activity in a concentration-dependent manner in rat aorta, brain striatum, anterior pituitary, and adrenal cortical membranes. The maximal inhibition was about 50-60% with an apparent Ki between 0.1 and 1 nM. In addition, C-ANF4-23 also decreased the cAMP levels in vascular smooth muscle cells in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting the cGMP levels. The maximal decrease observed was about 60% with an apparent Ki of about 1 nM. Furthermore, C-ANF4-23 was also able to inhibit cAMP levels and progesterone secretion stimulated by luteinizing hormone in MA-10 cell line. Other smaller fragments of ANF with ring deletions were also able to inhibit the adenylate cyclase activity as well as cAMP levels. Furthermore, the stimulatory effects of various agonists such as 5'-(N-ethyl)carboxamidoadenosine, dopamine, and forskolin on adenylate cyclase activity and cAMP levels were also significantly inhibited by C-ANF4-23. The inhibitory effect of C-ANF4-23 on adenylate cyclase was dependent on the presence of GTP and was attenuated by pertussis toxin treatment. These results indicate that ANF-R2 receptors or so-called C-ANF receptors are coupled to the adenylate cyclase/cAMP signal transduction system through inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein.
