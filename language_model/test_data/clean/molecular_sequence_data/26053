Genomic DNA sequence analysis was used to define the extent of deletions within the C1 inhibitor gene in two families with type I hereditary angioneurotic edema. Southern blot analysis initially indicated the presence of the partial deletions. One deletion was approximately 2 kb and included exon VII, whereas the other was approximately 8.5 kb and included exons IV-VI. Genomic libraries from an affected member of each family were constructed and clones containing the deletions were analyzed. Sequence analysis of the deletion joints of the mutants and corresponding regions of the normal gene in the two families demonstrated that both deletion joints resulted from recombination of two Alu repetitive DNA elements. Alu repeat sequences from introns VI and VII combined to make a novel Alu in family A, and Alu sequences in introns III and VI were spliced to make a new Alu in family B. The splice sites in the Alu sequences of both mutants were located in the left arm of the Alu element, and both recombination joints overlapped one of the RNA polymerase III promoter sequences. Because the involved Alu sequences, in both instances, were oriented in the same direction, unequal crossingover is the most likely mechanism to account for these mutations.
