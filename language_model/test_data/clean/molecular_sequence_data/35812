Using a radioimmunoassay against the C-terminal sequence Arg-Pro-NH2 (RPamide), we have isolated the peptide Leu-Pro-Pro-Gly-Pro-Leu-Pro-Arg-Pro-NH2 (Antho-RPamide) from an extract of the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. Antho-RPamide is located in neurons of sea anemones. Application of low concentrations of Antho-RPamide to tentacle preparations of sea anemones strongly increased the frequency and duration of spontaneous contractions, suggesting that this peptide is involved in neurotransmission. Antho-RPamide has a free N-terminus, yet its X-Pro-Pro sequence makes it relatively resistant to degradation by nonspecific aminopeptidases. Thus, we have discovered another strategy by which sea anemones protect the N-termini of their bioactive neuropeptides.
