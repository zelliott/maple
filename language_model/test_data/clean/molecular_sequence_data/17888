The platelet adhesion on adhesive protein-coated surfaces was significantly reduced by the addition of the synthetic tetrapeptide, RGDS (Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser), which was identified as the common amino acid sequence of adhesive site of adhesive proteins. The inhibitory effect was also observed for leukocyte(WBC) in complement-inactivated serum. No significant effect was observed for WBC in complement-activated serum. These indicate that the RGDS ligand-receptor mechanism operates on adhesive protein-adsorbed surfaces for both cellular systems and that activated complement factor (C3b)-membrane receptor (CR3) interaction operates for WBC as the complement is activated.
