Picornaviruses are mammalian plus-strand RNA viruses whose genomes serve as mRNA. A study of the structure and function of these viral mRNAs has revealed differences among them in events leading to the initiation of protein synthesis. A large segment of the 5' nontranslated region, approximately 400 nucleotides in length, promotes 'internal' entry of ribosomes independent of the non-capped 5' end of the mRNA. This segment, which we have called the internal ribosome entry site (IRES), maps approximately 200 nt down-stream from the 5' end and is highly structured. IRES elements of different picornaviruses, although functionally similar in vitro and in vivo, are not identical in sequence or structure. However, IRES elements of the genera entero- and rhinoviruses, on the one hand, and cardio- and aphthoviruses, on the other hand, reveal similarities corresponding to phylogenetic kinship. All IRES elements contain a conserved Yn-Xm-AUG unit (Y, pyrimidine; X, nucleotide) which appears essential for IRES function. The IRES elements of cardio-, entero- and aphthoviruses bind a cellular protein, p57. In the case of cardioviruses, the interaction between a specific stem-loop of the IREs is essential for translation in vitro. The IRES elements of entero- and cardioviruses also bind the cellular protein, p52, but the significance of this interaction remains to be shown. The function of p57 or p52 in cellular metabolism is unknown. Since picornaviral IRES elements function in vivo in the absence of any viral gene products, we speculate that IRES-like elements may also occur in specific cellular mRNAs releasing them from cap-dependent translation. IRES elements are useful tools in the construction of high yield expression vectors, or for tagging cellular genetic elements.
