Guinea pig gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gpGnRH) is predicted to have a unique structure among all known forms of GnRH molecule [Endocrinology 138 (1997) 4123] and it is of great interest to determine whether the unique structure of gpGnRH is manifested in the characteristics of the guinea pig GnRH receptor. In the present study, we isolated a full-length cDNA for a GnRH receptor from the pituitary gland of the guinea pig. The putative guinea pig GnRH receptor protein has an amino acid identity of 79-87% with mammalian type I GnRH receptors. The amino acid residues which have been demonstrated to be important for ligand binding and signal transduction were conserved in the guinea pig GnRH receptor. However, there are several specific amino acid substitutions among mammalian type I GnRH receptors. Moreover, though the guinea pig has generally been classified as a rodent, the putative GnRH receptor protein did not have some rodent-specific characteristics. Total IP assays demonstrated that the cloned guinea pig GnRH receptor is a functional GnRH receptor and that it shows different preference of ligand sensitivities from the rat GnRH receptor.
