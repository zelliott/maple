Lysosomal membrane glycoproteins carry targeting information in cytoplasmic regions. Two distinct targeting motifs in these regions, GY (glycine-tyrosine) and LI (leucine-isoleucine), have been identified and characterized. Accumulating evidence suggests that the adaptor complexes (AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3) recognize this information in cytoplasmic tails of transmembrane proteins. Here we report two different in vitro analyses (affinity beads and surface plasmon resonance) which revealed specific interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of LGP85 and AP-1 but not so with AP-2. We also noted requirement of the LI motif of the LGP85 tail in binding to the AP-1 complex. Our data and others which indicated the binding of AP-3 to the LIMP II (synonym of LGP85) tail suggest that the cytoplasmic tail of LGP85 interacts with AP-1 at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and AP-3 at late endosomes, respectively. We propose that this sequential interaction between the lysosomal targeting signal and distinct APs along its transport pathway is responsible for the critical sorting of lysosomal membrane proteins and/or the potential proofreading system of mistargeted molecules.
