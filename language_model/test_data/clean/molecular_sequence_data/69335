GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) modulate the activity of the ras superfamily of proteins by converting active GTP-bound to inactive GDP-bound p21s. Employing a novel GAP overlay assay (Manser, E., Leung, T., Monfries, C., Teo, M., Hall, C., and Lim, L. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 16025-16028), we demonstrated a diversity of proteins with GAP activities in different tissues. Using a polymerase chain reaction strategy exploiting conserved residues in the GAP domains of n-chimaerin and the product of the breakpoint cluster region gene (BCR), we isolated a human brain 5.3-kilobase cDNA containing a 486-base pair region with complete identity to a previously reported active BCR-related (ABR) gene sequence on human chromosome 17. The brain cDNA encoded a 98-kDa protein (ABR) resembling BCR (68% identity), containing both the oncogene dbl-related domain at the N terminus and the GAP domain at the C terminus; however, it lacks the N-terminal BCR protein kinase domain. The ABR GAP domain expressed as an Escherichia coli fusion protein was active against Rac1 and Cdc42 of the rho subfamily. The ABR mRNA is highly enriched in the brain. ABR probably corresponds to the brain-enriched 100-kDa GAP for Rac and Cdc42Hs previously detected. The relationship of ABR to Miller-Dieker syndrome, a neurological disorder co-mapping to 17p13.3, is discussed.
