The human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) strain ROD/B can efficiently use the 7tm chemokine receptor CXCR-4 as a primary receptor to enter CD4-negative cells. We have stably expressed CXCR-4 on mink lung Mv-1-lu and feline kidney CCC cells (normally restrictive to HIV entry) and have shown efficient fusion, entry, and replication of ROD/B. Mutation of the two N-linked glycosylation sites on CXCR-4 (N11-->I, and N176-->Q) or pretreatment of CCC or Mv-1-lu cells expressing wild-type CXCR-4 with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin increased fusion and entry by ROD/B. Deletion of portions of the N terminus of CXCR-4 resulted in a 3- to 10-fold decrease in cell-free infection by ROD/B and complete inhibition of cell-cell fusion by both ROD/B and another HIV-2 strain, CBL23. These data suggest that the N-terminal domain of CXCR-4 is involved in but is not essential for the efficient fusion of ROD/B with CD4-negative cells. Deletion of the C-terminal (intracellular) domain of CXCR-4 did not significantly affect entry by ROD/B, indicating that intracellular signalling through this domain does not play a significant role in entry by HIV-2.
