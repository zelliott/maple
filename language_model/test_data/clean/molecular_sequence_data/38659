As a step toward understanding of the role of adenylate kinase (AK) in energy metabolism, we analyzed this enzyme in Drosophila melanogaster. The enzyme activities of all three AK isozymes were determined in cell-free extracts of flies, and their proteins were detected by Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies against the mammalian isozymes. A cDNA encoding adenylate kinase was isolated from D. melanogaster cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a 240-amino acid protein, which shows high similarity to bovine, human and rat AK2, and hence was named DAK2. Preliminary subcellular fractionation analysis indicated that DAK2 is localized in both cytoplasm and mitochondria. In situ hybridization to salivary gland polytene chromosomes revealed that the Dak2 gene is located at 60B on the right arm of the second chromosome.
