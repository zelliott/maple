Soybean lipoxygenase-3 has been crystallized by the vapor diffusion method in 16-20% polyethylene glycol (average M(r), 3,400), 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.7, at 21 degrees C, at a protein concentration of 8-15 mg/mL. The crystals, which diffract to 3-A spacings, belong to the monoclinic space group C2. Cell constants are a = 111.9, b = 136.4, and c = 61.6 A and beta = 95.7 degrees. The calculated value of Matthews's constant, Vm = 2.48 A3/kDa, is consistent with the presence of one molecule of lipoxygenase per crystallographic asymmetric unit (Z = 4).
