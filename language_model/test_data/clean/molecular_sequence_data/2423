Antigenic peptides are presented to T lymphocytes by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. The binding of peptides to MHC class II molecules has been demonstrated directly, and is found to correlate with the ability of specific class II alleles to restrict the T-cell response to specific peptides. By comparison, a direct demonstration of a physical association between antigenic peptides and MHC class I molecules has proved difficult. A recent report shows that it is possible, however, and the three-dimensional structure of a class I MHC molecule illustrates the site where such binding must occur. Here we describe a simple assay which measures the binding of radiolabelled MHC class I molecules to peptides bound to a solid phase support. We find that class I molecules bind specifically to peptides known to be antigenic for class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Peptides which are recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes bind not only to the restricting MHC class I molecule but also to other class I molecules. Our results suggest that quantitative differences in the peptide/MHC class I interaction may influence the-pattern of MHC restriction observed in vivo.
