We report here the complete nucleotide sequence of the 30.9-kb mitochondrial genome of the dermatophyte fungus Epidermophyton floccosum. All genes are encoded on the same DNA strand and include seven subunits of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ubiquinone oxireductase (nad1, nad2, nad3, nad4, nad4L, nad5, and nad6), three subunits of cytochrome oxidase (cox1, cox2, and cox3), apocytochrome b (cob), three subunits of ATP synthase (atp6, atp8, and atp9), the small and large ribosomal RNAs (rns and rnl), and 25 tRNAs. A ribosomal protein gene (rps5) is present as an intronic ORF in the large ribosomal subunit. The genes coding for cob and cox1 carry one intron and nad5 carries two introns with ORFs. The mtDNA of E. floccosum has the same gene order as Trichophyton rubrum mtDNA, with the exception of some tRNA genes. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis confirms T. rubrum as a close relative of E. floccosum. This is the first complete mitochondrial sequence of a species of the order Onygenales. This sequence is available under GenBank accession number AY916130.
