We searched for HPV DNA in 72 cases of seborrheic keratosis (nongenital SK 29, genital SK 43) using polymerase chain reaction. Amplification of HPV DNA was found in 24 (nongenital, 1; genital, 23). HPV DNA type 6 was present in 18 cases and type 11 in four and type 33 in two. Twenty-three (53%) cases of genital region SK and one (3%) case of nongenital region SK contained HPV DNA sequences. Histopathologically, the perinuclear vacuolization of epithelial cells, mitosis and dyskeratotic cells were more marked in HPV DNA-positive SK than those in negative SK (P < 0.01). We suppose HPV may play an important role in epidermal proliferation of SK in the genital region.
