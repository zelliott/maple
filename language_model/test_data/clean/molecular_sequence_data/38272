We have cloned a Caenorhabditis elegans cDNA encoding a Delta12 fatty acid desaturase and demonstrated its activity by heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The predicted protein is highly homologous both to the cloned plant genes with similar function and to the published sequence of the C. elegans omega-3 fatty acid desaturase. In addition, it conforms to the structural constraints expected of a membrane-bound fatty acid desaturase including the canonical histidine-rich regions. This is the first report of a cloned animal Delta(12) desaturase gene. Expression of this cDNA in yeast resulted in the accumulation of 16:2 and 18:2 (linoleic) acids. The increase of membrane fluidity brought about by this change in unsaturation was measured. The production of polyunsaturated fatty acids in yeast cells and the concomitant increase in membrane fluidity was correlated with a modest increase in growth rate at low temperature and with increased resistance to ethanol and oxidative stress.
