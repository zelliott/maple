The main stream of biology today is the analysis of the molecular mechanisms of major biological phenomena through studies of the genes governing these processes and their protein products. An example is the problem of tumor metastasis which is extremely important both theoretically and practically. Here we describe the data obtained on the detection, cloning, structure and transcription control of the mts1 gene, that encodes metastasin 1, a protein which seems to play an important role in the control of metastasis in mouse tumors. In particular, the experiments on tumor cell transfection with constructions containing either a sense or antisense mts1 sequence under a strong promoter/enhancer element show the direct dependence of the metastatic phenotype on the expression of the mts1 gene at least in some systems. Gene mts1 encodes a protein belonging to the family of Ca(2+)-binding proteins and may be involved in the control of cell motility in different types of cells, such as macrophages and T-lymphocytes. The relationship between mts1 and other genes up- and down-regulated in metastatic cells is discussed.
