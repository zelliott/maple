The nucleotide sequence of the Azotobacter vinelandii nifL-like gene (Av-nifL) was determined. The 1.9 kb sequence shows an open reading frame (ORF) of 1577 bp which encodes a polypeptide of 519 amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of 57,793. Av-nifL has about 50% homology with the Klebsiella pneumoniae nifL gene (Kp-nifL) at the nucleotide level and a little more than 52% homology at the amino acid level. The N-terminal regions show more homology than the C-terminal regions. As is the case in K. pneumoniae, Av-nifL is located just upstream of the A. vinelandii nifA gene (Av-nifA) and both genes constitute an operon. The expression of Av-nifL, however, seems to be independent of NtrA and NtrC. Furthermore, Av-nifL expression is not autogenously regulated by NifA, unlike the case in K. pneumoniae. The expression of an Av-nifL::lacZ fusion in A. vinelandii is inhibited by novobiocin and coumermycin A, which are inhibitors of DNA gyrase.
