We report the isolation and characterization of a new bacteriocin, thuricin S, produced by the Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. entomocidus HD198 strain. This antibacterial activity is sensitive to proteinase K, is heat-stable, and is stable at a variety of pH values (3-10.5). The monoisotopic mass of thuricin S purified by high performance liquid chromatography, as determined with mass spectrometry ESI-TOF-MS, is 3137.61 Da. Edman sequencing and NanoESI-MS/MS experiments provided the sequence of the 18 N-terminal amino acids. Interestingly, thuricin S has the same N-terminal sequence (DWTXWSXL) as bacthuricin F4 and thuricin 17, produced by B. thuringiensis strains BUPM4 and NEB17, respectively, and could therefore be classified as a new subclass IId bacteriocin.
