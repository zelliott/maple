Two chemical assays have been developed for identifying and quantifying peptides which either could be biologically active by virtue of their alpha-carboxamidation or could be substrates for peptidylglycine alpha-amidating mono-oxygenase. The first assay is specific for the alpha-carboxamide of peptides. Using bis[trifluoroacetoxy]iodobenzene, the alpha-carboxamide was converted via a Hoffman reaction into a primary amine, which was then quantified by ninhydrin. The second assay is specific for glycine at the carboxy-terminus of a peptide. Glycine at the carboxy-terminus was derivatized to form 2-thiohydantoin, which was then separated and quantified by reverse phase HPLC. These assays were used to detect peptides in HPLC-separated extracts of bovine hypothalamus, bovine anterior lobe pituitary and porcine heart which may be of biological interest.
