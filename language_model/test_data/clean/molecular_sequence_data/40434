Two linear plasmids, pNSL1 and pNSL1, were detected from Rhodocuccus sp. NS1.

Cloning, sequencing and identification of replication origin of the Rhodococcus linear plasmid pNSL1.

Large amount of linear plasmid DNA was recovered from pulsed-field gels for shotgun-cloning and sequencing, and identification of its replication locus.

The complete nucleotide sequence of pNSL1 consisted of 117252 bp, including the conserved 1282-bp telomere sequences among Rhodococcus linear plasmids. pNSL1 encoded 103 open reading frames, including functions of replication, maintenance and transfer etc. A locus, pNSL1. 038 and upstream 767-bp non-coding sequence, was identified for autonomous replication by cloning in an E. coli vector and introduced by electroporation into Nocardia coralline 4. 1037.
