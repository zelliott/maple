A repetitive region of Plasmodium berghei merozoite surface protein-1 (PbMSP-1) was expressed as a fusion protein with either maltose binding protein or the B subunit of heat-labile enterotoxin from Escherichia coli. Vaccination of mice with the fusion proteins indicates that this region of PbMSP-1 is antigenic as evidenced by an antibody response. The fusion proteins were also expressed in Salmonella and mice were orally immunized with the recombinant Salmonella. Some of the vaccinated mice survived a challenge with P. berghei blood-stage parasites without developing parasitemia. All control mice became patent and succumbed to the challenge infection. This partial protection was also observed with purified recombinant protein and was independent of the adjuvant used. Mice immunized with recombinant Salmonella showed either extremely low or no antibody response to PbMSP-1, suggesting that cell-mediated immunity is important for the observed protection. These studies show that it is feasible to develop a cost effective oral vaccine against the blood stage of the malarial parasite.
