We isolated a cDNA for p20K, a secreted protein preferentially synthesized in nonproliferating cells. p20K mRNA and protein levels declined rapidly following treatment with various mitogens. DNA sequence analysis of the p20K cDNA predicted a novel protein distantly related to alpha 2 mu-globulin and plasma retinol-binding protein.
