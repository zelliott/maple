Four clones of cDNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase [EC 4.1.1.31] were obtained from a maize green leaf cDNA library by colony hybridization. The largest cDNA was of full-length (3335 nucleotides), being 243 nucleotides longer than the cDNA cloned previously [(1986) Nucleic Acids Res. 14, 1615-1628]. Alignment of the sequence for the N-terminal coding region found in two of the four clones with the sequence reported previously, established the sequence of the entire coding region for the enzyme. The sequencing of 3'-untranslated region of the clones revealed that the poly(A) tract is attached at multiple sites in vivo.
