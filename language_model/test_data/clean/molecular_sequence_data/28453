The binding of basic amphipathic fluorescent peptides to lipid bilayers was studied in relation to their antimicrobial activity. Four fluorescent peptides containing pyrenylalanine or tryptophan in an amphipathic basic peptide (4(4] consisting of four repeated units of tetrapeptide, -L-Leu-L-Ala-L-Arg-L-Leu-, were found to have antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive bacteria and to take conformations with fairly high alpha-helical content both in aqueous solutions and liposomes. The fluorescence spectroscopic data suggested that the pyrenylalanine-peptide existed as a monomer in methanol or liposomes but as an oligomer in aqueous solutions to form an excimer between pyrenylalanyl residues. Upon binding with liposomes, the fluorescence spectra of the tryptophan-containing peptide shifted to a shorter wavelength, indicating the change in the state of tryptophan from hydrophilic environment to hydrophobic one. The analytical data for the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by I- anion suggest that the tryptophan residue in the peptide is not deeply buried in the hydrophobic core of the bilayers. Based on these findings, it is suggested that the peptides may interact with liposomes in such a manner that they lie parallel to the surface of the lipid bilayers with their hydrophobic regions shallowly in the amphipathic moiety of the bilayers.
