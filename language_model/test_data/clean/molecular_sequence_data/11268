The expression of the tobacco retrotransposon Tnt1 is induced by wounding, pathogen infections as well as microbial elicitors and abiotic factors known to induce the plant defence response. We report here that the LTR U3 region is sufficient to mediate transcriptional activation by biotic and abiotic elicitors in stable transgenic conditions. We have used in vivo footprinting techniques in order to analyse the cis-regulatory elements of the LTR U3 region that mediate the induction of Tnt1 expression. Our results indicate that a tandemly repeated short element, named BII box, is involved in the transcriptional activation of the tobacco retrotransposon Tnt1 in association with the plant defence signaling cascade.
