The mass spectrometric strategy including three steps is presented for primary structure determination of the N-terminally blocked peptides. First, the C-terminal sequencing is performed by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry coupled with carboxypeptidase Y digestion. Then, the peptide is cleaved according to the obtained C-terminal sequence information and the resulting peptides are identified by mass spectrometry and Edman degradation after fractionation by reverse-phase chromatography. Finally, the N-terminal fragment is sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry. The strategy was successfully applied to the sequence determination of two novel N-terminally blocked peptides named EAFP1 and EAFP2.
