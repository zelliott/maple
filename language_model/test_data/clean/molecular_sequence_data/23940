Morniga M is a jacalin-related and mannose-specific lectin isolated from the bark of the mulberry (Morus nigra). In order to understand the function and application of this novel lectin, the binding property of Morniga M was studied in detail using an enzyme-linked lectinosorbent assay and lectin-glycan inhibition assay with extended glycan/ligand collection. From the results, it was found that the di-, tri-, and oligomannosyl structural units of N-glycans such as those of the bovine alpha1-acid glycoprotein (gp) and lactoferrin were the most active gps, but not the O-glycans or polysaccharides including mannan from yeast. The binding affinity of Morniga M for ligands can be ranked in decreasing order as follows: gps carrying multiple N-glycans with oligomannosyl residues >> N-glycopeptide with a single trimannosyl core > Tri-Man oligomer [Man alpha1-->6(Man alpha1-->3) Man], Penta-Man oligomer [Man alpha1-->6(Man alpha1-->3)Man alpha1-->6(Man alpha1-->3) Man] > or = Man alpha1-->2, 3 or 6 Man > Man > GlcNAc, Glc >> L-Fuc, Gal, GalNAc (inactive), demonstrating the unique specificity of this lectin that may not only assist in our understanding of cell surface carbohydrate ligand-lectin recognition, but also provide informative guidelines for the application of this structural probe in biotechnological and clinical regimens, especially in the detection and purification of N-linked glycans.
