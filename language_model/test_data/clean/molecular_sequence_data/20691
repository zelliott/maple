Fostriecin and cytostatin are structurally related natural inhibitors of serine/threonine phosphatases, with promising antitumor activity. The total synthesis of these antitumor agents has enabled the production of structural analogs, which are useful to explore the biological significance of features contained in the parent compounds. Here, the inhibitory activity of fostriecin, cytostatin, and 10 key structural analogs were tested in side-by-side phosphatase assays to further characterize their inhibitory activity against PP1c (Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit), PP2Ac (Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit), PP5c (Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 5 catalytic subunit), and chimeras of PP1 (Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 1) and PP5 (Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 5), in which key residues predicted for inhibitor contact with PP2A (Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2A) were introduced into PP1 and PP5 using site-directed mutagenesis. The data confirm the importance of the C9-phosphate and C11-alcohol for general inhibition and further demonstrate the importance of a predicted C3 interaction with a unique cysteine (Cys(269)) in the beta12-beta13 loop of PP2A. The data also indicate that additional features beyond the unsaturated lactone contribute to inhibitory potency and selectivity. Notably, a derivative of fostriecin lacking the entire lactone subunit demonstrated marked potency and selectivity for PP2A, while having substantially reduced and similar activity against PP1 and PP1/PP2A- PP5/PP2A-chimeras that have greatly increased sensitivity to both fostriecin and cytostatin. This suggests that other features [e.g., the (Z,Z,E)-triene] also contribute to inhibitory selectivity. When considered together with previous data, these studies suggest that, despite the high structural conservation of the catalytic site in PP1, PP2A and PP5, the development of highly selective catalytic inhibitors should be feasible.
