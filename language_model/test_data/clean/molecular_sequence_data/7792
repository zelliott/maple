A cDNA encoding rat mast cell tryptase (rMCT) was successfully cloned, and sequenced, from peritoneal cells of Lewis rats infected with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends methods. The cDNA was 1,097 base-pairs long, and included 822 base-pairs of an open reading frame. As judged from the deduced amino acid sequence, rMCT is highly homologous to mouse mast cell protease-6, and is considered to be translated as a prepro-enzyme with a 19-amino acid signal peptide, a 10-amino acid activation peptide, and a 245-amino acid mature enzyme. The rMCT mRNA was not detected in peritoneal cells of mast cell-deficient Ws/Ws rats, though it was strongly detected in ones of littermate +/+ and Lewis rats. In addition to in peritoneal mast cells, the rMCT mRNA was detected in the tongue. However, mRNA signals were not detected in the small intestine regardless of N. brasiliensis infection. Nor were mRNA signals detected in RBL2H3 rat basophilic leukemia cells. In the lung, the rMCT mRNA was strongly detected after infection with N. brasiliensis, though it was only faintly detected before infection. These results suggest that the rMCT is basically specific for connective tissue mast cells, but not for mucosal mast cells and that it is up-regulated in the lung during the inflammatory process of a parasitic infection.
