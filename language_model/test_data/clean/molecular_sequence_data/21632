N-Glycosylation is normally a co-translational process that occurs as soon as a nascent and unfolded polypeptide chain has emerged ~12 residues into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we describe the efficient utilization of an N-glycosylation site engineered within the luminal extreme C-terminal residues of distinct integral membrane glycoproteins, a native ER resident protein and an engineered secreted protein. This N-glycan addition required that the acceptor asparagine within an Asn-Trp-Ser sequon be located at least four residues away from the C-terminus of the polypeptide and, in the case of membrane proteins, at least 13 residues away from the lumenal side of the transmembrane segment. Pulse-chase assays revealed that the natural N-glycans of the proteins studied were attached co-translationally, whereas C-terminal N-glycosylation occurred post-translocationally within a time frame of hours in Xenopus laevis oocytes and minutes in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. In oocyte and HEK cell expression systems, affinity tag-driven C-terminal N-glycosylation may facilitate the determination of orientation of the C-terminal tail of membrane proteins relative to the membrane.
