The chemical structure of the phosphorylated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Escherichia coli J-5 was investigated because it is of biomedical interest in the context of septic shock, a syndrome often encountered in nosocomial infections with gram-negative pathogens. The successive de-O-acylation and de-N-acylation of J-5 LPS yielded phosphorylated oligosaccharides which represent the complete carbohydrate backbone. Five compounds were separated by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography and analysed by one-dimensional and two-dimensional homonuclear and heteronuclear 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and 31P-NMR spectroscopy. The main product was a nonasaccharide of the structure alpha-D-Glcp-(1-->3)-[alpha-D-GlcpN- (1-->7)-alpha-L,D-Hepp-(1-->7)]-alpha-L,D-Hepp-(1-->3)-alpha -L, D-Hepp-4P-(1-->5)-[alpha-Kdop-(2-->4)]-alpha-Kdop-(2-- >6)-beta-D-GlcpN-4p- (1-->6)-alpha-D-GlcN-1P wherein all sugars are present as D-pyranoses. Hep and Kdo represent L-glycero-D-manno-heptose and 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid, respectively. In addition, two octasaccharides and two heptasaccharides were isolated that were partial structures of the nonasaccharide. In one octasaccharide the terminal alpha-D-GlcpN was missing and an additional phosphate group linked to O4 of the branched heptose was present, whereas in the other octasaccharide the side-chain Kdo was missing. In both heptasaccharides the side-chain alpha-D-GlcpN-(1-->7)-L-alpha-D-Hepp-disaccharide was absent; they differed in their phosphate substitution. Whereas both heptasaccharides contained two phosphates in the lipid-A backbone (beta-1,6-linked GlcpN-disaccharide at the reducing end) and one phosphate group at O4 of the first heptose, only one of them was additionally substituted with phosphate at O4 of the second heptose.
