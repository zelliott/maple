The enteroviruses (EV), RNA viruses belonging to the Picornaviridae family, have a high genetic variability due to the absence of the efficient proofreading and post replicative repair activities associated with the RNA polymerase. In the present work, we studied the genetic and the antigenic variability of ECHO virus types 11 (E11) and 30 (E30), which are the most isolated echoviruses serotypes in clinical and environmental samples. We established on the 3' end of the VP1 gene, consensus sequences of E11 and E30 by alignment of 67 E11 and 247 E30 published sequences in GenBank. Our results of sequences comparison showed that the majority of the mutational sites are situated on the third nucleotide of the codon. These mutations were without consequence on the antigenic sequences of the VP1 protein. Thus, E11 and E30 have a high genetic variability (1/3 of the nucleotides are variable), but a relative antigenic conservation. The analysis of the intertypic antigenic variability between E11 and E30 was obtained by the alignment of the corresponding amino acids sequences relative to the N-terminal part of the VP1 protein. Two discriminating parts were highlighted, probably representing antigenic sites for neutralisation antibodies.
