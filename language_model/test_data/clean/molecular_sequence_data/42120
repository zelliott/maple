Endothelin acts via specific membrane-bound receptors through signal transduction pathways that include increases in intracellular free calcium and inositol triphosphate generation. Two endothelin receptors have been cloned. The ETA receptor is ET-1 selective, and the ETB receptor is isopeptide nonselective. Both receptor subtypes are widely distributed throughout the body, although ETA receptors predominate in vascular smooth muscle, whereas ETB receptors predominate in the brain. The presence of mixed receptor subtypes makes functional screening of subtype-specific analogues difficult. A eukaryotic expression vector was constructed by inserting the cloned coding region of the human ETB receptor downstream from the Rous sarcoma promoter. COS-7 cells were transfected with this construct, and cell lines were isolated with stably integrated copies of the relevant gene. One line, 1C7, was shown to specifically bind 125I-ET-1. Scatchard analysis indicated a Kd value of 8.8 pM and a Bmax value of 1.02 pM/mg. ET-1 stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in a dose-dependent manner, as did ET-3, sarafotoxin 6c, and [1,3,13,15Ala]ET-1, whereas BQ123, a selective ETA receptor antagonist, did not inhibit the action of ET-1. The transfected receptor stimulates phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis via a pertussis-sensitive pathway. Pretreatment of the membrane from 1C7 cells with dithio-bis-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) a negatively charged, nonpenetrating agent capable of oxidizing sulfhydryl groups, and N-ethyl-maleimide (NEM), a penetrating agent that causes irreversible alkylation of sulfhydryl groups, significantly reduces Bmax but has no effect on Kd. In whole cells, DTNB pretreatment abolishes the ability of ET-1 to stimulate PI hydrolysis.
