A Gram-positive bacterial strain, 3.1.1T, was isolated from traditional pickle in Heilongjiang Province, China. The bacterium was characterized by a polyphasic approach, including 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, pheS gene sequence analysis, rpoA gene sequence analysis, dnaK gene sequence analysis, fatty acid methyl ester analysis, determination of DNA G+C content, DNA-DNA hybridization and an analysis of phenotypic features. Based upon the data obtained in the present study, a novel species, Lactobacillus xiangfangensis sp. nov., is proposed with the type strain 3.1.1T (=LMG 26013T=NCIMB 14687T).
