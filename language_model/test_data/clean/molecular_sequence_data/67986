Primer extension analyses and a PCR-based cloning strategy were used to identify and characterize 5' nucleotide sequences on the maize stripe virus (MStV) RNA4 mRNA transcripts encoding the major noncapsid protein (NCP). Direct RNA sequence analysis by primer extension showed that the NCP mRNA transcripts had 10-15 nucleotides beyond the 5' terminus of the MStV RNA4 nucleotide sequence. MStV genomic RNAs isolated from ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) lacked the additional 5' nucleotides. cDNA clones representing the 5' region of the mRNA transcripts were constructed, and the nucleotide sequences of the 5' regions were determined for 16 clones. Each was found to have a distinct 10-15 nucleotide sequence immediately 5' of the MStV RNA4 sequence. Eleven of 16 clones had the correct MStV RNA4 5' nucleotide sequence, while five showed minor variations at or near the 5' most MStV RNA4 nucleotide. These characteristics show strong similarities to other viral mRNA transcripts which are synthesized by cap snatching.
