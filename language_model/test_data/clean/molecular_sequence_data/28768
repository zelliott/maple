Nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) is a highly conserved trimeric activator that recognizes with high specificity and affinity the widespread CCAAT box promoter element. We previously cloned the genes of 23 NF-Y genes of Arabidopsis thaliana (Gene 264 (2001) 173). Now that the Arabidopsis genome sequencing project is complete, we present the cloning, alignments and expression profiles of the remaining six genes coding for the three NF-Y subunits. Consistent with our previous reports, most of the new members of the three subunits show a unique tissue-specific pattern, while another AtNF-YC9 is rather ubiquitous.
