A genetic engineering approach was made to generate a recombinant non-segmented negative-strand RNA virus, Sendai virus (SeV) of the family Paramyxoviridae, that expresses firefly luciferase. The DNA construct containing the entire open reading frame (ORF) of the luciferase gene followed by the SeV transcription stop and restart signals connected with the conserved intergenic three nucleotides was inserted immediately before the ORF of the viral 3'-proximal nucleocapsid (N) protein gene in a full-length SeV cDNA copy. After intracellular expression of full-length antigenomic transcripts from the engineered cDNA and of the viral n ucleocapsid protein and RNA polymerase from the respective plasmids, a recombinant SeV expressing luciferase activity at a high level was recovered, although the tendency of this particular reporter gene product to aggregate in cells made it difficult to estimate the maximum level of expression. The increase in genome length brought about by inserting 1728 nucleotides into the 15,384 nucleotide parental SeV was associated with reduced plaque size, slightly slower replication kinetics and a severalfold decrease in yield of the virus. The inserted luciferase gene was stably maintained after numerous rounds of replication by serial passages in chick embryos. These results indicate the potential utility of SeV as a novel expression vector.
