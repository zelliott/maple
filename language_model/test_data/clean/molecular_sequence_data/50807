We have examined the expression of growth factor genes in primary cultures of chicken adipocyte precursors. RNA was extracted from proliferating and differentiated cells, reversed transcribed and amplified by PCR using gene specific primers. The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by restriction mapping. We show, for the first time, constitutive expression of TGF-beta 2, TGF-beta 3, TGF-beta 4 and bFGF genes in chicken adipocyte precursors. We also detect GH-independent, but differentiation-dependent IGF-I gene expression. The synthesis and action of these growth factors supports the hypothesis that they act as autocrine and/or paracrine regulators of adipocyte precursor cell proliferation and differentiation.
