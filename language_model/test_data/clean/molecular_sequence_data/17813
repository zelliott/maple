The determinant for the peptide sex pheromone inhibitor iAD1 (iad) on the hemolysin/bacteriocin plasmid pAD1 of Enterococcus faecalis was sequenced. The sequence reveals a 22-amino-acid precursor with the carboxyl-terminal 8 residues corresponding to iAD1. It appears that iAD1 is a component of its own signal sequence.
