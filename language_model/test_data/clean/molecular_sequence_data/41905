Satellite DNA from wild beet species was separated from restriction endonuclease digested genomic DNA by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two nonhomologous HaeIII satellite DNA repeats were cloned from the wild beet Beta trigyna. The type I repeat is 140-149 bp long and AT rich, while the type II is 162 bp in size and GC rich. A third repetitive HaeIII element cloned from the related wild beet B. corolliflora was shown to be organized as a HinfI satellite DNA family in the cultivated beet B. vulgaris ssp. vulgaris and the wild beet B. vulgaris ssp. maritima. This type III satellite monomer is 149 bp long and contains a high number of short direct subrepeats. The monomer was found in different genomic organizations and copy numbers in all sections of the genus Beta indicating an amplification early in the phylogeny. The HaeIII repeats from B. trigyna are characterized by a lower variability and form long tandem arrays in the genomes of Corollinae species. The investigation of the distribution of all three sequence families provided data that may contribute to the solution of taxonomic problems of the genus Beta and be useful in the characterization of hybrids and derived lines with alien wild beet chromosomes.
