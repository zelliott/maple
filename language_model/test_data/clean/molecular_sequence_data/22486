Peptide agonists and antagonists of the human gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRH-R) are widely used to treat a range of reproductive hormone related diseases. Recently, nonpeptide, orally available GnRH-R antagonists have emerged from several chemical classes. To understand how a relatively large peptide-binding pocket can recognize numerous nonpeptide ligands, we undertook a systematic mapping of GnRH-R residues involved in the binding of three nonpeptide antagonists. A region composed of the extracellular portions of transmembrane helices 6 and 7, extracellular loop 3, and the N-terminal domain significantly contributed to nonpeptide antagonist binding. However, each molecule was affected by a different subset of residues in these regions, indicating that each appears to occupy distinct, partially overlapping subregions within the more extensive peptide-binding pocket. Moreover, the resulting receptor interaction maps provide a basis to begin to reconcile structure-activity relationships between various nonpeptide and peptide series and facilitate the design of improved therapeutic agents.
