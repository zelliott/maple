Using a phage-displayed peptide library, we have identified the epitope recognized by a new panel of five monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against full-length recombinant human lamin A. The mAbs were found to recognize both lamin A and C by Western blotting and immunolocalization at the nuclear rim. A nine-amino acid consensus sequence PLLTYRFPP in the common immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domain of lamin A/C contains the binding site for all five mAbs. Three-dimensional structure of the Ig-like domain of lamin A/C shows this sequence is a complete beta-strand. This sequence includes arginine-482 (R482) which is mutated in most cases of Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD). R482 may be part of an interaction site on the surface of lamin A/C for lamin-binding proteins associated with lipodystrophy.
