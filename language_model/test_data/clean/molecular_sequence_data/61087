Invertebrate cells lack the p53 recombination checkpoint but contain mobile DNA sequences that transpose by a mechanism in part shared with excision of the V(D)J recombination signal sequences (RSS). In this work, inversion, deletion, and duplication of sequences associated with an invertebrate C. elegans Tc6 element is described. The structure of this C. elegans sequence and other dispersed Tc6 elements suggests that covalently closed 'hairpin' structures are not unique to excision of the V(D)J RSS by the RAG proteins, but rather can be generated by transposases at transposon termini leading to characteristic inversion and duplication events. Comparative analysis of recombination events at invertebrate sequences resembling the vertebrate V(D)J RSS may be useful in understanding V(D)J recombination-mediated recombination events in malignant vertebrate cells or genetic diseases such as ataxia telangectasia, in which the p53 recombination checkpoint is defective.
