Proteomic approach is applied for the analysis of seed brans of 14 rice varieties (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica) which can classify to five aromatic rice and nine nonaromatic rice. The two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) protein patterns for 14 rice varieties were similar within pH ranges of 3-10 and 4-7. To characterize aromatic group-specific proteins, we compared 2-D gels of aromatic rice to nonaromatic rice using PDQUEST image analysis. Four out of six differential spots were identified as hypothetical proteins, but one (SSP 7003) was identified by matrix assisted laser desoption/ionization-quardrupole-time of fight (MALDI-Q-TOF) as prolamin with three matching peptides based on NCBI database. Prolamin is a class of storage proteins with three different polypeptides of 10, 13, and 16 kDa. Spot SSP7003 was identified as a 13 kDa polypeptide of prolamin by combination of mass spectroscopy and N-terminal sequence analyses. In contrast, one sulfur-rich 16 kDa polypeptide of prolamin was found in extremely high intensity in brans of deep-water rice compared to nondeep-water rice. Our results suggest that proteomics is a powerful step to open the way for the identification of rice varieties.
