The cloning, sequencing and expression of the gene encoding the 36-kilodalton (kDa) outer membrane protein of Rhizobium leguminosarum has been recently described in the literature (De Maagd RA et al (1992) J Bacteriol 174, 214-221). We present evidence that this protein is a porin from a sub-type covalently bound to the peptidoglycan.
