Due to their high sequence diversity even among closely related species, satellite DNA sequences can be a useful molecular marker for phylogenetic and taxonomic analyses. To characterize the satellite DNA in the genome of a native muntjac species of Taiwan, the Formosan muntjac, satellite DNA clones representing three different cervid satellite DNA families from this species were isolated and analyzed. Genomic organization study of these satellite DNAs was also undertaken. Three Formosan muntjac satellite DNA clones were obtained and designated as FM-satI (1,391 bp), FM-satII (1,143 bp) and FM-satIV (1,103 bp), and found to share approximately 82, 81 and 98% sequence homology with the Chinese muntjac satellite I clone (C5), Indian muntjac satellite II clone (Mmv-0.7) and Chinese muntjac satellite IV clone (MR-1.0), respectively. These three satellite DNA families are organized in a pter<--FM-satII-FM-satIV-FM-satI-->qter orientation in the centromeric region with satII closely associated with the telomeric sequences. Satellite DNA sequence comparison, in combination with chromosome data concludes that the Formosan muntjac is likely a subspecies of M. reevesi, closely related to the Chinese muntjac. With the kinetochore satellite II DNA co-localizing with the telomeric sequences, the Formosan muntjac chromosomes could be truly telocentric.
