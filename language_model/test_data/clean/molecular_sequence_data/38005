Raw and smoked samples of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were identified using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of the p53 gene. DNA from S. salar and 0. mykiss was amplified by using primers flanking exons 5 to 6 of the p53 nuclear gene. PCR products of different length were obtained for each species (532 and 518 base pairs, respectively). Sequences of PCR products obtained from S. salar and O. mykiss were compared in the search for polymorphic restriction sites. The restriction fragments obtained with Eco RV, Hinf I, and Taq I endonucleases showed interspecific polymorphism, making it a useful method for identification of Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout.
