The vast quantities of publicly available DNA sequencing data and genome resources are enabling biologists to investigate age-old problems in biology that were not addressable previously. In this review, we discuss how comparative genomics is practiced and how the data can be used to make biological inferences with respect to vertebrate evolution and development. Examples are taken from the well-known HOX clusters, which are always a high-priority target for genomic analyses due to their inferred role in the evolution of metazoans. In addition, we briefly discuss the application of genomic approaches to problems in comparative endocrinology.
