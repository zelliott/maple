Upon modification of neurotoxin RTX-III at amino groups with [3H]acetic anhydride, four monoacetyl and four diacetyl derivatives have been obtained. Acetylation of the N-terminal amino group led to 12-fold decrease of toxicity in mice. Monoderivatives of the toxin with either Lys or two out of three C-terminal Lys residues modified showed a 2-fold drop in toxicity as compared with the native RTX-III. Diacetylation caused a 30 to 35-fold decrease in toxicity, the N-terminal amino group being modified in all the derivatives. As assessed by circular dichroism method, the modification of amino groups, except for N-terminal one, affected secondary structure of the toxin. The data suggest the N-terminal amino group to be essential for toxicity of RTX-III.
