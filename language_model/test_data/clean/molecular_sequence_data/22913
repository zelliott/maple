In spite of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination, HBV infection remains an important public health problem worldwide. Although the HBV genotype distribution has been determined in some parts of South Central Asia, no survey has been conducted to determine the HBV genotype in Afghanistan. Twelve Afghan patients infected with HBV living in Afghanistan were enrolled in this study. Partial HBsAg and basic core promoter, precore, and core (BCP/preC/C) regions were amplified and subjected for direct sequencing. In parallel, precore G1896A mutation was also determined by an amplification-created restriction site method. Results revealed HBV genotype D (95% bootstrap value), sub-genotype D1 (98% bootstrap value), and subtype ayw2 in all Afghan isolates. Afghan isolates clustered in a separate branch in the D1 sub-genotype called D1', while supported by 82% bootstrap value. The percentage of intra-genotypic distance among Afghan isolates was 1.05% and inter-genotypic distance with the other genotype D was 2.87% and with other genotypes was 7.50%-11.1%. The wild-type, mixed infection, and precore mutant were found in six, two, and four HBV isolates, respectively. The A1762T/G1764A BCP dual mutation was found in one isolate. Three isolates presented single mutation in the BCP dual mutation region, whereas two showed a novel G1764T mutation. In conclusion, this preliminary study revealed HBV genotype D, sub-genotype D1, and subtype ayw2 of HBV among hepatitis B infected patients from Afghanistan. Further investigation should be carried out.
