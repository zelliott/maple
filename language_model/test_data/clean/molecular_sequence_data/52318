Catecholamines stimulate proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression in corticotrope cells, but the molecular mechanisms of these effects are not known. While beta-adrenergic receptors stimulate the protein kinase A (PKA) system, the POMC promoter does not have classical cAMP-response elements (CREs). Therefore, we investigated the induction of the c-fos protooncogen, previously shown to increase POMC transcription in AtT20 cells. In this corticotrope-derived cell line, we show that activation of beta-receptors with isoprenaline (Iso) induces a transient rise in c-fos mRNA levels. Gel mobility shift assays with a labeled AP1 consensus sequence (TGACTCA) showed induction of specific binding activity after Iso treatment. Cotransfection experiments with dominant inhibitory PKA mutants and reporter genes containing c-fos promoter sequences showed that c-fos induction by Iso is entirely dependent on a functional PKA activity. Furthermore, we show that beta-receptor induction of c-fos in corticotrophs is mediated by at least two distinct cAMP-responsive sequences. cAMP regulatory element binding (CREB)-dependent induction is observed on the CRE located at -60 bp on the c-fos promoter. A region located in the vicinity of the dyad symetry element (-290) is also found to mediate tissue-specific cAMP induction. Transcriptional activation by this site, although sensitive to PKA antagonism, is not blocked by CREB mutants.
