Bacteria belonging to the Azospirillum genus are nitrogen fixers that colonize the roots of grasses, but do not cause the formation of differentiated structures. Sequences from total DNA of several Azospirillum strains are homologous to restriction fragments containing Rhizobium meliloti nodulation genes. A 10-kilobase (kb) EcoRI fragment from A. brasilense Sp7, sharing homology with a 6.8-kb EcoRI fragment carrying nodGEFH and part of nodP of R. meliloti 41, was cloned in pUC18 to yield pAB502. The nucleotide sequence of a 3.5-kb EcoRI-SmaI fragment of the pAB502 insert revealed 60% homology with R. meliloti nodP and nodQ genes. The nodP gene product shares no homology to any known protein sequence. The Azospirillum nodQ gene product shares homology with a family of initiation and elongation factors as does the R. meliloti nodQ gene product. Since the nodQ gene overlaps the nodP gene, the two genes might be cotranscribed. Azospirillum contains large plasmids, and the nodPQ genes were found on the 90-MDa plasmid (p90). A translational nodP-lacZ fusion was constructed in the broad host range plasmid pGD926. No beta-galactosidase activity was detected in Escherichia coli, but the fusion was functional in Azospirillum and constitutively expressed. Deletions and mutations of nodPQ did not modify growth, nitrogen fixation, or interaction with wheat seedlings.
