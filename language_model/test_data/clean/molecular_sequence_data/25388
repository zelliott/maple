To examine whether the disulfide bridge between residues 65 and 81 can be replaced by a non-native disulfide bridge in the mutant h-lysozyme C77/95A and whether the formation of such a new disulfide bridge affects the folding of the protein, cysteine scanning mutagenesis has been performed within two discontinuous segments (residues 61-67 for the mutant C65/77/95A, and 74-84 for the mutant C77/81/95A). The position of the Cys residue at 65 or 81 was continuously shifted by site-directed mutagenesis. Of the mutants, only substitution of Cys for Trp64 allowed the secretion of mutant h-lysozyme(W64C) into the medium in a sufficient amount for analysis. After the purification, the mutant enzyme was obtained as two components (W64C-A and W64C-B). The only difference between A and B was that A had a peptide bond cleaved between Ala77 and His78. A non-native disulfide bridge between residues 64-81 was found in both components. Little difference was observed in CD spectra among wild-type and mutant enzymes. It is likely that the tertiary structure of the W64C mutant might be distorted at the location, because the directions of amino acid side chains at positions of 64 and 81 are shown to be opposite to each other in wild-type h-lysozyme by X-ray crystallographic analysis.
