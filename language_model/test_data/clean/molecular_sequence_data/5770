We cloned a fragment of the chromosomal DNA of Enterobacter cloacae, which enabled a melibiose-negative Escherichia coli mutant lacking melB to grow on melibiose as the sole source of carbon. Transformed cells harboring the hybrid plasmid carrying the cloned DNA showed melibiose transport activity. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA region was determined. One complete open reading frame (ORF) and a part of another ORF were found in the region, and the amino acid sequences were deduced. The complete ORF was found to encode a melibiose transporter which consisted of 425 amino acid residues. Hydropathy analysis revealed that there are about 12 hydrophobic domains in this transporter. The incomplete ORF which exists in the upstream region of the transporter gene seemed to encode an alpha-galactosidase.
