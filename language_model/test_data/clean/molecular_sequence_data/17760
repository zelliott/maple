Two possible forms of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBE) gene NS1 (called NS1' and NS1) were constructed using two overlapping cDNA-fragments of TBE genome and synthetic DNA fragments. This genes were expressed in E. coli cells in expression vector pUR290 as individual proteins or fusion with bacterial beta-galactosidase. The proteins NS1 (Mw. 39 kDa), beta-galactosidase-NS1' (Mw. 162 kDa) and beta-galactosidase-NS1 (Mw. 155 kDa) were effectively synthesized under the Plgc-promoter induction conditions. Expression of NS1' gene results in the formation of two virus-specific proteins (Mw. 46 and 44 kDa). All bacterial analogs of NS1 protein fixed monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies specific to viral NS1.
