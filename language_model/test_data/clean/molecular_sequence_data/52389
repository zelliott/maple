We report a fast method for the isolation of homogeneous C-protein from bovine skeletal muscle. In electron micrographs C-protein appears as short rods with a relatively uniform length of about 50 nm. Protein sequencing shows a single N-terminal sequence. Radio-labelled C-protein strongly decorates titin II and myosin rods but not myosin heads. Binding to titin II is retained in preparations lacking titin-associated proteins. Antibodies to bovine C-protein were used to screen a lambda gt11 cDNA library constructed from fetal human skeletal muscle. Clone HC38 is 3833 bp long and encodes a protein of 1138 amino acid residues. The start of the predicted sequence fits the N-terminal sequence of the bovine protein. All partial sequences obtained from the bovine protein (348 residues) and the sequence deduced from a partial chicken cDNA (Einheber and Fischman, 1990) can be aligned along the human sequence. The sequences of human and chicken C-proteins share 50% identity and 70% similarity. Along the repeat patterns of the human protein the fibronectin (Fn)-like domains are better conserved than the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains. Regions of strong divergence between chicken fast C-protein and human slow C-protein may represent differences in C-protein isoforms.
