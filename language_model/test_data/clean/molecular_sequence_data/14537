The availability of Brugia malayi genome sequence has paved ways for the search of homologues for a variety of genes. Helicases are ubiquitous enzymes involved in all the nucleic acid metabolic pathways and are essential for the development and growth. The genome wide analysis of B. malayi for different helicases showed the presence of a number of DEAD box helicases, 7 DEAH box helicases, RecQ helicases, repair helicases, super killer helicases, MCM2-7 complex, Rad54 and two subunits of Ku helicase. The comparison of protein sequence of each helicase with its human counterpart indicated characteristic differences in filarial helicases. There are noticeable differences in some of the filarial helicases such as DHX35, RecQL1 and Ku. Further characterization of these helicases will help in understanding physiological significance of these helicases in filarial parasites, which in future can be utilized for chemotherapy of parasitic infection.
