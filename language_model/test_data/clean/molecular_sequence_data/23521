The metal binding properties of peptides corresponding to metal-binding sites spanning regions that normally function as linkers in tandem arrays of metal-binding domain-containing proteins were examined. For a peptide with two His residues from one TFIIIA-like zinc finger domain, a canonical TFIIIA-like linker, and two Cys residues from an adjacent zinc domain, the dissociation constant for the 1:1 peptide to cobalt(II) was found to be 15 +/- 10 microM, compared with 60 nM for the corresponding zinc finger domains themselves. Peptides overlapping two sets of metal-binding domains from human TRAF (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor) proteins were examined. In one case, the affinity of the presumed metal-binding domain and that for the linker region were comparable, while in the second case, the affinity of the linker peptide was higher than that for the corresponding presumed metal-binding domain peptide. These studies revealed that cobalt(II) affinities in the micromolar range can occur even for peptides that do not correspond to natural zinc-binding domains and that the degree of distinction between authentic metal-binding domains and the corresponding linker-spanning peptides may be modest, at least for single domain peptide models.
