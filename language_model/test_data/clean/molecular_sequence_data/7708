Three cDNA clones encoding the 17.5-kDa polypeptide of cucumber Photosystem I were isolated and sequenced. A cDNA insert of them was 812 bp long and contained a long open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide with 217 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA was 77% and 71% identical to the amino acid sequences of psaL gene products from barley and spinach, respectively.
