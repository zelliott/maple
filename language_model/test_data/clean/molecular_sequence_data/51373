Synthetic lipopeptide N-palmitoyltyrosyl-seryl-seryl-asparaginyl-alanine, an analogue of B-mitogenic tripalmitoyl-pentapeptide from Escherichia coli lipoprotein, was coupled with an oligosaccharide hapten from Neisseria meningitidis lipooligosaccharide to give a glycopeptidolipid conjugate--the artificial antigen of a new type processing the type-specific microbial determinant.
