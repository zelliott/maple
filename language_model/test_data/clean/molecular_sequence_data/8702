The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene (leuB) coding for beta-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase of Bacteroides fragilis was determined. An open reading frame of 1,061 nucleotides was detected that could encode a polypeptide of 353 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 39,179 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of the beta-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase from B. fragilis showed substantial sequence similarity with the beta-isopropylmalate dehydrogenases from other bacteria.
