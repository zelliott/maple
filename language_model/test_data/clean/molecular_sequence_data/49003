The large-scale production of recombinant biotherapeutics, particularly recombinant proteins, provides significant process and regulatory challenges to the biotechnology industry in order to meet the regulatory agencies stringent requirements in a cost-effective manner. Host cell derived nucleic acid causes problems from both a process and a regulatory perspective, as high molecular weight chromosomal DNA is responsible both for the viscosity of cell lysates, and it is a source of heterologous DNA sequences whose inclusion in the final product must be prevented. We have constructed a modified Escherichia coli JM107 expression host (JMN), containing a staphylococcal nuclease expression cassette, integrated into the host chromosome at the dif locus. The nuclease is expressed as a fusion to the ompA signal peptide, and is translocated to the periplasm of the cell, protecting the cytoplasmic nucleic acid from any toxic activity. The nuclease is released during cell lysis, where it subsequently acts to hydrolyse host nucleic acid present in the lysate. Results with this strain show that sufficient levels of nuclease activity are produced to completely auto-hydrolyse the host's chromosomal DNA to a size non-visible on 1% agarose gel, generating a markedly lower lysate viscosity. This provides a suitable methodology to remove heterologous DNA sequences early in the product stream and decrease lysate viscosity, improving the efficiency of downstream processing and product yield, whilst avoiding the addition of exogenous nuclease and its prohibitive costs at large-scale.
