We have characterized three mouse U3-RNA-processed pseudogenes. Together with previous analyses of mouse functional genes and of rat genes and pseudogenes, these data provide some insights into the processes of U3 retrogene formation during the evolution of rodents. All the mouse retrogenes correspond to a full-length U3B-coding sequence with a 3'-poly(A) tail and are precisely flanked by a pair of direct repeats, in agreement with formation through an RNA intermediate followed by insertion at staggered nicks in the genome. All the rodents U3 retrogenes identified so far are produced from a U3B-RNA form, with two of them (one for each rodent) formed from a 3'-elongated U3-RNA precursor, pointing to the particular susceptibility of RNA precursors forms to serve as templates for retrogene formation. Rodent full-length U3 retrogenes are not inserted randomly in the genome but are systematically found in a context of simple sequences, prone to slipped-strand mispairings and likely to favour the appearance of single-stranded DNA. Moreover their flanking repeats share not only the same size (15 bp) but also common sequence features (which extend to vicinal upstream nucleotides) suggesting that common mechanisms, specific to this class of retrogenes, have been involved in their formation. For the first time, a model accounting for the generation of full-length cDNA copies from nonpolyadenylated RNA templates is proposed. Rodent U3 retrogenes appear to be of rather recent origin (posterior to the mouse/rat divergence) and some of them could have undergone subsequent genetic exchanges with the functional genes.
