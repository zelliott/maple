Five strains of the novel ascogenous yeast species Lipomyces orientalis sp. nov. were isolated from soil samples collected in Vietnam. The yeast forms asci containing one to four ascospores. The ascospores of L. orientalis have warty surfaces and differ from the characteristic striated ascospores of Lipomyces tetrasporus. Phylogenetic analyses of D1/D2 26S rDNA and ITS sequences indicate that L. orientalis and L. tetrasporus are closely related, but they differ from each other by 6 nucleotides in the D1/D2 region and 16 nucleotides in the ITS region. The type culture is strain Lip 95(T) (=CBS 10300(T)=NRRL Y-27927(T)).
