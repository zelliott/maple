A method of determination for solasodine glycosides by using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) immunostaining was investigated. Solasodine glycosides separated by silica gel TLC were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was treated with sodium periodate solution followed by bovine serum albumin (BSA), resulting in a solasodine glycoside-BSA conjugate. Conjugation was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Individual spots were stained by monoclonal antibody against solamargine. Immunostaining of solasodine glycosides was more sensitive compared to other stainings. The newly established immunostaining method can be extended to analysis of the distribution of solasodine glycoside in the plant body.
