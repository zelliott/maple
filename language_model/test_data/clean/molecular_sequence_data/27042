Rho family small GTPase plays a key role in the regulation of cell shape and migration in mammalian cells. Constitutive activation of Rho GTPase leads to the aberrant cell morphology and migration. We identified nm23-H2 as a binding partner of Lbc proto-oncogene product, which specifically activates RhoA, and revealed that nm23-H2 could act as a negative regulator of Rho activity. Furthermore, we found that Lbc, nm23-H2 and ICAP1-alpha could form tertial complex in cells, and this complex formation was thought to be critical for cell migration stimulated by integrin. It is reported that nm23-H1 bound to Tiam1 and Dbl, which activates Rac and Cdc42 small GTPase, respectively. We discuss the role of nm23 in the regulation of cell morphology and cell migration via Rho family GTPases.
