The concept of the 1H-NMR window has been developed and examined through a comparative study of NOESY spectra of a self-complementary Dickerson's dodecamer (I) [5'd(5C6G7C8G9A10A11T12T13C-14G15C16G)2(3')], a self-complementary 20-mer (II) [(5'd(1C2G3C4G5C6G7C8G9A10A11T12T13C14G15C16G17C18G19C20G)2(3')] in which the core part consists of the same Dickerson's dodecamer sequence with the flanking CGCG residues at both 3' and 5'-ends, and the partly-deuteriated (shown by underlined CGCG residues at both 3' and 5'-ends) analogous duplex (III) [5'd(1C2G3C4G5C6G7C8G9A10A11T12T13C14G15C16G17C18G19C20G)2(3')] in which the core 5C to 16G part (i.e. 1H-NMR window) consists of the natural Dickerson's dodecamer sequence. A comparison of their NOESY spectra clearly demonstrates that the severe overlap of proton resonances in the larger DNA duplex (II) has been successfully reduced in the partly-deuterated duplex (III) as a result of specific incorporations of the sugar-deuteriated nucleotide residues in the latter [stereospecific > 97 atom % 2H enrichment at H2', H2'' and H3' sites, approximately 85 atom % 2H enrichment at H4' and approximately 20 atom % 2H enrichment at H1' (see refs. 10 and 11) in the 20-mer duplex (III)]. These simplifications of the resonance overlap by the deuteriation approach have enabled unequivocal chemical shift assignments and extraction of the quantitative NOE data in the 1H-NMR window part of duplex (III). A comparison of the 12-nucleotide long 1H-NMR window in (III) with that of the 12-mer duplex (I) also shows the scope of studying the changes in conformation and dynamics of the core 12-mer region in (III) which result from the increase of molecular weight due to the DNA chain extension. It is noteworthy that such a study is clearly impossible for the natural 20-mer (II) because of the inherent problem of the overlap of resonances.
