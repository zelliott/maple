Two related eukaryotic initiation factor-4E binding proteins (4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2) were recently characterized for their capacity to bind specifically to eIF4E and inhibit its function. Here, we determined the cDNA sequence, tissue distribution, genomic structure, and chromosome localization of murine and human 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2. Mouse 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 consist of 117 and 120 amino acids and exhibit 91. 5 and 95.0% identity, respectively, to their human homologues. 4E-BP1 mRNA is expressed in most tissues, but is most abundant in adipose tissue, pancreas, and skeletal muscle, while 4E-BP2 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed. The structures of the mouse 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 were determined. The 4E-BP1 gene consists of three exons and spans approximately 16 kb. In addition, two 4E-BP1 pseudogenes exist in the mouse genome. The 4E-BP2 gene spans approximately 20 kb and exhibits an identical genomic organization to that of 4E-BP1, with the protein coding portion of the gene divided into three exons. There are no pseudogenes for 4E-BP2. The chromosomal locations of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 were determined in both mice and humans by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Mouse 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 map to chromosomes 8 (A4-B1) and 10 (B4-B5), respectively, and human 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 localize to chromosomes 8p12 and 10q21-q22, respectively.
