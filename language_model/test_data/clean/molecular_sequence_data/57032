Chromosome 20-specific simple-sequence-repeat (SSR) markers were developed from a flow-sorted phage library (LL20NS01), subcloned in Bluescript, and screened with a tetranucleotide repeat, (AAAG)6, to identify potentially polymorphic loci. Of 100 clones sequenced, 39 were selected to construct primers. Of these 39, 22 were polymorphic. Reference to the CEPH linkage database (version 5) permitted genetic mapping of 16 of the new markers to specific regions of chromosome 20. Ten of the SSRs showed heterozygosity indices (above 70%) that would qualify them as potential index markers.
