An irregular rod-shaped, non-gliding, yellow-pigmented bacterium was isolated from seawater from the western North Pacific Ocean near Japan. The strain, designated S1-66T, was Gram-negative, obligately aerobic, heterotrophic and oxidase-positive. Growth occurred in the presence of 1-4 % NaCl, with optimum growth at 2 % NaCl. The strain grew at 15-30 °C, with optimum growth at 20-25 °C. The G+C content of genomic DNA was 48.1 mol% (HPLC). The predominant isoprenoid quinone was MK-6 and the major cellular fatty acids were iso-C15:0 (26.4 %), iso-C15:1 (20.3 %) and iso-C17:0 3-OH (14.2 %). Phylogenetic trees generated by using 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain S1-66T belongs to the family Flavobacteriaceae and showed 94.2 % sequence similarity to the most closely related type strain, Ulvibacter antarcticus IMCC3101T. On the basis of phenotypic and phylogenetic features, S1-66T is classified in a novel genus and species within the family Flavobacteriaceae, for which the name Aureitalea marina gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Aureitalea marina is S1-66T (=NBRC 107741T=KCTC 23434T).
