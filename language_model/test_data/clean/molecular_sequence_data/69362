The clinical and epidemiological relevance of circulating antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV) in hemodialysis patients is uncertain, since clinical signs of infection are often mild or absent, with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values that are virtually always normal, and liver biopsies are only rarely performed. Determination of HCV RNA in serum is therefore critical for distinguishing chronic HCV infection from previous exposure to the virus. We studied HCV viremia by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the 5'-noncoding region of the viral genome in 77 dialysis patients who were screened for anti-HCV by a second-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (the enzyme immunoassay II; Ortho HCV, 2nd generation, Ortho Diagnostic Systems Raritan, N.J.) and a second-generation recombinant immunoblot assay (Chiron Corporation and Ortho Diagnostic Systems) and prospectively evaluated for ALT elevations over a period of 5 years. Of 77 patients tested, 29 (38%) had active infection as shown by a positive PCR assay result, and of these, 26 were anti-HCV positive. Although a good correlation was found between circulating anti-HCV and HCV RNA in serum, 10 (28%) of 36 anti-HCV-positive patients were HCV RNA negative by PCR, suggesting either low levels of viremia or past exposure to HCV and subsequent recovery. On the other hand, 3 (7.3%) of 41 anti-HCV-negative patients had HCV RNA in their sera, indicating seronegative HCV infection. The ALT level had no predictive value for HCV infection, because it was repeatedly normal in 18 (62%) of 29 viremic patients. HCV genotyping was also performed and indicated that all four known genotypes of HCV were present in our group. In conclusion, serological assays are reliable for detecting exposure to HCV in hemodialysis patients; however, direct identification of the viral genome is required to document current infection.
