Here we describe the cloning of the human Achaete Scute Homologue 2 (HASH2) gene, officially designated ASCL2 (Achaete Scute complex like 2), a homologue of the Drosophila Achaete and Scute genes. In mouse, this gene is imprinted and maps to chromosome 7. We mapped the human homologue close to IGF2 and H19 at 11p15.5, the human region syntenic with mouse chromosome 7, indicating that this imprinted region is highly conserved in mouse and man. HASH2 is expressed in the extravillus trophoblasts of the developing placenta only. The lack of HASH2 expression in non-malignant hydatidiform (androgenetic) moles indicates that HASH2 is also imprinted in man.
