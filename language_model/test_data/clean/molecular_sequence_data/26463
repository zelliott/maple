The sweet protein monellin consists of two noncovalently associated polypeptide chains, the A chain of 44 amino acid residues and the B chain of 50 residues. Two different primary structures have been reported for each of these chains. The complete amino acid sequence of monellin was determined by a combination of FAB- and ESI-mass spectrometry, and by automatic Edman degradation.
