By RT-PCR and TAIL-PCR, the full coding region of Batai virus isolated in China (YN92-4 strain)was sequenced for the first time. According to the results, the genome of the virus contained three segments S, M and L of 947, 4,371 and 6,860 nucleotides, respectively. The S segment coded a nucleoprotein of 234 amino acids and a nonstructural protein of 102 amino acids, the M and L segments coded a precursor protein of 1 ,435 amino acids and RNA polymerase of 2,239 amino acids, respectively. Compared with the full coding sequence of Batai viruses isolated out of China, the S and M segments of YN92-4 and ON-7/B/01 showed the highest homology in nucleotide and amino acid sequenes with similarity of 97.7% (100%) and 95.7% (98%), respectively. Since there was no full coding sequence information on the L segment in GenBank for the reference, the L segment of YN92-4 was compared with that of Bunyamwera virus and the homology of nucleotide and amino acid was 73.5%and 81.6%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed YN92-4 strain was clustered into one group with the prototype of Batai virus (MM2222). The results suggested that the YN92-4 strain had no occurrance of genetic reassortment (like Ngari virus) and was close to the Batai virus (ON-7/B/01 strain) isolated from cattle serum in Japan.
