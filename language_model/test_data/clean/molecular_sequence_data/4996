An open reading frame was found 214 bp downstream of the cellulose synthase operon of Acetobacter. The encoded amino acid sequence was found to be similar to some beta-glucosidases (G3ases). We detected G3ase activity in the culture medium and analysis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence showed that this gene encodes the enzyme. Therefore, it is possible that this region is a gene cluster for cellulose synthesis.
