Death domains (DD) and leucine rich repeats (LRR) are two different types of protein interaction motifs. Death domains are found predominantly in proteins involved in signaling and are involved in homo- and heteromultimerization. Leucine rich repeats are found in proteins with diverse cellular functions, like cell adhesion and cellular signaling, and mediate reversible protein-protein interactions. In this paper we report the cloning of a new human gene called LRDD (leucine repeat death domain containing protein). LRDD encodes a protein of 83 kDa with six LRRs at the N-terminus and a DD at the C-terminus. LRDD appears to be processed into two fragments of about 33 and 55 kDa, containing LRRs and DD respectively. Interestingly, LRDD is shown to interact with two other death domain containing proteins, FADD and MADD, presumably through death domain interactions. LRDD may represent a new type of adapter protein that could be involved in signaling or other cellular functions.
