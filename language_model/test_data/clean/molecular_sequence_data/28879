Partial sequence analysis of the ribosomal operon in Xanthomonas axonopodis allowed discrimination among strains causing the A, B, and C types of citrus bacterial canker (CBC) and quantification of the relationship of these organisms with other species and pathovars in the same genus. Sets of primers based on sequence differences in the internally transcribed spacer and on a sequence from the plasmid gene pthA involved in virulence were designed for specific identification of xanthomonads causing CBC diseases. The two sets were validated with a collection of Xanthomonas strains associated with citrus species. The primer set based on ribosomal sequences had a high level of specificity for X. axonopodis pv. citri, whereas the set based on the pthA gene was universal for all types of CBC organisms. Moreover, the relationships among worldwide Xanthomonas strains causing CBC were analyzed by amplification of repetitive sequences (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus and BOX elements). Under specific conditions, pathotypes of these Xanthomonas strains could be discerned, and subgroups of the pathotypes were identified. Subgroups of strains were associated with certain geographic areas of the world, and on this basis the origin of type A strains introduced into Florida could be inferred.
