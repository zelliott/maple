The yeast nuclear SCO1 gene is required for accumulation of the mitochondrially synthesized cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II (COXI and COXII). We cloned and characterized the SCO1 gene. It codes for a 0.9 kb transcript. DNA sequence analysis predicts a 33 kDa protein. As shown by in vitro transcription and translation experiments in combination with import studies on isolated mitochondria, this protein is matured into a 30 kDa polypeptide which is tightly associated with a mitochondrial membrane. The possible function of the SCO1 gene product in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase is discussed.
