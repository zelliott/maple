Our aim was to characterize and determine the function of endothelin (ET) receptor subtypes in human vascular tissue. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction with nested oligonucleotide primers detected the presence of mRNA encoding both ETA and ETB receptors in the media from aorta and pulmonary and coronary arteries. In situ hybridization confirmed the presence of mRNA for both subtypes in the media of coronary arteries. Saturation binding assays using 125I-ET-1 found a single population of high-affinity ET receptors (n = three patients, +/- SEM) in aorta (Kd = 0.507 +/- 0.020 nM; Bmax = 9 +/- 4 fmol/mg protein) and pulmonary (Kd = 0.845 +/- 0.245 nM; Bmax = 15 +/- 10 fmol/mg protein) and coronary arteries (Kd = 0.141 +/- 0.020 nM; Bmax = 71 +/- 21 fmol/mg protein). Using media from coronary arteries, the ETA-selective ligand BQ123 (cyclo[D-Asp-L-Pro-D-Val-L-Leu-D-Trp]) and the ETB-selective ligand BQ3020 (Ala11,15-Ac-ET-1[6-21]) both produced biphasic competition binding curves against 125I-ET-1, confirming the presence of high- and low-affinity sites corresponding to the two subtypes: BQ123 (KdETA = 0.85 +/- 0.03 nM; KdETB = 7.58 +/- 2.27 microM; ETA/ETB, 87%:13%) and BQ3020 (KdETA = 0.22 +/- 0.04 microM; KdETB = 0.77 +/- 0.34 nM; ETA/ETB, 62%:38%). BQ123 (0.1 microM) caused a significant parallel rightward shift of ET-1-induced vasoconstriction of coronary arteries in vitro, but BQ3020 and Ala1,3,11,15-ET-1 failed to show any agonist activity when tested at concentrations of < or = 3 microM in three vessels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
