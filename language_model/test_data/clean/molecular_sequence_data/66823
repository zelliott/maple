Gata3 is a positional candidate gene for allergic asthma. We determined allergen-induced GATA-3 mRNA and protein expression in asthma susceptible and resistant mice and generated Gata3 sequence data. Our data indicate that the Gata3 gene in isolation is not a causative agent of asthma susceptibility in our model.
