Translocations of various lipid species between membranes have been extensively studied. The transport of water-insoluble lipids is thought to require the participation of lipid transfer proteins (LTP). Several LTP, differing in their physiochemical properties and substrate specificities, have been purified to homogeneity from blood plasma, eucaryotic and procaryotic cells. Depending on their site of activity, they can be classified as extracellular and intracellular LTP. Extracellular LTP are found in the blood plasma and intracellular LTP, which were originally characterized as phospholipid exchange proteins, are ubiquitous in nature. Despite the enormous knowledge about their physicochemical properties and their function in vitro their physiological role has not been clearly demonstrated. However, their ubiquitous occurrence indicates an important role in cellular events. This review gives an overview of this interesting category of proteins, which are able to catalyze inter-membrane transfer and exchange of lipids.
