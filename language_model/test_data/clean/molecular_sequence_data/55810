To determine the prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the short-term evolution of HCV infection in children undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation, we retrospectively studied the sera and medical records of 149 children surviving from 9 months to 5 years after OLT. Fourteen children (9.4%) were found to be positive for anti-HCV with second-generation ELISA and RIBA tests. They were individualized in 2 distinctive groups. In 5 children, anti-HCV was present before OLT, and in 1 patient only HCV RNA was detected at that time. All 6 patients were positive for anti-HCV after OLT. In the other 8 children, anti-HCV and HCV RNA were only detected after OLT and likely reflect infection during or shortly after OLT. The antibody reactivities against the 3 antigens included in the second-generation RIBA test varied in a given patient throughout follow-up and between these 2 groups of children. In all patients, serum transaminase (ALT) activities returned to normal levels when prednisone therapy was lowered and given every other day. These results indicate that the search for HCV infection in these children is necessary in the differential diagnosis of other liver complications in order to avoid excessive immunosuppressive treatment.
