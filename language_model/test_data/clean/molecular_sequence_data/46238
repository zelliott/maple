DLK1 and CLPG were located in DLK1-GTL2 imprinted cluster. They all affected muscle growth and meat tenderness. The functional importance of DLK1 and CLPG imply that the variation of the genes could affect the growth traits of animal. PCR-SSCP and sequencing were used to analyze the four loci of DLK1 gene and CLPG gene in 1109 individuals, which belong to eight breeds/species of bovidae, including cattle, buffalo and yak. A synonymous mutation (C451T) was detected in exon 5 of DLK1 in Qinchuan cattle, but didn't change significantly with phenotypic traits. Three genotypes AA, AB and AC of CLPG were identified in Jiaxian cattle. The associations analyst of different genotypes showed that the individuals with genotypes AA and AC had a greater body weight and longer body length than those with genotype AB (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively); the AA individuals were different from those AB (P<0.05) in the circumference of cannon bone. No polymorphism was observed in the other populations at other loci. These results were in agreement with the homology analysis: DLK1 and CLPG genes were in a highly conserved.
