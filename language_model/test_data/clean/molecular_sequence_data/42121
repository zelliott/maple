A survey of various rat tissues showed that the kidney had the highest endothelin degradation enzyme activity. An enzyme that effectively inactivated endothelin-1 was purified from soluble kidney extracts. This enzyme appeared to contain two subunits with molecular weights of 34 kDa and 21 kDa. It displayed carboxypeptidase-like properties and cleaved off the carboxyl terminal tryptophan of endothelin-1. These results agree with the findings that endothelin-1 is cleared efficiently by the kidney and suggest that this enzyme plays a role in the homeostasis of circulating endothelin-1.
