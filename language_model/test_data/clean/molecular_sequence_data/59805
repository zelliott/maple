Clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) are involved in selective protein transport in eukaryotes. AP-1 and AP-2 are protein complexes found in the CCVs of the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane respectively. AP19 is the smallest polypeptide chain components of AP-1. We have identified a cDNA clone (CAP19) encoding a putative homologue for the assembly protein AP19 from the Chinese medicinal tree, Camptotheca acuminata. The deduced polypeptide contains 161 amino acids and has a predicted Mr of 18820. DNA blot analysis suggests that the AP19S of C. acuminata are encoded by a small gene family. CAP19 was expressed ubiquitously throughout the plant suggesting that it may be involved in general Golgi-mediated secretion.
