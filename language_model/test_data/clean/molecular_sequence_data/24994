A previously uncharacterized yeast protein, YJL066c, was discovered in the membrane fraction although it has no hydrophobic stretch. The protein was partly solubilized by Triton X-100 in an oligomeric form, while it was insoluble in alkali or salt. By immunofluorescent microscopy, its localization coincided with the mitochondria. We therefore propose it should be named Mpm1 (mitochondrial peculiar membrane protein 1).
