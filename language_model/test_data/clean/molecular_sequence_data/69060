DNA sequences are presented for two members of the wheat Em gene family. The sequences correspond to the two linked genes at the Xem-1AL locus. Comparisons of these sequences with that of another wheat Em gene and two Em cDNA clones reveals substantial homology within the protein-coding regions, and the presence in the 5'-flanking regions of the genomic sequences of motifs characteristic of ABA-responsive cis-acting elements.
