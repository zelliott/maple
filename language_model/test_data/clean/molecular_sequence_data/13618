G1 cyclins and some cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) have been implicated in the G1/S transition during the eukaryotic cell cycle initiation. The present study demonstrates that the genes of cyclin E, cdk2, cdk5 and the transcriptional factor E2F-1 are expressed during the prolactin (PRL)-induced G1/S transition in rat Nb2 pre-T lymphoma cells. The mRNAs for these four cell cycle regulators were synergistically synthesized and degraded after the stimulation by PRL. The maximal levels of these mRNAs were observed at 8 to 12 h after the PRL addition, while DNA replication reached to the maximum between 12 and 16 h. These results suggest that cyclin E, cdk2, cdk5 and E2F-1 play the roles in the G1/S transition being expressed by a common cellular mechanism(s) in the PRL-stimulated pre-T lymphoma cells.
