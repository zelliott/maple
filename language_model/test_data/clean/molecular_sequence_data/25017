Uterine leiomyomas or fibroids are classified as a benign uterine disease in that the polyps display no malignant growth. However, uterine leiomyomas are a leading cause of morbidity, infertility, and hysterectomy in women. Since leiomyomas are known to be sensitive to estrogen for their growth, we have examined uterine genes known to be estrogen responsive in affected and unaffected uterine tissue. This information will be useful in determining the contribution, if any, of hormonally active environmental chemicals to this highly prevalent reproductive disorder.
