The 3.8-kb full-length mouse Ptk7 cDNA encoding a defective receptor protein tyrosine kinase was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR of mouse liver mRNA. The mouse PTK7 polypeptide showed 92.6% identity to human PTK7. The mouse Ptk7 gene consists of 20 exons and has exactly the same exon structure as the human PTK7 gene. Mouse PTK7 was shown to be phosphorylated neither by itself nor by other protein tyrosine kinases. In addition, its expression did not affect the phospho-tyrosine level of cellular proteins in COS-1 cells. The mouse Ptk7 mRNA was expressed at high levels in lung and un-pregnant uterus among adult tissues, and in the tail, limbs, somites, gut, and craniofacial regions among embryonic tissues. These data suggest that mouse PTK7, an orthologue of human PTK7, plays multiple roles in embryonic development.
