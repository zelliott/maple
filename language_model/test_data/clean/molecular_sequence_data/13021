STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins combine with cytokine receptors and receptor-associated kinases in distinct protein/protein interactions that are critical for STAT-dependent signal transduction events, but the nature of any subsequent STAT interactions with DNA-binding proteins in the nucleus is less certain. Based on assays of DNA/protein binding and activity of transfected reporter plasmids, we determined that occupation of contiguous DNA-binding sites for Stat1 (the first member of the STAT family) and the transcriptional activator Sp1 are both required for full activation of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 gene by interferon-gamma. Thus, Stat1 binding to DNA cannot by itself be equated with biologic actions of Stat1. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we also obtained evidence of direct and selective Stat1/Sp1 interaction (in primary culture cells without overexpression), further indicating that Stat1/Sp1 synergy confers an element of specificity in the pathway leading to cytokine-activated transcription and cytokine-dependent immunity and inflammation.
