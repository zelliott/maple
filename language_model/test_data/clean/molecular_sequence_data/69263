The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify six small variable number of tandem repeat loci in two reactions (D19S20 co-amplifying with D17S5 and D1S80; D17S766 co-amplifying with D16S83 and D17S24). When coupled with fluorescent detection of the products, this provides a rapid, highly discriminating automated test. Preferential amplification of small alleles, leading to 'allelic dropout' was found to occur in D19S20 and D16S83. Population databases are presented for Caucasians and Afro-Caribbeans at loci D19S20, D16S83 and D17S24, and for Asians at D19S20.
