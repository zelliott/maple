The male-specific minor histocompatibility antigen H-Y plays an important role in both graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease following transplantation of male tissue into females that are completely matched at the major histocompatibility loci. The recent identification of two peptides that, in association with the mouse H-2Kk or human HLA B7 major histocompatibility class I molecules, are recognised by H-Y-specific T cells, has provided evidence for the molecular basis for such anti-H-Y responses. These peptides are encoded by the mouse and human homologues of a ubiquitously expressed Y chromosome gene, Smcy, whilst the equivalent peptides encoded by the X chromosome homologues of this gene fail to be recognised. Genetic studies have demonstrated that, as is the case for other minor histocompatibility antigens, peptide epitopes from several closely linked genes may be required to interact in order to elicit a response against H-Y. Definition of the peptides and the genes that encode these epitopes will allow the development of tolerogenic protocols that could specifically down-modulate the response to H-Y and perhaps even other minor histocompatibility antigens.
