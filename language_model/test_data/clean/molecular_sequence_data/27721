A cDNA clone for the human SmB and B' auto-immune antigens has been isolated by antibody screening of a cDNA expression library. The cDNA clone hybridises with two distinct mRNAs, one of which is expressed in a tissue-specific manner. A fusion protein expressed from the cDNA clone was recognised by a number of sera from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients containing anti-Sm antibodies but not by sera reactive with other auto-immune antigens. The potential use of this clone in a diagnostic assay for SLE and in elucidating the processes regulating the expression of SmB and B' is discussed.
