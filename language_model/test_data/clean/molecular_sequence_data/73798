FKBP-rapamycin associated protein (FRAP) is a phosphatidylinositol kinase (PIK)-related kinase implicated in the inhibition of progression through G1 of the cell cycle. The PIK-related kinases are a growing family of proteins involved in cell-cycle checkpoints, DNA repair and recombination. We have mapped the human FRAP gene to chromosome 1p36.2, a region consistently deleted in neuroblastomas.
