Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase (CyaA) is an invasive bacterial toxin that delivers its N-terminal catalytic domain into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells bearing the alpha(M)beta(2) integrin (CD11b/CD18), such as myeloid dendritic cells. This allows use of engineered CyaA for targeted delivery of CD8(+) T cell epitopes into the MHC class I pathway of APC and induction of robust and protective cytotoxic responses. In this study, we demonstrate that CyaA can efficiently codeliver both a CD8(+) T cell epitope (OVA(257-264)) and a CD4(+) T cell epitope (MalE(100-114)) into, respectively, the conventional cytosolic or endocytic routes of processing of murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Upon CyaA delivery, a strong potentiation of the MalE(100-114) CD4(+) T cell epitope presentation is observed as compared with the MalE protein, which depends on CyaA interaction with its CD11b receptor and its subsequent clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In vivo, CyaA induces strong and specific Th1 CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses against, respectively, the MalE(100-114) and OVA(257-264) epitopes. These results underscore the potency of CyaA for design of new vaccines.
