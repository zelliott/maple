GAL4-based yeast two-hybrid cDNA libraries from Toxoplasma gondii RH strain were constructed and screened for interactors of a putative T. gondii cdc2-related kinase, TgCRK2. A screen of 3.2 million transformants yielded a single yeast clone that harbored a protein fusion capable of specifically interacting with TgCRK2. Sequencing revealed the cDNA insert (TgCYC1) had homology to the cyclin class of proteins. The TgCYC1 cDNA fragment was used to probe a conventional T. gondii cDNA library and a 2.65 kb cDNA coding for a predicted protein of 582 amino acids was obtained. Based on comparison with a 5'-RACE product from tachyzoite mRNA, the 2.65 kb cDNA for TgCYC1 appeared to be complete. TgCYC1 had the highest similarity to Plasmodium falciparum CYC1 and displayed sequence characteristics that place it in the cyclin H class of eukaryotic cyclins. In synchronous tachyzoite populations the level of TgCYC1 mRNA was unchanged indicating it is not cell cycle regulated at the mRNA level. TgCYC1 rescues the G(1)/S cyclin cell cycle defect in S. cerevisiae strain DL1 demonstrating that this apicomplexan cyclin can function in an established heterologous model system.
