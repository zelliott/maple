The recent availability of the long-acting somatostatin analogue, octreotide, has allowed its therapeutical use in a wide variety of human diseases, including some digestive, neoplastic and autoimmune disorders. This review focuses on the treatment of some endocrine disorders with octreotide. Evidence is accumulating that octreotide treatment is effective in improving the cure rate of pituitary surgery in acromegaly by shrinking the tumour size, and in lowering GH and IGF-I levels in the vaste majority of patients. Octreotide is also effective in ameliorating TSH-induced hyperthyroidism in patients with TSH-secreting adenomas. Moreover, octreotide has proved useful in the management of endocrine tumours of the gastroenteropancreatic tract (vipomas, glucagonomas, gastrinomas, insulinomas, and carcinoids) by reducing hormone levels and in some instances the size of the primary and/or metastatic lesions. Besides the above well-established indications there are some other potential indications (non-secreting pituitary tumours, medullary thyroid carcinoma, ectopic Cushing's syndrome, diabete mellitus, Graves' ophthalmopathy, tall children and polycystic ovary syndrome) that still await further investigation. Side-effects of octreotide, particularly the formation of gallstones, should be carefully monitored.
