cDNAs coding for human manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (Mn SOD) have been isolated from a human liver and a dibutyryl cyclic AMP differentiated U937 cDNA library constructed in vector lambda gtll. The nucleotide sequences of the insert cDNAs had an opening reading frame coding for 222 amino acid residues. The first 24 amino acids of the primarily translated polypeptide might constitute the leader peptide for transport of the precursors to the mitochondria. Differentiation of the U937 cells with dibutyryl cyclic AMP resulted in a 70% decrease in Mn SOD mRNA. The amino acid sequences of the mature Mn SODs of human, rat and mouse are highly conserved, while the sequences of the leader peptides of these species are moderately conserved.
