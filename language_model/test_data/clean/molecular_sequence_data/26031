When the Bacillus brevis secretory metalloprotease is expressed from the npr gene on a plasmid vector in the mesophile B. subtilis, grown at 37 degrees C, the enzyme was found to be properly processed, but secreted into the culture medium in a low-active conformation. Secreted metalloprotease can by heat-treatment (70 degrees C for 30 min) be converted into fully active enzyme.
