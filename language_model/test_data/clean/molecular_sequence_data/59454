A pattern recognition method through the two dimensional matrix representation of the nucleic acids sequence is developed. This approach of two dimensional plotting primarily enables to visualize all types of bonding between different bases in a RNA or DNA. The two dimensional matrix uses the capability of intramolecular Watson-Crick type (A-U and C-G) and Wobble type (G-U) base pairing. The method discusses both parallel and anti-parallel stranded base pairing. The application of the method to tRNA is shown.
