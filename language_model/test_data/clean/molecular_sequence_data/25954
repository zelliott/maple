The structural and dynamic aspects of the interaction of the thiazole containing lexitropsin (1) with an oligodeoxyribonucleotide were studied by high field 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Complete assignment of the 1H-NMR resonances of lexitropsin 1 was accomplished by 2D-NMR techniques. The complexation-induced chemical shifts and NOE cross peaks in the NOESY map of the 1:1 complex of lexitropsin (1) and d-[CGCAATTGCG]2 reveal that the thiazole ring of the lexitropsin (1) intercalates between dA4.A5 bases and the rest of the ligand resides in the minor groove of the AT rich core of decamer, thus occupying the 5'-AATT sequence on the DNA. Intercalation of the thiazole moiety of the drug has been detected by the presence of intermolecular NOEs both in the major and the minor groove of the decamer helix. The absence of intranucleotide NOEs between base protons and H1'/H2' protons suggested local unwinding of the binding site on the DNA. From COSY and NOESY methods of 2D-NMR, it was established that the N-formyl (amino) terminus of the thiazole lexitropsin (1) is projecting into the major groove towards A5H8 while the amidinium terminus lies in the minor groove towards the T7G8 base pairs of the opposite strand. The expected intranucleotide NOEs confirmed that the decadeoxyribonucleotide in the 1:1 complex exists in a right handed B-conformation. The presence of exchange signals along the binding site 5'-AATT indicated an exchange of the bound drug process wherein the rate of exchange between the two equivalent sites was estimated to be congruent to 130 s-1 at 30 degrees C and with delta G degrees of 62.4 kJ mol-1. Force field and Pi calculations permitted a rationalization of the experimentally observed binding mode in terms of preferred conformation of the ligand and repeat length in lexitropsins compared with the DNA receptor.
