The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of human basic and acidic calponins were determined. The basic calponin cDNA from human aorta (1496 bp) contained a single open reading frame (ORF) which encodes 297 amino acids (33,169 Da). The acidic calponin cDNA from human kidney (1607 bp) contained a single ORF which encodes 329 amino acids (36,412 Da). Basic calponin mRNA was expressed in only smooth muscle tissues, but acidic calponin mRNA was expressed in non-smooth muscle tissues as well as smooth muscle tissues. Fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed that basic and acidic calponin genes localize in 19p13.1-13.2 and 1p21-22 of human chromosomes, respectively.
