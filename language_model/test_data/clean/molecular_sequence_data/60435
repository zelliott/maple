We previously showed that bovine apolipoprotein A-II (apoA-II) had antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in PBS. We have characterized here the active domain of apoA-II using synthetic peptides. A peptide corresponding to C-terminal residues Leu(49)-Thr(76) exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against E. coli in PBS, but not against S. cerevisiae. Experiments using amino-acid-substituted peptides indicated that the residues Phe(52)-Phe(53)-Lys(54)-Lys(55) are required for the activity. Peptide Leu(49)-Thr(76) induced the release of calcein trapped inside the vesicles whose lipid composition resembles that of E. coli membrane, suggesting that peptide Leu(49)-Thr(76) can destabilize the E. coli membrane. CD measurements showed that the alpha-helicity of peptide Leu(49)-Thr(76) increased from 3.5 to 36% by addition of the vesicles. When E. coli cells were incubated with peptide Leu(49)-Thr(76), some proteins were released to the external medium, probably owing to membrane destabilization caused by the peptide. In electron micrographs of E. coli cells treated with peptide Leu(49)-Thr(76), transparent nucleoids and granulated cytoplasm were observed. Amino acid substitutions, Phe(52)Phe(53)-->AlaAla (Phe(52, 53)-->Ala) in peptide Leu(49)-Thr(76) caused the loss of antimicrobial activity against E. coli, although protein-releasing activity was retained. Electron micrographs of the cells treated with peptide Leu(49)-Thr(76)(Phe(52,53)-->Ala) revealed morphological change only at the nucleoids. Therefore peptide Leu(49)-Thr(76) appears to primarily target the cytoplasm rather than the membrane of E. coli cells.
