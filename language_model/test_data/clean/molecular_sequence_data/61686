We describe the isolation of zebrafish growth factor independent 1 (gfi1) and present an analysis of its pattern of expression during early development. As with its murine homologue, gfi1 expression is detected in the ganglion cells of the neural retina and in developing hair cells of the ear. In keeping with a role in the development of sensory hair cells, gfi1 is also expressed in neuromasts of the anterior and posterior lateral line system. Finally, gfi1 is expressed in the developing epithalamus in the dorsal diencephalon where its transcription is restricted to the parapineal.
