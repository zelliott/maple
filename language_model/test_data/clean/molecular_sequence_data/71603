The peptide Val-Arg-Arg-Pro-Asn-Leu-His-Pro-Ser-Phe-Ile-Ala-Ile-Pro-Pro- Lys-Lys-Ile, which corresponds to residues 84-101 of human kappa-casein, has been synthesized and its conformation preferences determined by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in dimethyl sulphoxide. The peptide adopted a largely extended chain conformation in solution and there was evidence for the presence of a beta-turn involving residues Pro87-His90 of human kappa-casein. The presence of a turn in this position would make the physiologically significant Arg85 residue of human kappa-casein (which is equivalent to Arg97 in bovine kappa-casein) unavailable for interaction with Asp249 of bovine chymosin, and may partly explain why human kappa-casein is hydrolysed more slowly than its bovine counterpart by bovine chymosin.
