We previously identified a 20KDa membrane glycoprotein 1F5 antigen which inhibits the assembly of homologous complement membrane attack complexes and we designate it as HRF20 standing for 20KDa homologous restriction factor. The amino acid sequence deduced from its coding base sequence resembles that of T cell activating protein, most conspicuously in cysteine residues, 10 out of 11 of which occupy identical positions in an overall sequence homology of 24.8%. Furthermore, proliferation of human T cells was stimulated by monoclonal antibody to HRF20.
