We analyzed 52 blood samples obtained independently from among individuals, who had never practiced the intravenous administration of drugs, for the purpose of detecting the subtypes of HIV-1 that circulated during 1999-2002. The study materials were analyzed by the methods of gag/env heteroduplex mobility assay and by env gp120 C2-V3 sequencing. Four viral subtypes (A,B,C and G) and a recombinant gagA/envB were detected in subjects contaminated through heterosexual contacts. Noteworthily, HIV-1 variations of subtype A, which were found in 22 (73.3%) of 30 analyzed samples, were predominant in this risk group. An analysis of nucleotide sequences exposed a high degree of homology between the viruses, detected previously among drug-addicts, and the isolates detected by us in subjects contaminated heterosexually. However, HIV-1, subtype B, detected by us in all 16 studied cases, still continue to circulate among the males infected through homosexual contacts with men.
