The restriction endonuclease AatII was purified from cell-free extracts of Acetobacter aceti IFO 3281 by streptomycin treatment, ammonium sulfate fractionation, combined column chromatographies on DEAE-Toyopearl 650S, heparin-Sepharose CL-6B and DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B and FPLC on Mono Q and on Superose 12 (gel filtration). The purified enzyme was homogeneous on SDS-polyacrylamide gel disk electrophoresis. The relative molecular mass of the purified enzyme was 190,000 daltons by gel filtration. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel disk electrophoresis gave the relative molecular mass of 47,500 daltons. These data indicated that the purified, native enzyme is a tetramer (190,000 daltons) composed of four 47,500-dalton subunits. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was 6.0. The purified enzyme was intensely activated by manganese ion (50-fold increase or more when compared with magnesium ion). The enzyme worked best at 37 degrees C and pH 8.5 in a reaction mixture (50 microliters) containing 1.0 micrograms lambda DNA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 7 mM MnCl2 and 50 mM NaCl. The enzyme recognizes the same palindromic hexanucleotide sequence 5'-GACGTC-3', cuts between T and C and produces a 3'-tetranucleotide extension in the presence of MnCl2, as it does in the presence of MgCl2.
