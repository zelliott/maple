The ribosomal protein MvaS7 from the methanogenic archaeon Methanococcus vannielii is a protein of 188 amino acids, i.e., it is 42 amino acids longer than previously suggested. The triplet TTG serves as a start codon. The methanogenic translation initiation region that includes the rare TTG start codon is recognized in Escherichia coli.
