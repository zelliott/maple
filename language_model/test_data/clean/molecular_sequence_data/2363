The sulfur-regulatory circuit of Neurospora crassa consists of a set of unlinked structural genes which encode sulfur-catabolic enzymes and two major regulatory genes which govern their expression. The positive-acting cys-3 regulatory gene is required to turn on the expression of the sulfur-related enzymes, whereas the other regulatory gene, scon, acts in a negative fashion to repress the synthesis of the same set of enzymes. Expression of the cys-3 regulatory gene was found to be controlled by scon and by sulfur availability. The nucleotide sequence of the cys-3 gene was determined and can be translated to yield a protein of molecular weight 25,892 which displays significant homology with the oncogene protein Fos, yeast GCN4 protein, and sea urchin histone H1. Moreover, the putative cys-3 protein has a well-defined leucine zipper element plus an adjacent charged region which together may make up a DNA-binding site. A cys-3 mutant and a cys-3 temperature-sensitive mutant lead to substitutions of glutamine for basic amino acids within the charged region and thus may alter DNA-binding properties of the cys-3 protein.
