The mechanisms for the control of ribosomal protein synthesis have been characterized in detail in Eukarya and in Bacteria. In Archaea, only the regulation of the MvaL1 operon (encoding ribosomal proteins MvaL1, MvaL10, and MvaL12) of the mesophilic Methanococcus vannielii has been extensively investigated. As in Bacteria, regulation takes place at the level of translation. The regulator protein MvaL1 binds preferentially to its binding site on the 23S rRNA, and, when in excess, binds to the regulatory target site on its mRNA and thus inhibits translation of all three cistrons of the operon. The regulatory binding site on the mRNA, a structural mimic of the respective binding site on the 23S rRNA, is located within the structural gene about 30 nucleotides downstream of the ATG start codon. MvaL1 blocks a step before or at the formation of the first peptide bond of MvaL1. Here we demonstrate that a similar regulatory mechanism exists in the thermophilic M. thermolithotrophicus and M. jannaschii. The L1 gene is cotranscribed together with the L10 and L11 gene, in all genera of the Euryarchaeota branch of the Archaea studied so far. A potential regulatory L1 binding site located within the structural gene, as in Methanococcus, was found in Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and in Pyrococcus horikoshii. In contrast, in Archaeoglobus fulgidus a typical L1 binding site is located in the untranslated leader of the L1 gene as described for the halophilic Archaea. In Sulfolobus, a member of the Crenarchaeota, the L1 gene is part of a long transcript (encoding SecE, NusG, L11, L1, L10, L12). A previously suggested regulatory L1 target site located within the L11 structural gene could not be confirmed as an L1 binding site.
