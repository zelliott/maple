A cDNA clone, named XF41, that encodes an RNA-binding protein was isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana. The deduced protein, named AtRBP1, contains two conserved consensus sequence-type RNA-binding domains (CS-RBDs) in the N-terminal half, a putative PY motif (a target of a WW domain) in the center, and uncharacterized C-terminal domain. A binding assay demonstrated that the AtRBP1 can bind to single-stranded nucleic acids in vitro. Analysis of localization of the GUS activity of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants that have the chimeric gene containing the upstream sequence of the AtRBP1 gene and GUS gene demonstrated that the AtRBP1 gene is expressed in meristematic tissues such as the vegetative shoot apex and root tips, developing organs such as floral buds and pistils of young flowers, abscission layers of immature siliques and junctions of pedicels. Considering the specificity of the expression, AtRBP1 may be required in the progress of cell proliferation.
