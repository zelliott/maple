In the current study we report the isolation of 854 base pairs of the rat mannose receptor promoter. Analysis of the sequence revealed one Sp1 site, three PU.1 sites, and a potential TATA box (TTTAAA) 33 base pairs 5' of the transcriptional start site. The tissue specificity of the promoter was determined using transient transfections. The promoter was most active in the mature macrophage cell line NR8383 although the promoter also showed activity in the monocytic cell line RAW. No activity was observed in pre-monocytic cell lines or epithelial cell lines. Mutation of the TTTAAA sequence to TTGGAA resulted in a 50% decrease in activity in transient transfection assays suggesting that the promoter contains a functional TATA box. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and mutagenesis we established that the transcription factors Sp1, PU.1, and USF bound to the mannose receptor promoter, but only PU.1 and USF contributed to activation. Transient transfections using a dominant negative construct of USF resulted in a 50% decrease in mannose receptor promoter activity, further establishing the role of USF in activating the rat mannose receptor promoter. Comparison of the rat, mouse, and human sequence demonstrated that some binding sites are not conserved. Gel shifts were performed to investigate differences in protein binding between species. USF bound to the rat and human promoter but not to the mouse promoter, suggesting that different mechanisms are involved in regulation of mannose receptor expression in these species. From these results we conclude that, similar to other myeloid promoters, transcription of the rat mannose receptor is regulated by binding of PU.1 and a ubiquitous factor at an adjacent site. However, unlike other myeloid promoters, we have identified USF as the ubiquitous factor, and demonstrated that the promoter contains a functional TATA box.
