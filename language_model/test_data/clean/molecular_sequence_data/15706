One of the biggest challenges facing evolutionary biologists is to identify and understand loci that explain fitness variation in natural populations. This review describes how genetic (linkage) mapping with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers can lead to great progress in this area. Strategies for SNP discovery and SNP genotyping are described and an overview of how to model SNP genotype information in mapping studies is presented. Finally, the opportunity afforded by new generation sequencing and typing technologies to map fitness genes by genome-wide association studies is discussed.
