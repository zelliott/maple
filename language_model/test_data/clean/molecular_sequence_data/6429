Corneal endothelial cells are differentiated cells and are thus incapable of physiologic regeneration. In a search for a growth factor that would promote optimal proliferation of corneal endothelial cells in the absence of other modulating activities, the effect of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) on rabbit corneal endothelial cells was studied. In addition, cellular effector molecules responsible for the signal pathway for IGF-I were studied. IGF-I at 50 ng/ml stimulated corneal endothelial cell proliferation after at least 8 h of treatment. IGF-I did not change cell shape of corneal endothelial cells: the cells treated with IGF-I at 50 ng/ml maintained polygonal morphology regardless of the duration of exposure. IGF-I did not alter collagen phenotypes either qualitatively or quantitatively: the treated cells continued to synthesize types IV and VIII collagen, as did the control cells. The steady-state levels of alpha 2(I) collagen RNA and alpha 2(IV) RNA were not altered by IGF-I treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that IGF-I is present in corneal endothelium in vivo, while the underlying Descemet's membrane demonstrated no staining. Corneal endothelial cells also produce IGF binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2), which appears to bind IGF-I that has been introduced exogenously in the medium. Further investigation as to how the signals of IGF-I were transmitted for the biological activities demonstrated that the expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is up-regulated by IGF-I treatment, while PLC-gamma 1 expression is not altered by this growth factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
