The primary structures of two variants of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) plasma retinol-binding protein (RBP) were determined and found to be approximately 60% identical with those of both human and Xenopus laevis RBPs. The comparable sequence similarities that we have found agree with the estimate of similar divergence times between bony fishes and mammals and between bony fishes and amphibians. The two piscine RBP variants differ by six amino acid substitutions at positions that are not crucial for the interaction with retinol, on the basis of the human RBP three-dimensional structure [Cowan, S. W., Newcomer, M. E. & Jones, T. A. (1990) Proteins Struct. Func. Genet. 8, 44-61]. 2. Models were developed for the three-dimensional structures of rainbow trout and X. laevis RBPs, based on that of human RBP. The overall three-dimensional structure appears to be very well preserved for RBPs isolated from vertebrate species for which the divergence time is 350-400 million years. At variance with an almost absolute conservation for the residues that participate in the formation of the retinol binding site in mammalian RBPs, several amino acid replacements are found for this part of the RBP molecule when the comparison is extended to piscine and amphibian RBPs. However, the only allowed amino acid replacements are either conservative or more than 0.4 nm distant from retinol. Besides the retinol binding site, a few regions at the protein surface appear to be rather conserved during phylogenetic development of vertebrates and, therefore, might be involved in molecular interactions.
