The Streptomyces lividans DnaA protein (73 kDa) consists, like the Escherichia coli DnaA protein (52 kDa), of four domains. The larger size of the S. lividans protein is due to an additional stretch of 120 predominantly acidic amino acids within domain II. The S. lividans protein was overproduced as a His-tagged fusion protein. The purified protein (isoelectric point, 5.7) has a weak ATPase activity. By DNase I footprinting studies, each of the 17 DnaA boxes (consensus sequence, TTGTCCACA) in the S. lividans oriC region was found to be protected by the DnaA fusion protein. Purified mutant proteins carrying a deletion of the C-terminally located helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif or with amino acid substitutions in helix A (L577G) or helix B (R595A) no longer interact with DnaA boxes. A substitution of basic amino acids in the loop of the HLH motif (R587A or R589A) entailed the formation of S. lividans mutant DnaA proteins with little or no capacity for binding to DnaA boxes. Thus, like in E. coli, the C-terminally located domain IV is absolutely necessary for the specific binding of DnaA. A mutant protein lacking a stretch of acidic amino acids corresponding to domain II is not affected in its DNA binding capacity. Whether the acidic domain II interacts with accessory proteins remains to be elucidated.
