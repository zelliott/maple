DNA sequencing data showed that five clinical isolates of Escherichia coli with reduced susceptibility to ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime contain an ampC gene that is preceded by a strong promoter. Transcription from the strong promoter was 8- to 18-fold higher than that from the promoter from a susceptible isolate. RNA studies showed that mRNA stability does not play a role in the control of AmpC synthesis.
