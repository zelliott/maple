The calpain inhibitor N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN) has been reported to have complex effects on the production of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta). In this study, the effects of ALLN on the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to Abeta were examined in 293 cells expressing APP or the C-terminal 100 amino acids of APP (C100). In cells expressing APP or low levels of C100, ALLN increased Abeta40 and Abeta42 secretion at low concentrations, decreased Abeta40 and Abeta42 secretion at high concentrations, and increased cellular levels of C100 in a concentration-dependent manner by inhibiting C100 degradation. Low concentrations of ALLN increased Abeta42 secretion more dramatically than Abeta40 secretion. ALLN treatment of cells expressing high levels of C100 did not alter cellular C100 levels and inhibited Abeta40 and Abeta42 secretion with similar IC50 values. These results suggest that C100 can be processed both by gamma-secretase and by a degradation pathway that is inhibited by low concentrations of ALLN. The data are consistent with inhibition of gamma-secretase by high concentrations of ALLN but do not support previous assertions that ALLN is a selective inhibitor of the gamma-secretase producing Abeta40. Rather, Abeta42 secretion may be more dependent on C100 substrate concentration than Abeta40 secretion.
