Loss of tumor suppressor gene function is essential in the multistep progression of cells to neoplasia. Immortalized cells were established by carcinogen treatment of Syrian hamster embryo cells. At early passages, these nontumorigenic cells retained the ability to suppress tumorigenicity in cell hybrids with malignant cells. Upon passage and subcloning of these suppressor-positive (supB+) cells, variant clones that had lost tumor suppressor activity were isolated. These suppressor-negative (supB-) clones remained nontumorigenic. The mRNAs encoding collagen II(alpha 1a), a chondrocyte differentiation marker, and H19, a developmentally controlled gene, were more abundant in supB+ cells than in supB- cells. Nuclear run-on analysis indicated that the transcription of these genes is differentially regulated. Transient transfection experiments revealed that a cis-acting element in the rat collagen II 5' flanking sequences directs differentially regulated transcription. Gel retention analysis demonstrated the presence of a nuclear DNA-binding factor(s) that specifically recognizes a DNA sequence common to both the rat collagen II sequences and the mouse H19 enhancer. In one set of clones, transcriptional regulation could account for differential collagen II and H19 expression in supB+ and supB- cells. In another set of clones, posttranscriptional controls are responsible for the decreased expression of these genes in supB- cells. The emergence of two independent mechanisms that cause differential expression of collagen II and H19 related to tumor suppressor loss suggests that coordinate regulation of these genes, or others regulated by common mechanisms, may be important in tumor suppression.
