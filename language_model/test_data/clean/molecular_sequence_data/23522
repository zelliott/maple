Metal ions play significant roles in most biological systems. Over the past two decades, there has been significant interest in the redesign of existing metal binding sites in proteins/peptides and the introduction of metals into folded proteins/peptides. Recent research has focused on the effects of metal binding on the overall secondary and tertiary conformations of unstructured peptides/proteins. In this context, de novo design of metallopeptides has become a valuable approach for studying the consequence of metal binding. It has been seen that metal ions not only direct folding of partially folded peptides but have at times also been the elixir for properly folding random-coil-like structures in stable secondary conformations. Work in our group has focused on binding of heavy metal ions such as Hg(II) to de novo designed alpha-helical three stranded coiled coil peptides with sequences based on the heptad repeat motif. Removal from or addition of a heptad to the parent 30-residue TRI peptide with the amino acid sequence Ac-G(LKALEEK)(4)G-NH(2) generated peptides whose self-aggregation affinities were seen to be dependent on their lengths. It was noted that adjustment in the position of the thiol from an "a" position in the case of the shorter BabyL9C to a "d" position for BabyL12C resulted in a peptide with low association affinities for itself, weaker binding with Hg(II), and a considerably faster kinetic profile for metal insertion. Similar differences in thermodynamic and kinetic parameters were also noted for the longer TRI peptides. At the same time, metal insertion into the prefolded and longer TRI and Grand peptides has clearly demonstrated that the metal binding is both thermodynamically as well kinetically different from that to unassociated peptides.
