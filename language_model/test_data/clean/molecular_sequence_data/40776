Fourteen avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1; Newcastle disease) viruses isolated from dead free-living and domestic pigeons in Slovenia between 2000 and 2008 were analyzed by a molecular characterization of a part of the fusion protein gene, which included the region encoding the fusion protein cleavage site. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Slovene pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1) viruses do not cluster together but instead are divided into two groups--4bi and 4bii--of sublineage 4b. Nine Slovenian strains were placed in group 4bii. Five other strains clustered together with PPMV-1 from group 4bi. The sequence of the fusion protein cleavage site of all Slovenian strains was typical for pathogenic APMV-1. The 112RRQKRF117 motif was present in the strains from group 4bii, whereas strains from group 4bi displayed the 112GRQKRF117 motif.
