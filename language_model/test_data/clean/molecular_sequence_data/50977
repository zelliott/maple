Under the influence of maturation-inducing hormone (MIH) secreted from follicle cells, oocyte maturation is finally triggered by maturation-promoting factor (MPF), which consists of a homolog of the cdc2+ gene product of fission yeast (p34cdc2) and cyclin B. Two species of cyclin B clones were isolated from a cDNA library constructed from mature goldfish oocytes. Sequence comparisons revealed that these two clones are highly homologous (95%) and were found to be similar to Xenopus cyclin B1. Using monoclonal antibodies against Escherichia coli-produced goldfish cyclin B and the PSTAIR sequence of p34cdc2, we examined the levels of cyclin B and p34cdc2 proteins during goldfish oocyte maturation induced in vitro by 17 alpha, 20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17 alpha, 20 beta-DP), a natural MIH in fish. Protein p34cdc2 was found in immature oocyte extracts and did not remarkably change during oocyte maturation. Cyclin B was not detected in immature oocyte extracts and appeared when oocytes underwent germinal vesicle breakdown. Cyclin B that appeared during oocyte maturation was labelled with [35S]methionine, indicating its de novo synthesis. Introduction of E. coli-produced cyclin B into immature oocyte extracts induced p34cdc2 (MPF) activation. Although the possibility that immature goldfish oocytes contain an insoluble cyclin B is not completely excluded, these results strongly suggest that 17 alpha, 20 beta-DP induces oocytes to synthesize cyclin B, which in turn activates preexisting p34cdc2, forming active MPF.
