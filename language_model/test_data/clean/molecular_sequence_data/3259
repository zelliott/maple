The secreted signaling molecule Hedgehog regulates gene expression in target cells in part by preventing proteolysis of the full-length Cubitus interruptus (Ci-155) transcriptional activator to the Ci-75 repressor form. Ci-155 proteolysis depends on phosphorylation at three sites by Protein Kinase A (PKA). We show that these phosphoserines prime further phosphorylation at adjacent Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3) and Casein Kinase I (CK1) sites. Alteration of the GSK3 or CK1 sites prevents Ci-155 proteolysis and activates Ci in the absence of Hedgehog. Ci-155 proteolysis is also inhibited if cells lack activity of the Drosophila GSK3, Shaggy, previously implicated in Wingless signaling. Conversely, Ci-155 levels are reduced in Hedgehog-responding cells by overexpression of PKA and the Drosophila CK1, Double-time, a regulator of circadian rhythms.
