Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase cDNA clones have been isolated from an adult rat heart cDNA library and the nucleotide sequence of the Ca2+-ATPase mRNA determined. The sequence has an open reading frame of 997 codons. It is identical to a cDNA isolated from a rat stomach cDNA library and 90% isologous to the rabbit and human slow/cardiac cDNAs. Nuclease S1 mapping analysis indicates that this sequence corresponds to the main Ca2+-ATPase mRNA present in heart and in slow skeletal muscle and that it is expressed in various proportions in smooth and non-muscle tissues, together with another isoform which differs from the cardiac form in the sequence of its 3'-end.
