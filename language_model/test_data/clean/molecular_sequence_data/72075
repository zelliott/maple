To identify early changes in gene expression during the fast-to-slow transition induced by chronic low-frequency stimulation, total RNA was extracted from 12-h-stimulated tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of rats and amplified by differential display RT-PCR. Among the signals of differentially expressed mRNAs, a cDNA approximately 300 bp in length, which was almost undetectable in control TA muscles but prominent in stimulated TA and normal soleus muscles, was identified. This cDNA was cloned and identified as corresponding to the mRNA of the muscle LIM protein (MLP). Its differential expression in control, stimulated TA, and soleus muscles was verified by Northern blotting. Antibodies against MLP were used to identify by immunoblot analysis a protein of 22 kDa, the predicted molecular mass of MLP. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong reactivity for MLP in all fibers of normal soleus muscle and faint staining of some type IIA and type I fibers in control TA muscle. These fibers increased in number and staining intensity in 4-day-stimulated TA muscle. MLP thus seems to play an essential role during the rearrangement of cytoskeletal and/or myofibrillar structures in transforming adult muscle fibers.
