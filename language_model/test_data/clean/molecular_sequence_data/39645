The design of antiviral strategies against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been largely derived from studies of subtype B viruses, although they constitute only 12% of infections worldwide. At 50% of all HIV-1 infections worldwide, subtype C viruses are the most predominant. Here, we present evidence that subtype C Nefs display functional Pak2-activating motifs that differ from those found in subtype B and E Nefs. The identification of multiple Pak2-activating structural motifs that singly affect one Nef activity revealed a functional plasticity that has implications for future drug and vaccine design aimed at HIV-1 Nef and its effects on the deregulation of the immune system.
