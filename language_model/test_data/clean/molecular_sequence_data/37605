One of the early genes in aflatoxin biosynthesis, avnA, encodes a pathway-specific cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase that catalyzes the hydroxylation of the polyketide anthraquinone, averantin. Based on beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, promoter sites upstream of -118 bp in the 367-bp verB-avnA intergenic region are not required for avnA gene activity. Therefore, only the -100 to -110 site of the four putative binding sites for AFLR, the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway transcription regulatory protein (consensus binding sequence: 5'-TCGN(5)CGR-3') was required for elevated avnA expression.
