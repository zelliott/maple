Aquaporins have been identified based on highly conserved two asparagine-proline-alanine (NPA) boxes that are important for the formation of a water-permeating pore. Some aquaporin-like sequences, however, have less conserved NPA boxes. Although they have lower homology with conventional aquaporins, they should be included in aquaporin family based on their conserved six transmembrane domains and hydrophobic NPA box-like repeats. They are widely distributed in multicellular organisms. Only SIPs from plants and AQP11/12 from mammals were examined previously and found to be localized inside the cell. Intracellular localization will be a common feature of these aquaporin-like proteins since most of them have positively charged amino acid clusters at the carboxy-termini similar to di-lysine motif (-KKXX) for an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. Accordingly, they are tentatively named subcellular-aquaporins in this review. Currently, studies on their functions and biological roles are limited. SIPs were shown to function as water channels and the disruption of AQP11 produced neonatally fatal polycystic kidneys. Further works on subcellular-aquaporins will reveal new insights into the roles of aquaporins.
