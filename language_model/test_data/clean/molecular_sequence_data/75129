A frog alpha-tubulin cDNA and a frog alpha-tubulin gene, closely related to the cDNA, were cloned and sequenced and the structure of the gene deduced. The gene was introduced into mouse L-cells in order to investigate the transcription and regulation of the gene. The gene was transcribed and there was processing of the transcripts. Furthermore, the gene displayed the correct autoregulatory feedback control.
