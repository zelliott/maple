Null mutations in the prune gene of Drosophila melanogaster result in prune eye color due to reductions in red pigment accumulation. When one copy of the awd(Killer of prune) mutant gene is present in a prune background, the animals die. The cause of prune/Killer of prune lethality remains unknown. The genomic region characterized for the prune locus is transcriptionally active and complex, with multiple and overlapping transcripts. Despite the transcriptional complexity of the genomic region of prune, accumulated evidence suggests that the prune locus is small and consists of a single transcription unit, since every prune allele to date exhibits both prune eye color and prune/Killer of prune lethality. A functional prune product from a single, full-length cDNA was identified in this study that can rescue both the eye phenotype and prune/Killer of prune lethality. The DNA sequences of several mutant prune alleles along with Western blot analysis of mutant proteins provide convincing evidence that prune mutations are nulls, and that the cDNA identified in this study encodes the only product of the prune locus.
