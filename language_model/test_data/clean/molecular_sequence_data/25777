A series of chemically synthesized oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing one or two ribonucleotides (DNA/RNA mixed polymers) at and/or adjacent to the cleavage site of the substrate can be cleaved by the "hammerhead" ribozyme. In comparison with the all-RNA substrate, the predominantly deoxyribonucleotide substrates have (1) lower optimal temperatures of cleavage, (2) approximately 6-fold higher Km's and 7-fold lower kcat's at 30 degrees C, and (3) 15-fold higher Km's and 8-fold lower kcat's at 37 degrees C. The extent to which the RNA substrate cleavage is inhibited in the presence of an all-DNA (KI = 13 microM) and an RNA substrate analogue with a dC at the cleavage site (KI = 0.96 microM) supports the contention that the formation of the ribozyme-substrate complex with the predominantly deoxyribonucleotide substrates (D substrates) is impaired. The weaker binding of D substrates was confirmed by thermal denaturation and determination of the Tm of the complex. Analysis of the kinetic data also suggests that the conformation of the catalytic core of the ribozyme-substrate complex differs from that of the all-RNA complex, a change that results from the presence of a DNA/RNA heteroduplex in the complex.
