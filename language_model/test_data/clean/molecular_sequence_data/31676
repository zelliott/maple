A 94-kb integrative conjugative element (ICESluvan) transferable to Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis from an animal isolate of Streptococcus lutetiensis consists of a mosaic of genetic fragments from different Gram-positive bacteria. A variant of ICESluvan was confirmed in S. lutetiensis from a patient. A complete Tn5382/Tn1549 with a vanB2 operon is integrated into a streptococcal ICESde3396-like region harboring a putative bacteriophage exclusion system, a putative agglutinin receptor precursor, and key components of a type IV secretion system. Moreover, ICESluvan encodes a putative MobC family mobilization protein and a relaxase and, thus, in total has all genetic components essential for conjugative transfer. A 9-kb element within Tn5382/Tn1549 encodes, among others, putative proteins similar to the TnpX site-specific recombinase in Faecalibacterium and VanZ in Paenibacillus, which may contribute to the detected low-level teicoplanin resistance. Furthermore, ICESluvan encodes a novel bacitracin resistance locus that is associated with reduced susceptibility to bacitracin when transferred to E. faecium. The expression of a streptococcal pezAT toxin-antitoxin-encoding operon of ICESluvan in S. lutetiensis, E. faecium, and E. faecalis was confirmed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, indicating an active toxin-antitoxin system which may contribute to stabilizing ICESluvan within new hosts. Junction PCR and DNA sequencing confirmed that ICESluvan excised to form a circular intermediate in S. lutetiensis, E. faecalis, and E. faecium. Transfer between E. faecalis cells was observed in the presence of helper plasmid pIP964. Sequence analysis of the original S. lutetiensis donor and enterococcal transconjugants showed that ICESluvan integrates in a site-specific manner into the C-terminal end of the chromosomal tRNA methyltransferase gene rumA.
