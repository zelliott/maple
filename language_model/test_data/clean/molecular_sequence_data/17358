Thirty-six isolates of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of two clones. One clone carried a bla(IMP-1) gene identical to that first described in Japan. The other clone carried a bla(IMP-1) variant containing four silent mutations. One isolate with a unique pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern contained bla(IMP-7).
