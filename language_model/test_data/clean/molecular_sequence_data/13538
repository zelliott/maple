A highly repeated DNA sequence with a repeat unit of ca. 180 bp was found in genomic DNA HindIII-digests of Raphanus sativus. The repeating units of six isolated, independent clones were sequenced. These units have 177 or 178 bp, are 36% G+C in their DNA base composition, and show 90% sequence homology. The copy number of this 180-bp repeat unit is about 0.5 x 10(6) per diploid genome. In situ hybridization analysis with the repeating units as the probe and C-banding analysis indicated that the repeated DNA sequence of R. sativus is closely associated with the major C-heterochromatins in the proximal regions of all 18 chromosomes at mitotic metaphase.
