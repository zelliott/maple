In the Yersinia pseudotuberculosis serotyping scheme, 21 serotypes are present originating from about 30 different O-factors distributed within the species. With regard to the chemical structures of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and the genetic basis of their biosynthesis, a number, but not all, of Y. pseudotuberculosis strains representing different serotypes have been investigated. In order to present an overall picture of the relationship between genetics and structures, we have been working on the genetics and structures of various Y. pseudotuberculosis O-specific polysaccharides (OPSs). Here, we present a structural and genetic analysis of the Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype O:11 OPS. Our results showed that this OPS structure has the same backbone as that of Y. pseudotuberculosis O:1b, but with a 6d-L-Altf side-branch instead of Parf. The 3' end of the gene cluster is the same as that for O:1b and has the genes for synthesis of the backbone and for processing the completed repeat unit. The 5' end has genes for synthesis of 6d-L-Altf and its transfer to the repeating unit backbone. The pathway for the synthesis of the 6d-L-Altf appears to be different from that for 6d-L-Altp in Y. enterocolitica O:3. The chemical structure of the O:11 repeating unit is [structure: see text].
