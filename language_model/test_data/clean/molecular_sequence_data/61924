The membrane fusion process mediated by the gp41 transmembrane envelope glycoprotein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was addressed by a flow cytometry assay detecting exchanges of fluorescent membrane probes (DiI and DiO) between cells expressing the HIV-1 envelope proteins (Env) and target cells. Double-fluorescent cells were detected when target cells expressed the type of chemokine receptor, CXCR4 or CCR5, matching the type of gp120 surface envelope protein, X4 or R5, respectively. Background levels of double-fluorescent cells were observed when the gp120-receptor interaction was blocked by AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist. The L568A mutation in the N-terminal heptad repeat (HR1) of gp41 resulted in parallel inhibition of the formation of syncytia and double-fluorescent cells, indicating that gp41 had a direct role in the exchange of fluorescent probes. In contrast, three mutations in the loop region of the gp41 ectodomain, located on either side of the Cys-(X)(5)-Cys motif (W596 M and W610A) or at the distal end of HR1 (D589L), had limited or no apparent effect on membrane lipid mixing between Env(+) and target cells, while they blocked formation of syncytia and markedly reduced the exchanges of cytoplasmic fluorescent probes. The loop region could therefore have a direct or indirect role in events occurring after the merging of membranes, such as the formation or dilation of fusion pores. Two types of inhibitors of HIV-1 entry, the gp41-derived peptide T20 and the betulinic acid derivative RPR103611, had limited effects on membrane exchanges at concentrations blocking or markedly reducing syncytium formation. This finding confirmed that T20 can inhibit the late steps of membrane fusion (post-lipid mixing) and brought forth an indirect argument for the role of the gp41 loop region in these steps, as mutations conferring resistance to RPR103611V were mapped in this region (I595S or L602H).
