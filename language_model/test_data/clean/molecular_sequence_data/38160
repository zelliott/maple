Brain mitochondrial carrier protein-1 (BMCP1), a new member of the mitochondrial uncoupling carrier, has been shown to be expressed predominantly in the brain of the mice and humans. We cloned rat BMCP1 cDNA and investigated its mRNA level during postnatal development and under various metabolic conditions. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA revealed that rat BMCP1 protein was composed of 322 amino acid residues, and was 99 and 96% identical to the mouse and human proteins and 29, 33 and 35% identical to rat uncoupling protein (UCP) 1, UCP2 and UCP3, respectively. The molecular weight was predicted to be 36017 Da and the protein of this size was detectable when the cDNA was expressed in vitro. Using Northern blot analysis, the corresponding mRNA, approximately 1.8-kb in size, was found expressed predominantly in the cerebrum, cerebellum and hypothalamus. A unique developmental pattern was identified in the brain, where BMCP1 expression was low in their fetal life, but significantly elevated in the first postnatal week. Thereafter BMCP1 mRNA was maintained to be gradually increased. In 48-h fasted or insulin-induced hypoglycemic rats, BMCP1 mRNA expression in the hypothalamus slightly, but significantly, decreased compared with that in their appropriate controls. The present results indicate that BMCP1 may be involved in pathogenesis of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons induced by aging or neurodegenerative disorders, and perhaps in energy balance in the brain.
