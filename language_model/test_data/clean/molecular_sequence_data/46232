The correlations between Y chromosome polymorphisms and the carcass traits were studied in five Chinese beef cattle populations by PCR, single strand conformation polymorphism and Y-STR sequence analysis. Nine alleles and their frequencies were identified on Y-STR UMN0929 region in Qinchuan (n=116), Luxi (n=112), Jinnan (n=104) pure breeds, Simmental×Qinchuan crossbred (n=80) and Angus×Qinchuan crossbred (n=96). The most popular A-176 and B-178 alleles were presented in all 5 cattle populations in the range of 12% (Jinnan) to 66% (Simmental×Qinchuan). The allele I-194 presented Luxi and Angus×Qinchuan. In Qinchun cattle, G-190 and E-186 alleles had bigger effect on BPI (4.23±0.32 and 4.22±0.48 kg/cm, P<0.01) and CW (325.40±49.42 and 316.73±45.29 kg, P<0.01), respectively. In Luxi cattle, I-194 allele affected higher BPI (4.08±0.35 kg/cm, P<0.01) and CW (302.07±17.55 kg, P<0.01), respectively. In Jinnan cattle breed, H-192 had higher BPI (4.32±0.50 kg/cm, P<0.05) and CW (327.87±59.37 kg, P<0.05), respectively. In Simmental×Qinchuan cross breed, C-180 allele affected largely on BPI (5.16±0.25 kg/cm, P<0.05) and CW (393.16±25.92 kg, P<0.05). In Angus×Qinchuan cross breed, I-194 had higher BPI (4.43±0.33 kg, P<0.05) and CW (346.63±29.77 kg, P<0.05). Correlations between alleles and other carcass traits (net meat weight, top grade weight, slaughter rate, net meat rate, loin-eye muscle area, carcass length, meet tenderness and shear force) were also analyzed using mixed-effect model. Cattle Y-STR UMN0929 loci alleles and its correlation with carcass traits in beef cattle populations could be implemented into the cattle breeding program for choosing beef cattle with better carcass traits.
