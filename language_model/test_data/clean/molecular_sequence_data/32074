The paper presents the results of designing a technology for the manufacture of enzyme immunoassay kits to detect class G antibodies to the Echinococcus granulosus antigen EgF with a molecular weight of 16.7 kDa in sheep. According to the results of field trials on flocks of sheep from various age groups, the diagnostic efficiency of the test system was 78.1% sensitivity and 73.9% specificity. The proposed test system may be used during mass sheep screenings for the epizootic monitoring of the prevalence ofechinococcosis in the Russian Federation, for the serological diagnosis of this disease in the female livestock at the level of a flock.
