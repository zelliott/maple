A 6-nucleotide insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region of the thymidylate synthase gene was shown to influence mRNA stability, but the molecular basis of this effect has not been elucidated. Here, studies of both endogenous and ectopically expressed thymidylate synthase alleles revealed that the mRNA-binding, decay-promoting protein AUF1 has higher affinity for allele D mRNA. AUF1 overexpression preferentially suppressed D allele mRNA levels, whereas AUF1 silencing selectively elevated D allele mRNA levels. Our results illustrate the functional consequences of ribonucleoprotein associations involving a polymorphic RNA sequence and uncover a novel mechanism of action for non-coding RNA polymorphisms.
