Atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) comprise an important group of paediatric pathogens. Atypical EPEC have reservoirs in farm and domestic animals where they can be either commensal or pathogenic; serogroup O26 is dominant in humans and animals. Central to intestinal colonization by EPEC is the translocation of the type III secretion system effector Tir into enterocytes, which following phosphorylation (Tir-Yp) recruits Nck to activate the N-WASP actin signalling cascade. The authors have recently shown that typical EPEC strains, belonging to the EPEC-2 lineage, carry a tir gene encoding Tir-Yp and can also use the alternative TccP2 actin-signalling cascade. The aim of this study was to determine if tccP2 is found in atypical EPEC isolated from human and farm animals. tccP2 was found at a frequency of 41% in non-O26 EPEC isolates and in 82.3% of the O26 strains. TccP2 of human and animal strains show high level of sequence identity. It is shown that most strains carry a tir gene encoding Tir-Yp. In addition the authors identified two new variants of tir genes in EPEC O104:H12 and NT:H19 strains.
