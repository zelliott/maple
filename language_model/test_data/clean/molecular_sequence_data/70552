Cofactors of LIM homeodomain proteins (CLIM) are transcriptional activators that associate with the LIM homeoproteins and coordinate transcription. LIM homeoproteins and CLIMs are involved in a variety of developmental processes. Two CLIMs, CLIM1 and CLIM2, have been identified in the mouse. Here we report the isolation of human CLIM1 and CLIM2 cDNAs and the determination of their chromosome locations by using a human-rodent monochromosomal hybrid cell panel and a radiation hybrid mapping panel. The proteins deduced from human CLIM1 and CLIM2 cDNAs were composed of 373 and 375 amino acids, respectively, and had 97.3% and 98.7% amino acid identity, respectively, to their mouse counterparts. Human CLIM1 and CLIM2 proteins were 75.5% identical. Human CLIM1 and CLIM2 genes were mapped to the chromosome on 4p15.3 and 10q24-q25 regions, respectively. Mapping of a pair of developmentally important genes may provide new clues to the understanding of genetic disorders caused by these chromosome regions.
