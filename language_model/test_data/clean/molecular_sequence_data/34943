B. subtilis dihydroorotase is an important enzyme in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway and encoded by pyrC gene in pyr operon. pyrC was amplified from B. subtilis genomic DNA and cloned into expression vector pET21-DEST. Dihydroorotase was expressed soluble form in E. coli and purified. The protein was crystallized and diffracted to 2.2 A. The crystal belongs to P2(1)2(1)2(1) space-group, with unit cell parameters a = 48.864 A, b = 84.99 A, c = 203.05 A. There are 2 molecules per asymmetry unit.
