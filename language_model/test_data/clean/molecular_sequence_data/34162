Leaf curl disease of tobacco (TbLCD) is endemic in India. A monopartite Begomovirus, a betasatellite and an alphasatellite were found associated with the disease in Pusa, Bihar. The DNA-A of the Begomovirus associated with TbLCD in Pusa, Bihar was found to comprise of 2707 nt with a typical Old World begomovirus-like genome organization. The full-length sequence of DNA-A [HQ180391] showed that the Pusa isolate is a newly described member of the genus Begomovirus, as it had <89% sequence homology with DNA-A of all the known begomoviruses. The isolate is tentatively named as Tobacco leaf curl Pusa virus [India:Pusa:2010]. The betasatellite (HQ180395) associated with TbLCD in Pusa was identified as a variant of Tomato leaf curl Bangladesh betasatellite [IN:Raj:03], with which it shared 90.4% sequence identity. The alphasatellite (HQ180392) associated with the disease had highest 87% nucleotide sequence identity with Tomato leaf curl alphasatellite. The Begomovirus, betasatellite, and alphasatellite associated with TbLCD in Pusa, Bihar, India were found to be recombinants of extant begomoviruses, betasatellites and alphasatellites spreading in the Indian sub-continent and South-East Asia.
