Using the mouse interleukin 4 (IL-4) receptor cDNA as a probe, we isolated a cDNA encoding the human IL-4 receptor (hIL-4 receptor) from a multifactor-responsive human myeloid cell line, TF1. The cDNA encodes for an open reading frame of 825 amino acids including a signal sequence (25 amino acids), the external domain (207 amino acids), a transmembrane domain (24 amino acids), and a large cytoplasmic domain (569 amino acids). The human IL-4 receptor has a 65% identity with the mouse IL-4 receptor at the nucleic acid level and retains the typical structural motif of the previously described cytokine receptor family. COS7 cells transfected with the full-length cDNA expressed high levels (140,000 sites/cell) of IL-4 binding sites, with a Kd = 80 pM, an affinity identical to that of the original TF1 cells. Similar to IL-4 responsive cells, cross-linking of [125I]IL-4 to COS7 cells transfected with the cDNA showed a major protein of 130-150 kd and minor species of 55-85 kd.
