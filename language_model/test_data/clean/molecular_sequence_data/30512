A cosmid clone bearing an HLA class I gene has been isolated from a human genomic library by hybridization to a class I-specific probe. This clone encodes the HLA-A26 molecule characterized by immunologic reagents on murine transfected L cells. Nucleotide sequencing of the A26 allele has been performed, and the deduced amino acid sequence was compared with previously published HLA class I sequences. Amino acid sequence homologies between HLA-A26 molecules and members of the HLA-AW19 cross-reactive group were observed and allowed us to demonstrate that residue Q144 is the only critical residue involved in the binding of the 4E monoclonal antibody defining an epitope common to all HLA-B, -C, and -Aw19 alleles. This study also permitted designation of a V residue at position 189 in the third domain as possibly involved in the binding of the B1-23-2 monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, we located clusters of variability in reference to the three-dimensional structure of the HLA-A molecules, i.e., the ninth residue of the first beta-strand domain, the upper surface of the first helical region, and both beta and alpha structures of the alpha 2 domain.
