Strain GB-2 is a marine microbe with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, isolated from soil taken from the coastal city Lianyungang in the JiangSu province of China. Analysis of its morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics as well as chemical components of the cell wall strongly suggested that the strain GB-2 belonged to the Streptomyces sp. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of Streptomyces sp. GB-2 strain showed a strong similarity (98%) with the 16 rRNA gene of Streptomyces fradiae. Application to antibacterial substance of strain Streptomyces sp. GB-2 by various separation steps led to isolation of one active molecule having a retention time of 9.495 min, P(9.495 min), which possessed antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Through analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and mass/mass spectrometry of the peak, the molecular weight of the antibacterial substance (P(9.495 min) sample) was 447.5 Da and it was determined to be sisomicin according to the analysis of ion fragments. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of the peak also demonstrated that the antibacterial substance was sisomicin. This study is the first to introduce the finding of sisomicin produced from marine Streptomyces sp. This work provides a preference for the production of sisomicin in pharmaceutical industries and a probability for studying the biodiversity of marine microbe.
