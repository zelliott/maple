Induction of the retinoic acid receptor beta 2 (RAR beta 2) gene by retinoic acid (RA) is mediated by a RA response element (RARE), which represents a high affinity binding site for RAR/RXR heterodimers acting at this site as RA-inducible transcription activators. In RA resistant RAC65 cells, RAR beta 2 induction is blocked due to expression of a truncated RAR alpha acting as a dominant negative repressor. Here we show that exogenous expression of RAR but not RXR can restore RA-dependent RAR beta 2 promoter activation in RAC65 cells. Structure-function analysis of hRAR beta 2 mutants in RAC65 cells shows, that the transactivation function required to restore RAR beta 2 promoter activation is dependent on the DNA binding, dimerization and RA-dependent transactivation properties of hRAR beta 2, which are retained in a mutant (beta delta 409) lacking the F domain. By contrast, dominant repression of RA-dependent mRAR beta 2 promoter activation by hRAR beta 2 mutants is independent of the DNA binding or RA-dependent transactivation function but requires a region (residues 204-384) in hRAR beta 2 involved in heterodimerization with RXR. These data extend previous observations on structure-function of RARs and provides tools for studying the role of retinoids and RARs during vertebrate development.
