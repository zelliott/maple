Branched arabinofuranose pentasaccharide with 2-azidoethyl aglycon was prepared for the first time by [3+1+1] bis-(1,2-cis)-glycosylation of trisaccharide diol with silyl-protected thioglycoside glycosyl donor. The presence of 2-azidoethyl aglycon would enable the preparation of neoglycoconjugates using the click chemistry approaches.
