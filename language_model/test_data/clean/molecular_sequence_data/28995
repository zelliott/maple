Cutin monomers, generated by the low levels of constitutively expressed cutinase, induce high levels of cutinase that can help pathogenic fungi to penetrate into the host through the cuticle whose major structural polymer is cutin. We cloned three highly homologous cutinase genes, cut1, cut2, and cut3, from Fusarium solani f. pisi (Nectria haematococca). Amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of cut1 and cut2/3 matched with that of the peptides from cutinase 1 and cutinase 2, respectively, isolated from F. solani pisi grown on cutin as the sole carbon source. Induction of beta-glucuronidase gene fused to the promoters of the cutinases integrated into F. solani pisi genome indicates that cut2 is constitutively expressed and induced under starvation, whereas cut1 is highly induced by cutin monomers. A palindrome binding protein (PBP) previously cloned binds only to palindrome 1 of cut1 promoter but not palindrome 1 of cut2/3 which contains two base substitutions. PBP is thought to interfere with the binding of CTF1 alpha, the transcription factor involved in induction, to cut1 promoter and thus keep cut1 gene repressed until induced by cutin monomers. Because PBP cannot bind palindrome 1 of cut2, this gene is not repressed. CTF1 alpha does not transactivate cut2 promoter. A new Cys(6)Zn(2) motif-containing transcription factor, CTF1 beta, that binds palindrome 2 was cloned and sequenced. In yeast, CTF1 beta transactivates cut2 promoter but not cut1 promoter unless its palindrome 1 is mutated, unlike CTF1 alpha which transactivates cut1. Thus, CTF1 beta is involved in the constitutive expression of cut2 that causes production of low levels of cutin monomers that strongly induce cut1 using CTF1 alpha as the transcription factor.
