A Gram-negative, rod-shaped, yellow-pigmented bacterium, designated strain R2A-7(T), was isolated from sediment of the eutrophic Taihu Lake in Jiangsu Province, China. The isolate was subjected to a taxonomic study using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences placed strain R2A-7(T) within the genus Flavobacterium in the family Flavobacteriaceae. The highest sequence similarity was found with Flavobacterium saliperosum (98.3 %), followed by other Flavobacterium species with similarities <96.0 %. The major fatty acids (>5 %) were 15 : 0 iso, 17 : 1 iso omega9c, 17 : 0 iso 3-OH, 15 : 1 iso G and 15 : 0 iso 3-OH. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain R2A-7(T) was 37.7 mol%. The DNA-DNA relatedness value with F. saliperosum CGMCC 1.3801(T) was 40.6 %. Molecular and phenotypic data suggest that strain R2A-7(T) represents a novel species within the genus Flavobacterium, for which the name Flavobacterium cauense is proposed. The type strain is R2A-7(T) (=CGMCC 1.7270(T)=NBRC 104929(T)).
