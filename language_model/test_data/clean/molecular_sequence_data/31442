Argulus siamensis is a major ectoparasitic pathogen of freshwater fish capable of causing substantial economic loss. None of the available control measures have been able to address the problem of argulosis resourcefully. To combat this pathogen effectively, it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of its life processes with information on various genes involved. The transcriptome studies can generate introductory information about genes participating in physiological processes of the parasite which could be targeted for their control. In this study, the transcriptome sequencing of A. siamensis was performed on Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform which generated 75,126,957 high quality reads. A total of 46,352 transcript contigs were assembled with average length of 1211bp and N50 length of 2302bp. In total, 19,290 CDS including 184 novel CDS and 59,019 open reading frames (ORFs) were identified from the assembled contigs. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encylopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis were performed to classify contigs into their functional categories and regulation pathways. Additionally, 1171 simple sequence repeats were identified from the assembled contigs. Further, twelve contigs with high similarity with downstream molecules of the mammalian toll like receptor (TLR) pathway were validated by their inductive expressions in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram negative bacteria, Escherichia coli and Gram positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus. The transcriptome of an ectoparasite A. siamensis was sequenced, assembled, annotated, and the downstream signalling molecules of Toll pathway characterized. The transcriptome data generated will facilitate studies on functional genomics that will subsequently be applied for vaccine development and other control strategies against the parasite.
