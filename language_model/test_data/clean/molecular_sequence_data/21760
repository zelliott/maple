Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are innate immune molecules that are present in most invertebrates and vertebrates. Mammals have four PGRPs, PGLYRP1-4. In the present study, we cloned the cDNAs encoding porcine PGLYRP3 and 4 from the esophagus of adult swine. The length of the complete open reading frames of porcine PGLYRP3 and 4 are identical and contain 1125bp encoding 374 amino acid residues. The amino acid sequences of these two proteins were more similar to their human orthologs (78.9% [PGLYRP3] and 73.9% [PGLYRP4]) than to their mouse orthologs (71.3% [PGLYRP3] and 67.9% [PGLYRP4]). Expression analysis revealed that both PGLYRP3 and 4 were more strongly expressed in digestive tract, especially the esophagus, than in immune organs such as spleen or mesenteric lymph nodes in both newborn and adult swine. To analyze the subcellular distribution of porcine PGLYRP1-4, we constructed transfectant cell lines. Western blot and flow cytometric analyses revealed that porcine PGLYRP3 and 4 are not only secreted, but also expressed on the cell surface, unlike PGLYRP1 and 2. These results should help contribute to the understanding of PGLYRP3- and 4-mediated immune responses via their recognition of intestinal microorganisms in newborn and adult swine.
