Staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin (alphaHL) is a beta barrel pore-forming toxin that is secreted by the bacterium as a water-soluble monomeric protein. Upon binding to susceptible cells, alphaHL assembles via an inactive prepore to form a water-filled homoheptameric transmembrane pore. The N terminus of alphaHL, which in the crystal structure of the fully assembled pore forms a latch between adjacent subunits, has been thought to play a vital role in the prepore to pore conversion. For example, the deletion of two N-terminal residues produced a completely inactive protein that was arrested in assembly at the prepore stage. In the present study, we have re-examined assembly with a comprehensive set of truncation mutants. Surprisingly, we found that after truncation of up to 17 amino acids, the ability of alphaHL to form functional pores was diminished, but still substantial. We then discovered that the mutation Ser(217) --> Asn, which was present in our original set of truncations but not in the new ones, promotes complete inactivation upon truncation of the N terminus. Therefore, the N terminus of alphaHL cannot be critical for the prepore to pore transformation as previously thought. Residue 217 is involved in the assembly process and must interact indirectly with the distant N terminus during the last step in pore formation. In addition, we provide evidence that an intact N terminus prevents the premature oligomerization of alphaHL monomers in solution.
