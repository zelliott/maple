We have constructed YAC, PAC, and cosmid contigs in the ataxia-telangiectasia gene region and used the assembled clones to isolate expressed sequences by exon trapping and hybridization selection. In the interval between D11S1819 and D11S2029, exons and cDNAs for potentially 13 different genes were identified. Three of these genes, F37, K28, and 6.82, are large novel genes expressed in a variety of different tissues. K28 shows sequence homology to the Rab GTP binding protein family and gene 6.82 homology to the rabbit vasopressin activated calcium mobilizing receptor, while gene F37 has no homology to any known sequence in the database. Three further clones, exon 6.41 and cDNAs K22 and E74, from the interval between D11S1819 and D11S2029, appear to be expressed endogenous retrovirus sequences. The fourth large novel genes, E14, together with two further possible novel genes, E13 and E3, was identified from exons and cDNAs in the more telomeric 300-kb interval between markers D11S2029 and D11S2179. These are in addition to the genes for mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA-acetyltransferase (ACAT) and the ATM gene in the same region. Genes E3, E13, and E14 do not show homology to any known genes. K28, 6.82, ACAT, and ATM all appear to have the same transcriptional orientation toward the telomere.
