To study the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performance in detecting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, we tested 53 HIV-1 seropositive patients and 29 HIV-1 seronegative subjects for four different HIV-1 DNA regions. Fifty-one seropositive patients were found positive by PCR with at least one primer pair, but two were repeatedly negative for all primers. Weekly blood samples from 12 seropositive subjects all detected positive for at least one primer pair, but for three patients an irregular primer detection pattern was found. One additional HIV-1 seropositive sample, found negative for HIV DNA, was also negative for the beta-globin PCR control. The 29 seronegative specimens were HIV-1 DNA negative, as was a HIV-2 seropositive patient. This study demonstrates that PCR is almost as good as serological tests for detecting HIV infections, with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 96% and that resampling the patients may improve detection performance.
