An optimization of the production and purification processes of carnobacteriocins Cbn BM1 and Cbn B2 from Carnobacterium maltaromaticum CP5, by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli is described. The genes encoding mature bacteriocin were cloned into an E. coli expression system and expressed as a fusion protein with a thermostable thioredoxin. Recombinant E. coli were cultivated following a fed-batch fermentation process with pH, temperature and oxygenation regulation. The overexpression of the fusion proteins was improved by replacing IPTG by lactose. The fusion proteins were purified by thermal coagulation followed by affinity chromatography. The thioredoxin fusion protein was removed by using CNBr instead of enterokinase and the carnobacteriocins were recovered by reverse-phase chromatography. These optimizations led us to produce up to 320 mg of pure protein per liter of culture, which is four to ten fold higher than what is described for other heterologous expression systems.
