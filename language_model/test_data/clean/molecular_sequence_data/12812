We have analyzed recombinant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptases that contain mutations at position 184. These variants retain high levels of RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity and show resistance to ddITP. However, the mutants varied in their ability to polymerize processively. The variants Met184Ile and Met184Val showed slight reductions in processivity relative to that of the wild-type enzyme; the variants Met184Ala and Met184Leu showed considerable reductions in their processivity.
