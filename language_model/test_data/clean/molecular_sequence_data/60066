[Pseudomonas] echinoides DSM 1805T (= ATTC 14820T, DSM 50409T, ICBP 2835T, NCIB 9420T) has been reinvestigated to clarify its taxonomic position. 16S rDNA sequence comparisons demonstrated that this species clusters phylogenetically with species of the genus Sphingomonas. Investigation of fatty acid patterns, polar lipid profiles, polyamine patterns and quinone systems supported this delineation. Substrate utilization profiles and biochemical characteristics displayed no distinct overall similarity to any validly described species of the genus Sphingomonas. Therefore, the reclassification of [Pseudomonas] echinoides as Sphingomonas echinoides comb. nov. is proposed, based upon the estimated phylogenetic position derived from 16S rRNA gene sequence data, chemotaxonomic data and previously published genomic DNA G+C content data.
