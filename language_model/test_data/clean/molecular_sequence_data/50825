The two findings indicate that 8-hydroxyguanine(8-OH-Gua) is a hot piperidine-sensitive lesion in DNA. These are cleavages of DNA containing 8-OH-Gua at the site of this residue and decomposition of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine when the DNA and nucleoside were treated in 1 M piperidine for 30 min at 90 degrees C. However, no cleavage was observed in DNA containing 8-hydroxyadenine or O6-methylguanine. 8-OH-Gua was found to be different from apurinic sites that are also alkali-labile lesions since the former was more resistant to alkali treatment. This property of 8-OH-Gua can be used as a check for the incorporation of this base into DNA after the synthesis of DNA containing 8-OH-Gua at a specific position or possibly can be one of the markers for the identification of 8-OH-Gua formed in DNA exposed to reactive oxygen species.
