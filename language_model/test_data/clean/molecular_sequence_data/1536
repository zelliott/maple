A peptide was fused to the C terminus of the M13 bacteriophage major coat protein (P8), and libraries of P8 mutants were screened to select for variants that displayed the peptide with high efficiency. Over 600 variants were sequenced to compile a comprehensive database of P8 sequence diversity compatible with assembly into the wild-type phage coat. The database reveals that, while the alpha-helical P8 molecule was highly tolerant to mutations, certain functional epitopes were required for efficient incorporation. Three hydrophobic epitopes were located approximately equidistantly along the length of the alpha-helix. In addition, a positively charged epitope was required directly opposite the most C-terminal hydrophobic epitope and on the same side as the other two epitopes. Both ends of the protein were highly tolerant to mutations, consistent with the use of P8 as a scaffold for both N and C-terminal phage display. Further rounds of selection were used to enrich for P8 variants that supported higher levels of C-terminal peptide display. The largest improvements in display resulted from mutations around the junction between P8 and the C-terminal linker, and additional mutations in the N-terminal region were selected for further improvements in display. The best P8 variants improved C-terminal display more than 100-fold relative to the wild-type, and these variants could support the simultaneous display of N and C-terminal fusions. These finding provide information on the requirements for filamentous phage coat assembly, and provide improved scaffolds for phage display technology.
