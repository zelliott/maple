The phenotype of mice homozygous for the osteosclerosis (oc) mutation includes osteopetrosis, and a variety of studies demonstrate that osteoclasts in these mice are present but nonfunctional. We have identified a novel gene that has homology to a family of 12-transmembrane domain proteins with transport functions and maps to proximal mouse chromosome 19, in a region to which the oc mutation has been previously assigned. The putative transporter is abundant in normal kidney, but its expression is markedly reduced in kidneys from oc/oc mice when tested using Northern and Western analyses. Southern analysis of this gene, which we call Roct (reduced in oc transporter), demonstrates that it is intact and unrearranged in oc/oc mice. In situ studies show that Roct is expressed in developing bone. We propose that the absence of Roct expression results in an osteopetrosis phenotype in mice.
