A striking feature of Burkholderia contaminans strain MS14 is the production of a glycolipopeptide named occidiofungin. Occidiofungin has a broad range of antifungal activities against plant and animal pathogens. In this study, a complete covalent structure characterization and identification of the whole genomic DNA region for the occidiofungin gene (ocf) cluster are described. Discovery of the presence of 2,4-diaminobutyric acid and 3-chloro-Î²-hydroxytyrosine and elucidation of the structure of a novel C(18) fatty amino acid residue have been achieved. In addition, seven additional putative open reading frames (the genes from ocfI to ocfN [ocfI-N] and ORF16) were identified. Transcription of all the putative genes ocfI-N identified in the region except ORF16 was regulated by both ambR1 and ambR2. Elucidation of the structure and the ocf gene cluster provides insight into the biosynthesis of occidiofungin and promotes future aims at understanding the biosynthetic machinery. This work provides new avenues for optimizing the production and synthesis of structural analogs of occidiofungin.
