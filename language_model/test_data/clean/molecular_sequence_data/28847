We constructed a promoter-trap vector pPT6803-1 to isolate circadian clock-controlled promoters in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. The vector contains a promoterless luciferase gene set (luxAB) from Vibrio harveyi that is targeted to a specific site of the Synechocystis genome as a reporter for gene expression. A library was constructed in pPT6803-1 by introducing the genomic DNA fragments upstream of luxAB to transform Synechocystis cells. Of approximately 10,000 Synechocystis transformants, at least 55 (#1-55) showed circadian rhythms of bioluminescence under continuous illumination. Clones #19, #22, and #26 exhibited obviously different waveforms of bioluminescence from each other. Deletion analysis and primer extension experiments mapped the promoters for the clpP, slr1634, and rbpP genes that are responsible for bioluminescence from #19, #22, and #26, respectively.
