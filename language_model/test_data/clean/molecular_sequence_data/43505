The complete sequence of a 36775 bp DNA segment located on the right arm of chromosome XV of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been determined and analysed. The sequence encodes 26 open reading frames of at least 100 amino acids. Eight of these correspond to known genes, whereas 18 correspond to new genes.
