Transcription of the sea urchin early histone genes occurs transiently during early cleavage, reaching the maximum at the morula stage and declining to an undetectable level at the gastrula stage. To identify the regulatory elements responsible for the timing and the levels of transcription of the H2A gene, we used promoter binding studies in nuclear extracts and microinjection of a CAT transgene driven by the early H2A promoter. We found that morula and gastrula nuclear proteins produced indistinguishable DNase I footprint patterns on the H2A promoter. Two sites of interactions, centred on the modulator/enhancer and on the CCAAT box respectively, were detected. Deletion of the modulator or coinjection of an excess of modulator sequences severely affected the expression of two transgenes driven by the enhancer-less and modulator-containing H2A promoter. Finally, a DNA fragment containing 3' coding and post-H2A spacer sequences, where upon silencing three micrococcal nuclease hypersensitive sites were previously mapped, specifically repressed at the gastrula stage the expression of the transgene driven by the H2A promoter. These results indicate that the modulator is essential for the expression of early H2A gene and that sequences for downregulation are localized near the 3' end of the H2A gene.
