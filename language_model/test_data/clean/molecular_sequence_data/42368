Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) were isolated from human blood, and PMN phagocytosis was assessed by measuring the chemiluminescence (CL) response in the presence of ZAP (opsonized zymosin particles containing luminol). The administration of 6.5 nM of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), des(1-3)-IGF-I, IGF-II or insulin to PMNs for 20 min resulted in significant increases of the CL response for all test preparations. Des(1-3)-IGF-I, a truncated IGF-I with low affinity binding to IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs), was the most potent CL stimulator. The CL production evoked by 6.5 nM of des(1-3)-IGF-I was inhibited significantly by both 0.25 and 1.0 nM of EGTA (Ca2+ chelator), or 10 microM nifedipine (Ca2+ channel inhibitor), pertussis toxin (0.05 and 1.0 micrograms/ml) or cholera toxin (5 micrograms/ml). These results suggest that IGF-I and its homologues are potent stimulators of phagocytosis and that this action is modulated by IGFBP, and may require extracellular Ca2+ and/or IGF-I receptor G-protein coupling.
