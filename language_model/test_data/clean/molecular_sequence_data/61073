Previous studies showed that benzothiophene and 3- and 5-methylbenzothiophenes are oxidized by some bacteria to yield their corresponding sulfones, which were not subsequently degraded. In this study, a filamentous bacterium was isolated, which grew on each of these three sulfones as its sole carbon, sulfur, and energy source. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and scanning electron microscopy, the isolate was found to belong to the genus Pseudonocardia and assigned the strain designation DB1. Benzothiophene sulfone and 3-methylbenzothiophene sulfone were more readily biodegraded than 5-methylbenzothiophene sulfone, and growth on these three compounds resulted in the release of 57, 62, and 28% of the substrate carbon as CO2, respectively. The thiophene ring was also cleaved, and between 44 and 88% of the sulfur from the consumed substrate was found as sulfate and (or) sulfite. Strain DB1 grew on benzoate, dibenzothiophene sulfone, and hexadecanoic acid, but it could not grow on benzofuran, dibenzothiophene, dibenzothiophene sulfoxide, hexadecane, indole, naphthalene, phenol, 2-sulfobenzoic acid, sulfolane, benzothiophene, or 3- or 5-methylbenzothiophenes. In addition, it did not oxidize the latter three compounds to their sulfones.
