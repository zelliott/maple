We have found that synthetic peptides derived from the two epidermal growth factor-like domains of factor VII are inhibitors of tissue factor dependent factor X activation. Inhibition was most pronounced for a constrained sequence of amino acids corresponding to positions 91-102 of factor VII, Cys-Val-Asn-Glu-Asn-Gly-Gly-Cys-Glu-Gin-Tyr-Cys. The biological activity appeared to be localized to the tripeptide 'motif', Glu-Gln-Tyr, within the larger sequence. The cyclic peptide was also an inhibitor of tissue factor induced coagulation of plasma, using lipidated tissue factor or tissue factor expressed on the surface of living cells. However, it did not interfere with intrinsic coagulation. Inhibition of factor X activation was dose-dependent with an IC50 value of 350 microM. Kinetic analyses revealed non-competitive inhibition with respect to factor X and suggested that the peptide sequence interferes with the factor VII/tissue factor/factor X complex formation and function. A pentapeptide analog of the putative pharmacophore was also a dose-dependent inhibitor of factor X activation with an IC50 value of 560 microM, but the tripeptide, Glu-Gin-Tyr, alone was without effect. Our results suggest a direct role for the second epidermal growth factor-like domain of factor VII, and in particular its loop I, in the formation and function of the factor VII/tissue factor/factor X complex.
