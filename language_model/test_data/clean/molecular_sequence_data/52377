Nuclear extract of human erythroleukemic cell line K562 contains a 70 kDa protein which is gradually reduced when cells are induced to express globin genes by 25 microM hemin. When globin synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide (100 micrograms/ml) or Actinomycin D (1 microgram/ml), the disappearance of this protein was prevented. The 70 kDa nuclear protein exhibited strong binding to G gamma and A gamma globin promoters but not to beta-globin promoter. This suggests that this 70 kDa nuclear protein may be involved in the regulation of fetal globin gene expression.
