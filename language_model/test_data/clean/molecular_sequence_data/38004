To better understand a role of the delta32 allele of the CCR5 gene in HIV-1 transmission and disease progression, we determined the CCR5 genotypes within several groups of Koreans. Amplification of DNA from each subject was achieved with polymerase chain reaction, using the CCR5 specific primer pair, which flanks the 32 bp deletion. The 1.2 kb coding sequences of CCR5 were examined to see the possible effects of CCR5 polymorphism. All of the 339 healthy, HIV-uninfected individuals had no mutation in the CCR5 gene. All of the 115 HIV-1-infected patients including 11 long-term non-progressors (LTNPs) and 18 discordant spouses were also wild homozygotes. No variation in the 1.2kb CCR5 coding sequence was found in 5 LTNPs and 5 discordant spouses. In conclusion, the 32 bp deletion mutant is rarely present in Koreans. Our data suggest that factors other than the CCR5 coding sequences may also play a role in the resistance to HIV infection.
