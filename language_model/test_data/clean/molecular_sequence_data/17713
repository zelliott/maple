H-Ser-Pro-Val-Thr-Leu-Asp-Leu-Arg-Tyr-OMe, corresponding to the sequence 41-49 of eglin c, inhibited human leukocyte cathepsin G and alpha-chymotrypsin. In order to gain further insight into the relationship between the structure and the inhibitory activity against cathepsin G and alpha-chymotrypsin, peptide fragments related to the above nonapeptide were synthesized by a conventional solution method and their inhibitory activities were examined. The smallest peptide which exhibited inhibitory effects on the above enzymes was H-Pro-Val-Thr-Leu-OMe, corresponding to the sequence 42-45 of eglin c.
