The two-component regulatory proteins OmpR and EnvZ of Escherichia coli K-12 regulate expression of the major outer membrane porin protein, OmpF. OmpR is a DNA-binding protein that is involved in both the positive and negative control of ompF transcription. EnvZ is a histidine kinase that phosphorylates OmpR in response to environmental signals. We used DNA migration retardation analysis to examine the interactions of OmpR and the phosphorylated form of OmpR (OmpR-P) with the regulatory region immediately upstream of the ompF promoter. Our results indicate that the binding of OmpR to this regulatory region is cooperative and that phosphorylation significantly stimulates these cooperative interactions. Moreover, although phosphorylation increases the intrinsic binding of OmpR to a single OmpR-binding site, the primary role of phosphorylation in ompF regulation is to facilitate cooperative interactions between OmpR molecules bound at adjacent sites. Based on these results, we propose a model to explain how the phosphorylation of OmpR could stimulate the occupancy of specific sites in the ompF regulatory region, thereby resulting in the activation or repression of ompF transcription under the appropriate environmental conditions.
