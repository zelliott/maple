Analyzing highly hydrophobic proteins is a challenge for identification protocols based on gel separation and mass spectrometry. We combined Blue Native and 2D tricine gel electrophoresis to allow separation and identification of respiratory complex subunits from Arabidopsis mitochondria. We identified many of the highly hydrophobic mitochondrion-encoded subunits (GRAVY scores between +0.6 to +1.4) and also found a number of nucleus-encoded proteins associated with complex I for the first time in plants.
