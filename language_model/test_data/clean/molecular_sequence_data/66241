In protein analysis using mass spectrometry, proteins are usually separated by electrophoresis and digested within the gel with proteases such as trypsin. However, analysis of lipid-modified proteins is difficult due to the low recovery of lipid-modified peptide fragments from the gel as well as their low ionization efficiency during mass spectrometry. In this study, we developed a simple extraction method with n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside following chloroform/methanol extraction that efficiently elutes lipid-modified fragments from gels. This method allowed us to analyze the structure of lipid-modified fragments, suggesting the applicability of the method for analysis of lipid-modified fragments by mass spectrometry.
