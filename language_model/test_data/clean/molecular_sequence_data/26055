Genomic clones containing the 5'-flanking region and exon 1 of the human and rat Na,K-ATPase alpha 3 isoform gene have been isolated and characterized. The nucleotide sequences of 1.6 kb of the rat gene and 2.8 kb of the human gene in the 5'-flanking region were determined. Mapping of transcription initiation sites by primer extension and S1 nuclease protection analyses indicates that transcription is initiated in the same region in both genes although the rat gene has a greater number of initiation sites. Neither gene has a canonical TATA box, having instead a ATAT sequence preceding the transcription initiation sites. There is a perfect CCAAT sequence, in the reverse orientation, approximately 30 bp upstream of the potential TATA box in both genes. We have identified potential binding sites for transcription factors Sp-1, AP-1, AP-2, and AP-4, as well as for glucocorticoid and thyroid hormone receptors in the 5'-flanking regions. These are conserved in both human and rat alpha 3 isoform genes.
