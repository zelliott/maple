A new sesquiterpenoid, 1alpha,5alpha-epoxy-4alpha-hydroxyl-4beta,10beta-dimethyl-7alphaH,10alphaH-guaia-l1(13)-en-12-oic acid (1), and four known compounds, lactucin (2), 1beta-hydroxy-7alphaH,8,11betaH-eudesm-3-en-8,12-olide (3), 13,14-seco-stigma 9(11),14(15)-dien-3alpha-ol (4), and bacosterol-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (5) were isolated from Cichorium intybus L. Their structures were determined on the basis of detailed analysis of their 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric data. Compounds 2 and 4 showed strong activities against the A2780 cell line with IC50 values of 1.81 and 0.07 microM, respectively.
