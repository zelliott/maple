The RIZ (G3B or MTB-Zf) zinc finger gene is structurally related to the myeloid leukemia gene, MDS1-EVI1, and the transcription repressor/differentiation factor, PRDI-BF1/BLIMP1, through a conserved amino-terminal motif, the PR domain. Similar to MDS1-EVI1, RIZ gene normally produces two protein products that differ by the PR domain. The smaller protein RIZ2 lacks the PR domain of RIZ1 but is otherwise identical to RIZ1. Here we show that RIZ proteins bind to GC-rich or Sp-1-binding elements and repress transcription. Both RIZ1 and RIZ2 repressed the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) promoter, one of the best characterized eukaryotic promoters. Recombinant RIZ1 proteins were able to bind to HSV-TK promoter. This binding was mediated by the GC-rich Sp-1 elements of the promoter and the first three zinc finger motifs of RIZ1. RIZ also encodes a repressor domain that was mapped to the central region of the protein. Fusion of this region to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain generated GAL4 site-dependent transcriptional repressors. We also show that RIZ1 protein can efficiently repress the simian virus 40 (SV40) early promoter, which primarily consists of Sp-1 sites; RIZ2, however, only weakly repressed this promoter, suggesting a role for PR in modulating RIZ protein function. The data have implications for a role of RIZ proteins in the regulation of cellular gene promoters, many of which are characterized by GC-rich elements.
