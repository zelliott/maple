A rapid phenotypic screening method for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) thymidine kinase (TK) genes was developed for monitoring acyclovir-resistant viruses. This method determines the biochemical phenotype of the TK polypeptide, which is synthesized in vitro from viral DNA using a procedure as follows. The TK gene of each sample virus strain is amplified and isolated under the control of a T7 promoter by PCR. The PCR products are transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase and translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Using this method, enzymatic characteristics and the size of the TK polypeptides encoding HSV and VZV DNA were defined in less than 2 days without virus isolation. The assay should be a powerful tool in monitoring drug-resistant viruses, especially in cases in which virus isolation is difficult.
