Nucleotide sequences of 441 promoters recognized by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase were subjected to a site-specific cluster analysis based on the hierarchical method of classification. Five regions permitting promoter subgrouping were identified. They are located at -54 +/- 4, -44 +/- 3, -35 +/- 3 (-35 element), -29 +/- 2 and -11 +/-4 (-10 element). Promoters were independently subgrouped on the basis of their sequence homology in each of these regions and typical sequence elements were determined. The putative functional significance of the revealed elements is discussed on the basis of available biochemical data. Those promoters that have a high degree of homology with the revealed sequence elements were selected as representatives of corresponding promoter groups and the presence of other sequence motifs in their structure was examined. Both positive and negative correlations in the presence of particular sequence motifs were observed; however, the degree of these interdependencies was not high in all cases, probably indicating that different combinations of the signal elements may create a promoter. The list of promoter sequences with the presence of different sequence elements is available on request by Email: ozoline@venus.iteb. serpukhov.su.
