Simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (T), a potent dominant oncogene product, forms a specific complex with the human retinoblastoma protein (pRb), a cellular growth suppressor. We have used a recombinant pRb fusion protein (GST-Rb) in combination with extracts from a line of SV40-transformed human lung cells (WI-26 VA4) to develop a simple, non-radioactive assay to rapidly screen for competitive inhibitors of T/pRb binding. We illustrate the use of the assay by demonstrating that several short peptides containing the signature sequence, Leu-X-Cys-X-Glu, can inhibit T/pRb complex formation. In contrast, peptides containing the related motif, Leu-X-Glu-X-Glu, including two peptides derived from the transcription factor E2F, are inactive in this assay. These results show that Glu cannot substitute for Cys in the Leu-X-Cys-X-Glu motif. This assay will facilitate the identification of agents that are inhibitors of T/pRb complex formation and that might exert effects on cellular growth regulation.
