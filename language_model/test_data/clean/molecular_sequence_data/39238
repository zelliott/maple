Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), an oncogenic protein encoded by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), has been verified to be phosphorylated in vitro by protein casein kinase 2 (CK2). In this study, we characterized the phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus of LMP1 fused with glutathione-S-transferase (GST-LMP1c) and the FLAG-epitope-tagged LMP1 (F-LMP1) proteins expressed in HEK293T cells. Using a combination of chemical modification and tandem mass spectrometry, we detected the phosphorylation of a tryptic peptide, 191-223 amino acids, in both GST-LMP1c catalysed by CK2 and F-LMP1-expressing cell lines. Serine residues at positions 211 and 215 were determined to be the substrates of CK2 in vitro. Most importantly, the S215 phosphorylation was also detected in F-LMP1-expressing human cell lines. The phosphorylation of S215, which is located in the carboxyl-terminus activation region 1 of LMP1, provides a new insight for investigating the role and modulation of the phosphorylation of LMP1.
