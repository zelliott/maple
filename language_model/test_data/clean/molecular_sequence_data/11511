The citrate permease determinant (citP) in several Leuconostoc strains was demonstrated to be plasmid encoded by curing experiments and hybridization studies with a DNA fragment containing the citP gene from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis NCDO176. Cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis of Leuconostoc lactis NZ6070 citP revealed almost complete identity to lactococcal citP.
