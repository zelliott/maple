The spatial structure and conformations of rimorphin were investigated using theoretical conformational analysis. The spatial organization of the peptide can be described by a set of 11 low-energy conformations of the backbone. By solving the reverse conformational problem, a number of modified amino acid sequences ([Ala2], [Ala3], [MePhe9], [MeLys10], [MeVal11], and [MeVal12]-analogs of rimorphin) were determined that have spatial structures corresponding to the set of low-energy conformations and should, therefore, possess physiological activity.
