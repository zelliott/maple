Differences in glycolipid expression between species contribute to the tropism of many infectious pathogens for their hosts. For example, we demonstrate that cultured human and monkey urinary epithelial cells fail to bind a canine Escherichia coli uropathogenic isolate; however, transfection of these cells with the canine Forssman synthetase (FS) cDNA enables abundant adherence by the same pathogen, indicating that addition of a single sugar residue to a glycolipid receptor has marked effects on microbial attachment. Given the contribution of glycolipids to host-microbial interactions, we sought to determine why human tissues do not express Forssman glycolipid. Query of the GenBank(TM) data base yielded a human sequence with high identity to the canine FS cDNA. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Northern blotting demonstrated the presence of FS mRNA in all tissues examined. A human FS cDNA was characterized, revealing identities with the canine FS gene of 86 and 83% at the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences, respectively. In contrast to the canine FS cDNA, transfection of COS-1 cells with the human FS cDNA resulted in no detectable FS enzyme activity. These results suggest that variability in glycolipid synthesis between species is an important determinant of microbial tropism. Evolutionary pressure from pathogenic organisms may have contributed to diversity in glycolipid expression among species.
