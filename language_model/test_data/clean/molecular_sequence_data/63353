Pineapple mealybug wilt-associated virus-1 (PMWaV-1; family Closteroviridae, genus Ampelovirus) belongs to a complex of mealybug-transmissible viruses found in pineapple worldwide. In this study, the complete genome of PMWaV-1 was sequenced and found to be 13.1 kb in length, making it the smallest in the family. The genome encoded seven open reading frames (ORFs) and was unusual for an ampelovirus due to the lack of an intergenic region between the RdRp and p6 ORFs, an ORF encoding a relatively small coat protein (CP), and the absence of an ORF encoding a coat protein duplicate (CPd). Phylogenetic analyses placed PMWaV-1, plum bark necrosis stem pitting-associated virus and some grapevine leafroll-associated viruses in a distinct clade within the genus Ampelovirus.
