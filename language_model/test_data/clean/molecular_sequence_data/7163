HMG-17 is a highly conserved and ubiquitous nonhistone chromosomal protein that binds to nucleosome core particles. HMG-17 and HMG-14 form a family of chromosomal proteins that have been reported to bind preferentially to regions of active chromatin structure. To study the functional role of the single-copy chicken HMG-17 gene, null mutants were generated by targeted gene disruption in a chicken lymphoid cell line, DT40. Heterozygous and homozygous null mutant cell lines were generated by two independent selection strategies. Heterozygous null mutant lines produced about half the normal level of HMG-17 protein, and homozygous null lines produced no detectable HMG-17. No significant changes in cell phenotype were observed in cells harboring either singly or doubly disrupted HMG-17 genes, and no compensatory changes in HMG-14 or histone protein levels were observed. It is concluded that HMG-17 protein is not required for normal growth of avian cell lines in vitro, nor does the absence of HMG-17 protein lead to any major changes in cellular phenotype, at least in lymphoid cells.
