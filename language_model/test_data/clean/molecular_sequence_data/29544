New kinds of acarbose analogues were synthesized by the reaction of acarbose with cyclomaltohexaose and cyclomaltodextrin glucanyltransferase (CGTase). Three major CGTase coupling products were separated and purified by Bio-Gel P2 gel-permeation chromatography. Digestion of the three products by beta-amylase and glucoamylase showed that they were composed of maltohexaose (G6), maltododecaose (G12), and maltooctadecaose (G18), respectively, attached to the nonreducing-end of acarbose. 13C NMR of the glucoamylase product (D-glucopyranosyl-acarbose) showed that the D-glucose moiety was attached alpha- to the C-4-OH group of the nonreducing-end cyclohexene ring of acarbose, indicating that the maltodextrins were attached alpha-(1-->4) to the nonreducing-end cyclohexene of acarbose.
