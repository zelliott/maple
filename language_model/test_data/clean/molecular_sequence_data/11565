An in vitro study investigated mechanisms for the development of genetically variable mycorrhizal mycelia for Laccaria bicolor. Seedlings of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) grown nonaseptically in an autoclaved soil substrate were given different L. bicolor inoculum treatments. These included (i) a dikaryotic mycelium genotype (D); (ii) D and basidiospores collected from one group of five sporophores (T1); (iii) D and basidiospores collected from 10 sporophores, two from each of five different groups (T5); (iv) T1 alone; (v) T5 alone; and (vi) a noninoculated control. Dikaryotic mycelial inoculum was provided at the time of sowing, while basidiospore inoculum was added at 10 weeks after seed germination. Sporophore formation was induced after 20 weeks of growth, and dikaryotic cultures were isolated from their tissue. Seedlings were harvested, and growth and mycorrhization were assessed. Levels of both were generally lower for T1-treated seedlings, compared with seedlings receiving D, while levels for T5-treated seedlings were intermediate. Sporophore genotype variability was assessed for inoculum treatments by using the isoenzymatic marker leucine aminopeptidase. The greatest genetic variability was seen with the basidiospore treatments T1 and T5, with up to four leucine aminopeptidase patterns per seedling. The mixed treatments D plus T1 and D plus T5 produced most frequently, but not exclusively, the inoculated dikaryon genotype. After isoenzyme results were assessed, variable sporophore isolates of mixed treatments were analyzed with randomly amplified polymorphic DNA and PCR mitochondrial DNA markers to determine if they were formed by dikaryon-monokaryon crosses between the inoculated dikaryon and monosporous mycelia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
