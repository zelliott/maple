RNAi is now the preferred method for silencing gene expression in a variety of systems. In this chapter we describe the procedure for applying short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) to study gene function. Detailed descriptions of target site selection, shRNA construction, shRNA transfection and target knockdown validation are included.
