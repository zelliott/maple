The core proteins of epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) have important roles to perform in maintaining the structure and function of the virus. A complete genetic and phylogenetic analysis was therefore performed on these proteins (and the genes that code for them) to allow comparison of the selective pressures acting on each. Accession numbers, gene and protein sizes, ORF positions, G+C contents, terminal hexanucleotides, start and stop codons and phylogenetic relationships are all presented. The inner core proteins (VP1, VP3, VP4 and VP6) were characterised by high levels of sequence conservation, and the ability to topotype isolates very strongly into eastern or western groups. This is particularly evident in genome segment 9 (VP6) which exists as two different sized homologues. VP7 did not topotype, but rather exhibited a more random, radial phylogeny suggestive of genetic drift. With the exception of VP6, all of the core proteins also showed high numbers of synonymous mutations in the third base position, suggesting they have been evolving for a long period of time. Interestingly, VP6 did not show this, and possible reasons for this are discussed.
