Loss of epithelioid organization in carcinoma cell lines has been related to invasiveness and poor differentiation of tumors. We investigated the invasion in vitro of various human colon cancer cell lines. Most cell lines were noninvasive into chick heart fragments, and this correlated with an epithelioid morphotype. Only cell lines COLO320DM, SW620, and variants of HCT-8 and DLD-1 were invasive and nonepithelioid. We examined in these cell lines whether invasiveness was related to changes in the structure and function of the E-cadherin/catenin complex. E-cadherin functions as an invasion suppressor and as a cell-cell adhesion molecule when linked to the cytoskeleton via alpha-catenin plus beta- or gamma-catenin. All noninvasive cell lines showed E-cadherin linked to these catenins. The E-cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesion function in these cell lines was demonstrated by two assays in vitro. It was interesting that all invasive cell lines showed a dysfunctional E-cadherin/catenin complex. COLO320DM, SW480, and SW620 cells were defective in E-cadherin expression, whereas the invasive variants of HCT-8 and DLD-1 lacked the alpha-catenin protein. From clonal epithelioid HCT-8 cultures with functional E-cadherin/catenin complexes, we subcloned, repeatedly, round cell variants that were again invasive and expressed no alpha-catenin protein. Our data suggest that reproducible transformations toward a more invasive phenotype in HCT-8 cells are associated with down-regulation of alpha-catenin. The mechanisms of this transformation and the level of alpha-catenin down-regulation are currently investigated.
