A new Peptoniphilus species has been isolated from samples from a patient who was scheduled for endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis. The isolate, Peptoniphilus rhinitidis 1-13(T) (KCTC 5985(T)), can use peptone as a sole carbon source and produce butyrate as a metabolic end product. This is the first report of the draft genome sequence of a novel species in the genus Peptoniphilus within the group of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
