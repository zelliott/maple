The uteroferrin(Uf)-associated basic proteins (UfAP) are a group of three (Mr = 42K, 48K, and 50K) antigenically related, basic glycoproteins secreted by the porcine uterus under the influence of progesterone (P4) which exist as heterodimers (Mr = 80,000) with the iron-binding acid phosphatase, Uf. Several UfAP cDNA clones from a day-60 pregnant pig uterine endometrial cDNA library have been cloned and sequenced. The UfAP mRNA is approximately 1400 bases long and has a single open reading frame of 1251 bases with two start codons at positions 64 and 79 from the 5'-end. UfAP mRNA content of the endometrium increases as pregnancy proceeds, reaching maximum levels around day 70 and then remaining relatively constant in late gestation (days 70 to 110). The pro-form of the UfAP minus signal sequence appears to be 392 amino acids in length and has four potential N-linked glycosylation sites Asn107, Asn197, Asn243, and Asn315. Comparison of the NH2-terminal sequences of the individual UfAP poly-peptides with the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA has indicated a series of at least four posttranslational proteolytic processing steps which generate the various molecular forms of the UfAP. The deduced amino acid sequence of UfAP shares considerable identity with several protease inhibitors and hormone-binding proteins that are members of the serpin superfamily of proteins. The UfAP amino acid sequence also exhibits about 55% sequence identity with the P4-induced uterine milk proteins (UTMP) of the sheep. Since the UfAP and UTMP share many biosynthetic and structural features that include site of biosynthesis in the endometrium, P4-responsiveness, the presence of the mannose 6-phosphate lysosomal recognition marker, and considerable sequence similarity, the UfAP and the UTMP may have homologous function which for both still remains obscure.
