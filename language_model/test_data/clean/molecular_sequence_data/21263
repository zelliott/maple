Pyrococcus yayanosii CH1 is the first obligate piezophilic hyperthermophilic archaeon isolated from the deep-sea hydrothermal site Ashadze on the mid-Atlantic ridge at a depth of 4,100 m. This organism grows within a temperature range of 80 to 108°C and a hydrostatic pressure range of 20 to 120 MPa, with optima at 98°C and 52 MPa, respectively. Here, we report the complete genome sequence (1,716,817 bp, with a G+C content of 51.6%) of the type strain P. yayanosii CH1(T) (= JCM 16557). This genomic information reveals a systematic view of the piezoadaptation strategy and evolution scenario of metabolic pathways in Thermococcales.
