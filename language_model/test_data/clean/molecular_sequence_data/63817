To identify vaccine candidates for Schistosoma mansoni, the IgG fraction of rabbit antiserum raised against immature female worms affinity purified over a NP-40 extract of 3-h schistosomula was used to immunoscreen a cercarial lambdagt11 cDNA library. One clone with a 1.5-kb cDNA insert revealed an encoded peptide of 479 amino acids, which bears homology to human actin-binding protein (ABP-280=filamin). Northern blot analysis revealed a transcript of about 8.6 kb, indicating that the complete gene was not cloned. Overlapping clones, which encode a composite sequence of 983 amino acids (45% identity with filamin), were subsequently isolated from the cDNA library. The 1.5-kb insert was cloned into pGEX, overexpressed, and the 479 amino acid peptide purified. Western blot analysis using polyclonal antisera specific to the peptide identified a 280-kDa molecule in adult worm extracts. RT-PCR demonstrated that Smfilaimin is expressed in various stages. Immunofluorescence studies with specific antisera revealed a tegument-associated fluorescence in adult worms. IgG specific to the Smfilamin fragment showed 36.6% killing of schistosomules in an in vitro killing assay.
