The nucleotide sequences were determined for the VH and VL domains of two human IgG1 antibodies, Pag-1 and Fog-B, specific for the D antigen of the Rh-blood-group system. The VH-region genes of the two antibodies were derived from separate germ-line genes within the VH-IV gene family, but both antibodies used the same JH6 gene. The D-region genes differed from each other, and no similarity was found to known D regions. The light chain of Fog-B belongs to the V lambda-I subgroup and that of Pag-1 probably belongs to the V lambda-V subgroup; both light chains used the J2/3 gene. Three-dimensional models of the variable domains were made, based on those of known crystallographic structure. The surface contours at the combining sites are clearly different, consistent with the evidence that the antibodies recognize different but overlapping epitopes. Some details of the molecular modelling of hypervariable regions have been deposited as Supplementary Publication SUP 50155 (6 pages) at the British Library Document Supply Centre, Boston Spa, Wetherby, West Yorkshire LS23 7BQ, U.K., from whom copies can be obtained on the terms indicated in Biochem.
