Genes in the interleukin-1 (IL-1) gene cluster on human chromosome 2 play an important role in mediating inflammatory responses and are associated with numerous diseases. We have identified a novel IL-1-like gene, IL-1F10, on human chromosome 2q13-14.1 near the IL-1 receptor antagonist gene (IL-1RN). The IL1F10 gene is encoded by 5 exons spanning over 7.8 kb of genomic DNA. The 1008-bp IL-1F10 cDNA encodes a 152-amino acid protein that shares between 41% and 43% amino acid identity with human IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and FIL-1delta, respectively. IL-1F10 shares characteristics of the IL-1Ra family, including key amino acid consensus sequences and a similar genomic structure. By multitissue first-strand cDNA PCR analysis, IL-1F10 mRNA is expressed in heart, placenta, fetal liver, spleen, thymus, and tonsil. The expression in a variety of immune tissues and similarity to IL-1Ra suggest a role of IL-1F10 in the inflammatory response.
