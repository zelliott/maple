2',3'-Dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (cis-(+/-)-SddC) was found to have potent activity against hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency viruses in culture. Recent studies by us identified (-)-SddC as the stereoisomer responsible for the antiviral effect and showed that the cytotoxicity was mainly caused by (+)-SddC. Metabolism studies showed that these drugs were converted to their monophosphates, diphosphates, and triphosphates. The enzyme responsible for the formation of monophosphates was identified to be cytoplasmic deoxycytidine kinase in CEM cells. Uptake studies showed that the intracellular concentration of (-)-SddC and its metabolites was approximately 5-fold higher than that of (+)-SddC metabolites. (-)-SddCTP was more potent than (+)-SddCTP in inhibiting hepatitis B virus replication; (+)- and (-)-SddCTP exhibited minimal inhibition on polymerases alpha and delta, more inhibition on beta, and strong inhibition on gamma. In all cases, (+)-SddCTP was found to be more inhibitory than (-)-SddCTP to all four polymerases. (+)-SddCMP competed with dCTP for incorporation into DNA by DNA polymerase gamma and beta and served as a chain terminator; however, similar incorporation was not detected using other polymerases. The selective inhibition of DNA synthesis in isolated mitochondria by (+)- and (-)-SddCTP suggests a stereospecificity on the mitochondrial uptake of deoxynucleoside triphosphates.
