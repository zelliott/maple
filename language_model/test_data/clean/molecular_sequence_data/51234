cDNA clones encoding the precursor of the Rieske FeS protein of the chloroplast thylakoid membrane have been isolated from a pea leaf cDNA library in lambda gt 11, following screening with antibodies to purified pea chloroplast Rieske FeS protein. The longest cDNA insert of 880 bp encodes a polypeptide of 230 amino acid residues, of which 50 residues constitute an N-terminal cleavable presequence and 180 residues make up the mature protein. Transcription and translation of the cDNA in vitro produced a polypeptide of 26 kDa which was efficiently imported by isolated pea chloroplasts and processed to the mature 20 kDa protein. Southern hybridisation to pea genomic DNA indicated the presence of a single gene encoding the Rieske FeS protein in the haploid genome.
