A Gram-negative, non-spore-forming and rod-shaped gliding bacterium, designated strain SMK-19T, was isolated from a tidal flat sediment of the Yellow Sea, Korea, and its taxonomic position was investigated by using a polyphasic approach. Strain SMK-19T grew optimally at 37 degrees C, in the presence of 2-3 % (w/v) NaCl and at pH 7.0-8.0. It contained MK-6 as the predominant menaquinone, and iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH and iso-C(15 : 0) as the major fatty acids. Major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, unidentified phospholipids and an amino-group-containing lipid that is ninhydrin-positive. The DNA G+C content was 36.0 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences demonstrated that strain SMK-19T formed a distinct evolutionary lineage within the family Flavobacteriaceae. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain SMK-19T exhibited similarity values of <94.4 % to those of other members of the family Flavobacteriaceae. Strain SMK-19T was distinguished from phylogenetically related genera by differences in several phenotypic properties. On the basis of phenotypic, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic data, SMK-19T (= KCTC 12390T = DSM 17196T) was classified at the type strain of a novel genus and species, Gaetbulimicrobium brevivitae gen. nov., sp. nov.
