Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) plays an important role in the reproductive processes of both males and females. It is synthesized by the hypothalamus and binds to a specific receptor on the pituitary to bring about the release of the gonadotrophins, lutineizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone, which in turn bring about the release of the gonadal steroids. Although the structure of the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) has been elucidated from a number of sources, no information is available about the receptor from the non-human primate species. Here we report the cloning and characterization of the receptor from the pituitary of the bonnet monkey. Antiserum to a bacterially expressed recombinant fragment was used in Western blot analysis and fluorescence microscopy to demonstrate the presence of GnRHR in both human and monkey placentae and pituitary.
