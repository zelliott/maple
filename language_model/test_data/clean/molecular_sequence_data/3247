PC2 prohormone convertases are enzymes involved in the proteolytic maturation of neuropeptide precursors. In the present work, a cDNA encoding a PC2-like enzyme (OrlPC2) was cloned from crayfish eyestalk ganglia (medulla terminalis) containing the X-organ, a major neuroendocrine center. The predicted 634 amino acid preproprotein exhibits highest sequence identity, especially in the catalytic domain, with PC2s from arthropods and nematodes, and less with mollusc and vertebrate enzymes. It was demonstrated by in situ hybridization on crayfish medulla terminalis sections that OrlPC2 is expressed in a large number of neuron perikarya, including those producing the well known crustacean hyperglycemic hormone.
