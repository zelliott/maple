Hematopoietic cells differentially bind to the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin depending on the activation state of integrin alpha 4 beta 1. In this study, we have identified a synthetic peptide derived from the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin that promotes adhesion of PMA-treated U937 cells (a monocytic cell line) in a dose-dependent manner. A peptide (FN-C/H-V; residues Gln1892 to Gly1910) was active to inhibit adhesion of PMA-treated U937 cells to the 29-kDa fragment comprising the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin. A peptide with scrambled version of FN-C/H-V lost the inhibitory activity on the adhesion. Furthermore, the IgG-conjugated FN-C/H-V promoted the adhesion of PMA-treated U937 cells to an extent comparable to that of the 29-kDa fragment. The adhesion of PMA-treated U937 cells on IgG-conjugated FN-C/H-V was inhibited both by anti-alpha 4 beta 1 antibody and by glycosaminoglycans including chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate. The other peptide, FN-C/H-II, was also a weak adhesion-promoting domain. These results suggest that the amino acid sequence defined by peptide FN-C/H-V contributes to the main adhesion-promoting activity of the 29-kDa fragment of fibronectin to stimulated U937 cells. The regulation of interactions of alpha 4 beta 1 integrin and glycosaminoglycans with ligands in fibronectin may have important implications for the migration and function of U937 cells.
