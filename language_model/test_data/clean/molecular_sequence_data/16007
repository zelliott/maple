A monkey cell factor that interacts specifically with double- and single-stranded DNA sequences in the early domain of the simian virus 40 (SV40) core origin of replication was identified using gel-retention assays. The protein was enriched over 1200-fold using ion-exchange and affinity chromatography on single-strand DNA cellulose. Binding of protein to mutant origin DNA restriction fragments was correlated with replication activity of the mutant DNAs. Exonuclease footprint experiments on single-stranded DNA revealed prominent pause sites in the early domain of the core origin. The results suggest that this cellular protein may be involved in SV40 DNA replication.
