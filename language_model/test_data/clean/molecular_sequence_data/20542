A new multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus strain was isolated from casuarina moth, Lymantria xylina Swinhoe, (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) in Taiwan. This Lymantria-derived virus can be propagated in IPLB-LD-652Y and NTU-LY cell lines and showed a few polyhedra (occlusion bodies) CPE in the infected cells. The restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) profiles of whole genome indicated that this virus is distinct from LyxyMNPV and the virus genome size was approximately 139 kbps, which was smaller than that of LyxyMNPV. The molecular phylogenetic analyses of three important genes (polyhedrin, lef-8 and lef-9) were performed. Polyhedrin, LEF-8 and LEF-9 putative amino acid analyses of this virus revealed that this virus belongs to Group II NPV and closely related to LdMNPV than to LyxyMNPV. The phylogenetic distance analysis was further clarified the relationship to LdMNPV and this virus provisionally named LdMNPV-like virus. A significant deletion of a 44bp sequence found in LdMNPV-like virus was noted in the fp25k sequences of LdMNPV and LyxyMNPV and may play an important role in the few polyhedra CPE. In ultrastructural observations, the nuclei of the infected LD host cells contained large occlusion bodies (OBs), and few OBs, which presented as one or two OBs in a nucleus that was otherwise filled with free nuclocapsids and virions. We concluded that this LdMNPV-like virus is a new LdMNPV strain from L. xylina.
