Maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV) is an important and widespread aphid-transmitted virus of maize. It is a member of the genus Potyvirus in the family Potyviridae with a monopartite (+) ssRNA genome. Here we report the complete genome sequence and construction and testing of infectious clones of an Ohio isolate of MDMV. Full-length MDMV cDNA was cloned into the vector pSPORT. Full-length cDNA PCR-amplified from the vector constructs were used as template for in vitro transcription, and transcripts were inoculated to maize seeds by vascular puncture inoculation. Plants inoculated by this procedure showed symptoms typical of MDMV infection, and infection was confirmed by RT-PCR and mechanical transmission to new plants.
