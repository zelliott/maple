In many organisms, glycogen gives rise to 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose (AF), which is reduced to 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol (AG). AF reductase, which catalyzes the latter reaction, was purified from pig liver, but mouse ortholog has not yet been reported. In the database, aldo-keto reductase family 1, member E1 (AKR1E1) showed highest homology to pig enzyme. We confirmed that cloned AKR1E1 is mouse ortholog based on enzymatic properties of purified recombinant protein.
