One hundred sixty-nine nonreplicate imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated in a large hospital on the coastal region of Croatia were studied. The most active antibiotics were colistin and amikacin. Most of the isolates were multiresistant. The most prevalent serotype was O12, followed by O11. Six strains carried the bla(VIM-2) gene located in a novel class 1 integron composed in its variable part of the bla(VIM-2)-bla(oxa-10)-ΔqacF-aacA4 genes. Metallo-β-lactamase-producing strains belonged to sequence types ST235 and ST111.
