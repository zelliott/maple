Production of the plasmid-coded fimbrial antigen CFA/I of Escherichia coli requires both CFA/I region 1 and CFA/I region 2, which are separated by about 40 kb on the wildtype plasmid. The nucleotide sequence of region 2 was determined and contains an open reading frame (cfa d), encoding a protein of 265 amino acids. The protein has no signal sequence and upon sequence analysis appeared to be a DNA-binding protein. A plasmid was constituted, with a promoterless beta-galactosidase gene preceded by the promoter of region 1. Introduction of a plasmid, carrying the cfa d gene, into a strain containing this construct enhanced expression of beta-galactosidase by at least five-fold indicating that the cfa d protein was enhancing expression from the promoter of region 1. The cfa d gene sequence differed at 28 positions from the Rns gene, which encodes a protein that is a positive regulator of the expression of CS1 or CS2 fimbriae. It was shown that the cfa d gene and the Rns gene can functionally substitute each other in regulating fimbrial synthesis.
