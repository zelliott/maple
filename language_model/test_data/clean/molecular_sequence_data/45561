Taenia solium is a cestode parasite that causes cysticercosis in humans and pigs. This study examined the antibody responses in pigs immunized with the TSOL18 and TSOL45-1A recombinant vaccines against T. solium cysticercosis. Immunization with these proteins induced specific, complement-fixing antibodies against the recombinant antigens that are believed to be associated with vaccine-induced protection against T. solium infection. Sera from immunized pigs were used to define the linear B-cell epitopes of TSOL18 and TSOL45-1A. Prominent reactivity was revealed to one linear epitope on TSOL18 and two linear epitopes on TSOL45-1A. These, and oncosphere antigens from other taeniid cestodes, contain a protein sequence motif suggesting that they may show a tertiary structure similar to the fibronectin type III domain (FnIII). Comparison of the location of linear antigenic epitopes in TSOL18 and TSOL45-1A within the proposed FnIII structure to those within related cestode vaccine antigens reveals conservation in the positioning of the epitopes between oncosphere antigens from different taeniid species.
