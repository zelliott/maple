A hyperthermophile NC12 was newly isolated from Noboribetsu hot spring. To characterize this organism, a gene coding for 16S rRNA was cloned and sequenced. The 16S rRNA sequence from NC12 shows the highest similarity with those from Pyrodictium occultum and Desulfurococcus mobilis among the sequences in the database, indicating that NC12 belongs to a cluster of extreme thermophiles (Crenarchaeota) in the archaeal domain. However, since the highest identity score was only 91.2%, it is suggested that NC12 may constitute a new genus.
