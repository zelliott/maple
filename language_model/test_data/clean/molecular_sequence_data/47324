Three hydrolyzable tannins, nobotannins L, M and N, were isolated from the water-soluble portion of the leaf extract of Tibouchina semidecandra, and their trimeric structures were elucidated from spectral and chemical evidence. Nobotanins L and N exist as equilibrium mixtures of four anomers due to the presence of two unacylated anomeric centers.
