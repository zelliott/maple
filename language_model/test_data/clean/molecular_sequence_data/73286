We report the DNA sequence of a 34,038 bp segment of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XV. Subsequent analysis revealed 20 open reading frames (ORFs) longer than 300 bp and two tRNA genes. Five ORFs correspond to genes previously identified in S. cerevisiae, including RPLA2, PRE6, MSE1, IFM1 and SCM2 (TAT2, TAP2, LTG3). Two putative proteins share considerable homology with other proteins in the current data libraries. ORF O2145 shows 41.2% identity with the glycophospholipid-anchored surface glycoprotein Gas1p of S. cerevisiae and ORF O2197 has 53.2% identity to chromosome segregation protein Dis3p of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
