In this study, actinomycetes from roots and rhizospheric soils of leguminous plants were isolated using starch casein agar supplemented with antifungal and antibacterial antibiotics. Three hundred and seventeen actinomycetes were isolated with 77 isolates obtained from plant roots and 240 isolates from rhizospheric soils. Analysis of whole-organism hydrolysates showed that 289 strains were rich in the LL-isomer of diaminopimelic acid, a result consistent with their assignment to the streptomycetes. The remaining 28 strains were assigned to non-streptomycetes based on the presence of meso-isomer of diaminopimelic acid in cell wall. Sixty-four isolates (20.2%) showed antagonistic activity against soybean pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. glycine by agar overlay method. Isolate RM 365 showed the highest activity with an inhibition ratio of 3.79, with no inhibitory activity on the growth of Rhizobium japonicum TISTR 079, Rhizobium sp. TISTR 061 and Rhizobium sp. TISTR 063. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that isolate RM 365 shared 99.28% similarity to Streptomyces caeruleatus GIMN4(T) (GQ329712). In addition, isolates which contained meso-DAP were also identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The results showed that they were members of the genus Amycolatopsis, Isoptericola, Micromonospora, Microbispora, Nocardia, Nonomuraea, Promicromonospora and Pseudonocardia.
