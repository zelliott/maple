Protein-protein interaction via specific modular domains has been implicated in the regulation of many signalling pathways. Recently, such modules, in particular WW, Src homology-3 and PDZ domains, have been shown to regulate localization, clustering and function of several ion channels and transporters, including the epithelial Na+ channel, K+ channel and ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors.
