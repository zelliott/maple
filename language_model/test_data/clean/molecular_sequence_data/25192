The tRNAGlu gene copy number, determined by genomic blot analysis of human placental DNA, is approximately thirteen. These studies, using several probes and DNA digested with several restriction enzymes singly or in combination, show that most of these tRNAGlu genes are flanked by DNA of very similar sequence for at least 5 kb. This conclusion is supported by the close similarity of the restriction maps of two lambda Charon-4A recombinants of human genomic DNA containing two different tRNAGlu genes.
