Ciliates associated with fish mortalities in a New Zealand hatchery were identified by DNA sequencing of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rRNA). Tissue samples were taken from lesions and gill tissues on freshly dead juvenile groper, brain tissue from adult kingfish, and from ciliate cultures and rotifers derived from fish mortality events between January 2007 and March 2009. Different mortality events were characterized by either of 2 ciliate species, Uronema marinum and Miamiensis avidus. A third ciliate, Mesanophrys carcini, was identified in rotifers used as food for fish larvae. Sequencing part of the SSU rRNA provided a rapid tool for the identification and monitoring of scuticociliates in the hatchery and allowed the first identification of these species in farmed fish in New Zealand.
