We have used the endogenous reverse transcriptase reaction of viral core particles from duck liver to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition of duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) replication by the nucleoside analog (-)-beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC). As is the case in human immunodeficiency virus replication, 3TC-5'-triphosphate (3TC-TP) acts as a chain terminator for the DNA polymerase activities. The results of several different experiments support this conclusion, which explains the potent activity of 3TC against the hepadnaviruses. In isolated DHBV core particles, 3TC-TP inhibited the reverse transcriptase in a manner that resembled competitive inhibition with respect to dCTP. However, the kinetics of inhibition was not linear on a double-reciprocal plot for the highest concentrations of 3TC-TP and the lowest concentration of dCTP. This anomaly would be expected if binding to the nucleotide site was followed by DNA chain termination. Calculations that used only the linear part of the curve yielded a Ki of 0.78 +/- 0.10 microM 3TC-TP. The inhibition of core particles incubated in vitro with 3TC-TP was not reversed by removal of the free inhibitor. 3TC-TP inactivated the reverse transcriptase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The Km of the chain termination reaction was calculated at 0.71 +/- 0.05 microM. Similar competitive kinetics and irreversible inhibition were also obtained on the endogenous DNA polymerase from viral particles from serum, suggesting that 3TC-TP also acts as a chain terminator of the DNA-directed DNA polymerase of DHBV replication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
