Five novel Nocardiopsis strains isolated from hypersaline soils in China were subjected to a polyphasic analysis to determine their taxonomic position. All of the novel isolates could grow on agar plates at NaCl concentrations of up to 18 % (w/v), with optimum growth at 5-8 %. The DNA G+C contents of the novel strains ranged from 67.9 to 73.2 mol%. The morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics of the isolates matched those described for members of the genus Nocardiopsis. Based on their 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, DNA-DNA hybridization values and phenotypic characteristics, including the composition of cell-wall amino acids and sugars, menaquinones, polar lipids and cellular fatty acids, the isolates are proposed as representing five novel species of the genus Nocardiopsis. The novel species are proposed as Nocardiopsis gilva sp. nov. [type strain YIM 90087T (=KCTC 19006T=CCTCC AA 2040012T=DSM 44841T)], Nocardiopsis rosea sp. nov. [type strain YIM 90094T (=KCTC 19007T=CCTCC AA 2040013T=DSM 44842T), Nocardiopsis rhodophaea sp. nov. [type strain YIM 90096T (=KCTC 19049T=CCTCC AA 2040014T=DSM 44843T), Nocardiopsis chromatogenes sp. nov. [type strain YIM 90109T (=KCTC 19008T=CCTCC AA 2040015T=DSM 44844T) and Nocardiopsis baichengensis sp. nov. [type strain YIM 90130T (=KCTC 19009T=CCTCC AA 2040016T=DSM 44845T). On the basis of the chemotaxonomic data, the description of the recently described species Nocardiopsis salina Li et al. 2004 is emended.
