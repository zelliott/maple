A lactose-binding lectin from rat lung (RL-29) and a related lectin from Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells have been analyzed with the primary goal of identifying post-translational modifications. The sequences show that RL-29 and the dog lectin are homologues of a lectin designated here as L-29 and elsewhere as CBP-35, epsilon BP, Mac-2, or L-34. RL-29 has a 140-amino-acid COOH-terminal carbohydrate-binding domain, a 20-amino-acid NH2-terminal domain, and an intervening domain consisting of 11 repeating elements rich in Pro, Gly, and Tyr (R-domain). The dog homologue has 14 repeating elements in its R-domain explaining its larger size. The sensitivity of the R-domain to bacterial collagenase allowed us to isolate the NH2-terminal domain and show that the NH2 terminus was blocked by acetylation and, in the accompanying paper (Huflejt, M. E., Turck, C. W., Lindstedt, R., Barondes, S. H., and Leffler, H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 26712-26718), that the NH2-terminal domain is phosphorylated. In addition, we unexpectedly found an endogenous component, resembling 92-kDa type IV collagenase, that co-purified with L-29 and slowly digested the R-domain. Hence, L-29 is a substrate for bacterial and tissue collagenases even though the R-domain is non-collagenous. Moreover, the co-purification suggests a non-enzymatic interaction between 92-kDa collagenase and L-29.
