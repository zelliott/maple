The role of the transcription factor AP-1 in regulating D2 receptor transcriptional activity was investigated in D2 receptor expressing neuroblastoma cells, NB41A3, and in non-D2 receptor expressing CHO cells. Deletion of a region containing the putative AP-1 binding site resulted in a significant reduction in the activity in CHO cells; while the activity in NB41A3 cells was increased suggesting that the AP-1 site may differentially regulate D2 gene expression in these distinct cell types. However, both cell lines were found to express significant and similar levels of the transcription factors AP-1. Analysis of phosphorylated proteins in each of the cell lines provided evidence that AP-1 is phosphorylated in NB41A3 cells, but not in CHO cells. This result suggests that differential regulation of D2 gene expression may be related to AP-1 phosphorylation.
