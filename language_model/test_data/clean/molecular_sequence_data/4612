We examined the effects of 2"- or 3"-monoglycosylated alpha-galactosylceramides (alpha-GalCers) and 2",3"-diglycosylated alpha-GalCers on allogeneic MLR and the proliferation of murine spleen cells. It was found that their ceramide portions greatly affect their immunostimulatory activities, and that the 3"-hydroxyl group plays a more important role in the immunostimulatory effects of alpha-GalCer derivatives than the 2"-hydroxyl group.
