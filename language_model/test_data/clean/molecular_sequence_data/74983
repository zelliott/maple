We report the first complete nucleotide sequence (8,440 base pairs) of a biologically active feline leukemia virus (FeLV), designated FeLV-61E (or F6A), and the molecular cloning, biological activity, and env-long terminal repeat (LTR) sequence of another FeLV isolate, FeLV-3281 (or F3A). F6A corresponds to the non-disease-specific common-form component of the immunodeficiency disease-inducing strain of FeLV, FeLV-FAIDS, and was isolated from tissue DNA of a cat following experimental transmission of naturally occurring feline acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. F3A clones were derived from a subgroup-A-virus-producing feline tumor cell line. Both are unusual relative to other molecularly cloned FeLVs studied to date in their ability to induce viremia in weanling (8-week-old) cats and in their failure to induce acute disease. The F6A provirus is organized into 5'-LTR-gag-pol-env-LTR-3' regions; the gag and pol open reading frames are separated by an amber codon, and env is in a different reading frame. The deduced extracellular glycoproteins of F6A, F3A, and the Glasgow-1 subgroup A isolate of FeLV (M. Stewart, M. Warnock, A. Wheeler, N. Wilkie, J. Mullins, D. Onions, and J. Neil, J. Virol. 58:825-834, 1986) are 98% homologous, despite having been isolated from naturally infected cats 6 to 13 years apart and from widely different geographic locations. As a group, their envelope gene sequences differ markedly from those of the disease-associated subgroup B and acutely pathogenic subgroup C viruses. Thus, F6A and F3A correspond to members of a highly conserved family and represent prototypes of the horizontally transmitted, minimally pathogenic FeLV present in all naturally occurring infections.
