The crystal structure of an extremely thermostable multicopper oxidase (McoP) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum was determined at a resolution of 2.0 Å. The overall fold was comprised of three cupredoxin-like domains and the main-chain coordinates of the enzyme were similar to those of multicopper oxidases from Escherichia coli (CueO) and Bacillus subtilis (CotA). However, there were clear topological differences around domain 3 between McoP and the other two enzymes: a methionine-rich helix in CueO and a protruding helix in CotA were not present in McoP. Instead, a large loop (PL-1) covered the T1 copper centre of McoP and a short α-helix in domain 3 extended near the N-terminal end of PL-1. In addition, the sizes of several surface loops in McoP were markedly smaller than the corresponding loops in CueO and CotA. Structural comparison revealed that the presence of extensive hydrophobic interactions and a smaller cavity volume are likely to be the main factors contributing to the hyperthermostability of McoP.
