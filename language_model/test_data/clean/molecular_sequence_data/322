We surveyed the prevalence of Leptospira spp. from 2005 to 2008 in wild boars and deer in Japan using polymerase chain reaction. Leptospiral flaB was detected in the kidneys of wild boars (positive ratio, 15.2%; 22 of 145) from 9 prefectures and a deer (1.1%; 1 of 94) from 1 prefecture in Japan. There was no annual change in the prevalence of positive animals during the investigation period (chi-squared test, p=0.94) or in the prevalence in male and female wild boars in the 2007 to 2008 season (Fisher's exact test, P=0.45). The Leptospira species harbored by these animals were deduced to be L. interrogans (from 22 animals) and L. borgpetersenii (from 1 animal).
