CD45 is an abundant, highly glycosylated transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase expressed on hematopoietic cells. Herein we demonstrate that two proteins of 116 kDa and 80 kDa copurify with CD45 from mouse T cells. Microsequence analysis of the 116-kDa protein revealed high similarity to an incomplete human open reading frame that has been suggested to correspond to the catalytic alpha-subunit of glucosidase II. We determined the nucleotide sequence of the mouse cDNA and observed that it encodes a protein product nearly identical to its human homologue and shares an active site consensus sequence with Family 31 glucosidases. Amino acid sequencing of the 80-kDa protein, followed by molecular cloning, revealed high homology to human and bovine cDNAs postulated to encode the beta-subunit of glucosidase II. Antisera developed to the mouse beta-subunit allowed us to demonstrate that the interaction between CD45 and glucosidase II can be reconstituted in vitro in an endoglycosidase H-sensitive manner. The strong interaction between glucosidase II and CD45 may provide a paradigm for investigating novel aspects of the biology of these proteins.
