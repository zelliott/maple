Polymerase chain reaction for 4 fimbriae (F4, F5, F6, F41), 2 heat-stable enterotoxins (STa, STb), and 1 heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) were performed on 400 Escherichia coli isolates to determine their genotype prevalence among enterotoxigenic E. coli isolates from preweaned pigs with diarrhea in the Republic of Korea. A total of 200 of the 400 E. coli isolates were also selected for characterization of the O serogroup. Of these 200 isolates, serogroup could be determined in 139 (69.5%) but not in 61 isolates (30.5%). Isolates of serogroup O101 were the most common, followed in descending order by 08, 020, 0162, 0141, and 0149. Ninety-seven (24.3%) of the 400 E. coli isolates carried genes for at least 1 of the entertoxins or fimbrial adhesins. Of these 97 isolates, 27 carried genes for at least 1 of the fimbrial adhesins and entertoxins. Sixty-six percent of the isolates that carried fimbrial adhesin genes carried genes for at least 1 of the enterotoxins, and 71% of the isolates that carried enterotoxin genes carried genes for at least 1 of the fimbrial adhesins. Genes for the F6 fimbriae were detected in 6% of the E. coli isolates, and F4+, F41+, and F5+ genes were detected in 4.3%, 3.3%, and 2% of the isolates, respectively. Genes for STa, STb, and LT were detected in 10%, 8.5%, and 4.3% of the isolates, respectively. The 6 major genotypes observed in this study (in decreasing order) were F6+, STb+, F41+, STa+STb+, F6+STa+, and STa+.
