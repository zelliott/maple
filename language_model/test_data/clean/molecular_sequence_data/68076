We have recently shown that a group of antimicrobial peptides of bovine neutrophils share highly identical pro-sequences. In this paper we report the cDNA sequence of a 172 amino acid residue pig myeloid protein showing a similar pro-sequence of 101 residues. The carboxyl-moiety of the predicted protein is identical to the mature form of the proline- and arginine-rich antibacterial peptide named PR-39, isolated from pig intestine.
