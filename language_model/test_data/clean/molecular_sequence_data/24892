HLA-DP genotyping of 800 unrelated donor-recipient pairs in phase 5 of a retrospective analysis of unrelated bone marrow transplantation, sponsored by the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP), has identified two new DPB1 alleles (DPB1*8701 and DBP1*8801) and one new DPA1 (DPA1*0108) allele. Sequencing confirmed that all three of these new alleles represent novel combinations of previously described sequence motifs, reinforcing the notion that "gene conversion-like" events play an important role in generating HLA allelic diversity. The identification of these new alleles brings the total number of DPA1 alleles to 20 and the total number of DPB1 alleles to 94.
