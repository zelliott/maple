Thrombospondin (TSP) is a trimeric glycoprotein of Mr 420,000. It was originally described as a major component of human platelet alpha granules and is essential for the secondary phase of platelet aggregation. TSP is also synthesized and secreted by a variety of nucleated cells where it functions in processes involving growth and adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix. Many of these processes are heparin-inhibitable and are mediated by a proteolytic fragment of TSP called the heparin binding domain (HBD). In order to facilitate the analysis of the structure and function(s) of this domain, we have expressed this molecule in Escherichia coli. A fragment of a TSP cDNA that encodes the heparin binding domain was inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector pJBL6. In bacterial cells grown at 42 degrees C, this vector directs the synthesis of a 24,000-Da polypeptide. Milligram quantities of this protein were purified to homogeneity from E. coli lysates. The structure of the recombinant HBD was confirmed by protein sequencing. The protein was further characterized by analysis of its conformation and function. The recombinant HBD binds [3H]heparin with a Kd of 71 nM, almost identical to that of TSP-derived HBD (80 nM). Additionally, the recombinant HBD is able to compete for TSP binding to 11B carcinoma cells. These studies indicate that the recombinant HBD is synthesized and purified in a native configuration and is functionally equivalent to thrombospondin-derived HBD. They further indicate that glycosylation of the thrombospondin HBD is not necessary for its interaction with heparin and that sequences essential to this interaction reside within the first 229 amino acids of secreted thrombospondin.
