Homogeneity of rDNA sequence within a cell is maintained by mechanisms working at the DNA level. The imperative to maintain homogeneity is thought to result from pressure to maintain the sequence of the rRNA transcript. We have investigated the extent of sequence variation within and between members of a species that is unable to utilize some standard mechanisms of rDNA sequence correction. We have compared the sequence of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) located between the 18 S rRNA and 5.8 S rRNA genes of five different loci of a single Plasmodium falciparum genotype. The ITS1 sequences are identical at 80 to 91% of the positions among the three asexually expressed genes (A-types) and 75% between the two genes expressed during sporogony (S-types), with only 42 to 57% identity between the types. This is rather startling in that the differences described here for a single genome are greater than those normally seen when comparing rDNA units from distantly related organisms. We observe an apparent conservation of secondary structure within ITS1 sequences from the different transcription units, which would reflect a level of selection at the rRNA but the organism seems to be quite tolerant of primary sequence variation. Investigation of the mature coding region within the 18 S rRNA genes did not reveal sequence variation within A- and S-types from a single genotype. However, comparison of the 18 S rRNA coding region from 17 geographically distinct strains reveals up to 10% sequence variation within a 400 nucleotide region. Hence homogeneity of rRNA units within a species does not seem to be an imperative driven totally by selection at the RNA level. The extraordinary maintenance of homogeneity within rDNA units normally seen within a species appears to have significance beyond those that can be ascribed to the events involved in processing, assembly and function of the ribosome.
