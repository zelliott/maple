The photo-crosslinking amino acid, p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (pBpa), was genetically incorporated into Escherichia coli catabolite activator protein (CAP) in bacteria in response to an amber nonsense codon using an orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair. The mutant CAP (CAP-K26Bpa) containing pBpa formed a covalent complex with a DNA fragment containing the consensus operator sequence upon UV irradiation. Because this amino acid can be genetically incorporated into any DNA-binding protein in E. coli, yeast or mammalian cells with minimal perturbation of protein structure, this method should be generally useful for investigating DNA-protein interactions.
