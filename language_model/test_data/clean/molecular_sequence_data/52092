A novel version of Multiple Antigenic Peptide (MAP) is described. This approach consists of the synthesis of a properly functionalized antigen carrier and the incorporation, on request, of one or more activated antigenic peptides. This method was to synthesize a MAP containing eight epitopes of Hsp 70-1 from Plasmodium falciparum. Mice immunised with this MAP gave a specific response while those immunised with the peptide alone did not.
