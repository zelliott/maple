Get into the groove: The first high-resolution structure of a foldamer bound to a protein target is described (see picture; foldamer in sticks). The foldamer consists of alpha- and beta-amino acid residues and is bound to the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-x(L). The overall binding mode and key interactions observed in the foldamer/Bcl-x(L) complex mimic those seen in complexes of Bcl-x(L) with natural alpha-peptide ligands. Additional contacts in the foldamer/Bcl-x(L) complex involving beta-amino acid residues appear to contribute to binding affinity.
