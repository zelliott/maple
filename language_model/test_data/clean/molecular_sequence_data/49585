Short peptides derived from p14ARF and Hdm2 (14 and 15 amino acids in length, respectively), two cancer associated proteins, have been found to co-assemble into amyloid-like structures. Larger protein domains containing these peptide segments interact in cells and also undergo a disorder-to-order transition upon binding in vitro. In contrast to the association of beta-strand assemblies with amyloid diseases, the system described herein utilizes the formation of binary, extended beta-strands as a novel mechanism of biomolecular assembly. The beta-strand-containing fibrils formed from these peptides may allow the directed assembly of decorated fibrils with applications as biological nanostructures.
