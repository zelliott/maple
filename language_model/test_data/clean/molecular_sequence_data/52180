We have isolated a cDNA clone encoding ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase PGP9.5 from a rat brain cDNA library and examined the tissue distribution. The primary structure of the cDNA consists of 856 nucleotides including the entire coding region for 223 amino acids, and the calculated molecular mass is 24,782 Da. The rat PGP9.5 is strikingly homologous to the human PGP9.5, 75.2% of nucleic acids and 95.1% of amino acids being identical. The mRNA of PGP9.5 is most abundant in the rat brain and to a lesser degree in the testis. In other peripheral tissues we tested, the mRNA was undetectable. Western blotting using an anti-rat PGP9.5 antibody revealed the parallel distribution of mRNA and protein in various brain regions and testis. The availability of the rat PGP9.5 clone provides a new approach to examine the function of PGP9.5 and the role that it plays in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases.
