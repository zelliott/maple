An efficient cellulose degrading bacteria exists in the thermophilic wheat straw-degrading community, WDC2. However, this strain cannot be isolated and cultured using conventional separation techniques under strict anaerobic conditions. We successfully isolated a strain of effective cellulose degrading bacteria CTL-6 using a wash, heat shock, and solid-liquid alternating process. Analysis of its properties revealed that, although the community containing the strain CTL-6 grew under aerobic conditions, the purified strain CTL-6 only grew under anaerobic culture conditions. The strain CTL-6 had a striking capability of degrading cellulose (80.9% weight loss after 9 days of culture). The highest efficiency value of the endocellulase (CMCase activity) was 0.404 micromol/(min mL), cellulose degradation efficiency by CTL-6 was remarkably high at 50-65 degrees C with the highest degradation efficiency observed at 60 degrees C. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the closest relative to strain CTL-6 belonged to the genus Clostridium thermocellum. Strain CTL-6 was capable of utilizing cellulose, cellobiose, and glucose. Strain CTL-6 also grew with Sorbitol as the sole carbon source, whereas C. thermocellum is unable to do so.
