Two novel Gram-positive, acidophilic bacterial strains were isolated from forest soil. According to their 16S rRNA gene sequences, these strains are related closely to each other and form a distinct cluster within the order Actinomycetales. They show the typical features of filamentous actinomycetes, with branched vegetative hyphae and production of aerial hyphae. The distinct phylogenetic positions and the combination of chemotaxonomic characteristics of these strains justify the proposal of Actinospica gen. nov. Both strains display 3-hydroxydiaminopimelic acid plus traces of meso-diaminopimelic acid, the phospholipids diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, methylphosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol, the predominant cellular fatty acids i-C(15 : 0), i-C(16 : 0) and ai-C(15 : 0) and the whole-cell sugars mannose and rhamnose. They differ in the fatty acid profiles, in the quantitative ratios of the major menaquinones MK-9(H(4)), MK-9(H(6)) and MK-9(H(8)) and in the occurrence of additional whole-cell sugars (arabinose and xylose in strain GE134766(T) and galactose in strain GE134769(T)). Differences in the phenotypic characteristics and in the 16S rRNA gene sequences suggest the description of two species, Actinospica robiniae gen. nov., sp. nov. (the type species) and Actinospica acidiphila sp. nov., with the type strains GE134769(T) (=DSM 44927(T)=NRRL B-24432(T)) and GE134766(T) (=DSM 44926(T)=NRRL B-24431(T)), respectively. The DNA G+C contents of strains GE134769(T) and GE134766(T) are 70.8 and 69.2 mol%, respectively. Due to the large phylogenetic distance from known actinomycete genera, it is proposed to accommodate Actinospica gen. nov. in Actinospicaceae fam. nov. In addition, Catenulisporineae subord. nov. is proposed to harbour Actinospicaceae fam. nov. and the newly proposed family Catenulisporaceae, described in the accompanying paper.
