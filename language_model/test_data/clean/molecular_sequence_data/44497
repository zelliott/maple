We report the structural and functional features of the 5'-flanking region of the human cytosolic malic enzyme (ME) gene. A 2.2-kb subclone, comprising 1.5 kb upstream of the translation initiation codon, the first exon, and 0.7 kb of flanking intronic region, was sequenced and mapped to chromosome 6. The proximal promoter region is rich in G + C, lacks TATA or CCAAT boxes, and shows multiple transcription start sites, the major one 106 nucleotides upstream the ATG codon. Sequences -59/-13 and -137/-103 conferred maximal promoter activity. Deletional analysis revealed the presence of two regions positively regulated by 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3). The proximal region confers the strongest T3 inducibility to the human ME as well as to a heterologous promoter. Thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRbeta) binds to an inverted palindromic T3 response element (TRE) at position -105/-87 in a manner that is prevented by T3. Nuclear extracts or in vitro-translated retinoid acid receptor alpha (RXR alpha) shifted the TRbeta retarded band to slower-mobility complexes, which are unaffected by T3. In the absence of T3, overexpression of TRbeta repressed the ME promoter activity, most probably, through binding of TRbeta homodimers to the TRE. Thus, T3 seems to control ME transcription by inducing the dissociation of TRbeta homodimers and the functional activation of liganded heterodimers.
