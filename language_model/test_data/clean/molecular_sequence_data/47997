Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) glycoproteins E (ORF 68) and I (ORF 67) are members of late genes. They belong to the major components of the virion envelope and can be found on the host cell surface as well. To get further insights in the regulation of gE and gI expression, which are known to be activated by IE4 and IE62, we analysed the intergenic regions of ORF 66/67 and ORF 67/68, containing the putative promoters of gI and gE. We have mapped the transcriptional start site of gE and have identified an extensive set of eucaryotic cis-elements: typical TATA- and CAAT-motifs and further regulatory sequences to facilitate interaction with eucaryotic transcription factors. Reporter constructs have been made using the intergenic regions of ORF 66/67 and ORF 67/68 as promoter elements. In cis-trans interaction studies, an influence on the regulation of transcription and reporter gene expression of overexpressed transfactors, LAP/LIP, Sp1, YY1 and NF-E2 has become measurable. In addition, protein-DNA binding assays using both gE- and gI-intergenic regions and cellular extracts from different VZV-permissive cells have suggested a binding of a 32 and 18 kD protein. In conclusion, these data indicate an involvement of common cellular transcription factors in the regulation of VZV late gene expression.
