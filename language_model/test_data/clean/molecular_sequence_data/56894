We have recently cloned cDNAs encoding human insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBP)-4, -5 and -6 and have now expressed these BPs in yeast as ubiquitin (Ub)-IGFBP fusion proteins. Western ligand blotting with 125I-IGF II under nonreducing conditions of recombinant human (rh) IGFBP-containing yeast lysates revealed specific binding bands for IGFBP-4, -5, and -6 at apparent molecular masses of 24-26, 30-32, and 24-26 kDa, respectively, indicating expression and processing of the fusion proteins. HPLC purified rhIGFBPs had virtually the same amino acid composition, amino acid number, and NH2-terminal sequences as the native BPs. Rabbit antiserum directed against each rhIGFBP-4, -5 and -6 reacted specifically with the respective rhIGFBP as well as with the native human counterpart and displayed very low cross-reactivity with other IGFBPs. Except for the affinity of rhIGFBP-6 for IGF I (Ka = 8.5 x 10(8) M-1), the affinity constants of the three IGFBPs for IGF I and II lie between 1.7 and 3.3 x 10(10) M-1. When present in excess, rhIGFBP-4, -5, and -6 inhibited IGF I- and II-stimulated DNA and glycogen synthesis in human osteoblastic cells, although rh-IGFBP-6 had only a weak inhibitory effect on IGF I in agreement with its relatively lower IGF I affinity constant.
