Cryptosporidium wrairi was isolated from guinea pigs during a spontaneous outbreak of cryptosporidiosis. Despite the morphological and antigenic similarities to C. parvum, C. wrairi displayed a different host range and site of infection and may represent a separate species or sub-species. We used the polymerase chain reaction to clone two distinct 550 bp-long DNA fragments, Wc-I and Wc-II, of the gene encoding the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) of C. wrairi, which showed 98% identity to the C. parvum homologue. Within Wc-I, polymorphic Rsal restriction sites were used to develop a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method able to distinguish C. wrairi from C. parvum and to identify two groups of C. parvum isolates differentially associated with animal and human infections.
