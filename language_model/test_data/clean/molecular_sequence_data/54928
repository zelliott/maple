The ACT domain is a structurally conserved small molecule binding domain which is mostly involved in amino acid and purine metabolism. Here, we report the crystal structure of a tandem ACT domain-containing protein (ACTP) from Galdieria sulphuraria. The two ACTP monomers in the asymmetric unit form a dimer with a non-crystallographic twofold axis in a domain-swapped manner, showing a horseshoe-like structure with a central crevice. This structure contributes to expand our knowledge on the structural diversity of ACT domain-containing proteins.
