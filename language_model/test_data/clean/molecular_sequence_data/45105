A new PLA2 homologue was purified from Agkistrodon blomhoffii Siniticus by applying reverse phase (HPLC) C18 column. The molecular weight of PLA2 homologue is 13900Da and its purity is 97.2%. The results of N-terminal sequence analysis were HLLQFRKMIKKMTKK. All the fragments were determined with the protein-protein BLAST software of GenBank. BLAST analysis showed that the N-terminal sequences of 15 amino acids were highly homologous with the sequences of other PLA2.
