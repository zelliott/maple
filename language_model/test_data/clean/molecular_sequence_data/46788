The large amount of genome sequence data now publicly available can be accessed through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez search and retrieval system, making it possible to explore data of a breadth and scope exceeding traditional flatfile views.

Here we report recent improvements for completely sequenced genomes from viruses, bacteria, and yeast. Flexible web based views, precomputed relationships, and immediate access to analytical tools provide scientists with a portal into the new insights to be gained from completed genome sequences.
