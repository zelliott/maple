Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L. cv. UC82b) was found to contain two distinct 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase genes that are differentially expressed. The corresponding cDNAs were isolated and characterized. Both genes code for putative plastidic DAHP synthase isoforms. The deduced amino acid sequences are 79% identical. A comparison of the known Solanaceae DAHP synthases indicates two distinct conserved isoforms. The steady-state levels of transcripts of the two tomato genes differ in all organs analysed.
