Human glutathione synthetase (hGS) catalyzes the second ATP-dependent step in the biosynthesis of glutathione (GSH) and is negatively cooperative to the Î³-glutamyl substrate. The hGS active site is composed of three highly conserved catalytic loops, notably the alanine rich A-loop. Experimental and computational investigations of the impact of mutation of Asp458 are reported, and thus the role of this A-loop residue on hGS structure, activity, negativity cooperativity and stability is defined. Several Asp458 hGS mutants (D458A, D458N and D458R) were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis and their activities determined (10%, 15% and 7% of wild-type hGS, respectively). The Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)) was determined for all three substrates (glycine, GAB and ATP): glycine K(m) increased by 30-115-fold, GAB K(m) decreased by 8-17-fold, and the ATP K(m) was unchanged. All Asp458 mutants display a change in cooperativity from negative cooperativity to non-cooperative. All mutants show similar stability as compared to wild-type hGS, as determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The findings indicate that Asp458 is essential for hGS catalysis and that it impacts the allostery of hGS.
