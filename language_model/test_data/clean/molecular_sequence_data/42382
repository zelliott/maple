Using a case-control design, a reported association of schizophrenia with homozygosity at the dopamine D3 receptor gene locus was investigated in a group of patients (n = 53), with schizophrenia (DSM-III-R), and psychiatrically normal controls (n = 61), matched for ethnicity and area of residence. No significant differences in the distribution of alleles or genotypes between the two groups could be detected. However, among patients with a family history of schizophrenia, as compared to controls without such family history, an association with allele 1 at this locus was noted (Odds ratio 12.4, C.I. 1.61, 96.35).
