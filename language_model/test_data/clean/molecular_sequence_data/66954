The internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)from encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) is a popular RNA element used widely in experimental and pharmaceutical applications to express proteins in eukaryotic cells or cell-free extracts. Inclusion of the wild-type element in monocistronic or bicistronic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) confers a high level of cap-independent translation activity to appropriately configured cistrons. The history of this element and the experimental consequences of sequence derivations inherent to commercial IRES vectors are less well known. Compared head-to-head with dual-luciferase reporter constructs, a native EMCV IRES in a bicistronic configuration directed 8- to 10-fold more protein than a similarly configured pIRES vector. It also produced nearly twice as much protein as pCITE-1, an early monocistronic iteration, harboring a suboptimal A7 sequence in a crucial structural motif The results indicate that investigators should be aware of and carefully report the sequence of their IRES in any comparative study. The preferred IRES (viral bases 273-845) and the minimum IRES (viral bases 400-836) for optimum activity are illustrated.
