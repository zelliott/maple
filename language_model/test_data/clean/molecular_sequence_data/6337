Isolated Escherichia coli molecular chaperone Cpn60 (GroEL) has been further purified from tightly bound substrate polypeptides by two different procedures: (i) group-specific affinity chromatography by using the triazine dye Procion yellow HE-3G as affinity ligand, and (ii) urea-induced monomerization and subsequent chromatography. Procion yellow binds specifically to aromatic amino-acid side chains present in the majority of proteins, but has no affinity to GroEL because of its low content of aromatic residues. Some GroEL-bound polypeptides are buried within the aqueous cavity of the GroEL oligomer, whereas others are exposed on its surface and available for affinity-ligand interactions and the complex is thereby retarded on Procion yellow columns. Pure substrate-free GroEL was obtained after ion-exchange chromatography of GroEL monomers followed by reassembly of the purified monomers into functional GroEL oligomers. The final preparation contained no substrate polypeptides bound to GroEL as judged by electrophoretic analysis and lack of tryptophan fluorescence. GroEL preparations also displayed two equally strong bands on native electrophoresis suggesting the presence of two conformers. Monomers of GroEL showed heterogeneity with respect to isoelectric point and molecular mass when analysed by MALDI-MS and electrophoresis under native and denaturing conditions respectively. By use of MALDI-MS, highly accurate molecular masses of wild-type and a truncated form of GroEL were determined and verified, by comparison with their respective gene sequences.
