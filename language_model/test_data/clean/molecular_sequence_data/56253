Repeated DNA sequences have been instrumental in the development of DNA probes for many different parasites. Isolation of such DNA probes has generally been accomplished by differential screening of genomic libraries with total genomic DNA preparations. In the current work, a rational design strategy is presented for the development of oligonucleotide probes based upon repeated sequence families. A repeated sequence family present in the genome of Onchocerca parasites, designated O-150, has been amplified from various samples of genomic DNA using PCR. DNA sequence analysis of the resulting PCR products demonstrated that the sequences may be arranged into clusters within which the individual sequences are identical or nearly identical. Differences among the cluster consensus sequences have been exploited to explain the specificities of previously isolated O-150 based probes and to develop two new oligonucleotide probes. One of these probes hybridizes specifically to Onchocerca volvulus O-150 PCR products, while the second hybridizes specifically to O-150 PCR products from the closely related bovine parasite O. ochengi. These oligonucleotide probes have been used to characterize Onchocerca infective larvae isolated from wild caught infected flies in West Africa. Because repeated sequence families are a common feature of most genomes, including those of parasites, this method should be applicable to the rational design of oligonucleotide probes for other parasitic infections.
