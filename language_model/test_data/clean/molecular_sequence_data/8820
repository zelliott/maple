Phosphorylation of c-Myb has been implicated in the regulation of the binding of c-Myb to DNA. We show that murine c-Myb is phosphorylated at Ser-11 and -12 in vivo and that these sites can be phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase II (CKII), analogous to chicken c-Myb. An efficient method to study DNA binding properties of full-length c-Myb and Myb mutants under nondenaturing conditions was developed. It was found that a Myb mutant in which Ser-11 and -12 were replaced with Ala (Myb Ala-11/12), wild-type c-Myb, and Myb Asp-11/12 bound to the A site of the mim-1 promoter with decreasing affinities. In agreement with this finding, Myb Ala-11/12 transactivated better than wild-type c-Myb and Myb Asp-11/12 on the mim-1 promoter or a synthetic Myb-responsive promoter. Similar observations were made for the myeloid-specific neutrophil elastase promoter. The presence of NF-M or an NF-M-like activity abolished partially the differences seen with the Ser-11/12 mutants, suggesting that the reduced DNA binding due to negative charge at positions 11 and 12 can be compensated for by NF-M. Since no direct interaction of c-Myb and NF-M was observed, we propose that the cooperativity is mediated by a third factor. Our data offer two possibilities for how casein kinase II phosphorylation can influence c-Myb function: first, by reducing c-Myb DNA binding and thereby influencing transactivation, and second, by enhancing the apparent cooperativity between c-Myb and NF-M or an NF-M-like activity.
