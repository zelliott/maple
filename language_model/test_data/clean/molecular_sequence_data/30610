Ribonuclease and chemical probes were used to investigate the binding sites of ribosomal protein L11 and the pentameric complex L10.(L12)4 on Escherichia coli 23 S RNA. Protein complexes were formed with an RNA fragment constituting most of domains I and II or with 23 S RNA and they were investigated by an end-labelling method and a reverse transcriptase procedure, respectively. The results demonstrate that the two protein moieties bind at adjacent sites within a small RNA region. The L11 binding region overlaps with those of the modified peptide antibiotics thiostrepton and micrococcin and is constrained structurally by a three-helix junction while the L10.(L12)4 site is centred on an adjacent internal loop. The secondary structure of the whole region was determined in detail by the phylogenetic sequence comparison method, and the results for the L11 binding region, together with the experimental data, were used in a computer graphics approach to build a partial RNA tertiary structural model. The model provides insight into the topography of the L11 binding site. It also provides a structural rationale for the mutually co-operative binding of protein L11 with the antibiotics thiostrepton and micrococcin, and with the L10.(L12)4 protein complex.
