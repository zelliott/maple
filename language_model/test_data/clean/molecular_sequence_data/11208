The cDNA sequence of the human chondroadherin gene was cloned using PCR-based techniques. The gene encodes a protein of 359 amino acids, of which the first 21 amino acids represent a putative signal peptide sequence and which possesses 11 leucine-rich repeats flanked by cysteine-rich regions. The cDNA possesses a 5' untranslated region of 149 bp, a coding region of 1080 bp including the stop codon, and a 3' untranslated region of 561 bp terminating in a poly(A) tail. The cDNA hybridizes with a single messenger RNA of 1.9 kb, which is present in chondrocytes at all ages. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed that the chondroadherin gene possesses two introns, both of which reside within the coding region. The first intron has a length of about 2.3 kb and separates the codons for lysine(258) and phenylalanine(259). The second intron has a length of about 0.5 kb and splits the codon for tryptophan(314). This genomic organization results in exon 1 encoding the signal peptide, the amino-terminal cysteine-rich region, and the first 9 leucine-rich repeats; exon 2 encoding the last 2 leucine-rich repeats and part of the carboxy-terminal cysteine-rich region; and exon 3 encoding the remainder of the carboxy-terminal cysteine-rich region. The gene does not possess a TATA box prior to its transcription start site. Isolation of a cosmid clone spanning the chondroadherin gene enabled its chromosome location to be established. The gene was shown to reside at chromosome 17q21.33.
