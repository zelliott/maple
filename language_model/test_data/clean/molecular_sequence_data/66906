To evaluate the role of the C-terminal region in Bacteroides fragilis toxin (BFT) activity, processing, and secretion, sequential C-terminal truncation and point mutations were created by site-directed mutagenesis. Determination of BFT activity on HT29/C1 cells, cleavage of E-cadherin, and the capacity to induce interleukin-8 secretion by wild-type BFT and C-terminal deletion mutants showed that deletion of only 2 amino acid residues at the C terminus significantly reduced BFT biological activity and deletion of eight or more amino acid residues obliterated BFT biologic activity. Western blot and reverse transcription-PCR analyses indicated that BFT mutants lacking seven or fewer amino acid residues in the C-terminal region are processed and expressed similar to wild-type BFT. However, BFT mutants lacking eight or more amino acids at the C terminus are expressed similar to wild-type BFT but are unstable. We concluded that the C terminus of BFT is not tolerant of modest amino acid deletions, suggesting that it is biologically important for BFT activity.
