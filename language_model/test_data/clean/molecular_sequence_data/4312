Immunization of BALB/c mice with purified recombinant human Ro52 protein resulted in three anti-Ro52 MoAbs termed 2E7, 4C6 and 4F11. All anti-Ro52 MoAbs specifically reacted with recombinant human Ro52 protein, and also with Ro52 protein in total extracts of all human cell lines analysed, including the epithelial cell line HeLa, the B cell line Raji, the bladder carcinoma cell line RT112, and a fibroblast cell line derived from patients with xeroderma pigmentosum. The anti-Ro52 MoAbs were able to immunoprecipitate the recombinant human Ro52 protein expressed in wheat germ extract, but failed to precipitate hY RNAs from cell extracts. The staining pattern of the MoAbs strongly differed between the RT112 cells and the fibroblast cell line. RT112 cells displayed an intense cytoplasmic staining and in addition distinct fine nuclear speckles. In contrast, in the fibroblast cell line no cytoplasmic staining but only staining of distinct nuclear speckles was observed. Using deletion mutants of Ro52 the epitopes recognized by the anti-Ro52 MoAbs 2E7, 4C6 and 4F11 were partially mapped. All three MoAbs appeared to recognize distinct epitopes, that are located in the regions of Ro52 bordered by amino acids 136-164, 208-363 and 136-190, respectively. These MoAbs can be of great use in studying the cellular processes in which the Ro52 protein is involved.
