The expression and distribution of prolactin (PRL) mRNA and their alterations induced by estrogen and bromocriptine were investigated using non-radioisotopic in situ hybridization (ISH) at the electron microscopic (EM) level. Our EM-ISH studies using biotinylated oligonucleotide probes showed that estrogen induced whirling changes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) of female rat PRL cells and increased transcription of PRL genes located on the polysomes of the whirling RER. The presence of mammosomatotroph cells in the rat pituitary gland was also verified in our EM-ISH studies. After bromocriptine administration, PRL cells contained many secretory granules due to the inhibition of secretion. Pre- and post-embedding EM-ISH and northern hybridization studies revealed that bromocriptine induced the distorted, vesiculated, and dilated RER, and also the suppressed PRL mRNA expression. The activity of protein kinase C (PKC), which mediates PRL gene expression, tended to be elevated by estrogen and suppressed by bromocriptine. Therefore, it is considered that the ultrastructural and quantitative changes in PRL mRNA expression evoked by estrogen and bromocriptine may be mediated by the intracellular signal transduction system, including PKC.
