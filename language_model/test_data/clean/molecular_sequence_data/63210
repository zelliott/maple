Previous studies have shown that mRNA and protein encoded by late embryogenesis-abundant (LEA) gene D113 from Gossypium hirsutum L. accumulate at high levels in mature seeds and also in response to abscisic acid (ABA) in young embryo. In this study, we studied the expression of four promoter 5' deletion constructs (-1383, -974, -578 and -158) of the LEA D113 gene fused to beta-glucuronidase (GUS). GUS activity analysis revealed that the -578 promoter fragment was necessary to direct seed-specific GUS expression in transgenic tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum L.). To further investigate the expression pattern of LEA D113 promoter under environmental stresses, 2-week-old transgenic tobacco seedlings were exposed to ABA, dehydration, high salinity and cold treatments. GUS activity in the seedlings was quantified fluorimetrically, and expression was also observed by histochemical staining. An apparent increase in GUS activity was found in plants harboring constructs -1383, -974 and -578 after 24 h of ABA or high-salinity treatments, as well as after 10 days of dehydration. By contrast, only a slight increase was observed in all the three lines after cold treatment. Virtually no change in expression was found in construct -158 in response to dehydration, salinity and cold, but there was a moderate response to ABA, suggesting that the region between -574 and -158 was necessary for dehydration- and salinity-dependent expression, whereas ABA-responsive cis-acting elements might be located in the -158 region of the promoter.
