From a library of DNA fragments associated with Ultrabithorax protein in vivo, we have isolated nessy, a new Drosophila gene that encodes a putative transmembrane protein conserved in evolution from Caenorhabditis elegans, to human. Zygotic expression occurs transiently in mesectodermal cells at gastrulation, proceeds in mesoderm and endoderm lineages during germ band movements and becomes then restricted to anterior and posterior domains in the visceral mesoderm. The Hox proteins Ultrabithorax, Antennapedia and AbdominalA are likely acting simultaneously to repress nessy in the other parts of the visceral mesoderm.
