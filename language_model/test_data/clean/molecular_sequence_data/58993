It has been proposed that interval 6 of the human Y chromosome contains the gene or genes that control spermatogenesis (AZF, azoospermia factor). We have studied this region in 33 patients with oligo- or azoospermia, using PCR amplification of the YRRM1 (RBM1) gene and of 13 sequence-tagged sites (STSs), all mapping within interval 6. Six of the 33 patients showed no amplification of specific STSs, whereas there was no failure of amplification in normal male controls. We deduce that these six patients had microdeletions in interval 6 of the Y chromosome that correlated with the oligo- or azoospermia of these individuals. On biopsy of the testis, two of these patients showed a low number of germ cells, and four showed arrest with spermatides. We conclude that PCR amplification of Y-specific regions is a powerful and very sensitive tool for screening infertile men.
