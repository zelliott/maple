The hepatitis C virus (HCV) virion is associated with lipoproteins and immunoglobulins in the sera of patients with chronic hepatitis C; however, an accurate binding rate of HCV to lipoproteins or immunoglobulins has not yet been elucidated. Therefore, the accurate binding rate of HCV to low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and immunoglobulins was measured quantitatively by a real-time PCR assay. The immunoglobulin binding rate of HCV was found to be greater than 97.5% in most patients, as compared with an LDL binding rate of greater than 80% in most patients. In contrast, the HDL binding rate was greater than 98% in the genotype 2a/2b patients, while it varied in the genotype 1b patients. The genotype 2a/2b HCV not only had a higher LDL binding rate but also had a strikingly higher HDL binding rate than that of the genotype 1b HCV. These lipoprotein binding rates correlated neither to any patient's variables, including the serum apolipoprotein levels, nor to the viral load or the hypervariable region 1 (HVR 1) amino acid sequences. Most of the HCV virions in the sera of such patients have been shown to be associated simultaneously with immunoglobulins and LDL and/or HDL, but not exclusively.
