A Trichinella spiralis cDNA expression library was constructed in lambda gt11 from muscle larvae mRNA and immunologically screened to identify genes encoding previously described immunodiagnostic excretory-secretory (ES) antigens. Screening the library with T. spiralis infection serum from swine or rabbit antiserum to T. spiralis ES antigen identified one clone, designated TsA-12, that contains a cDNA transcript 539 bp in length and codes for an apparent 123-kDa beta-galactosidase fusion protein that does not cross-react with Trichuris suis or Ascaris suum infection serum. Western blots of T. spiralis extracts and immunoperoxidase staining of tissue sections from muscle larvae using antibodies to purified TsA-12 demonstrate homology between TsA-12 and the 53 kDa diagnostic antigen from ES products (designated Ts.53) and localize the homologous native antigen to the stichocyte cells of the parasite. ELISA tests using TsA-12 as antigen, detected antibodies to T. spiralis in experimentally-infected mice as early as 14 days post-inoculation with maximum antibody titers being reached at 28 days post-inoculation. The TsA-12 dscDNA hybridizes to mRNA sequences expressed in both the muscle larvae and adult stages; however, concomitant expression of the native antigen is not observed within adult ES products. Southern blots of homologous and heterologous genomic DNAs probed with 32P-labeled TsA-12 dscDNA fragments verify TsA-12 as a T. spiralis specific sequence that is present in multiple copies within the parasite genome.
