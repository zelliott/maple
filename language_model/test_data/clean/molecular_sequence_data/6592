Although Mycobacterium leprae shares many protein antigens with other mycobacterial species, there is a degree of specificity in the T cell response to the organism. This is evident in the failure of cross-protection between mycobacterial species and the specific unresponsiveness to M. leprae in lepromatous leprosy patients. The antigenic basis of this specificity is unresolved, but the M. leprae 18-kD protein is one candidate because of its restricted distribution and the isolation of M. leprae-specific T cell clones reactive with the protein from M. leprae-vaccinated subjects. In the course of analysing the human T cell repertoire to mycobacteria we have isolated further CD4+ T cell clones reactive with this protein from a subject who had never been exposed to M. leprae. These clones did not respond to other mycobacteria, including M. tuberculosis and M. bovis (BCG). In addition, they were unreactive with the M. tuberculosis 16-kD protein which has recently been shown to have limited amino acid identity with the M. leprae 18-kD protein. Both clones reacted with peptide 38-50 from the M. leprae 18-kD protein, the T cell response to which is restricted by HLA-DR4. Although homologues for the gene encoding the M. leprae 18-kD antigen have been identified in M. avium and M. intracellulare, the clones failed to respond to preparations of M. avium. Both clones secreted interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumour necrosis factor-beta (TNF-beta) and were cytolytic against autologous targets pulsed with peptide 38-50 or the 18-kD protein. The nature of the antigen which stimulates this apparently 'M. leprae-specific' response is unknown. Nevertheless the recognition of the 18-kD protein by individuals not exposed to leprosy indicates that this protein may not be suitable as a reagent to distinguish between infection with M. leprae and other pathogenic mycobacteria.
