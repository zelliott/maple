A nucleus-encoded MinE gene, designated PpMinE, from Physcomitrella patens was identified using RT-PCR. The presence of both N- and C-terminal extensions in PpMinE protein suggested its cyanobacterial origin. The transient expression of PpMinE using green fluorescent protein fusion in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) indicated that the PpMinE was a chloroplast-targeted protein. Overexpression of PpMinE in Escherichia coli caused division site misplacement and minicell formation, suggesting evolutionary functional conservation of MinE during plant phylogenesis. According to the phylogenetic tree, PpMinE protein has a close relationship with the highland plants, which suggests that the transfer events of MinE gene from plastid to nucleus might have occurred before the origin of the land plants.
