The cDNAs of three cytokines, viz., IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-γ from Dromedary camels were amplified by PCR using Bactrian camel sequences and subsequently cloned for sequence analysis. Relationship based on amino acid sequences revealed that Dromedary camel IL-2 shared 99.5% and 99.3% identity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels with Bactrian camel IL-2. In the case of IL-4, the identity of Dromedary camel was 99.7% and 99.2% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively with that of Bactrian camel. The Dromedary camel IFN-γ shared 100% identity both at nucleotide and amino acid levels with Bactrian camel IFN-γ. Phylogenetic analysis based on amino acid sequences indicated the close relationship in these cytokine genes between the Dromedary camel and other camelids.
