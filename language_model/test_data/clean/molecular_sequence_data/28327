Celiac disease is strongly associated with the HLA class II D-region serologic markers DR3 (DRw17) and DQw2. Moreover, by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, greater than 90% of DR3 (DRw17), DQw2 celiac disease patients have a polymorphic 4.0-kilobase Rsa I DP B gene DNA fragment. The present study sought to determine if there is a unique HLA class II D-region A or B gene structural variant on the DR3 (DRw17) haplotype found in celiac disease. The polymorphic second exons of the coding DRB, DQA and DQB, and DPA and DPB genes in celiac disease patients with the DR3 (DRw17) haplotype were sequenced after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. To define the DP B genes associated with celiac disease, the second exons of the coding DP B genes from 27 celiac disease patients were amplified similarly and probed by using a panel of sequence specific oligonucleotides. The HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP A and B gene second exon sequences of celiac disease patients were noted to be identical to sequences that can be found also, although at a significantly lower frequency, in unaffected individuals. This is compatible with a disease model wherein the HLA class II genes on the DR3 (DRw17) haplotype are necessary, but not sufficient, for the phenotypic expression of celiac disease. Analysis of the DP B genes revealed a significant increase in the frequency of the alleles DPB1 and DPB3 in celiac disease. Furthermore, the increased frequency of the 4.0-kilobase Rsa I DP B gene restriction fragment length polymorphism in celiac disease can be accounted for by the overrepresentation in disease of the alleles DPB1 and DPB3. The HLA-associated susceptibility to celiac disease appears to be multigenic, with specific, but structurally normal, allelic variants in the DP and DQ/DR subregions contributing to disease susceptibility.
