To evaluate some of the mechanisms involved in the hypocholesterolemic effects of corn fiber oil (CFO), male Hartley guinea pigs were fed diets containing increasing doses of CFO [0 (control), 5, 10 or 15 g/100 g]. Total fat was adjusted to 15 g/100 g in all diets with regular corn oil. Diets contained 0.25 g/100 g cholesterol. A positive control group (LC) with low dietary cholesterol (0.04 g/100 g) was also included. Plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations were 32, 55 and 57% (P < 0.0005) lower with increasing doses of CFO. Compared with controls, intake of CFO resulted in 27-32% lower hepatic microsomal cholesterol (P < 0.0001), the regulatory pool of LDL receptor (LDL-R) expression. CFO intake resulted in favorable plasma and hepatic cholesterol concentrations, similar to those in guinea pigs fed the LC diet. Hepatic cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7) activity was approximately 88% higher in guinea pigs fed the two higher dosages of CFO (P < 0.05). In parallel, CYP7 mRNA abundance was approximately 88% higher in guinea pigs fed all three CFO diets. CFO treatment also induced hepatic LDLR mRNA by 66-150% with significant differences at the highest CFO dose. These results suggest that CFO, as a result of decreased bile acid absorption, increased mRNA abundance and activity of CYP7. Because hepatic cholesterol is the substrate for CYP7, a lowering of cholesterol concentrations in the total and microsomal pools was observed. As a response to the depleted microsomal free cholesterol pool, the LDL receptor was up-regulated, drawing more cholesterol from plasma, thus leading to the observed decrease in plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations.
