The thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) exists in two forms (single polypeptide and two subunits), whereas the lutropin/chorionic gonadotropin receptor (LH/CGR) is a single chain. Recent data suggest that the TSHR cleaves at two sites. We mutagenized selected chimeric TSH-LH/CGR to localize the cleavage sites in the TSHR. All 23 receptors mutated in the estimated vicinity of the upstream site cleaved into two subunits as determined by 125I-TSH cross-linking to intact cells. In contrast, in a series of mutations homologous to the noncleaving LH/CGR, the downstream TSHR cleavage site localized to three amino acids (GQE367-369). Remarkably, group substitution of these residues, but not substitution of individual residues, abolished cleavage. Moreover, the mutation that prevented cleavage (GQE367-369NET) transposed a motif (NET291-293) that is glycosylated in the LH/CGR. TSHR cleavage or noncleavage after substitution of GQE367-369 with other triplets (AAA, NQE, and NQT) was consistent with a role for N-linked glycosylation at this site. In summary, our data (i) support the concept that the TSHR cleaves at two sites, (ii) relate TSHR residues GQE367-369 to cleavage at the second, downstream site, and (iii) suggest that cleavage or noncleavage at site two is related to N-linked glycosylation. These findings provide new insight into the evolutionary divergence of two closely related receptors.
