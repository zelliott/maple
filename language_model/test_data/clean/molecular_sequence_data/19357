The genus Blastobotrys, which now includes species previously assigned to the synonymous genera Arxula and Sympodiomyces, represents the anamorph of the ascosporogenous genus Trichomonascus. Six novel species are proposed for assignment to Blastobotrys. They were detected from their unique nucleotide sequences in large-subunit rDNA, ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA, mitochondrial small-subunit rDNA and the cytochrome oxidase II gene. The proposed novel species are Blastobotrys americana sp. nov. (type strain NRRL Y-6844(T)=CBS 10337(T); substrate unknown; Kansas, USA), Blastobotrys illinoisensis sp. nov. (type strain NRRL YB-1343(T)=CBS 10339(T); from forest debris; Illinois, USA), Blastobotrys malaysiensis sp. nov. (type strain NRRL Y-6417(T)=CBS 10336(T); from soil; Malaysia), Blastobotrys muscicola sp. nov. (type strain NRRL Y-7993(T)=CBS 10338(T); from moss; Louisiana, USA), Blastobotrys peoriensis sp. nov. (type strain NRRL YB-2290(T)=CBS 10340(T); from a fungus; Peoria, IL, USA) and Blastobotrys raffinosifermentans sp. nov. (type strain NRRL Y-27150(T)=CBS 6800(T); substrate unknown).
