The positively acting regulatory gene amdR of Aspergillus nidulans coordinately regulates the expression of five structural genes involved in the catabolism of certain amides (amdS), omega amino acids (gatA and gabA), and lactams (lamA and lamB) in the presence of omega amino acid inducers. Analysis of the amdR gene showed that it contains three small introns, heterogeneous 5' and 3' transcription sites, and multiple AUG codons prior to the major AUG initiator. The predicted amdR protein sequence has a cysteine-rich "zinc finger" DNA-binding motif at the amino-terminal end, four putative acidic transcription activation motifs in the carboxyl-terminal half, and two sequences homologous to the simian virus 40 large T antigen nuclear localization motif. These nuclear localization sequences overlap the cysteine-rich DNA-binding motif. A series of 5', 3', and internal deletions were examined in vivo for transcription activator function and showed that the amdR product contains at least two activation regions in the carboxyl-terminal half. Each of these activator amdR product contains at least two activation regions in the carboxyl-terminal half. Each of these activator regions may function independently, but both are required for wild-type levels of transcription activation. A number of the amdR deletion products were found to compete with the wild-type amdR product in vivo. Development of a rapid method for the localization of amdR mutations is presented, and using this technique, we localized and sequenced the mutation in the semiconstitutive amdR6c allele. The amdR6c missense mutation occurs in the middle of the gene, and it is suggested that it results in an altered protein which activates gene expression efficiently in the absence of an inducer.
