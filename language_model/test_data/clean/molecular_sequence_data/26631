N-Linked glycosylation plays important roles in modulating protein structure and function. The direct impact of the modification on protein conformation is not yet well understood.

Here we probed the dynamic changes following Endo H trimming of high mannose glycans in Î±-amylase by means of amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry.

The results revealed that deglycosylation elicited extensive alterations in backbone dynamics, affecting regions both adjacent to and distal from the glycosylation site.

The overall exchange rate is reduced in the glycosylated state, which indicates rigidity enhancement due to the attached carbohydrates.
