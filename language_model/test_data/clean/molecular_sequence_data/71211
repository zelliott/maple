The HS9 gene encoding a surface membrane protein is expressed in thymic epithelial cells. We have isolated the mouse HS9 gene and determined the sequence of all exons. The mouse HS9 gene is composed of 14 exons spanning approx. 31 kb. Primer extension analysis identified two transcription initiation sites 33 bp and 179 bp upstream from the ATG start codon. DNA sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the first exon revealed a number of consensus binding sites for known transcription factors such as GC box, Sp1, NFkappaB, gamma-IRE. Neither typical TATA nor CCAAT boxes were found in this region. These results and the analysis of the luciferase activity showed that transcription of the HS9 gene is regulated at a TATA-less promoter.
