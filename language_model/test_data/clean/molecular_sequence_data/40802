The taxonomic position of Inocybe inexpectata is reconsidered on the basis of new molecular and morphological data from four published records. Up to three species can be recognized to which the name I. inexpectata has been applied. In addition to distinct morphological features present in this lineage it is proposed here as the new genus Tubariomyces. A complete taxonomical description of the genus and the species Tubariomyces inexpectatus and T. hygrophoroides sp. nov. also is provided.
