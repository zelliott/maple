The protein sequence of MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAP kinase 2) deduced from mouse cDNA sequence reveals structural features of the enzyme, which could be of importance for its function: a proline-rich SH3-binding domain N-terminal to the catalytic region, a MAP kinase phosphorylation site and a bipartite nuclear targeting sequence located C-terminal to the catalytic region. The catalytic domain itself has the strongest homology to calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Northern blot analysis demonstrates a 3.5 kb MAPKAP kinase 2 transcript which is ubiquitously expressed and, hence, co-expressed with the mRNA of the recently identified substrate Hsp25 in all tissues analysed. However, the functional consequences of the nuclear targeting sequence present in MAPKAP kinase 2 suggest the existence of further substrates for the enzyme in the nucleus.
