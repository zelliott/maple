Using the technique of differential cDNA library screening, a cDNA clone was isolated from an estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast carcinoma cell line (MCF7) cDNA library based upon the overexpression of this gene compared to an ER-negative cell line (MDA-MB-231). Sequence analysis of this clone determined that it shared significant homology to G-protein-coupled receptors. This receptor, GPCR-Br, was abundantly expressed in the ER-positive breast carcinoma cell lines MCF7, T-47D, and MDA-MB-361. Expression was absent or minimal in the ER-negative breast carcinoma cell lines BT-20, MDA-MB-231, and HBL-100. GPCR-Br was ubiquitously expressed in human tissues examined but was most abundant in placenta. GPCR-Br expression was examined in 11 primary breast carcinomas. GPCR-Br was detected in all 4 ER-positive tumors and only 1 of 7 ER-negative tumors. Based upon PCR analysis in hybrid cell lines, the gene for GPCR-Br (HGMW-approved symbol GPR30) was mapped to chromosome 7p22. The pattern of expression of GPCR-Br indicates that this receptor may be involved in physiologic responses specific to hormonally responsive tissues.
