We have isolated a series of overlapping murine genomic DNA clones that include the complete coding sequence of the Golgi membrane bound marker enzyme beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase. The coding sequence is distributed into six exons spanning 50,000 b.p. of mouse chromosome 4. The COOH terminal domain is predominantly encoded by exons 2-6 and the transmembrane and amino terminal cytoplasmic domains are encoded by exon 1. S1 analysis establishes the most 5' transcriptional initiation site 190 b.p. upstream of the first methionine residue.
