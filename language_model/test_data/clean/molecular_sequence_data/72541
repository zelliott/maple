We have cloned and characterized a cDNA, Npap60, encoding a rat nuclear pore-associated protein. The 3-kb cDNA was obtained by antibody screening of a rat testis expression library. The predicted NPAP60 contains 381 amino acids with a composition of 25.6% charged residues and is highly hydrophilic. The Npap60 gene appears to be conserved in mouse, rat, and human. Immunofluorescence studies with anti-NPAP60 fusion protein antibody show that the NPAP60 protein colocalizes with nuclear pore complexes in RAT1A cells. The expression of Npap60 is about 10-20 times higher in rat testis than in somatic tissues. The subcellular localization of NPAP60 protein changes dramatically during male germ cell differentiation, from nuclear pore complex-like staining in spermatocytes to whole nucleus staining in spermatids and finally to a nuclear surface staining in mature spermatozoa. These changes are temporally and spatially related to nuclear reorganization during male germ cell differentiation.
