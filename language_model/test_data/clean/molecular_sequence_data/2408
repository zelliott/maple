Three of eleven clones isolated from a genomic expression library of Schistosoma japonicum DNA using chronically infected human sera also react with chronically infected mouse sera. Characterization of these three clones showed that they contain different members of the same gene family. One clone contains two members of the gene family approximately 2 kb apart and in opposite orientation to each other. DNA sequence homologies between pairs of genes range from 98% to 99.5%. Southern hybridization results indicate there are approximately 40 copies of these genes per haploid genome. Sera from mice immunized with purified fusion protein detected immunoreactive products in the central ganglion and ciliated epidermal cells of miracidia.
