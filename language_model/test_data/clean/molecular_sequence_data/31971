Precise somatic and reproductive cell proliferation and differentiation in anthers are crucial for male fertility. Loss of function of the Male sterile 8 (Ms8) gene causes male sterility with multiple phenotypic defects first visible in the epidermal and tapetal cells. Here, we document the cloning of Ms8, which is a putative Î²-1,3-galactosyltransferase. Ms8 transcript is abundant in immature anthers with a peak at the meiotic stage; RNA expression is highly correlated with protein accumulation. Co-immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry sequencing identified several MS8-associated proteins, including arabinogalactan proteins, prohibitins, and porin. We discuss the hypotheses that arabinogalactan protein might be an MS8 substrate and that MS8 might be involved in maintenance of mitochondrial integrity.
