EBV growth-transforms primate B lymphocytes and directly causes mono/multiclonal B cell lymphomas in vulnerable hosts. In this report we demonstrate that the degree of B cell transformability is not quantitatively determined at the level of either the saturable, transformation-prerequisite virus receptors or of the actual viral cell entry process. Instead, post-receptor binding events [Na+/H+ exchange, Ca2+ flux, tyrosine phosphorylation of two proteins (55-60/130-140 kd)] were identified as critical determinants of transformability. The presence of competent virus in transformable cells was per se insufficient for transformation: blockade of Ca2+ fluxes (or the antiport) generates virus-loaded cells that express viral genes but remain untransformed. Delayed induction by ionomycin of appropriately sized Ca2+ fluxes ([Ca2+]i greater than 180 less than 400 nM) re-starts transformation processes in EGTA-blocked, virus-loaded cells, perhaps providing a model for the study of virus re-activation. Overall, EBV induces unique cellular activation events different from non-oncogenic lymphocyte mitogens/activators, and, given the oncogenic potential of transformed cells in susceptible hosts, we hypothesize that these events describe a novel oncogenic transformation pathway.
