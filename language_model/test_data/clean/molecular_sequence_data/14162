Microsatellite markers were developed in Diplopanax stachyanthus to investigate the population genetics of this endangered tree.

Using the Fast Isolation by AFLP of Sequences Containing repeats (FIASCO) protocol, 15 microsatellite markers were developed in D. stachyanthus and evaluated for their variability in 25 samples from a natural population. For the 11 polymorphic loci, the number of alleles ranged from two to eight, while the observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.5200 to 0.7600 and 0.4200 to 0.7813, respectively. Their cross-taxa transferability was also examined in Acanthopanax gracilistylus, Tetrapanax papyrifer, Cornus controversa, and Dendrobenthamia japonica var. chinensis, and four to 15 loci proved amplifiable in these species.

These microsatellite markers could be employed to investigate the population genetics of D. stachyanthus, and may potentially be applicable to other related species.
