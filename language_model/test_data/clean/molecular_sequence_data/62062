We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the cDNA encoding DNA topoisomerase II from Physarum polycephalum. Using degenerate primers, based on the conserved amino acid sequences of other eukaryotic enzymes, a 250-bp fragment was polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified. This fragment was used as a probe to screen a Physarum cDNA library. A partial cDNA clone was isolated that was truncated at the 3' end. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR was employed to isolate the remaining portion of the gene. The complete sequence of 4613 bp contains an open reading frame of 4494 bp that codes for 1498 amino acid residues with a theoretical molecular weight of 167 kDa. The predicted amino acid sequence shares similarity with those of other eukaryotes and shows the highest degree of identity with the enzyme of Dictyostelium discoideum. However, the enzyme of P. polycephalum contains an atypical amino-terminal domain very rich in serine and proline, whose function is unknown. Remarkably, both a mitochondrial targeting sequence and a nuclear localization signal were predicted respectively in the amino and carboxy-terminus of the protein, as in the case of human topoisomerase III alpha. At the Physarum genomic level, the topoisomerase II gene encompasses a region of about 16 kbp suggesting a large proportion of intronic sequences, an unusual situation for a gene of a lower eukaryote, often free of introns. Finally, expression of topoisomerase II mRNA does not appear significantly dependent on the plasmodium cycle stage, possibly due to the lack of G1 phase or (and) to a mitochondrial localization of the enzyme.
