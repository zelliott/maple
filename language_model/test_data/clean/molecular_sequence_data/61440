Autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR) is a cell surface glycoprotein of molecular weight 78,000 (gp78), mediating cell motility signaling in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Here, we cloned the full-length cDNAs for both human and mouse AMFR genes. Both genes encode a protein of 643 amino acids containing a seven transmembrane domain, a RING-H2 motif and a leucine zipper motif and showed a 94.7% amino acid sequence identity to each other. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of AMFR with protein databases revealed no significant homology with all known seven transmembrane proteins, but a significant structural similarity to a hypothetical protein of Caenorhabditis elegans, F26E4.11. Thus, AMFR is a highly conserved gene which encodes a novel type of seven transmembrane protein.
