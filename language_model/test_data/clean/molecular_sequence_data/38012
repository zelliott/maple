Three new Acetobacter strains were isolated from vinegar. By plasmid profiling they were recognized as genotypically different from each other. Sequencing of the genes for 16S and 23S rRNA and DNA-DNA hybridization of total DNA against DNA of all type strains of Acetobacter identified Acetobacter strains JK2 and V3 as A. europaeus, and Acetobacter strain JK3 as A. intermedius. In contrast to the type strain of A. europaeus (DSM 6160), A. europaeus JK2 and V3 do not require acetic acid for growth and can be successfully transferred between media with and without acetic acid. This phenotypic characteristic enables convenient handling of both strains in genetic studies. Plasmid pJK2-1 from A. europaeus JK2 was used as the basis for shuttle plasmid construction with the aim of developing an efficient vector system for these strains. The entire nucleotide sequence of pJK2-1 was determined. High amino acid identities were found for three open reading frames: Rep (replication protein); Dinjl (DNA damage inducible enzyme); and Dinj2 proteins. A recombinant plasmid pUCJK2-1 (5.6 kb) consisting of the entire plasmid pJK2-1 and the entire plasmid pUC18 was successfully used in transformation experiments. Plasmid pJT2 (5.8 kb) was constructed from pUCJK2-1 with the aim of reactivating the lacZ' gene.
