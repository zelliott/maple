A novel Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, non-flagellated, strictly aerobic strain with gliding motility, designated XH134(T), was isolated from surface seawater of the South Pacific Gyre (45° 58' S 163° 11' W) during the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 329. The major respiratory quinone of strain XH134(T) was MK-6. The dominant fatty acids of strain XH134(T) were iso-C15 : 0, iso-C15 : 1 G, C16 : 1ω6c and/or C16 : 1ω7c, iso-C17 : 0 3-OH, iso-C15 : 0 3-OH and 10-methyl C16 : 0 and/or iso-C17 : 1ω9c. The polar lipids of strain XH134(T) comprised phosphatidylethanolamine, one unknown aminolipid and three unknown polar lipids. The DNA G+C content of strain XH134(T) was 32.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the novel strain was related most closely to Aquimarina macrocephali JAMB N27(T) with 96.9 % sequence similarity. A number of phenotypic characteristics distinguished strain XH134(T) from described members of the genus Aquimarina. On the basis of combined phenotypic and phylogenetic analyses, strain XH134(T) represents a novel species of the genus Aquimarina, for which the name Aquimarina megaterium sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is XH134(T) ( = CGMCC 1.12186(T) = JCM 18215(T)).
