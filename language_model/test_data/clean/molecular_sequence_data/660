Genetic relationships between 22 spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV) isolates from Austria collected between 1994 and 2007 were determined based on the partial nucleotide sequence of the glycoprotein gene (G gene). Phylogenetic analyses located all Austrian isolates except one in genogroup Id. One isolate collected in 2007 was placed within the SVCV Ia genogroup. More importantly, the study also revealed 3 distinct clusters within genogroup Id, designated Id1, Id2 and Id3. Existence of subgroups Id2 and Id3 within the genogroup Id was supported by high bootstrap values. The genetic clustering could neither be linked to host species nor to geographic localization of fish farms. Furthermore, no clear link could be established between the pathological lesions and phylogenetic relationship. However, time-dependent division of the isolates was observed. Viruses from the Id1 cluster were mainly sampled in Austria in the 1990s and up until 2003, whereas all viruses from the Id2 subgroup were isolated after 2003.
