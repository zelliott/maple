We have isolated a genomic clone encoding tomato TAS14, a dehydrin that accumulates in response to mannitol, NaCl or abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. A fragment of tas14 gene containing the region from -2591 to +162 fused to beta-glucuronidase gene drives ABA- and osmotic stress-induced GUS expression in transgenic tobacco. Histochemical analysis of salt-, mannitol- and ABA-treated plants showed GUS activity mainly localized to vascular tissues, outer cortex and adventitious root meristems, coinciding with the previously observed distribution of TAS14 protein in salt-stressed tomato plants. In addition, GUS activity was also observed in guard cells, trichomes and leaf axils. Developmentally regulated gus expression was studied in unstressed plants and found to occur not only in embryos, but also in flowers and pollen. Tas14 expression in floral organs was confirmed by northern blots of tomato flowers.
