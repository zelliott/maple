Seven microproteins analogous to Ecballium elaterium Trypsin Inhibitor II. were synthesized. The study of their inhibiting power showed a change in selectivity from trypsin to elastase for 5 of the compounds and to alpha-chymotrypsin for another one. A striking characteristic that appeared during this synthetic approach was the ability of the 28 amino acid peptides to refold and close correctly the 3 disulfide bridges, giving in each case an active compound.
