We synthesized the 20-34 and 22-34 fragments of the core and 1269-1282 fragment of the NS3 protein of the hepatitis C virus. The peptides were prepared by the solid-phase synthesis using activated esters and symmetrical anhydrides of Boc-amino acids. Peptide 20-34 demonstrated positive reaction in ELISA with all individual sera from HCV chronic patients. Peptide 1269-1282 reacted with 33% patients sera.
