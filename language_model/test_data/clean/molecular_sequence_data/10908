Sets of degenerate oligomers corresponding to highly conserved domains of MutS-homolog (MSH) mismatch-repair proteins primed polymerase chain reaction amplification of two Arabidopsis thaliana DNA fragments that are homologous to eukaryotic MSH-like genes. Phylogenetic analysis places one complete gene, designated atMSH2, in the evolutionarily distinct MSH2 subfamily.
