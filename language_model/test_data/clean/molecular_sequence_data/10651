The results of investigations on the morphology, physiology, pigment composition, light-harvesting antenna and reaction center organization, and electron carriers of five Erythromicrobium representatives, and on phylogenetic relations among them, are summarized. On the basis of clear phenotypic differences and distinct phylogenetic positions shown by 16S ribosomal DNA analysis, the tentative species "Erythromicrobium sibiricum" and "Erythromicrobium ursincola" are formally described as the type species of two new genera: Sandaracinobacter sibiricus gen. nov., sp. nov., and Erythromonas ursincola gen. nov., sp. nov., respectively. The genus Erythromicrobium is at present composed of the type species, E. ramosum, and two species, "E. hydrolyticum" and "E. ezovicum," whose nomenclature is yet to be validated. All species studied group within the alpha-4 subclass of Proteobacteria.
