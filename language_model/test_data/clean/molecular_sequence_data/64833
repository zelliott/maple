The recruitment of plasminogen endows the bacterial cell surface of Streptococcus pneumoniae with proteolytic activity. In this study we demonstrate specific plasmin- and plasminogen-binding activity for the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which is located in the cytoplasm as well as on the surface of pneumococci. GAPDH exhibits a high affinity for plasmin and a significantly lower affinity for plasminogen.
