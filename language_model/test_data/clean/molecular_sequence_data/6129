An in-frame gag gene mutant of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, which carries two amino acid substitutions in the center of the p24 coding region, was constructed in vitro, and its replication properties in several cell lines were examined. In CD4-negative SW480 cells transfected with the mutant clone, synthesis and processing of viral gag, pol, and env proteins occurred normally, and viral particles were produced. Virions derived from the transfection displayed a severe replication defect when inoculated into some CD4-positive cell lines (H9 and Molt4 clone 8), but in other lines (A3.01 and M8166), the mutant virus grew fairly well. The mutant was demonstrated to be defective at an early infection phase (from adsorption to integration) in Molt4 clone 8 cells but was normal in A3.01 cells. These results indicated that the Gag-p24 protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 plays an important role at the early infection phase in a cell-dependent manner.
