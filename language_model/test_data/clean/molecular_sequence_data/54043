The yeast Mre11 protein participates in important cellular functions such as DNA repair and telomere maintenance. Analysis of structure-function relationships of Mre11 has led to identification of several separation-of-function mutations as well as N- and C-terminal domains essential for Mre11 meiotic and mitotic activities. Previous studies have established that there is a strong correlation between Mre11 DNA repair and telomere maintenance functions and that Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex formation appears to be essential for both of these activities. Here we report that the mre11(ts) allele, previously shown to cause temperature-dependent defects in DNA repair and meiosis, confers a temperature-independent telomere shortening, indicating that mre11(ts) is a separation-of-function mutation with respect to DNA repair and telomere maintenance. In a yeast two-hybrid system, Mre11(ts) fails to form a homodimer or interact with Rad50 and Xrs2 irrespective of experimental temperatures. These observations collectively suggest that the Pro(162)Ser substitution in Mre11(ts) confers a novel separation of Mre11 mitotic functions. Moreover, we observed that while overexpression of the 5'-3' exonuclease gene EXO1 partially complements the MMS sensitivity of mre11, rad50, and xrs2 null mutants, it has no effect on telomere shortening in these strains. This result provides additional evidence on possible involvement of distinctive mechanisms in DNA repair and telomere maintenance by the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex.
