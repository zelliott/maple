Orcokinin (NFDEIDRSGFGFN) and orcokinin homologues are crustacean peptides eliciting potent myotropic effects in gut tissues. Through HPLC purification of brain extract of the cockroach Blattella germanica, we isolated the first insect orcokinin (NFDEIDRSGFNS). This insect orcokinin-like peptide do not show myotropic properties in B. germanica gut tissues. Gene database search using orcokinin precursor sequences of the crustacean Procambarus clarkii led to putative homologues found in non-crustacean groups, including the mosquito Anopheles gambiae and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.
