Expression of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor gene during long-term administration of competitive and non-competitive NMDA antagonists was studied in rat brain using antisense cRNA transcribed from reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-generated rat NMDA receptor cDNA. Unlike non-competitive antagonists, 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) markedly decreased NMDA receptor mRNA steady-state concentrations in frontal cortex and hippocampus. Our results are consistent with a regulation of the NMDA receptor at the level of gene expression.
