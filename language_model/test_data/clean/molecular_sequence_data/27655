We used recombinant DNA techniques to map a panel of six monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to regions of the human factor IX molecule. A-2 maps to 17 amino acids at the amino terminus of the heavy chain of IXa; 2D5, an inhibitor of clotting, is defined to 36 amino acids of the first EGF-like domain of human factor IX. A-4, A-5, C10D, and FXC008 all map to a region of the heavy chain containing amino acids 180 through 310, suggesting an immunodominant site. FXC008 has been reported to interfere with binding of factor IXa to factor VIII:Ca.
