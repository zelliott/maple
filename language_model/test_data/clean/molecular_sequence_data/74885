Dwarf willows (e.g. Salix herbacea) are among the earliest ectomycorrhizal (EM) plants colonising primary successional sites such as glacier forefronts in the Tyrolean Alps. EM of S. herbacea were sampled at the Rotmoos glacier forefront (Otz Valley, Austria) three times a year during the growing season and once a year during winter when plants were covered with snow in 2005 and 2006. EM were investigated using morphological methods and by sequencing the rDNA ITS region. The degree of EM mycorrhization was high throughout both years (93%). We distinguished 21 EM morphotypes and identified 19 fungal species. Cenococcum geophilum, Sebacina spp., Tomentella spp. and Cortinarius spp. dominated the mycobiont community of S. herbacea. The observed species richness in this about 150-year-old soil was at least 59% of the estimated species richness. Fungal communities differed significantly between consecutive years, and spatial heterogeneity was high. These differences made it difficult to detect seasonal impacts. Abundances of C. geophilum EM increased throughout the 2-year sampling period. Sebacina incrustans EM were very abundant in 2005, but nearly disappeared in 2006, whilst its fruitbodies were still frequent in the sampling area. This suggests that the mycorrhizae were displaced from the roots by an outcompeting species, whereas the mycelium was still present in the soil.
