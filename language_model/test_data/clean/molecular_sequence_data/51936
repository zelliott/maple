Inactivation of one or more tumor-suppressor genes on the short arm of chromosome 11 is thought to play a role in the etiology of Wilms' tumor. A candidate gene, QM, was recently isolated by subtractive hybridization between a tumorigenic cell line (deleted for part of 11p) and a non-tumorigenic cell line (the tumorigenic cell line carrying an extra t(X;11)copy). We show here with an exon-specific polymerase chain reaction that the genomic homolog of the QM cDNA is located in the G6PD-color vision genes region in Xq28. No homologous sequences could be detected on 11p. Our experiments indicate that the QM gene is not involved in the suppression of Wilms' tumor.
