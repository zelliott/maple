We have determined the chromosomal localization of the murine gene encoding the 68-kDa sperm adhesion molecule 1, Spam1 or Ph-20. Using two independent approaches, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and interspecific backcross analysis we show the Spam1 maps to proximal mouse Chromosome (Chr) 6. This map position is within the conserved linkage group corresponding to human Chr 7q, where the human homolog, SPAM 1, has been shown to map previously. Genetic mapping shows the gene to be very closely linked to Met, one of the most proximal loci on MMU 6. It thus places the gene near the centromere and the junction of the Rb(6.16)24Lub and Rb(6.15)1Ald translocations. The essential role of the Spam1 sperm antigen in mouse sperm-egg interactions and its gene location provide strong support for its candidacy as the gene involved in the dysfunction of mouse sperm bearing the Rb(6.16)24Lub or Rb(6.15)1Ald translocation.
