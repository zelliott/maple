The c-fos proto-oncogene has been implicated as a central regulatory component of the nuclear response to mitogens and other extracellular stimuli. Embryonic stem cells targeted at the c-fos locus have been used to generate chimeric mice that have transmitted the mutated allele through the germline. Homozygous mutants show reduced placental and fetal weights and significant loss of viability at birth. Approximately 40% of the homozygous mutants survive and grow at normal rates until severe osteopetrosis, characterized by foreshortening of the long bones, ossification of the marrow space, and absence of tooth eruption, begins to develop at approximately 11 days. Among other abnormalities, these mice show delayed or absent gametogenesis, lymphopenia, and altered behavior. Despite these defects, many live as long as their wild-type or heterozygous littermates (currently 7 months). These data indicate that c-fos is not required for the growth of most cell types but is involved in the development and function of several distinct tissues.
