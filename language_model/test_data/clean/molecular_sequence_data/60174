An 18.5-kb DNA fragment containing the oriC region of the chromosome of the alkaliphilic Bacillus halodurans C-125 was obtained by PCR and sequenced. Sixteen open reading frames (ORFs) were identified in this region. A sequencing similarity search using the BSORF database found that ORF1 to 13 all had significant similarities to gene products of Bacillus subtilis. Three other ORFs (ORF14-16) of unknown function were positioned down-stream of gyrB instead of rrnO, which is found in the same region in the case of B. subtilis. The ORF organization from gidA to gyrA was the same as that of B. subtilis. The gene organization and the location of the DnaA-box region were also similar to those of the chromosomes of other bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. There were two DnaA-box clusters (Box-region C and R) with a consensus sequence TTATCCACA on both sides of the dnaA gene but another DnaA box cluster (Box-region L) which is found in the region between thdF and jag in B. subtilis was not found in the corresponding region in the case of alkaliphilic Bacillus halodurans C-125.
