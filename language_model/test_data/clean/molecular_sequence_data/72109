Transport of proteins along the exocytotic pathway is primarily achieved by vesicular intermediates. Two proteins, Golgi SNAREs of 27 kDa, GS27, and of 28 kDa, GS28 (HGMW-approved nomenclature GOSR2 and GOSR1, respectively), are important trafficking membrane proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi and between Golgi subcompartments. Here, we present the human GS27 and GS28 cDNA sequences. They encode predicted proteins of 212 and 250 amino acids, respectively. Chromosomal mapping analyses reveal that human GS27 is located on chromosome 17q21 and GS28 on approximately 17q11. The chromosomal location of GS27 near a locus implicated in familial essential hypertension and its known function in trafficking indicate that it is a potential candidate gene for this disease.
