Doxorubicin is one of the most employed anticancer drugs, but its efficacy is limited by the onset of adverse effects such as drug resistance, due to the drug efflux via P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Several factors are associated to a high Pgp activity, including the amount of cholesterol in plasma membrane, which is essential to maintain the pump function. In this work we started from the following observations: 1) the drug-resistant colon cancer HT29-dx cells had a higher content of cholesterol in plasma membrane than drug-sensitive HT29 cells and a higher activity of Pgp, which was decreased by the cholesterol-lowering agent Î²-methyl-cyclodextrin; 2) HT29-dx cells showed a higher synthesis of endogenous cholesterol and a higher expression of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR); 3) the anti-cholesterolemic drug simvastatin reduced the cholesterol synthesis, increased the synthesis of LDLR and lowered the Pgp activity in resistant cells. In order to circumvent drug resistance we designed a new liposomal doxorubicin, conjugated with a recombinant LDLR-binding peptide from human apoB100: this LDL-masked doxorubicin ("apo-Lipodox") was efficiently internalized by a LDLR-driven endocytosis and induced cytotoxic effects in HT29-dx cells, reversing their drug resistance. Its efficacy was further increased by simvastatin, which up-regulates the LDLR levels and contemporarily reduces the Pgp activity, thus increasing the liposomes uptake and limiting the drug efflux. We propose that the association of liposomal doxorubicin and statins may be a future promising strategy to reverse drug-resistance in human cancer cells.
