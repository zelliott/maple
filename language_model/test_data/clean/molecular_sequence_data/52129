Laxaphycins A and B are the major components in an antifungal mixture of cyclic peptides from the terrestrial blue-green alga Anabaena laxa FK-1-2. NMR and MS spectral studies coupled with amino acid analysis indicate that the gross structures of laxaphycins A and B are cyclic (Aoc-Hse-E-Dhb-Hyp-Hse-Phe-Leu-Ile-Ile-Leu-Gly) where Aoc is a 3-aminooctanoic acid residue and cyclic (Ala-Hleu-Gln-N-MeIle-Hasn-Thr-Pro-Leu-Thr-Ade-Val- Hleu) where Ade is a 3-aminodecanoyl unit, respectively. Laxaphycin E, a minor cyclic undecapeptide, differs in gross structure from laxaphycin A in possessing a 3-aminodecanoic acid unit (Ade) in lieu of Aoc, whereas laxaphycin D, a minor cyclic dodecapeptide, differs from laxaphycin B in possessing a 3-aminooctanoyl unit (Aoc) instead of an Ade unit.
