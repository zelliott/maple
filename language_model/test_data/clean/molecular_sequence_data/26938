Recently, riboswitches and other structures discovered on mRNAs have been reported as examples of functional RNA structures, motifs. Such motifs were shown to be present as single-form valid structures but they are obscured among other less-valid structures. Here, I present a novel, practical virtual spectrometry (the GenoPoemics Spectrometry) visualizing motifs on mRNA strands as spectra at-a-glance. Every motif along with validity of their existences could be observed on the spectra in human-friendly manners, and whole structures of mRNAs could be overviewed. Therefore, the spectra helped distinguish valid and less valid motifs. The spectrometry was applied to variety of mRNAs such as ADM, rPolbeta and CD83 to identify structures of high validity on them, previously reported functional motifs were successfully revealed. These findings indicate that the structures of mRNAs that may be folded into multiple forms can be further discussed quantitatively based on the visual spectra to discover functional RNA motifs.
