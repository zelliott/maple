Phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) in mammalian cells is synthesized through an exchange of free L-serine for the base moiety of pre-existing phospholipids. Studies on PtdSer biosynthesis in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have suggested that the serine base-exchange is catalyzed by at least two different enzymes; one, named PtdSer synthase I (PSS I), uses phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and possibly phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) as phosphatidyl donors for the serine base-exchange, and the other, named PtdSer synthase II (PSS II), uses PtdEtn but not PtdCho as a phosphatidyl donor. Recently, cDNAs of the PSS I and II have been isolated from CHO-K1 cells. This review will briefly describe the current understanding of PtdSer synthases of mammalian cells, mainly CHO cells.
