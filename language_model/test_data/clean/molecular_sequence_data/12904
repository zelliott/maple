The clone FHG22, isolated from a female minus male subtracted cDNA library obtained from the sexually dimorphic Syrian hamster Harderian glands (HG) is 440 bp long with a 95 amino acids ORF, and hybridizes to a female HG-specific 0.6 kb mRNA. The FHG22 nucleotide and amino acid sequences are similar to the subunits from prostatein, uteroglobin, major cat allergen Fel dI (chain 1) and mouse salivary androgen binding proteins (subunit alpha). Therefore I propose that all those polypeptides belong to a common new family. The hamster genome has a single copy of the FHG22 gene, without homologous genes. FHG22 mRNA is also found in male and female parotid (higher levels in females) and submandibular glands, indicating a tissue and sex-dependent control of expression.
