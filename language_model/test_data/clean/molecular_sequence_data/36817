The hexadeoxynucleotide analog, L-d(CGCGCG) composed of L-deoxyribose was synthesized and clearly shown to have the same conformation and dynamic properties with natural D-d(CGCGCG) except for chirality with CD spectra. This unnatural hexanucleotide was not cleaved by bleomycin, an antitumor DNA cleaving drug, but was able to bind to the DNA binding domain of bleomycin to a similar extent with the natural one. These results strongly suggest the importance of the other moiety than the DNA binding domain for the specific DNA recognition of bleomycin. Thus, L-oligonucleotides are useful for the study of DNA-drug interactions.
