The detailed distribution and characterization of 51 hydroxylamine (HA)-induced and 59 nitrous acid (NA)-induced mutations in the intron-containing bacteriophage T4 thymidylate synthase (td) gene is reported here. Mutations were mapped in 10 regions of the td gene by recombinational marker rescue using plasmid or M13 subclones of the td gene. Phage crosses using deletion mutants with known breakpoints in the 3' end of the td intron subdivided HA and NA mutations which mapped in this region. At least 31 of the mutations map within the 1-kb group I self-splicing intron. Intron mutations mapped only in the 5' and 3' ends of the intron sequence, in accordance with the hypothesis that the 5' and 3' domains of the T4 td intron are essential for correct RNA splicing. RNA sequence analysis of a number of mapped td mutations has identified two intron nucleotides and one exon nucleotide where both HA- and NA-induced mutations commonly occur. These three loci are characterized by a GC dinucleotide, with the mutations occurring at the cytosine residue. Thus, these data indicate at least three potential sites of both HA- and NA-induced mutagenic hotspot activity within the td gene.
