We report here the complete genomic nucleotide sequence for the Atlantic salmon growth-hormone gene (asGH), including 600 bp of 5' flanking sequences. The primary transcription (3651 nt) is significantly longer than that of the mammalian genes, mainly because of larger intron sizes, but also because the asGH gene contains an additional intron (intron 5). The coding regions of the asGH gene have been compared to the corresponding regions from rainbow trout (cDNA and genomic), coho salmon (cDNA) and chum salmon (cDNA). With the exception of the rainbow trout cDNA sequence, all results were in agreement with current classification of the four species. The results of a similar comparison with the mRNA leader and trailer regions were also consistent with current classification. Sequences upstream from the transcription start point have been compared to the corresponding regions from rainbow trout and mammalian GH gene (maGH) upstream sequences. The results showed that the upstream sequences in the two fish species were very similar, while short stretches similar to conserved upstream sequences in the maGH genes were also found. Some of these conserved sequences are known to be involved in the specificity of expression of the mammalian genes.
