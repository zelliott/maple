We have established a panel of human monoclonal antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The antibodies 2F5 and 2G12 have been identified to be two of the most potently in vitro neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1. Here we report on a further antibody, 4E10, of similar in vitro neutralizing potency. 4E10 binds to a novel epitope C terminal of the ELDKWA sequence recognized by 2F5, which has been so far the only described broadly neutralizing anti-gp41 antibody. Both 4E10 and 2F5 bind only weakly to infected cells compared with gp120-specific 2G12 and polyclonal anti-HIV-1 immunoglobulin (HIVIG), but show potent in vitro neutralizing properties. 4E10 neutralizes potently not only tissue culture-adapted strains but also primary isolates of different clades, including A, B, C, D, and E. Viruses that were found to be resistant to 2F5 were neutralized by 4E10 and vice versa; none of the tested isolates was resistant to both anti-gp41 antibodies. This confirms that the region recognized by 2F5 and 4E10 is essential for viral infectivity and may be important for vaccine design. Moreover, our results suggest that 4E10 should be further investigated for passive anti-HIV immunotherapy.
