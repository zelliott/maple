Acyl carrier protein is an integral component of many cellular metabolic processes. A number of studies have reported self-acylation behavior in acyl carrier proteins. Although ACPs exhibit high levels of similarity in their primary and tertiary structures, self-acylation behavior is restricted to only some ACPs that can be classified into two major families based on their function. The first family of ACPs is involved in polyketide biosynthesis, whereas the second family participates in fatty acid synthesis. Facilitated by the growing number of genome sequences available for analyses, large-scale phylogenetic studies were used in these studies to uncover as to how self-acylation behavior of acyl carrier proteins is linked with the evolution of metabolic pathways in organisms. These studies show that self-acylation behavior in acyl carrier proteins was lost during the course of evolution, with certain organisms and organelles viz. plastids, retaining it for specified functions.
