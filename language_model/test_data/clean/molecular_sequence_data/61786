The alpha and beta thalassaemias are the commonest genetic disorders worldwide. The homozygous state is associated with high morbidity and mortality, thus screening of at-risk pregnancies and prenatal testing are strongly advocated. A thalassaemia (thal) array has been designed using allele-specific arrayed primer extension (AS-APEX) for the simultaneous analysis of 15 non-deletion alpha-gene defects and 23 beta-gene mutations commonly found in southeast Asian countries, where thalassaemias are highly prevalent. This overcomes the problem of using multiple reverse dot blot analysis. The array showed 100% sensitivity and specificity in the detection of 120 beta-thal mutants and 35 non-deletion alpha-thal mutants. It is robust enough to be produced in a single place and shipped to other laboratories for use. The production cost of the array is low, each slide can be used for three different test samples and is therefore amenable to large scale antenatal screening in southeast Asian countries.
