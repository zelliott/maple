The water solubility of pectin was successfully decreased by cross-linking with increasing amounts of epichlorohydrin in the reaction media. The initial molar ratios of epichlorohydrin/ galacturonic acid monomer in the reaction mixtures were 0, 0.37, 0.56, 0.74, 1.00, 1.47, and 2.44. The resulting epichlorohydrin cross-linked pectins were thus referred to as C-LP0, C-LP37, C-LP56, C-LP75, C-LP100, C-LP150, and C-LP250, respectively. Methoxylation degrees ranged from 60.5 +/- 0.9% to 68.0 +/- 0.6%, and the effective cross-linking degrees, determined by quantification of the hydroxyl anions consumed during the reaction, were 0, 17.8, 26.0, 38.3, 46.5, 53.5, and 58.7%. respectively. After incubating the different cross-linked pectins (0.5% w/v) in 25 mL of 0.05 M acetate-phosphate buffer (pH 4.5), containing 50 microL of Pectinex Ultra SP-L (pectinolytic enzymes), between 60 and 80% of the pectin osidic bounds were broken in less than 1 hr. Moreover, increasing the cross-linking degree only resulted in a weak slowing on the enzymatic degradation velocity.
