Here we report the draft genome sequence of a Streptomyces strain, AA1529, isolated from marine sediment from the Yellow Sea. Its genome contains a subset of unique genes and gene clusters that encode diverse secondary metabolites, suggesting great potential as a source for the discovery of novel gene clusters and bioactive compounds.
