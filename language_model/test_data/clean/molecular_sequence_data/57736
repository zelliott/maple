Polyacrylamide supports, in a range of pore sizes, were investigated as nucleic acid affinity matrices for the detection of target DNA or RNA sequences using a sandwich hybridization format. Bromoacetyl and thiol oligonucleotide derivatives were covalently linked to sulfhydryl- and bromoacetyl-polyacrylamide supports with greater than 95% end-attachment efficiencies. These polyacrylamide-oligonucleotide supports were further derivatized with anionic residues to provide multi-functional supports which show low non-specific binding for non-complementary nucleic acids. While all the polyacrylamide-oligonucleotide supports capture complementary oligonucleotides with high affinity, the pore size was found to be a critical parameter in sandwich hybridization reactions. The superior hybridization characteristics of the Trisacryl support was ascribed to a combination of its macroporous nature, hydrophilicity and the terminal attachment of its capture oligonucleotides.
