Kobuviruses have been detected in humans and several animal species, including cattle, swine, sheep, canines, mice, and probably bats. While investigating the possibility of Kobuviruses infecting additional animal host species, we detected kobuvirus in three fecal samples from domestic Korean black goats. In a maximum parsimony tree and a Bayesian tree, the 08KG680 strain fell within the bovine kobuvirus lineage, but the 09KG172 and 10KG056 strains did not fall within any of the known animal kobuvirus lineages. Comparative analysis of the partial nucleotide sequences of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of the 08KG680 strain also revealed high amino acid sequence identity and a close genetic relationship with bovine kobuvirus, but the amino acid sequences of the other two strains had low similarity to those of known kobuvirus isolates from any animal species. The similarity of the sequence of the 08KG680 strains with the bovine kobuvirus indicate that the infectious may have originated from cattle, but the possible source for remaining strains could not be classified.
