A method is reported for conjugating an analog of 4'-(aminomethyl)-4,5',8- trimethylpsoralen to methylphophonate oligonucleotides. This method enables the psoralen moiety to be coupled to the phosphonate backbone between any two desired bases in a sequence. When hybridized to a target mRNA, the psoralen moiety can be directed toward a uridine base and, in turn, can undergo a photo-addition reaction with the target under UV irradiation at 365 nm. Several different non-nucleotide-based amino-linker reagents have been prepared for incorporation into methylphosphonate oligonucleotides by standard phosphonamidite chemistry. In addition, an N-hydroxysuccinimide activated ester analog of 4'-[(3-carboxypropionamido)methyl]-4,5',8- trimethylpsoralen has been synthesized for conjugation to the amino-linker moieties. Using this approach, we have prepared a number of psoralen-methylphosphonate-oligonucleotide conjugates which are complementary to the chimeric bcr/abl mRNA associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Solution hybridization studies with a 440-base subfragment of the bcr/abl RNA have shown that the psoralen moiety does not adversely affect duplex stability. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses have demonstrated that the psoralen-oligonucleotide conjugates undergo photo-addition to the RNA in a sequence-specific manner. Optimal photo-addition occurs when the psoralen moiety is inserted adjacent to one or more adenine residues in the oligonucleotide sequence, particularly between adenine and thymine (5'-3'). This internal labeling approach greatly increases the number of potential target sites available for photo-cross-linking experiments.
