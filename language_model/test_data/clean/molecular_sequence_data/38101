During a yeast two hybrid screen of a Dictyostelium cDNA library using the Ca(2+)-binding protein CBP1 as bait, we isolated a full-length cDNA encoding a novel Ca(2+)-binding protein (termed CBP4a). The protein is composed of 162 amino acids and contains four consensus EF-hands. PCR amplification of Dictyostelium genomic DNA using primers specific for the cDNA sequence resulted in the isolation of a gene encoding a different Ca(2+)-binding protein of 162 amino acids (designated CBP4b) with 90% amino acid sequence identity to CBP4a. Southern blot analysis confirmed the presence of two closely related genes in the Dictyostelium genome. CBP4a and CBP4b mRNAs are expressed at the same stages of development as CBP1 mRNA. In addition, both novel proteins bind (45)Ca(2+) and interact with CBP1 in vitro in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner.
