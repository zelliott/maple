Analysis of the oligosaccharides released from pig gastric mucus glycopolypeptides by hydrazinolysis showed that degradation had occurred. Nitrosation of the products followed by reduction gave a mixture that had a low content of 2,5-anhydro-D-talitol, which implied destruction of much of the terminal reducing 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-galactose. Under the conditions of hydrazinolysis, cellobiose was largely unchanged but laminaribiose gave a complex mixture that probably contained glucose hydrazone (13C-n.m.r. data). In order to avoid degradation, the hydrazinolysis-nitrosation sequence should be applied to the reduced oligosaccharides released on cleavage with alkali.
