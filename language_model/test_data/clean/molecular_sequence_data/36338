The murine paired-box-containing gene 5, Pax-5, is highly homologous to two other Pax genes, Pax-2 and Pax-8. The expression pattern of Pax-5 during mouse embryogenesis was examined by in situ RNA hybridization and compared to those of Pax-2 and Pax-8. Beginning at day 9.5 postcoitum (p.c.), Pax-5 was expressed in the developing brain, predominantly at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, and in the neural tube. While the neural tube expression pattern overlapped completely with Pax-2 and Pax-8, the expression pattern in the brain was only partially overlapping. Unlike Pax-2 and Pax-8, Pax-5 was not expressed in the developing excretory system, thyroid, eye or ear. Our data suggest that Pax-5 has a role in the development of the central nervous system.
