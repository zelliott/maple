A gene encoding a RecA/RAD51 homologue from a hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrococcus sp. KOD1 (Pk), was cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. The deduced 210-amino acid sequence was compared to homologues from bacteria (RecA), eukaryotes (RAD51, DMC1) and archaea (RadA). The entire protein from Pk (Pk-REC) basically corresponds to the essential central domain of its counterparts and lacks the two smaller RecA subdomains at the N- and C-termini. The sequence comparison suggests that Pk-REC represents a common prototype of RecA, RAD51, DMC1 and RadA, with higher enzymatic activity. Recombinant Pk-REC was fully active and complemented the ultraviolet light sensitivity of an E. coli recA mutant strain.
