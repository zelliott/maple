Few data regarding molecular diagnosis of primary distal renal tubular acidosis (DRTA) in Tunisian population are available.

25-day-old male patient from consanguineous parents of Tunisian origin diagnosed with DRTA and without hearing impairment observed later in life. ATP6V0A4 gene sequencing demonstrated a novel homozygous G deletion in exon 13 (c.1221delG, p.Met408CysfsX10), leading to a premature stop codon.

A novel ATP6V0A4 gene mutation confirmed autosomal recessive DRTA with normal hearing in the patient. Molecular analysis may help to rapidly diagnose autosomal recessive DRTA in Tunisian population.
