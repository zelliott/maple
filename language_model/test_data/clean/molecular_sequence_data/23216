To investigate the structural and functional features of the second alpha-helical transmembrane segment (TM2) of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier (AAC), we adopted cysteine scanning mutagenesis analysis. Single-cysteine mutations of yeast AAC were systematically introduced at residues 98-106 in TM2, and the mutants were treated with the fluorescent SH reagent eosin-5-maleimide (EMA). EMA modified different amino acid residues of alpha-helical TM2 between the two distinct carrier conformations, called the m-state and the c-state, in which the substrate recognition site faces the matrix and cytosol, respectively. When amino acids in the helix were projected on a wheel plot, these EMA-modified amino acids were observed at distinct sides of the wheel. Since the SH reagent specifically modified cysteine in the water-accessible environment, these results indicate that distinct helical surfaces of TM2 faced the water-accessible space between the two conformations, possibly as a result of twisting of this helix. In the recently reported crystal structure of bovine AAC, several amino acids faced cocrystallized carboxyatractyloside (CATR), a specific inhibitor of the carrier. These residues correspond to those modified with EMA in the yeast carrier in the c-state. Since the binding site of CATR is known to overlap that of the transport substrate, the water-accessible space was thought to be a substrate transport pathway, and hence, the observed twisting of TM2 between the m-state and the c-state may be involved in the process of substrate translocation. On the basis of the results, the roles of TM2 in the transport function of AAC were discussed.
