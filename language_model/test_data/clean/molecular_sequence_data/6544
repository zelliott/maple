In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the spindle pole body (SPB) serves as the microtubule-organizing center and is the functional analog of the centrosome of higher organisms. By expressing a fusion of a yeast SPB-associated protein to the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein, the movement of the SPBs in living yeast cells undergoing mitosis was observed by fluorescence microscopy. The ability to visualize SPBs in vivo has revealed previously unidentified mitotic events. During anaphase, the mitotic spindle has four sequential activities: alignment at the mother-daughter junction, fast elongation, translocation into the bud, and slow elongation. These results indicate that distinct forces act upon the spindle at different times during anaphase.
