To elucidate the spatial and temporal expression of a porcine lactoferrin (LTF) gene.

4 female and 4 male Large White pigs.

We examined LTF expression in various organs excised from the pigs, using northern blot hybridization with a porcine LTF cDNA probe. Antibodies against porcine LTF were raised in rabbits and were used along with immunohistochemical staining to localize the LTF protein.

High amounts of porcine LTF mRNA were detected in the secreting mammary gland and epididymis. This distribution is consistent with that of porcine LTF examined by immunohistochemistry. In female pigs, porcine LTF mRNA concentration increased remarkably in the ductal cells of the lactating mammary gland then significantly decreased at day 21 after parturition. Furthermore, specific staining for LTF was observed in the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract of female pigs, but not in the uterus, ovaries, spleen, kidneys, pancreas, muscles, heart, brain, lungs, or liver of postpartum female pigs, or in the testes of male pigs.

Gene expression of porcine LTF is closely related to lactation in the mammary gland. Distribution of LTF in the epididymis suggests that LTF may have a regulatory role in development of the reproductive tract of male pigs.
