Immulectin, a C-type lectin from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, was cloned from a larval fat body cDNA library. The immulectin cDNA encodes a 309 residue polypeptide. Immulectin synthesis was induced by injection of killed gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria or yeast. After injection of bacteria, immulectin mRNA appeared in fat body and immulectin protein was detected in hemolymph. Immulectin contains two carbohydrate recognition domains. The carboxyl-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain is most similar (36% identity) to a lipopolysaccharide-binding protein from the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana. It also shares 26-35% identity to carbohydrate recognition domains of various mammalian C-type lectins. Two immulectin isoforms were identified in the hemolymph of bacteria-injected larvae. Recombinant immulectin agglutinated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeast. Addition of recombinant immulectin to M. sexta plasma stimulated activation of phenol oxidase. A combination of immulectin with lipopolysaccharide from E. coli activated phenol oxidase more rapidly and to a higher level than immulectin alone, whereas lipopolysaccharide by itself had little effect on phenol oxidase activation. Immulectin synthesized in response to bacterial or fungal infection may help to trigger protective responses in M. sexta in a manner similar to mannose-binding protein, a C-type lectin that functions in the mammalian innate immune system.
