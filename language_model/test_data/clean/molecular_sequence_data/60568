In mammalian cells the Cdc25 family of dual-specificity phosphatases has three distinct isoforms, termed A, B, and C, which are thought to play discrete roles in cell-cycle control. In this paper we report the cloning of Xenopus Cdc25A and demonstrate its developmental regulation and key role in embryonic cell-cycle control. Northern and Western blot analyses show that Cdc25A is absent in oocytes, and synthesis begins within 30 min after fertilization. The protein product is localized in the nucleus in interphase and accumulates continuously until the midblastula transition (MBT), after which it is degraded. Upon injection into newly fertilized eggs, wild-type Cdc25A shortened the cell cycle and accelerated the timing of cleavage, whereas embryos injected with phosphatase-dead Cdc25A displayed a dose-dependent increase in the length of the cell cycle and a slower rate of cleavage. In contrast, injection of the phosphatase-dead Cdc25C isoform had no effect. Western blotting with an antibody specific for phosphorylated tyr15 in Cdc2/Cdk2 revealed a cycle of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in each cell cycle in control embryos, and in embryos injected with phosphatase-dead Cdc25A there was a twofold increase in the level of p-tyr in Cdc2/Cdk2. Consistent with this, the levels of cyclin B/Cdc2 and cyclin E/Cdk2 histone H1 kinase activity were both reduced by approximately 50% after phosphatase-dead Cdc25A injection. The phosphatase-dead Cdc25A could be recovered in a complex with both Cdks, suggesting that it acts in a dominant-negative fashion. These results indicate that periodic phosphorylation of Cdc2/Cdk2 on tyr15 occurs in each pre-MBT cell cycle, and dephosphorylation of Cdc2/Cdk2 by Cdc25A controls at least in part the length of the cell cycle and the timing of cleavage in pre-MBT embryos. The disappearance of Cdc25A after the MBT may underlie in part the lengthening of the cell cycle at that time.
