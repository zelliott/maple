A means of inducing gene expression by simultaneous infection with three recombinant adenoviruses (Ad) is described. The simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) envelope-coding region was placed under the control of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat and Rev proteins provided in trans by distinct Ad vectors (Ad-tat; Ad-rev). Coinfection of cells with the three recombinant adenoviruses led to induction of high levels of SIV env mRNA and protein synthesis, while inoculation of mice elicited anti-Env antibodies. Insertion of the poliovirus VP1 neutralization epitope (C3) in the V1 hypervariable region of SIV envelope not only proved to be highly immunogenic for the poliovirus epitope but also enhanced the kinetics of anti-SIV Env antibody production. By contrast, insertion in V4 elicited no anti-C3 response and only normal anti-Env responses.
