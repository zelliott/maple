Adjuvant arthritis (AA) and type II collagen (CII)-induced arthritis (CIA) in the rat serve as models of chronic human arthritis. Adoptive transfer of AA was observed in 21 of 25 Lewis rats given concanavalin A (Con A)-treated spleen cells prepared from animals immunized with Mycobacterium butyricum in mineral oil (complete Freund's adjuvant, CFA). No arthritic changes were noted in rats given spleen cells obtained from donors that had received incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA, 0/22), type I collagen in IFA (CI-IFA, 0/6) or CII-IFA (0/28). Administration of spleen cells from IFA, CI-IFA or CII-IFA-injected animals did not modify the development of CIA when these rats were subsequently challenged with CII-IFA. However, partial protection against induction of AA was provided by the transfer of spleen cells prepared from rats immunized with CII-IFA (6/11) but not by those obtained from rats injected with IFA (1/15) or CI-IFA (0/3). Rats that did not develop clinically evident arthritis following the administration of spleen cells prepared from CFA-injected rats were also resistant to AA induction by CFA. Pre-treatment of rats with a synthetic peptide, corresponding to amino acids 180-188 of the Mycobacterium 65 kD heat shock protein (65 kD HSP), significantly delayed the onset of AA, but not that of CIA. Disease-specific resistance to AA, provided by spleen cells prepared from rats injected with CII-IFA and by pre-treatment with the 65 kD HSP 180-188 peptide, may result from the induction of protective tolerance to arthritogenic epitopes present in the Mycobacterium and CII preparations.
