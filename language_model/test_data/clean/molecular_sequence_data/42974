DNA sequences of an intergenic spacer (IGS) and parts of genes in the nif cluster were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using two primers derived from nifD- and nifK-conserved sequences. The PCR products were cleaved by ten 4-base cutting restriction enzymes and the restriction patterns were used as fingerprints to type Frankia strains. The feasability of this PCR-RFLP method for typing Frankia strains was investigated on Frankia reference strains belonging mainly to the Elaeagnaceae infectivity group but also on new Frankia isolates and on other N2-fixing microorganisms. By modulating the stringency of the amplifications, we showed the method allowed to target either Frankia strains or the whole N2-fixing microbial community. DNA digestion patterns were used to estimate the sequence divergence between the Frankia nifD-K fragment. The estimated relationships deduced from these genotypic data correlated well with established Frankia taxonomic schemes.
