A Gram-reaction-negative bacterial strain, designated GIMN1.005T, was isolated from a forest soil sample in Vietnam. The isolate was yellow-pigmented, strictly aerobic, and unable to grow below 5 °C or above 37 °C and in the presence of more than 2.0 % NaCl. Cells were non-motile, non-gliding and non-spore-forming. The yellow pigment was of the flexirubin type, non-diffusible and non-fluorescent. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain GIMN1.005T occupied a distinct lineage within the genus Chryseobacterium, with sequence similarity values of 98.6, 98.5 and 98.3 % to Chryseobacterium aquifrigidense KCTC 12894T, Chryseobacterium jejuense KACC 12501T and Chryseobacterium indologenes GIFU 1347T, respectively. The level of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain GIMN1.005T and C. jejuense KACC 12501T was <30 %. The DNA G+C content of strain GIMN1.005T was 42.1 mol%. The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C15:0, iso-C17:0 3-OH and summed feature 3 (C16:1ω7c and/or C16:1ω6c); menaquinone 6 (MK-6) was the sole respiratory quinone. On the basis of phenotypic properties and phylogenetic distinctiveness, strain GIMN1.005T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Chryseobacterium, for which the name Chryseobacterium vietnamense sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is GIMN1.005T (=CCTCC M 209230T=NRRL B-59550T).
