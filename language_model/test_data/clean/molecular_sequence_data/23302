Previously cloned Candida famata (Debaryomyces hansenii) strain VKM Y-9 genomic DNA fragments containing genes RIB1 (codes for GTP cyclohydrolase II), RIB2 (encodes specific reductase), RIB5 (codes for dimethylribityllumazine synthase), RIB6 (encodes dihydroxybutanone phosphate synthase) and RIB7 (codes for riboflavin synthase) were sequenced. The derived amino acid sequences of C. famata RIB genes showed extensive homology to the corresponding sequences of riboflavin synthesis enzymes of other yeast species. The highest identity was observed to homologues of D. hansenii CBS767, as C. famata is the anamorph of this hemiascomycetous yeast. The D. hansenii CBS767 RIB3 gene encoding specific deaminase was cloned. This gene successfully complemented riboflavin auxotrophy of the rib3 mutant of flavinogenic yeast, Pichia guilliermondii. Putative iron-responsive elements (potential sites for binding of the transcription factors Fep1p or Aft1p and Aft2p) were found in the upstream regions of some C. famata and D. hansenii RIB genes. The sequences of C. famata RIB genes have been submitted to the EMBL data library under Accession Nos AJ810169-AJ810173.
