In order to develop glycosylated cytokines, neoglycoproteins were synthesized utilizing naturally occurring oligosaccharides. High mannose type oligosaccharide-asparagine (Asn)s, containing Man8GN2-Asn, Man7GN2-Asn and Man6GN2-Asn, were obtained from quail ovalbumin and were coupled to bovine serum albumin (BSA) by carbodiimide-mediated coupling. Major reaction occurred between amino residues of oligosaccharide-Asns and carboxyl residues of BSA. Approximately one molecules of oligosaccharides-Asns were coupled to per molecule of BSA with 50% yield of glycosylation. Among the oligosaccharides, Man6GN2-Asn appeared to be conjugated predominantly. While this strategy was applied to recombinant human interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), three molecules of oligosaccharide-Asns were introduced into per molecule of IL-1 with 10% yield of glycosylation.
