The association between multiple sclerosis (MS) and alleles of the HLA class II genes indicates that at least one MS susceptibility gene is linked to the HLA class II region. However, the actual locus responsible has not been precisely identified. The recent cloning of new genes involved in antigen processing that map within the HLA class II region led us to investigate--using the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) technique and sequence-specific oligonucleotide analysis--whether these genes might play a role in conferring susceptibility to MS. We studied large multifunctional protease (LMP) 2 and 7 and transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) 1 and 2 gene polymorphisms in 60 HLA-DR2 MS patients and 60 HLA-DR2 healthy subjects and found no specific or preferential RFLP patterns or coding sequence variants in the patient group. Our data do not support a role for these genes in MS susceptibility.
