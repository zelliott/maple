The temperate bacteriophage A2 forms stable lysogens in Lactobacillus casei. The A2-encoded cI product (CI), which is responsible for maintaining the A2 prophage in the lysogenic state, has been purified. The CI protein, which is a monomer of 25.3 kDa in solution, specifically binds to a 153-bp DNA fragment that contains two divergent promoters, PL and PR. These promoters mediate transcription from cI and a putative cro, respectively. Three similar, although not identical, 20-bp inverted repeated DNA segments (operator sites O1, O2, and O3) were found in this segment. CI selectively interacts with O1, which is placed downstream from the transcription start point of the cro gene, and with O2 and O3, which overlap with the -35 region of the two promoters. Using a heterologous RNA polymerase, we have determined the transcription start points of PL and PR. CI exerts a negative effect on the in vitro transcription of PR by repositioning the RNA polymerase in a concentration-dependent manner. CI, when bound to O1 and O2, enhances the positioning of the RNA polymerase with the PL promoter. Our data indicate that the CI protein regulates the lytic and lysogenic pathways of the A2 phage.
