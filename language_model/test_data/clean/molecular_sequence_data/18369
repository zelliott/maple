Three variants of a Crotalus atrox venom enzyme that cleaves primarily the Arg42 - Ala bond of the B beta-chain of human fibrinogen were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography and were shown by N-terminal sequence analysis to be amino acid isoforms. All are single-chain glycoproteins whose approximate molecular weights lie between 26,000 and 28,000. The isoenzymes also cleaved the A alpha-chain at Arg491 - His, though much more weakly, with strengths for both bonds that varied among the isoforms.
