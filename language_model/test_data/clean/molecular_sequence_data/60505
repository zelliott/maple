Methionine sulfoxide (MetSO) in calmodulin (CaM) was previously shown to be a substrate for bovine liver peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (pMSR, EC 1.8.4.6), which can partially recover protein structure and function of oxidized CaM in vitro. Here, we report for the first time that pMSR selectively reduces the D-sulfoxide diastereomer of CaM-bound L-MetSO (L-Met-D-SO). After exhaustive reduction by pMSR, the ratio of L-Met-D-SO to L-Met-L-SO decreased to about 1:25 for hydrogen peroxide-oxidized CaM, and to about 1:10 for free MetSO. The accumulation of MetSO upon oxidative stress and aging in vivo may be related to incomplete, diastereoselective, repair by pMSR.
