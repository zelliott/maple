The influence of peptide structure on immunogenicity has been investigated by constructing a series of cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) chimaeras expressing the 14 amino acid NIm-1A epitope from human rhinovirus 14 (HRV-14) at different positions on the capsid surface. Biochemical and crystallographic analysis of a CPMV/HRV chimaera expressing the NIm-1A epitope inserted into the betaC'-betaC" loop of the S protein revealed that, although the inserted peptide was free at its C-terminus, it adopted a conformation distinct from that previously found when a similarly cleaved peptide was expressed in the betaB-betaC loop of the S protein. Adjustment of the site of insertion within the betaB-betaC loop resulted in the isolation of a chimaera in which cleavage at the C-terminus of the epitope was much reduced. Crystallographic analysis confirmed that in this case the epitope was presented as a closed loop. Polyclonal antisera raised against the CPMV/ HRV chimaera presenting the NIm-1A epitope as a closed loop had a significantly enhanced ability to bind to intact HRV-14 particles compared with antisera raised against chimaeras presenting the same sequence as peptides with free C-termini. These results demonstrate that the mode of presentation of an epitope on a heterologous carrier can dramatically affect its immunological properties.
