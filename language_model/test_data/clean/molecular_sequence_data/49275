Benzoxazinoids are secondary metabolites of grasses that function as natural pesticides. While many steps of DIMBOA biosynthesis have been elucidated, the mechanism of the introduction of OCH(3)-group at the C-7 position was unknown. Inhibitor experiments in Triticum aestivum and Zea mays suggest that a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase catalyses the hydroxylation reaction at C-7. Cloning and reverse genetics analysis have identified the Bx6 gene that encodes this enzyme. Bx6 is located in the Bx-gene cluster of maize.
