Neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) has been shown to inhibit apoptosis in vitro and in vivo with an expression which is regulated in a variety of cells and tissues and may be modulated by a variety of external stimuli. To understand the molecular basis of the transcriptional regulation of the NAIP gene, we have analyzed the 5'-flanking region and transcription of the human NAIP gene. The functional promoter and silencer elements were identified by luciferase reporter constructs in transient transfection experiments using four different human cells. Although the location of the functional elements were shared among the different cells used, the activities for the NAIP promoter varied. Further, cell type-specific protein binding activities were observed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). EMSA analysis with specific antibodies and DNA sequence analysis identified the POU domain transcription factor Brn-2 as a candidate transcriptional regulator of the NAIP gene. The DNA sequence of the promoter region of the PsiNAIP gene, a copy gene for NAIP, was nearly identical to that of the NAIP gene, indicating a common regulatory mechanism for transcription of the NAIP and PsiNAIP genes. Indeed, the transcript of the PsiNAIP gene was identified. These results provided the first evidence for the functional promoter and candidate transcriptional factor for the NAIP gene and transcription of the PsiNAIP gene.
