Few studies have addressed the consequences of physical interactions between NK and T cells, as well as physical interactions among NK cells themselves. We show in this study that NK cells can enhance T cell activation and proliferation in response to CD3 cross-linking and specific Ag through interactions between 2B4 (CD244) on NK cells and CD48 on T cells. Furthermore, 2B4/CD48 interactions between NK cells also enhanced proliferation of NK cells in response to IL-2. Overall, these results suggest that NK cells augment the proliferation of neighboring T and NK cells through direct cell-cell contact. These results provide new insights into NK cell-mediated control of innate and adaptive immunity and demonstrate that receptor/ligand-specific cross talk between lymphocytes may occur in settings other than T-B cell or T-T cell interactions.
