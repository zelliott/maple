The primary structures of myoglobin (Mb) from the following five carangid species were determined: yellowtail Seriola quinqueradiata, greater amberjack Seriola dumerili, yellowtail kingfish Seriola lalandi, Japanese horse mackerel Trachurus japonicus, and silver trevally Pseudocaranx dentex. The sequences were of varying composition both in the coding and in the noncoding regions, but all contained the open reading frame of 444 nucleotides encoding 147 amino acids. Amino acid sequence identities of carangid Mbs were in the range of 81-99%. The similarity of the heme pocket and associated heme-binding residues of carangid Mbs were evidence of the conservative nature of Mbs. Similar to the other teleost Mbs, carangid Mbs did not contain a D helix and had mostly conserved A and E helices as well as E-F and G-H inter-helical segments. Hydropathy profiles of carangid Mbs showed species-specific variations where silver trevally Mb exhibited generally higher hydrophobicity. Phylogenetic analysis based on the primary structures was in agreement with conventional morphological taxonomy, establishing close proximity of carangid Mbs with those of cichlid and scombroid, the other members of the Perciformes order.
