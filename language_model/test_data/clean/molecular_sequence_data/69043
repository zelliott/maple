TIMP-1 is a member of the family of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases involved in regulating the activity of extracellular matrix degrading metalloproteinases. The TIMP-1 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of the corresponding mRNA from human fibroblasts. Cloning and expression of the TIMP-1 cDNA were performed in Escherichia coli. In the host vector system chosen, rTIMP-1 is stored intracellularly in its denatured, insoluble form in inclusion bodies. We report a new method for the purification and renaturation of rTIMP-1 from E. coli inclusion bodies to an active inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (80% yield), presumably containing the correct assignment of the six disulfide bonds. A resin with the covalently bound recombinant catalytic domain of the PMNL-collagenase as the affinity ligand provided an effective means for the separation of correctly folded, active rTIMP-1 from inactive forms with mismatched disulfides. TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, the two most extensively examined members of the family of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, are known to form a complex with the activated forms of most matrix metalloproteinases and the latent forms of the 92-kDa and 72-kDa gelatinases, respectively. In this study, we report on the complex formation of the recombinant catalytic domain of the PMNL-collagenase with TIMP-1, nonglycosylated recombinant TIMP-1, and recombinant TIMP-2. The Ki values for the different inhibitors were determined in a kinetic assay using a fluorogenic substrate peptide. In this assay, rTIMP-2 had a more effective inhibitory capability against the recombinant catalytic domain of the PMNL-collagenase than TIMP-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
