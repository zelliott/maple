Walnut orchards suffer from a blight caused by the bacteria Xanthomonas arboricola pv. juglandis. These bacteria can be infected by viral bacteriophages and this study was carried out to isolate and characterize bacteriophages from walnut orchards located throughout the South Island of New Zealand. Twenty six X. arboricola phages were isolated from three hundred and twenty six samples of plant material representing phyllosphere and rhizosphere ecosystems. The phage isolates were characterized by host-range, plaque and particle morphology, restriction digest and phylogenetic analysis and stability under various storage conditions. From capsid and tail dimensions the bacteriophages were considered to belong to the double-stranded DNA families Podoviridae and Siphoviridae. Of the twenty six bacteriophages, sixteen belonged to Podoviridae and were found both in the phyllosphere and rhizosphere. In contrast, Siphoviridae were present only in the rhizosphere isolates. Phage genome sizes ranged from 38.0 to 52.0 kb from a Hind III restriction digestion and had in common a 400 kb fragment that was identical at the DNA level. Despite the similar restriction patterns, maximum parsimony bootstrap analysis showed that the phage were members of different groups. Finally, we hypothesise that these phage might have use in a biocontrol strategy and therefore storage stability and efficacy was tested. Titres declined more than 50% over a 12-months storage period. Deep-freezing temperatures (-34Â°C) increased while chloroform decreased the stability.
