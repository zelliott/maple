Desiccation tolerance of seeds is positively correlated with raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs). However, RFOs' role in desiccation tolerance is still a matter of controversy. The aim of this work was to monitor the accumulation of RFO during acquisition of desiccation tolerance in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). Rapeseeds become desiccation tolerant at 21-24d after flowering (DAF), and the time was coincident with an accumulation of raffinose and stachyose. A gene encoding galactinol synthase (GolS; EC2.4.1.123), involved in RFO biosynthesis, was cloned and functionally characterized. Enzymatic properties of recombinant galactinol synthase were also determined. Accumulation of BnGOLS-1 mRNA in developing rapeseeds was concomitant with dry weight deposition and the acquisition of desiccation tolerance, and was concurrent with the formation of raffinose and stachyose. The physiological implications of BnGOLS-1 expression patterns in developing seeds are discussed in light of the hypothesized role of RFOs in seed desiccation tolerance.
