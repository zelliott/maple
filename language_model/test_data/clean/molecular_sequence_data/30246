Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that the product of the Escherichia coli secY gene is an integral membrane protein with a central role in protein secretion. We found the Bacillus subtilis secY homologue within the spc-alpha ribosomal protein operon at the same position occupied by E. coli secY. B. subtilis secY coded for a hypothetical product 41% identical to E. coli SecY, a protein thought to contain 10 membrane-spanning segments and 11 hydrophilic regions, six of which are exposed to the cytoplasm and five to the periplasm. We predicted similar segments in B. subtilis SecY, and the primary sequences of the second and third cytoplasmic regions and the first, second, fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth membrane segments were particularly conserved, sharing greater than 50% identity with E. coli SecY. We propose that the conserved cytoplasmic regions interact with similar cytoplasmic secretion factors in both organisms and that the conserved membrane-spanning segments actively participate in protein export. Our results suggest that despite the evolutionary differences reflected in cell wall architecture, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria possess a similar protein export apparatus.
