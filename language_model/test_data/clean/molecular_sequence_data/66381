The partial nucleotide sequences of the hemagglutinin (HA) genes of 72 H9N2 influenza viruses isolated from chickens and turkeys in Israel during the period 2000-2005 were genetically analyzed. The isolates possessed the three types of amino acid motif -R-S-S-R/G-L-, -R-S-N-R/G-L-, and -R-S-K-R/G-L- at the cleavage site of HA. Phylogenetic analyses showed that all Israeli isolates belonged to the same group which further divided into three closely related sub-groups. The HA genes of these isolates were related to the HA gene of A/chicken/Germany/R45/98 isolated from chicken in Germany in 1998.
