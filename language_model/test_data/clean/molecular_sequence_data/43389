Mammalian ribonucleases constitute one of the fastest evolving protein families in nature. The addition of a four-residue carboxyl-terminal tail: Glu-Asp-Ser-Thr (EDST) in human pancreatic ribonuclease (HPR) in comparison with bovine pancreatic RNase (RNase A) could have adaptive significance in humans. We have cloned and expressed human pancreatic ribonuclease in Escherichia coli to probe the influence of the four-residue extension and neighboring C-terminal residues on the biochemical properties of the enzyme. Removal of the C-terminal extension from HPR yielded an enzyme, HPR-(1-124)-peptide, with enhanced ability to cleave poly(C). HPR-(1-124)-peptide also exhibited a steep increase in thermal stability mimicking that known for RNase A. Wild-type HPR had significantly low thermal stability compared to RNase A. The study identifies the C-terminal boundary in the human pancreatic ribonuclease required for efficient catalysis.
