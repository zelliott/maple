1,6-Di-S-methyl-1,6-dithio-D-fructofuranose and its bis(S-oxide) and bis(S,S-dioxide) are described. On examination for sweetness, the oxygenated compounds were neutral but the parent compound was 15-20 times sweeter than sucrose, and 1',6'-di-S-methyl-1',6'-dithiosucrose was slightly less sweet than sucrose.
