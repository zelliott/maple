Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that the cytosolic tyrosine protein kinase p50csk is involved in the negative regulation of T-cell activation (L.M. L. Chow, M. Fournel, D. Davidson, and A. Veillette, Nature [London] 365:156-160, 1993). This function most probably reflects the ability of Csk to phosphorylate the inhibitory carboxy-terminal tyrosine of p56lck and p59fynT, two Src-related enzymes abundantly expressed in T lymphocytes. Herein, we have attempted to better understand the mechanisms by which Csk participates in the inhibitory phase of T-cell receptor signalling. Our results demonstrated that the Src homology 3 (SH3) and SH2 domains of p50csk are crucial for its negative impact on T-cell receptor-mediated signals. As these two sequences were not essential for phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal tyrosine of a Src-like product in yeast cells, we postulated that they mediate protein-protein interactions allowing the recruitment of p50csk in the vicinity of activated Lck and/or FynT in T cells. In complementary studies, it was observed that linkage of a constitutive membrane targeting signal to the amino terminus of Csk rescued the deleterious impact of a point mutation in the SH2 domain of p50csk. This observation suggested that the SH2 sequence is in part necessary to translocate p50csk from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, where Src-related enzymes are located. Nevertheless, constitutive membrane localization was unable to correct the effect of complete deletion of the SH3 or SH2 sequence, implying that these domains provide additional functions necessary for the biological activity of p50csk.
