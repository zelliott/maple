Using a fluorescent differential display (FDD) technique, a novel cDNA was identified by screening for gene expressed differentially between the Dunn osteosarcoma cell line and the LM8 cell line, an isolated variant of the Dunn cell line that has high metastatic potential to the lung. Molecular cloning of the cDNA revealed the clone has similarity to a bacterial fermentation enzyme, the citrate lyase beta-subunit (CL-beta). Northern blot and competitive reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis revealed up-regulation of the gene in the LM8 cell line. An RNA Master blot indicated that the mRNA encoding CL-beta is expressed abundantly in murine heart, liver, and kidney. A human expressed sequence tag (EST) database search suggested that a similar cDNA is expressed in humans. A gene with identical sequence is located on chromosome 13 in the genome database (Sanger centre, UK). These data suggest that a citrate fermentation pathway may exist in eukaryotes including mammals.
