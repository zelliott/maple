The 195 amino acid basic protein (δAg) of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is essential for replication of the HDV RNA genome. Numerous properties have been mapped to full-length δAg and attempts made to link these to secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures. Here, for the full-size δAg, extensive intrinsic disorder was predicted using PONDR-FIT, a meta-predictor of intrinsic disorder, and evidenced by circular dichroism measurements. Most δAg amino acids are in disordered configurations with no more than 30% adopting an α-helical structure. In addition, dynamic light scattering studies indicated that purified δAg assembled into structures of as large as dodecamers. Cross-linking followed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed hexamers to octamers for this purified δAg and at least this size for δAg found in virus-like particles. Oligomers of purified δAg were resistant to elevated NaCl and urea concentrations, and bound without specificity to RNA and single- and double-stranded DNAs.
