Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) continues to deliver high quality protein resolution and dynamic range for the proteomics researcher. To remain as the preferred method for protein separation and characterization, several key steps need to be implemented to ensure quality sample preparation and speed of analysis. Here, we describe the progress made towards establishing 2D-PAGE as the optimal separation tool for proteomics research.
