Sixty-four women presenting with a single mildly abnormal smear were investigated for infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 using both slot blot hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. PCR was nearly three times more sensitive for the detection of HPV 16 DNA than slot blot hybridization. HPV 16 was not significantly associated with a risk of progression to CIN if PCR was used to screen for infection. Women who smoked were at significantly greater risk of progression to CIN than non-smokers.
