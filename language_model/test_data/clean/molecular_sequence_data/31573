Gluconacetobacter europaeus, one of the microorganisms most commonly used for vinegar production, produces the unfavorable flavor compound acetoin. Since acetoin reduction is important for rice vinegar production, a genetic approach was attempted to reduce acetoin produced by G. europaeus KGMA0119 using specific gene knockout without introducing exogenous antibiotic resistance genes. A uracil-auxotrophic mutant with deletion of the orotate phosphoribosyltransferase gene (pyrE) was first isolated by positive selection using 5-fluoroorotic acid. The pyrE disruptant designated KGMA0704 (ΔpyrE) showed 5-fluoroorotic acid resistance. KGMA0704 and the pyrE gene were used for further gene disruption experiments as a host cell and a selectable marker, respectively. Targeted disruption of aldC or als, which encodes α-acetolactate decarboxylase or α-acetolactate synthase, was attempted in KGMA0704. The disruption of these genes was expected to result in a decrease in acetoin levels. A disruption vector harboring the pyrE marker within the targeted gene was constructed for double-crossover recombination. The cells of KGMA0704 were transformed with the exogenous DNA using electroporation, and genotypic analyses of the transformants revealed the unique occurrence of targeted aldC or als gene disruption. The aldC disruptant KGMA4004 and the als disruptant KGMA5315 were cultivated, and the amount of acetoin was monitored. The acetoin level in KGMA4004 culture was significantly reduced to 0.009% (wt/vol) compared with KGMA0119 (0.042% [wt/vol]), whereas that of KGMA5315 was not affected (0.037% [wt/vol]). This indicates that aldC disruption is critical for acetoin reduction. G. europaeus KGMA4004 has clear application potential in the production of rice vinegar with less unfavorable flavor.
