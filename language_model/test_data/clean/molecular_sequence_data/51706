We have investigated the ability of various antigen-presenting cell (APC) types to induce primary anti-viral cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses by single in vitro stimulation. Of these APC types, only dendritic cells (DC) and RMA-S lymphoma cells could induce primary CTL responses, but by divergent mechanisms. DC were capable of generating primary virus-specific CTL, either by presenting viral peptide or processed infectious virus. In contrast, RMA-S cells could not present endogenous antigen, e.g. after virus infection, but this cell line very efficiently presented exogenous viral peptides to induce primary virus-specific CTL in vitro. Spleen cells, lipopolysaccharide-induced B cell blasts or the non-mutated RMA cells did not have the ability to trigger unprimed T cells by single in vitro stimulation. We have investigated several characteristics important for primary CTL response induction by DC and RMA-S cells (summarized in Fig. 6). Primary CTL response induction by DC or RMA-S cells was blocked by anti-LFA-1 or anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies (mAb). DC rapidly aggregated with unprimed T cells, which was independent of LFA-1 and CD8 molecules. RMA-S cells did not form conjugates with unprimed T cells. Despite their abundant major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I cell-surface expression, DC did not bind much exogenously added viral peptide. In contrast, the MHC class I molecules on RMA-S cells bound a large quantity of exogenously administered peptide. Powerful adhesion by DC and high expression of relevant MHC/peptide complexes on RMA-S cells are important features in the initial contact with unprimed T lymphocytes. In a later stage of contact, both DC and RMA-S cells activate LFA-1 (and CD8) molecules at the T cell surface to strengthen and maintain the contact between T cell and APC.
