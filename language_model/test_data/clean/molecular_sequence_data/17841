The nucleotide sequence of Pinus silvestyris 5S rRNA was determined using two independent methods and compared with other plant 5S rRNAs. It shows more than 90% sequence homology with gymnosperm 5S RNAs. The free energy (delta G) analysis of 5S rRNAs from gymnosperms, angiosperms and the other higher plants revealed that the free energy of this ribosomal RNA decreases with evolution.
