A trisaccharide, the O-antigenic repeating unit of C. jejuni serotype O:23 and O:36, was synthesized as a 2'-azidoethyl glycoside by block addition of perbenzylated thiogalactoside donors to alpha-altroHepp-(1-->3)-GlcNPhth disaccharide acceptor in presence of IDCP promoter. The alpha-linked altroheptopyranoside moiety in the glycosyl acceptor was effectively prepared by Swern oxidation of alpha-mannohepp-(1-->3)-GlcNPhth disaccharide followed by mild reduction with NaCNBH3.
