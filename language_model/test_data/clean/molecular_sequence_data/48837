A Gram-stain-positive, non-motile, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain K-1(T), was isolated from soil at a sucrose refinery in Japan. The strain grew at 9-37 °C (optimum, 30 °C) and at pH 6-11 (optimum, pH 7.0). Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain K-1(T) revealed that it was a member of the genus Microbacterium. High 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities were found between strains K-1(T) and both Microbacterium pumilum NBRC 101279(T) (99.7 %) and Microbacterium deminutum NRRL B-24453(T) (99.5 %). However, the DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain K-1(T) and M. pumilum NBRC 101279(T) and M. deminutum NRRL B-24453(T) were only 12 % and 10 %, respectively. The DNA G+C content of strain K-1(T) was 73 mol%. The major fatty acids of strain K-1(T) were anteiso-C15 : 0 and anteiso-C17 : 0, and the major menaquinones were MK-12 and MK-13. The diamino acid in the cell-wall peptidoglycan was lysine. On the basis of these results, strain K-1(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Microbacterium, for which the name Microbacterium saccharophilum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is K-1(T) (= NBRC 108778(T) = NCIMB 14782(T)).
