The development and critical evaluation of new technologies for identifying genetic polymorphisms will rapidly accelerate the discovery and diagnosis of disease-related genes. We report a novel way for distinguishing a new class of human DNA polymorphisms, short insertion/deletion polymorphisms (indels). A sensor with cylindrical pores named channel glass in combination with tandem hybridization, which uses a 5'-fluorescent labeled stacking probe and microarray-based short allele-specific oligonucleotide (capture probe) was investigated. This methodology allows indels to be detected individually and rapidly with small quantities of target DNA. This establishes a reliable quantitative test. Approaches for simultaneously hybridizing different targets to arrayed probes, designed to detect various indels in parallel, were examined. Five markers were consistently detected in a single hybridization. Possible factors impeding the hybridization reaction process are discussed.
