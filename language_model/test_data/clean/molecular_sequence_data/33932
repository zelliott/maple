Lactobacillus pentosus MP-10 was isolated from brines of naturally fermented Alore√±a green table olives. MP-10 has potential probiotic traits, including inhibition of human pathogenic bacteria, survival at low pH (1.5), and bile salt tolerance (3%). Here, we report for the first time the annotated genome sequence of L. pentosus.
