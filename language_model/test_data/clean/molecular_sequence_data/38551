The hydrophobic alkyl chain-containing tetrasaccharide, dodecyl beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-->6)-[alpha-L - arabinofuranosyl-(1-->2)]-beta-D-galactopyranoside, was synthesized efficiently using a convergent strategy. In coupling reactions, protected trichloroacetimidates proved to be better donors than their corresponding bromides in the preparation of the dodecyl disaccharide and trisaccharide. Zempl√©n deacylation provided the target tetramer in good overall yield.
