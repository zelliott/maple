The coding region of 153 amino-acid sorbin, isolated from porcine intestine has been cloned and sequenced in pig, human and rat. The coding region includes 459 bases comprising the 5' region of 24 bases, the middle region named "sorbin-like sequence" (25-432) and the 3' region (433-459). The peptidic C-terminal segment presents the biological activity: absorption of water and electrolytes from the intestine and gall-bladder. The cDNA homology between the three species was 95%. Three forms of mRNA were found, two major forms (6.5 and 8 Kb) and one minor (4.5 Kb).
