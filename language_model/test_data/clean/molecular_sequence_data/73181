Expression of leptin receptor splice variants, including the long form variant (Ob-Rb), has been examined in murine peripheral tissues. RT-PCR indicates that the leptin receptor, Ob-R, and in particular the Ob-Ra splice variant are expressed in a wide range of tissues. Expression of the Ob-R receptor was localized by in situ hybridization to specific sites in the spleen, testes, kidney, liver, lung, and adrenal. However, the long form leptin receptor, Ob-Rb, was only expressed at significant levels in the medulla of the adrenal and the inner zone of the medulla of the kidney. The specific sites of expression of different splice variants within peripheral tissues has important implications with regard to the function of leptin.
