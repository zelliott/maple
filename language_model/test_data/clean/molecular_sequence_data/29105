The autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism is caused by the mutations of the gene encoding a novel protein called parkin. It has been reported that parkin is expressed in the central nervous system and functions as a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) which suppresses neuronal cell degeneration by ubiquitinating misfolded proteins. Thus far, however, it remains unknown if parkin is expressed and functions in the peripheral nervous system. In order to begin to address to this question, we investigated the expression of parkin in bovine peripheral nerve. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated the presence of parkin transcript in bovine peripheral nerve. The obtained bovine parkin cDNA sequence was identical to that of human except a single nucleotide. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated the expression of parkin protein in bovine peripheral nerve. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the localization of parkin in the axoplasm of myelinated nerve fibers, the Schwann cell cytoplasm and the Schwann cell outer membrane. Furthermore, fractionation analysis indicated the presence of two fractions of parkin in bovine peripheral nerve, the cytosolic fraction and the cell membrane-bound fraction. All together, these results point to diverse roles of parkin in not only the central but also the peripheral nervous system.
