Six field foot-and-mouth disease viruses (FMDVs), including four serotype O and two serotype Asia 1 strains, were collected from endemic outbreaks in 2005, 2006, and 2007 from four different provinces in Vietnam. The viruses were isolated and genetically characterized for their complete genomic sequences. The genetic analysis based on the complete genomic coding sequences revealed that the four serotype O FMDVs were related to each other, sharing 95.2% nucleotide (nt) identity and 97.5-97.6% amino acid (aa) identity. Genetic analysis and a phylogenetic tree, based on the VP1 gene of FMDV, showed that the four present Vietnamese serotype O strains have a high level of identity with other serotype O representatives of the Mya-98 lineage of the Southeast Asian (SEA) topotype. The four viruses were all clustered into the Mya-98 lineage of the SEA topotype, sharing 92.3-95.6% nt and 93.4-96.7% aa identity. This finding of the Mya-98 lineage was different from previous reports that the Vietnamese serotype O strains belonged to the Cam-94 lineage of the SEA topotype and two other topotypes, Middle East-South Asia (ME-SA) and Cathay. For the two serotype Asia 1 FMDVs, the genetic analysis based on the complete genomic coding sequences as well as on the VP1 gene revealed that they belonged to two genogroups, IV and V. Of note, the As1/VN/QT03/2007 strain of genogroup V, isolated in 2007, was very closely related to the pandemic Asia 1 strain which caused FMD outbreaks in China (Asia1/WHN/CHA/06, FJ906802) and Mongolia (Asia1/MOG/05, EF614458) in 2005, sharing 99.0-99.3% nt and 99.5-100% aa identity. In contrast, the second strain As1/VN/LC04/2005 of genogroup IV, isolated in 2005, was closely related to all referenced Vietnamese serotype Asia 1 strains found in the GenBank databases, sharing 86.4-100% nt and 90.9-100% aa identity with each. This study is the first description of the full-length genomic sequence of Vietnamese FMDV serotypes O and Asia 1 and may provide the evidence of the concurrent circulation of different serotypes and subtypes of FMDV in recent years in Vietnam.
