A heterotrophic bacterial strain TL1T capable of aerobic denitrification was previously enriched in continuous culture from a landfill leachate treatment plant and isolated as a pure culture. The taxonomic position of this isolate within the beta-subclass of the Proteobacteria was determined by 16S rDNA sequence analysis and by conventional taxonomy including substrate spectrum, quinone type (ubiquinone Q-8) and cellular fatty acid composition. Detection of the specific polyamine 2-hydroxyputrescine supports the membership of strain TL1T in the beta-subclass of the Proteobacteria. The results of 16S rDNA sequencing showed that the strain clustered with, but was separate from, Thauera aromatica and Thauera selenatis. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments indicated that the new isolate represents a new species of the genus, for which the name Thauera mechernichensis is proposed; the type strain is DSM 12266T.
