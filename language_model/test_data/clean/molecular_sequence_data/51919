The nucleotide sequence of a 1619-bp fragment of Mycobacterium bovis BCG containing the gene that encodes an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) has been determined. The M(r) calculated from the deduced amino acid (aa) sequence, as well as the N terminus, are in good accordance with those determined for the ADH purified from M. bovis BCG extracts. The M. bovis BCG cloned adh gene was expressed in Escherichia coli by its own promoter and the synthesized product shows ADH activity in the butane-1-ol-NADP system. Based on comparison of the aa sequence, this enzyme belongs to the zinc-containing, long-chain alcohol/polyol dehydrogenase family, which has been primarily described in eukaryotes. Of the 22 strictly conserved residues in this group, 19 are also conserved in M. bovis BCG ADH (BCGADH).
