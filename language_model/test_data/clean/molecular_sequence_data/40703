Pandora neoaphidis (Entomophthoromycotina, Entomophthorales) is one of the most important fungal pathogens of aphids with great potential as a biological control agent. Development of tools that allow high-resolution monitoring of P. neoaphidis in the environment is a prerequisite for the successful implementation of biological control strategies. In this study, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay was developed. The assay targets 13 SNPs identified in 6 genomic regions including the largest subunit of nuclear RNA polymerase II (RPB1) gene, the second-largest subunit of nuclear RNA polymerase II (RPB2) gene, the β-tubulin (BTUB) gene, the elongation factor 1α-like (EFL) gene, the large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene, and the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene together with the internal transcribed spacer (ITS). The assay allowed the discrimination of 15 different SNP profiles among 19 P. neoaphidis isolates and 4 P. neoaphidis-infected cadavers. Results showed that the assay is applicable to DNA extracted from infected aphids allowing genotyping of the fungus without cultivation. The SNP assay provides an efficient tool for investigation of population structures and dynamics of P. neoaphidis, as well as its persistence and epidemiology in agro-ecosystems. Furthermore, it constitutes a powerful approach for monitoring potential biological control strains of P. neoaphidis in the environment.
