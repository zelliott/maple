The identification of commercial shrimp species is a relevant issue to ensure correct labeling, maintain consumer confidence and enhance the knowledge of the captured species, benefiting both, fisheries and manufacturers. A proteomic approach, based on 2DE, tryptic in-gel digestion, MALDI-TOF MS, and ESI-MS/MS analyses, is proposed for the identification of shrimp species with commercial interest. MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprint from arginine kinase tryptic digests were used for the identification of seven commercial, closely related species of Decapoda shrimps. Further identification and characterization of these peptides was performed by CID on an ESI-IT instrument, database search and de novo sequence interpretation, paying special attention to differential, species-specific peptides. Fisheries and manufacturers may take advantage of this methodology as a tool for a rapid and effective seafood product identification and authentication, providing and guaranteeing the quality and safety of the foodstuffs to consumers.
