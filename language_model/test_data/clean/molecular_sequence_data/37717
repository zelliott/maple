Few molecular events important to platelet biogenesis have been identified. Mice homozygous for the spontaneous, recessive mutation gunmetal (gm) have prolonged bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and reduced platelet alpha- and delta-granule contents. Here we show by positional cloning that gm results from a G-->A substitution mutation in a splice acceptor site within the alpha-subunit of Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (Rabggta), an enzyme that attaches geranylgeranyl groups to Rab proteins. Most Rabggta mRNAs from gm tissues skipped exon 1 and lacked a start codon. Rabggta protein and Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (GGTase) activity were reduced 4-fold in gm platelets. Geranylgeranylation and membrane association of Rab27, a Rab GGTase substrate, were significantly decreased in gm platelets. These findings indicate that geranylgeranylation of Rab GTPases is critical for hemostasis. Rab GGTase inhibition may represent a new treatment for thrombocytosis and clotting disorders.
