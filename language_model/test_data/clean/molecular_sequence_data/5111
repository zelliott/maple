The cDNA encoding the catfish ovarian aromatase has previously been isolated and described (accession number S75715). As demonstrated previously, the predicted amino acid sequence and enzymatic activity of the encoded protein share a significant degree of similarity to the forms of aromatase found in other vertebrates. Analyses utilizing reverse transcription coupled with the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrate the expression of aromatase mRNA in catfish brain, testis and ovary. In spite of the evidence provided by Northern blot analysis for a single transcript encoding ovarian aromatase, RT-PCR analysis indicated transcript heterogeneity within the ovary, but not the testis or the brain. Although not characterized, PCR analysis indicated that the transcript complexity of ovarian aromatase was within the encoding region. Until this study, the expression of aromatase and its correlation with the reproductive physiology of fish had not been studied at the molecular level. In the catfish, significant changes in ovarian development were evident following elevation of plasma estradiol titers during October and again in February. Seasonal changes in the expression of ovarian aromatase and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD) mRNA was reflected in estradiol plasma titers. Ovarian expression of 3beta-HSD mRNA commenced a month before the message for aromatase was detected. Both transcripts were present from October to April. As the female approached the time of spawning (in May), the abundance of both aromatase and 3beta-HSD transcripts decreased. The aromatase message was not detected in post-spawning females but 3beta-HSD transcripts were evident. These data indicate that the timely synthesis of estradiol in catfish is caused by the regulation of both 3beta-HSD and aromatase.
