A chromosomal mutation resulting in 15- to 20-fold increased expression of the Salmonella typhimurium pyrE gene has been cloned and sequenced. The mutation was found to be a single base-pair transition of GC to AT, and occurred within a region of dyad symmetry (attenuator) located just upstream of the pyrE structural gene.
