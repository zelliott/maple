S-antigen (S-Ag) and its mRNA were analysed by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in 32 iridectomy specimens from 29 uveitic patients and 10 non-uveitic patients. S-Ag was detected in one iris and its mRNA was detected in 12 uveitic patients. Neither S-Ag nor its mRNA was found in the controls (P < 0.003). Ten of the 12 patients who had detectable S-Ag mRNA, while only four of the 17 patients who did not, had received corticosteroids for more than 3 years (P = 0.006). We also demonstrated S-Ag and its mRNA in bovine iris by immunoprecipitation and polymerase chain reaction. These results indicate that S-Ag and its mRNA accumulate in the irides of some uveitic patients. This accumulation may be the result of local immunoregulatory factors and an effect of corticosteroid treatment, and may modulate ocular inflammation.
