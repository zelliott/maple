Polypeptide growth factors rapidly induce the transcription of a set of genes that appear to mediate cell growth. We report that one of the genes induced in BALB/c mouse 3T3 cells encodes a transmembrane protein (mTF) homologous to human tissue factor, which is involved in the proteolytic activation of blood clotting. mTF mRNA is present in many murine tissues and cell lines. Our results raise the possibility that mTF may also play a role in cell growth.
