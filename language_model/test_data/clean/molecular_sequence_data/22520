In this study, 197 strains of Bacteroides genus from different species and origins were evaluated with regard to their susceptibility to 5-nitroimidazoles (5-Ni)-such as tinidazole, ornidazole, and metronidazole-using the agar dilution method. The presence of nim genes was also investigated by polymerase chain reaction. It was found that 5.6% of Bacteroides strains among all origins showed decreased susceptibility (minimum inhibitory concentrations varying from 4 to 16 microg/ml) to at least one of the imidazoles studied without any known nim gene associate. Also, we detected one strain isolated from a polluted aquatic environment in which one nim gene was found and characterized as nim B using restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing. Hence, resistance to 5-Ni should be monitored closely because they constitute, among few drugs, the ones quite effective in treating Bacteroides infections.
