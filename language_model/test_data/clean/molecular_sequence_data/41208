The first complete mitochondrial genome of the large white-bellied rat (Niviventer excelsior) was sequenced and annotated in order to provide a source of phylogenetic characters including an assessment of gene order arrangement. The mitochondrial genome sequence (16,298 bp) of N. excelsior contains 13 protein-coding, 2 rRNA and 22 tRNA genes as well as 1 typical control region (D-Loop), which are shared by other mammalian mitochondrial genomes. The codon usage also followed the typical vertebrate pattern except for an unusual CCA stop codon, which was termination codon of Cyt b. The 16 nucleotide insertion was detected in the central conserved domain of d-Loop. The 12 heavy-strand encoded protein-coding genes were used to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships by the Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods. Topologies revealed that N. excelsior clustered together with the species in genus Rattus, indicating their closer phylogenetic relationship.
