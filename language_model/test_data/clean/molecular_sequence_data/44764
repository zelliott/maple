The complete nucleotide sequence of a 33221 bp segment, contained in cosmid pEOA1044, derived from the left arm of chromosome XV of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, appears in public databases between coordinates 177013 and 210234 (http://speedy.mips.biochem.mpg.de/). Computer analysis of that sequence revealed the presence of the previously known genes IRA2, DEC1, NUF2, HST1, RTG1, RIB2 and HAL2, one previously partially sequenced open reading frame (ORF) of unknown function (SCORFAC) and ten newly identified ORFs. One of the new ORFs is similar to the Drosophila melanogaster white gene and other transmembrane ABC transporters, another one has similarities to inositol phosphatases and others are similar to ORFs of unknown function from various organisms, including human Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs). Potential transmembrane regions, ATP/GTP-binding and WD motifs have also been identified. The existence of yeast ESTs for two of the newly identified ORFs indicates that they are transcribed.
