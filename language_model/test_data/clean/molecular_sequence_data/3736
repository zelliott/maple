The expression of two CTR-gene homologues was investigated during flower senescence in two Rosa hybrida cultivars. A fragment of a gene for a protein kinase, termed RhCTR1 (GenBank Acc. No. AF271206), was amplified by PCR and used to isolate the corresponding full-length cDNA (Acc. No. AY032953) from a rose petal cDNA library. The protein RhCTR1 has 66% amino acid identity to Arabidopsis CTR1. A fragment of a second CTR homologue, termed RhCTR2 (Acc. No. AY029067) is 69% identical to the corresponding region of RhCTR1. RhCTR1 expression increased during flower senescence, while RhCTR2 was constitutively expressed during flower development. The expression of both RhCTR1 and RhCTR2 was increased in response to exogenous ethylene.
