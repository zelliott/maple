The Qnr proteins belong to the pentapeptide repeat protein family. Despite each pentapeptide repeat unit being an important structural determinant, accurately determining pentapeptide repeat units in the Qnr proteins through sequence-based alignments has been challenging. In the present study, the pentapeptide repeat units of the nine representative Qnr proteins have been precisely determined via the structure-based alignment approach using homology modeling and superposition of their best models.
