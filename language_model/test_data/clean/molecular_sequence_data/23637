A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contig was constructed by chromosome walking, starting from the Hox genes of the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Bombyx orthologues of the labial (lab) and zerknult (zen) genes were newly identified. The size of the BAC contig containing the Hox gene cluster-except the lab and Hox 2 genes-was estimated to be more than 2 Mb. The Bombyx Hox cluster was mapped to linkage group (LG) 6. The lab gene was mapped on the same LG, but far apart from the cluster. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis confirmed that the major Hox gene cluster and lab were at different locations on the same chromosome in B. mori.
