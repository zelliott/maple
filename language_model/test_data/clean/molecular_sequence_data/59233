With the systematic sequencing of the yeast genome, yeast biology has entered a new era where novel challenges have to be faced. One challenge is the identification of the function of the several hundred novel genes discovered by genome sequencing. Another is to understand how all yeast genes act in concert to ensure and maintain cell organization. Two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis is the technique of choice to take up these challenges because it provides the opportunity of obtaining an overall view of genome expression. In prospect of these studies we have undertaken the construction of a yeast 2-D gel protein database that contains information on polypeptides of the yeast protein map. In this paper we report the information presently contained in this database. The reported information includes the identification of 250 protein spots and the characterization of polypeptides corresponding to N-terminal acetylated proteins, mitochondrial proteins, glucose-repressed proteins, heat shock induced proteins and proteins encoded by intron-containing genes. In all, 600 spots are annotated. These data can be accessed on the Yeast Protein Map server through the World Wide Web network.
