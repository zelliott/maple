The secondary structure of two-electron-reduced Megasphaera elsdenii flavodoxin has been determined by visual, qualitative inspection of the sequential connectivities involving C alpha H, C beta H and NH protons observed in NOESY (two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy) spectra. Results from an amide proton exchange experiment were used to confirm the secondary structure assignment and to demonstrate the compactness and stability of the protein. After the secondary structure elements were established, the global fold of the protein and the flavin binding site have been determined using nonsequential interresidual NOE connectivities as primary source of information. The secondary structure and the global fold of M. elsdenii and Clostridium MP flavodoxin appeared to be very similar, differences are observed however. M. elsdenii flavodoxin consists of a central parallel beta-sheet including five strands surrounded on both sides by a pair of alpha-helices.
