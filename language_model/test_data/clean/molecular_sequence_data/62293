As present antibiotics therapy becomes increasingly ineffectual, new technologies are required to identify and develop novel classes of antibacterial agents. An attractive alternative to the classical target-based approach is the use of promoter-inducible reporter assays for high-throughput screening. The wide usage of these assays is, however, limited by the small number of specifically responding promoters that are known at present. This work describes a novel approach for identifying genetic regulators that are suitable for the design of pathway-specific assays. The basis for the proposed strategy is a large set of antibiotics-triggered expression profiles ("Reference Compendium"). Pattern recognition algorithms applied to the expression data pinpoint the relevant transcription-factor-binding sites in whole-genome sequences. Using this technique, we constructed a fatty-acid-pathway-specific reporter assay that is based on a novel stress-inducible promoter. In a proof-of-principle experiment, this assay was shown to enable screening for new small-molecule inhibitors of bacterial growth.
