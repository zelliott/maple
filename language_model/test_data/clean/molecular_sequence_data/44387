Expression of virulence-associated genes in Bordetella pertussis is under the control of the pleiotropic regulator BvgA. Although previous studies have identified recognition sequences for BvgA in several promoter regions, their structures have not been clearly characterized. We show that the BvgA binding sites within the bvgp(1) and cyaA promoters consist of inverted repeats and suggest that inverted-repeat motifs may represent the recognition elements for DNA-BvgA interaction.
