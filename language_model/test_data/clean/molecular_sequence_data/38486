Chaperonin 60 (cpn60) belongs to the group of ubiquitous molecular chaperones that comprise the heat shock proteins, nucleoplasmins and chaperonins. Antibodies to recombinant CPN60 from humans was used to screen a cDNA library of Onchocerca volvulus and antigen-positive clones were selected. Sequencing of the DNA inserts confirmed their identity as cpn60 transcripts. These are distinct from a cpn60 sequence recorded previously from O. volvulus (GenBank accession number Y09416) that appears to be of endobacterial origin, rather than derived from the parasite itself. The full-length sequence of the cDNA (designated Ov-cpn60) codes for a protein of 64.3kDa (598 amino acid residues) and shares significant identity with homologous gene products from Caenorhabditis elegans (72%), humans (69%), yeast (53%) and Escherichia coli (50%). The endobacterial and parasite sequences are 41% conserved. Ov-CPN60 migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 65kDa on SDS-PAGE and is present in all life-cycle stages, as determined by immunoblotting with rabbit antibodies raised against the recombinant protein. Immunogold electron microscopy identified the protein within mitochondria, as expected, but also in extra-mitochondrial sites, including inclusion bodies of the glandular oesophagus (in infective larvae), the uterine wall, cytosol of developing spermatids, and the hypodermis and cuticle. Endobacteria were also labelled, indicating cross-reactivity between CPN60 from the parasite and its intracellular symbiont. In human infections, serum antibodies to Ov-CPN60 were present in only 11% of cases from Ecuador, but in 81-89% of subjects in three separate foci from West Africa. There was no relationship between antibody levels and age, sex, or infection intensity, and no consistent association between the serological response and immune status. An evaluation of antibody specificities in individual sera revealed a mixture of parasite-specific and host crossreactive anti-CPN60 antibodies, the ratio of which varied amongst geographic areas. It is concluded that antibody responses to Ov-CPN60 are unlikely to contribute either to host protection or pathology in onchocerciasis.
