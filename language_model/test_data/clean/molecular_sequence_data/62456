Phosphoinositides play a fundamental role in clathrin-coat assembly at the cell surface. Several endocytic components and accessory factors contain independently folded phosphoinositide-binding modules that facilitate, in part, membrane placement at the bud site. As the clathrin-coat assembly process progresses toward deeply invaginated buds, focally synthesized phosphoinositides are dephosphorylated, principally through the action of the phosphoinositide polyphosphatase synaptojanin 1. Failure to catabolize polyphosphoinositides retards the fission process and endocytic activity. The long-splice isoform of synaptojanin 1, termed SJ170, contains a carboxyl-terminal extension that harbors interaction motifs for engaging several components of the endocytic machinery. Here, we demonstrate that in addition to DPF and FXDXF sequences, the SJ170 carboxyl terminus contains a novel AP-2 binding sequence, the WXXF motif. The WXXF sequence engages the independently folded alpha-subunit appendage that projects off the heterotetrameric AP-2 adaptor core. The endocytic protein kinases AAK1 and GAK also contain functional WXX(FW) motifs in addition to two DPF repeats, whereas stonin 2 harbors three tandem WXXF repeats. Each of the discrete SJ170 adaptor-interaction motifs bind to appendages relatively weakly but, as tandemly arrayed within the SJ170 extension, can cooperate to bind bivalent AP-2 with good apparent affinity. These interactions likely contribute to the appropriate targeting of certain endocytic components to clathrin bud sites assembling at the cell surface.
