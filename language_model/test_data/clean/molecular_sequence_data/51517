Total genomic DNA was isolated from three cereal stem rusts, Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, f. sp. secalis, f. sp. avenae, and two cereal leaf rusts, P. recondita f. sp. tritici and P. coronata f. sp. avenae, and analyzed for the presence of heterogeneity in the intergenic region of the ribosomal DNA repeat unit. A 1 kb region of the repeat unit between the 26s and the 5s rRNA genes (IGR-1) was amplified by PCR and was found to be heterogeneous within each isolate and variable in size between races and species. The PCR results were confirmed by Southern blot analysis of native DNA. In an isolate of race C36(48), heterogeneity appeared to be due to variable numbers of 0.1 kb subrepeats in IGR-1. Nine wheat stem rust strains representing nine different races produced a unique pattern of heterogeneity while two different isolates of one race were identical, as were five of another. This may provide a rapid method for race identification in wheat stem rust. Heterogeneity and polymorphism in rye stem rust, oat stem rust, wheat leaf rust, and oat crown rust, was less pronounced than in wheat stem rust. In the course of this work, the 5s rRNA gene was located and its position and orientation within the ribosomal repeat unit was established.
