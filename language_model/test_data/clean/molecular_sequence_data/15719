Bacterial proteins that are abnormally truncated due to incomplete mRNA or the presence of rare codons are extended by an SsrA tag during ribosome rescue in a trans-translation process important for maintaining protein quality. In Escherichia coli, the SsrA-tagged proteins become the target of the Tsp, Lon, FtsH, ClpXP, and ClpAP proteases. Here we show that degradation of model SsrA-tagged proteins in Streptococcus pneumoniae depends primarily or exclusively on ClpXP in vivo. In addition, we show the E. coli SsrA tag is also a target of S. pneumoniae ClpXP in vivo, even though the N-terminal portions of the tags differ significantly between the two species, suggesting there may be no adaptor protein for SsrA in S. pneumoniae.
