During assembly, HLA class II molecules associate with the invariant chain. As the result, the peptide-binding groove is occupied by an invariant chain peptide termed CLIP (class-II-associated invariant chain peptide; sequence MRMATPLLM). By mass spectrometry, we have now characterized peptides that are naturally present in HLA-DQ2. This analysis revealed that 22 variants of Ii-derived peptides are associated with HLA-DQ2. Strikingly, the large majority of those do not contain the conventional CLIP sequence MRMATPLLM, but instead a peptide that partially overlaps with CLIP, sequence TPLLMQALPM. Peptide binding studies indicate that this alternative CLIP peptide has superior HLA-DQ2 binding properties compared to the conventional CLIP and that the minimal nine-amino-acid binding core consists of the sequence PLLMQALPM, findings that could be corroborated by molecular simulation. The alternative CLIP peptide was also found to be present in HLA-DQ2 molecules isolated from human thymus. Moreover, the alternative CLIP peptide was also found in association with HLA-DQ8. Together, these results indicate that HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 associate with an alternative CLIP sequence, a property that may relate to the strong association between HLA-DQ molecules and human autoimmune diseases.
