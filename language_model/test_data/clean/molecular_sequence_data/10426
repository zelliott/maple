The phnX gene encoding the phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (phosphonatase) from the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa A237 has been cloned and its sequence determined. The open reading frame consists of 825 nucleotides specifying a protein of 275 amino acid residues corresponding to a predicted molecular weight of 29929. The deduced amino acid sequence of PhnX did not share significant amino acid sequence similarity with any other polypeptide. Expression of the phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase coding sequence in Escherichia coli under control of the E. coli tac promoter resulted in the production of enzymatically active protein with an affinity constant similar to that of the phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase purified from P. aeruginosa A237. This is the first nucleic sequence report of the phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase, an enzyme involved in the carbon-phosphorus bond cleavage.
