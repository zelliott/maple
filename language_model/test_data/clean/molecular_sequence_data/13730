Males housed in mixed sex groups quickly form dominance hierarchies; subordinates can be further subdivided into stress responsive subordinates (SRS) and non-responsive subordinates (NRS) based on corticosterone responses to a novel stressor. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA levels measured with in situ hybridization were elevated in locus coeruleus (LC) of NRS compared to singly or pair-housed controls; NRS also had higher TH levels than dominants. TH protein levels determined by immunoautoradiography were also higher in LC of NRS and SRS versus pair-housed controls.
