To analyze the regulation of Matrix Gla Protein (MGP) gene expression in Xenopus laevis, we cloned the xMGP gene and its 5' region, determined their molecular organization, and characterized the transcriptional properties of the core promoter. The Xenopus MGP (xMGP) gene is organized into five exons, one more as its mammalian counterparts. The first two exons in the Xenopus gene encode the DNA sequence that corresponds to the first exon in mammals whereas the last three exons show homologous organization in the Xenopus MGP gene and in the mammalian orthologs. We characterized the transcriptional regulation of the xMGP gene in transient transfections using Xenopus A6 cells. In our assay system the identified promoter was shown to be transcriptionally active, resulting in a 12-fold induction of reporter gene expression. Deletional analysis of the 5' end of the xMGP promoter revealed a minimal activating element in the sequence from -70 to -36 bp. Synthetic reporter constructs containing three copies of the defined regulatory element delivered 400-fold superactivation, demonstrating its potential for the recruitment of transcriptional activators. In gel mobility shift assays we demonstrate binding of X. laevis nuclear factors to an extended regulatory element from -180 to -36, the specificity of the interaction was proven in competition experiments using different fragments of the xMGP promoter. By this approach the major site of factor binding was demonstrated to be included in the minimal activating promoter fragment from -70 to -36 bp. In addition, in transient transfection experiments we could show that this element mediates calcium dependent transcription and increasing concentrations of extracellular calcium lead to a significant dose dependent activation of reporter gene expression.
