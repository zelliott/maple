Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) granules of Zoogloea ramigera I-16-M contained two major PHB granule-associated proteins (PGA12 and PGA16) as revealed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel elecrophoresis. N-terminal amino acid sequences of these proteins were determined. The genes encoding these proteins were cloned and sequenced. The structural genes of PGA12 and PGA16 were 351 and 447 bp long, which encode polypeptides with deduced molecular masses of 12.3 and 16.0 kDa, respectively. PGA12 and PGA16 were expressed in Escherichia coli. PHB granules were isolated from cells of recombinant strains of E. coli JM109, which harbored and expressed the PHB-synthetic genes of Ralstonia eutropha H16 and PGA12 or PGA16. These PHB granules contained PGA12 or PGA16 as a major protein. The presence of pga12 or pga16 did not affect the amount of PHB synthesized in E. coli. PGA12 and PGA16 bound to crystalline and amorphous PHB granules.
