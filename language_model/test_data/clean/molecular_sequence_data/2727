Expression of the ompF gene coding for an outer membrane protein of Escherichia coli is regulated by a transcriptional activation mechanism that requires the ompR gene product that acts on nucleotides located upstream of the -35 and -10 regions of the ompF promoter. We previously demonstrated that this cis-acting upstream sequence displays a sequence-directed curvature of the DNA helix. To characterize the structure and function of this upstream sequence, a series of deletion mutants and base-substitution mutants of the upstream sequence of the ompF promoter were constructed, and their abilities as to OmpR-binding and activities of the ompF promoter were examined after they had been connected to the lacZ gene. The nucleotides extending from position -91 to -79 are essential not only for sequence-specific recognition of the ompF promoter by the OmpR protein, but also for OmpR-dependent activation of the ompF promoter. It was also demonstrated that the nucleotides extending from position -111 to -92 play a role in stimulation of the ompF expression. A local structural alteration in the ompF promoter was observed in some of the base-substitution mutants. Based on the results, the structure and function of the upstream sequence of the ompF promoter are discussed in relation to activation of the ompF promoter by the OmpR protein.
