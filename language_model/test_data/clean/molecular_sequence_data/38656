Arcelins are insecticidal proteins found in some wild accessions of the common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris. They are grouped in six allelic variants and arcelin-5 is the variant with the highest inhibitory effect on the development of Zabrotes subfasciatus larvae. Characterization of the protein and its genes resulted in the identification of three polypeptides and the isolation of two genes that encode the Arc5a and Arc5b polypeptides. Here we describe a new gene, Arc5-III. The protein it encodes has 81% amino acid identity with the derived amino acid sequences of Arc5-I and Arc5-II. The Arc5-III gene is highly expressed in developing seeds and at a much lower level in roots. Data obtained by a combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, protein sequencing and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis support the conclusion that Arc5-III encodes a polypeptide present in Arc5c band. Using ion-exchange chromatography, three fractions containing arcelin-5 polypeptides were eluted by increasing the salt concentration. The three fractions contain various amounts of the three arc-5 polypeptides and inhibit the growth of Zabrotes subfasciatus larvae differentially, suggesting differences in insecticidal activity among the arcelin-5 isoforms.
