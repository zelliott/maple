Clones have been constructed that contain full-length cDNA copies of cowpea mosaic virus RNA1 and RNA2, downstream of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The clones, when linearized downstream of the viral sequences, give rise to cowpea mosaic virus-like symptoms when inoculated onto cowpea plants. Viral RNA and virions can be detected in the inoculated plants, demonstrating that the clones are directly infectious.
