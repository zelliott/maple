The negatively charged residues in the N-terminus of actin and the 697-707 region on myosin subfragment 1 (S-1), containing the reactive cysteines SH1 and SH2, are known to be important for actin-activated myosin ATPase activity. The relationship between these two sites was first examined by monitoring the rates of SH1 and SH2 modification with N-ethylmaleimide in the presence of actin and, secondly, by testing for direct binding of SH1 peptides to the N-terminal segment on actin. While actin alone protected SH1 from N-ethylmaleimide modification, this effect was abolished by an antibody against the seven N-terminal amino acids on actin, F(ab)(1-7), and was greatly reduced when the charge of acidic residues at actin's N-terminus was altered by carbodiimide coupling of ethylenediamine. Neither F(ab)(1-7) nor ethylenediamine treatment reversed the effect of F-actin on SH2 reactivity in SH1-modified S-1. These results show a communication between the SH1 region on S-1 and actin's N-terminus in the acto-S-1 complex. To test whether such a communication involves the binding of the SH1 site on S-1 to the N-terminal segment of actin, the SH1 peptide IRICRKG-NH2(4+) was used. Cosedimentation experiments revealed the binding of three to six peptides per actin monomer. Peptide binding to actin was affected slightly, if at all, by F(ab)(1-7). The antibody also did not change the polymerization of G-actin by the peptides. The peptides caused a small reduction in the binding of S-1 to actin and did not change the binding of F(ab)(1-7).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
