The casein kinase II alpha' gene (CSNK2A2), which physically maps to human chromosome 16 (HSA16), has previously been mapped to bovine chromosome 5 (BTA5). Based on these results, a new segment of homology between the human and bovine genomes was suggested. In this paper we demonstrate linkage between CSNK2A2 and several markers on BTA18. Our result is supported by the extensive conservation of synteny between HSA16q and BTA18. Bovine chromosome 18 markers used in this study included several microsatellites, as well as the MC1R gene previously mapped to HSA16q24.3. Sequencing of the PCR-fragment mapped to BTA5 reveals that a CSNK-like retroposon was responsible for the conflicting assignments. The present results further extend the observed conservation of synteny between HSA16q and BTA18.
