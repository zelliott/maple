Identification of T-cell epitopes from foreign proteins is the current focus of much research. Methods using simple two or three position motifs have proved useful in epitope prediction for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, but to date not for MHC class II molecules. We utilized data from pool sequence analysis of peptides eluted from two HLA-DR13 alleles to construct a computer algorithm for predicting the probability that a given sequence will be naturally processed and presented on these alleles. We assessed the ability of this method to predict known self-peptides from these DR-13 alleles, DRB1(*)1301 and *1302, as well as an immunodominant T-cell epitope. We also compared the predictions of this scoring procedure with the measured binding affinities of a panel of overlapping peptides from hepatitis B virus surface antigen. We concluded that this method may have wide application for the prediction of T-cell epitopes for both MHC class I and class II molecules.
