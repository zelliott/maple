The human RH locus is responsible for the expression of the Rh blood group antigens. It consists of two closely linked genes, RHD and RHCE, that exhibit 92% similarity between coding regions. These observations suggest that they are derived from a relatively recent duplication event. Previously a study of nonhuman primate RH-like genes demonstrated that ancestral RH gene duplication occurred in the common ancestor of man, chimpanzees and gorillas. By amplification of intron 3 and intron 4 of gorilla RH-like genes, we have now shown that, like man, gorillas possess two types of RH intron 3 (RHCE intron 3 being 289 bp longer than the RHD intron 3) and two types of intron 4 (RHCE intron 4 being 654 bp longer than the RHD intron 4). Here we report the characterization of a cDNA encoded by a gorilla RH-like gene which possesses introns 3 and 4 of the RHCE type. A comparison of this gorilla RHCE-like coding sequence with previously characterized human and ape cDNA sequences suggests that RH genes experienced complex recombination events after duplication in the common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees and gorillas.
