Chemically synthesized DNA fragments complementary to selected regions of the potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTV) genome were cloned into Escherichia coli plasmid pUC9. One of the recombinant plasmids (pIBB4) with a 87 bp insert representing the central region of the PSTV genome (nucleotides 88 to 174) was used after labelling by nick translation for detecting PSTV by dot-blot hybridization. The molecular probe was almost as sensitive as the one carrying the full genomic PSTV copy (pAV401), detecting down to 20 pg of PSTV RNA in 8-15 micrograms of infected tissue. The specificity of the test was high; no signals were created by extracts from healthy plants or plants infected with a variety of common potato viruses. The probe is potentially useful in studies on mixed infections of potatoes with different viruses, and in selection of certified seed material.
