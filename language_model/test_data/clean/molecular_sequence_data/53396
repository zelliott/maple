The ICln protein is expressed ubiquitously in mammals. Experiments designed to knock down the ICln protein in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts as well as in epithelial cells led to the conclusion that this protein is crucially involved in volume regulation after cytoplasmic swelling. Reconstitution of the ICln protein in lipid bilayers revealed the ion channel nature of ICln. Here we describe a new human promoter sequence, composed of 89 nucleotides, which is responsible for a highly constitutive expression of the ICln protein. The promoter sequence lacks a TATA box, and the transcription can be effected at multiple sites. In addition to the starting sites, upstream sequence elements are mandatory for an efficient transcription of the ICln gene (CLNS1A). These new nucleotide elements were defined by site-directed mutagenesis.
