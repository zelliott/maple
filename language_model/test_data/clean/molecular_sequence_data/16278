The capsular polymer of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 6 (ATCC 33590) was investigated by methylation, dephosphorylation, partial hydrolysis, and 1H- and 13C-n.m.r. methods. It was found to be a high-molecular-weight polymer composed of triglycosylglycerol phosphate repeating-units joined through monophosphate diester linkages, and has the structure: (formula; see text).
