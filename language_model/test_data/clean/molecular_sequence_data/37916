Three distinct regions, designated AZFa, b and c from proximal to distal Yq, are required for normal spermato-genesis in humans. Deletions involving AZFa (deletion interval 5C/D) seem to occur less frequently in infertile men and to be associated with a more severe testicular phenotype, with almost complete absence of germ cells. AZFa contains three genes, named USP9Y, DBY and UTY, and presents high homology with the mouse Delta Sxr (b) interval, deletion of which causes a severe spermatogenic impairment. However, the specific role of these genes in human spermatogenesis is still unknown and it is not clear which of them is responsible for the AZFa phenotype. Here we describe a complete sequence map of the AZFa region, the genomic structure of AZFa genes and their deletion analysis in a large number of infertile men characterized by well-defined spermatogenic alterations. Both USP9Y and DBY may cause severe testiculopathies, but DBY appears to be the major AZFa candidate. DBY is frequently deleted in infertile patients and its absence produces severe spermatogenic damage leading to a significant reduction of germ cells or even to their complete absence. Expression analysis of AZFa genes and their X-homologues revealed ubiquitous expression for all of them except DBY; this gene produces a long transcript which is ubiquitously expressed in addition to a shorter transcript which is only expressed in the testis, suggesting a specific role for DBY in the spermatogenic process. This hypothesis is further supported by the high similarity of DBY to other DEAD box proteins belonging to the PL10 subclass.
