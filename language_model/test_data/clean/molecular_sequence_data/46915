Little information is available correlating the structural properties of peptides with their immunogenicity in terms of responses via cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The TT-NP6 chimeric peptide, consisting of two copies of a promiscuous T-helper epitope (T: residues 288-302 from the fusion protein of the measles virus) linked to the NP6 T-cytotoxic epitope (NP6: residues 52-60 from the nucleoprotein of measles virus) was able to induce virus-specific CTL responses in the absence of any adjuvant and hydrophobic component. The present work was undertaken to gain insight into structural features of the TT-NP6 peptide that may be important in optimizing the CTL immunogenicity of the peptide. Circular dichroism data, obtained in a buffer of physiological ionic strength and pH, strongly suggest a self-associated state for the peptide, which was confirmed by a sedimentation velocity experiment. However, helix association is accompanied by loss of overall helical content. Thermal-dependence studies show that the unfolding of self-associated alpha-helices is significantly more pronounced than the unfolding of isolated alpha-helices. Circular dichroism data, together with tryptic limited proteolysis, suggest the presence of a charged amino acid within the hydrophobic core. This study should provide a basis for engineering more effective immunogenic peptides against the measles virus by increasing the stability of the TT-NP6 peptide.
