Of 471 specimens examined from foxes, raccoons, muskrats, otters, and beavers living in wetlands adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay, 36 were positive for five types of Cryptosporidium, including the C. canis dog and fox genotypes, Cryptosporidium muskrat genotypes I and II, and Cryptosporidium skunk genotype. Thus, fur-bearing mammals in watersheds excreted host-adapted Cryptosporidium oocysts that are not known to be of significant public health importance.
