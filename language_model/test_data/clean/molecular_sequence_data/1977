In Guillain-Barr√© syndrome following Campylobacter enteritis, anti-lipopolysaccharide antibodies cross-react with neural gangliosides, thereby precipitating autoimmune neuropathy. We examined the properties of 15 murine anti-LPS/ganglioside mAbs specific for NeuAc(alpha2-8)NeuAc-Gal disialosyl epitopes. Many mAbs displayed features of an innate B cell origin including polyreactivity (13/15), hybridoma CD5 mRNA expression (5/15), predominance of IgM (9/15) or IgG3 (3/6) isotype, low affinity, and utilisation of unmutated VH and VL VDJ rearrangements. Antibody specificity resided in highly selective V gene usage, with 6/15 mAbs being encoded by the VH7183.3b gene. These data indicate that neuropathogenic antiganglioside autoantibodies can arise from the natural autoantibody repertoire.
