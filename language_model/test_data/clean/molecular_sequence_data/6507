P-glycoproteins encoded by members of the mdr gene family function as membrane-situated transport proteins, isoforms of which are involved in conferring a form of multidrug resistance by participating in secretion of various xenobiotics. In primary rat hepatocytes maintained in serum-free culture, accumulation of immunodetectable P-glycoprotein and mdr1b mRNA occurred in a time-dependent manner and was accompanied by a substantial decrease in retention of the mdr1 substrate rhodamine 123. However, incubation of cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or with insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) markedly enhanced time-dependent accumulation of P-glycoprotein and mdr1b mRNA. Furthermore, EGF-treated cells exhibited decreased intracellular rhodamine 123 retention, an effect partially inhibited by the chemosensitizer verapamil. These data suggest that an increase in (a) functional transporter(s) eliciting transport of mdr1 substrates occurs under EGF.
