The work reported here has been directed to the identification of new nuclear calmodulin-binding proteins. To achieve this goal, nuclei from rat hepatocytes were purified and a fraction enriched in DNA- and RNA-binding proteins was extracted using DNase I and RNase A. Calmodulin-binding proteins present in this nuclear subfraction were purified by chromatography using first a DEAE-Sephacel column and subsequently a calmodulin-Sepharose column. Four major polypeptides of 118, 107, 48 and 45 kDa were found to bind to the calmodulin column in a Ca(2+)-dependent way. [125I]-calmodulin overlay analysis confirmed that the proteins of 118, 48 and 45 kDa are calmodulin-binding proteins. These proteins bind single-stranded and also double-stranded DNA. A partial amino acid sequence obtained from the 48 kDa protein revealed a 100% identity with the La/SSB protein, an autoantigen implicated in several autoimmune diseases, such as lupus erythematosus and Sj√∂gren's syndrome. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, Western blot analysis and experiments of binding to poly(U), also supports the identity of p48 as La/SSB. CaM and La/SSB protein colocalize in the heterochromatinic regions within the nucleus of rat hepatocytes. Preincubation of La/SSB with calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+ resulted in an increase in the binding of ssDNA to La/SSB, suggesting that calmodulin can play a role in the regulation of the association of La/SSB with DNA.
