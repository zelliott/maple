We report the identification of a new transthyretin (TTR) gene mutation and variant protein, Glu61Gly, in a 55-year-old man with progressive cardiomyopathy, mild peripheral neuropathy and bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. A diagnosis of TTR-associated familial amyloidosis (ATTR) was considered after an endomyocardial biopsy revealed amyloid deposits in the heart of a patient who had no family history of amyloidosis and no evidence of a plasma cell dyscrasia. Serum screening for a TTR variant by isoelectric focusing (IEF) was positive and prompted further studies to identify the genetic abnormality and to characterize the amyloidogenic protein. Direct DNA sequence analysis of all four coding regions in the TTR gene demonstrated heterozygosity in exon 3. Near equal amounts of guanine (G) and adenine (A) were observed at the second base position of codon 61. The wild-type (GAG) and mutated (GGG) sequences found in codon 61 correspond to glutamic acid (Glu) and glycine (Gly) residues, amino acids which differ in mass by -72 Da. Mass spectrometric analyses of TTR immunoprecipitated from serum showed the presence of both wild-type and variant proteins. The observed mass results for the wild-type and variant proteins were consistent with the predicted values calculated from the genetic analysis data.
