Seven years have elapsed since the terms calpain and calpastatin were introduced. During these years, significant progress in research has been recorded. Thus, cloning and sequencing of cDNAs for calpains I and II and calpastatin have established amino acid sequences of these molecules. Structure-function relationship of calpastatin has been studied using mutated cDNAs expressed in E. coli. Interleukin 2 receptor-linked expression of calpastatin in HTLV-I-infected T-cells has been reported. Evidence for Ca2+-induced translocation of calpain to the cell membrane, followed by its autolytic activation, has been discussed. A great varieties of proteins such as several kinases, membrane and cytoskeletal proteins, and hormone receptors have been reported to be susceptible to calpains. This paper is to summarize our current knowledge on chemistry and biology of calpain and calpastatin and thereby to speculate the true function of calpains and their regulatory mechanisms.
