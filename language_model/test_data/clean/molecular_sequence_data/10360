The crystal structures of two members of the SF1 family of helicases, Rep and PcrA, and one member of the SF2 family of helicases, the HCV RNA helicase, have recently been solved. These structures illuminate the roles of the conserved helicase motifs in catalytic function and offer clues as to how these proteins can translocate along DNA.
