Microbial exopolysaccharides (EPSs) are used in the food industry for their unique properties as viscosifiers, stabilisers, emulsifiers or gelling agents. In recent years, significant progress in the understanding of the genetics and biochemistry of microbial EPS synthesis by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria has been made. Biosynthesis pathways have been elucidated, and several of the genes involved have been characterised. This knowledge can now be applied to start EPS engineering or to improve EPS production.
