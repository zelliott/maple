The CD4 gene follows a complex and highly regulated pattern of expression throughout T cell development. This expression is governed by different regulatory elements that have been partly identified, including a promoter, a proximal enhancer, and a silencer. Here we show that a CD4 minigene comprising a combination of these elements is specifically expressed in mature CD4+ T cells of transgenic mice, but not in CD4+CD8+ double positive thymocytes. The proportion of transgene-expressing CD4+ T cells was constant within a given transgenic line, but varied greatly from one line to another. We demonstrate that this pattern of expression is due to integration of the transgene within or in the vicinity of centromeric heterochromatin. This position-effect variegation demonstrated with a short CD4 transgene has not been observed with larger ones containing additional regulatory sequences, suggesting that the CD4 gene contains a locus control region. Such position-dependent effects must be taken into consideration when developing transgenic models or gene transfer vectors because they can result in the absence of transgene expression in a subpopulation of target cells. Finally, the combination of the CD4 gene silencer, proximal enhancer, and promoter provides an interesting tool to selectively express genes of interest in mature CD4+ T cells of transgenic mice and for the development of gene therapy vectors.
