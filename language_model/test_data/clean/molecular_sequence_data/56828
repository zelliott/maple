In the present study DNA from 281 unrelated haemophilia A patients including 15 inhibitor patients has been analysed by Southern blotting technique. Using various restriction enzymes, cloned factor VIII cDNA probes and genomic fragments we have identified 14 mutations. Six of the mutations are novel partial factor VIII gene deletions. One deletion affects exon 1, two deletions concern exon 6, another deletion, of which breakpoints are sequenced, takes part of exon 16 and two deletions affect exon 26. Besides the deletions, eight point mutations have been found at the TaqI restriction sites of exons 18, 24 and 26. Five C-->T mutations resulted in nonsense mutations, one in exon 18, one in exon 26 and three in exon 24. Two G-->A mutations caused a missense mutation in exon 24 leading to an arginine/glutamine exchange. Although two patients showed this mutation, their clinical phenotypes were different, possibly due to an additional unidentified sequence polymorphism. A G-->T mutation in exon 26 substituted the arginine with leucine. All deletions and seven of the point mutations are associated with severe disease with a detectable inhibitor in the patient with the TaqI-point mutation in exon 18. One of the G-->A mutations is associated with mild haemophilia but the patient also has developed an inhibitor. Amongst these mutations the origin of the mutation could be determined in four kindred, one of which showed maternal mosaicism.
