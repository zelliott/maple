Trichomonads are anaerobic flagellated protists that, based on analyses of ribosomal RNA sequences, represent one of the earliest branching lineages among the eukaryotes. The absence of mitochondria in these organisms coupled with their deep phylogenetic position has prompted several authors to suggest that trichomonads, along with other deeply-branching amitochondriate protist groups, diverged from the main eukaryotic lineage prior to the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria. In this report we describe the presence of a gene in Trichomonas vaginalis specifically related to mitochondrial chaperonin 60 (cpn60). A recent study indicates that a protein immunologically related to cpn60 is located in trichomonad hydrogenosomes. Together, these data provide evidence that ancestors of trichomonads perhaps harbored the endosymbiotic progenitors of mitochondria, but that these evolved into hydrogenosomes early in trichomonad evolution.
