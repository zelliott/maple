TraM is a 11.4 kDa protein involved in the control of the conjugal transfer of Agrobacterium tumefaciens Ti plasmids by quorum-sensing. TraM was overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli. This protein binds to the transcriptional regulator TraR, abolishing its function. Size-exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering show that the recombinant protein has an apparent molecular weight of 30 kDa in solution. Crystals have been obtained of both native and selenomethionine-substituted TraM by the vapour-diffusion method. Crystals diffract to 1.67 A and belong to the space group P2(1)2(1)2, with unit-cell parameters a = 76.43, b = 47.09, c = 47.46 A and two molecules in the asymmetric unit. A two-wavelength MAD data set for the selenomethionine-substituted form has been collected to a resolution of 2.0 A. The selenium substructure (five out of six possible sites) has been solved using direct methods.
