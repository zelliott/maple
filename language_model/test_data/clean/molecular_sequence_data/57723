We have PCR-amplified cDNA sequence of the "embryonic" gamma subunit of muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR) from adult bovine extraocular muscle (EOM). We cloned and sequenced this product and used it to probe Northern blots. We detected the gamma subunit in EOM mRNA, but not in control skeletal muscle. The presence of gamma subunit in EOMs may explain their preferential involvement in myasthenia gravis, where an autoimmune response to the gamma subunit is generally present.
