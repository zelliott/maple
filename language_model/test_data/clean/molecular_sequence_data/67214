The vanillate demethylase genes from Streptomyces sp. NL15-2K were cloned and sequenced. The vanA and vanB gene homologs, which encode the terminal oxygenase subunit (VanA) and the ferredoxin-type reductase subunit (VanB) of the enzyme respectively, were found in the sequenced 7.5-kb DNA region. Expression of the vanAB genes in Streptomyces lividans 1326 resulted in in vivo demethylation of veratric acid to vanillic acid.
