Thyroid hormones (THs) play a pivotal role in many physiological functions in vertebrates, including fish. Their effects are mediated by thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), which are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. In this study, full-length cDNA sequences of TRs from yellow catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco and Javelin goby Synechogobius hasta were cloned and their mRNA tissue expression profiles were determined. In P. fulvidraco, the validated cDNAs encoding for TRα and TRβ were 1789 and 1848 bp in length, encoding peptides of 401 and 378 amino acid residues, respectively. In addition, a TRβ spliced variant (named P. fulvidraco-TRβv), containing a 60-bp insertion, was detected. In S. hasta, cDNAs encoding for TRαA, TRαB and TRβ were 1827, 2295 and 2258 bp in length, encoding peptides of 401, 409 and 393 amino acid residues, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that TRα and TRβ cDNAs grouped into two separate clusters with other vertebrate counterparts and two TRα sequences grouped separately, suggesting that the two TRαs derived from paralogous genes that might arise during a teleost-specific genome duplication event. All TR mRNAs were detected in various tissues sampled. The mRNA levels of both TRα and TRβ from P. fulvidraco were the highest in brain, followed by liver, and lowest in heart, intestine, muscle, gill and spleen. However, in S. hasta, TRαA, TRαB and TRβ showed the highest mRNA levels in brain and lowest in muscle. Identification and mRNA tissue expression of TR genes from P. fulvidraco and S. hasta provide an initial step towards understanding their biological roles in the two fish species.
