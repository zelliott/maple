Comparison of the NSP4 amino acid sequences from 31 strains of mammalian rotaviruses revealed the presence of four distinct NSP4 alleles; i.e., the Wa, KUN, AU-1, and EW alleles. The EW allele consists only of NSP4s from murine rotavirus strains and is divergent from other NSP4 alleles from the evolutionary perspective. There have been conflicting reports regarding the enterotoxigenic activity of NSP4 in the mouse model system; heterologous simian and porcine rotavirus NSP4s function as an enterotoxin in mice, while a homologous EC NSP4 does not play a dominant role as an enterotoxin in the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator knockout mice. To further examine the enterotoxigenic activity of NSP4, we expressed in Escherichia coli a recombinant protein consisting of glutathione S-transferase and amino acid residues 86-175 of the EW NSP4. We found that this fusion protein caused diarrhea in the majority (8/14) of 5- to 6-day-old CD1 mice. This study confirmed and extended that group A rotavirus NSP4s were able to induce diarrhea in neonatal mice and had an enterotoxigenic activity.
