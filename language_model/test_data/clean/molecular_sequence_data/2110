Nucleolin is a key nucleolar protein in higher eukaryotic cells and is involved directly in ribosome biogenesis. Using an antiserum raised against hamster nucleolin, the homologous protein was detected in nucleoli of Xenopus laevis hepatocytes as well as in the amplified nucleoli of oocytes. A cDNA encoding Xenopus nucleolin has been isolated and sequenced. The deduced protein sequence reveals similar domains in Xenopus and in mammals, but they have undergone separate evolutions. In particular, each of the four RNA-binding domains has evolved differently--the carboxy-proximal domain is twice as conserved (87%) as the amino-proximal domain (42%). These data shed some light on the possible roles of each domain. The expression of nucleolin has been followed throughout oogenesis and embryogenesis. The appearance of nucleolin during early development precedes the transcription of rDNA and the synthesis of ribosomal proteins. The maximal accumulation of nucleolin at gastrulation coincides with nucleolar reformation. Furthermore, when ribosomal synthesis is activated during oogenesis and embryogenesis, peptides immunorelated to nucleolin appear and accumulate. The results suggest that nucleolin plays a role not only in ribosome assembly but also in nucleologenesis.
