The regulation of gelsolin levels during differentiation of the murine embryonal carcinoma cell line, PC-13, was investigated using nucleic acid and immunological probes. A cDNA clone, Mu-319, which contained the entire coding sequence for the cytoplasmic form of murine gelsolin was isolated using a polyclonal antibody. Gelsolin was detected in several cell lines but was not detectable in three undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cell lines. Levels of gelsolin mRNA increased 10-fold during the differentiation of the murine embryonal carcinoma cell line, PC-13. Differentiation of PC-13 was accompanied by changes in cell shape, from small indistinct cells to large flat cells. The accumulation of gelsolin mRNA in PC-13 cells began 12-24 h after addition of the differentiation-inducing agents. In comparison, 2-5A-dependent RNase activity showed a 40-fold increase beginning after 24 to 36 h and c-fos mRNA were shown to increase about 9-fold beginning 36 to 60 h after induction of differentiation. The levels of gelsolin per se, as determined by immunoreactivity were also shown to increase with differentiation of PC-13 cells. These results suggest that gelsolin may play a role in the restructuring of actin filaments which accompanies the dramatic changes in cell shape during differentiation.
