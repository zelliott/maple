An unexpected structural similarity is described between the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and verotoxin. This similarity has escaped detection primarily due to the differences in topology that exist between the two proteins. By comparing this result with two previously reported similarities for the PH domain, one with the lipocalins and another with the FK506 binding protein, we discuss the problems of measuring and assessing structural similarities.
