Recently a new member of the blue-light photoreceptor family, CRY-DASH, was reported in Arabidopsis, though its distinctive biological functions are still unclear. We characterized the CRY-DASH gene of tomato and evidenced that its mRNA is expressed in both seeds and adult organs showing diurnal and circadian fluctuations. Moreover, the CRY-DASH transcription pattern is altered in both in a cry1a mutant and in a transgenic CRY2 overexpressor suggesting that CRY-DASH regulation must be mediated at least partially by an interaction of CRY1a and CRY2 with the timekeeping mechanism.
