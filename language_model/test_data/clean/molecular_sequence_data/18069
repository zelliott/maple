We have studied transcription from the cauliflower mosaic virus 19S and 35S promoters in a cell-free system derived from tobacco cells in suspension culture. While a whole-cell extract is incapable of detectable transcription from these promoters, successive purification by column chromatography allows the preparation of two fractions which contain all factors necessary for transcription from the 19S promoter. In contrast, transcription from the 35S promoter leads to the accumulation of short RNAs. This accumulation can only be partially alleviated by modifying the conditions of transcription.
