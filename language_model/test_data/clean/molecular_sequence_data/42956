Two crystal protein genes, the 5.3kb and 6.6kb class respectively, from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki HD-1 (B. t HD-1) had been cloned previously. Based on the classification system of Hofte and Whiteley, these two genes should belong to Cry I A (b) and Cry I A (c) gene type respectively. The nucleotide sequence of the toxic domain of this Cry I A (c) gene from B. t kurstaki HD-1 is firstly reported here and compared with that of Cry I A (c) gene from B. t HD-73 and Cry I A (b) gene from B. t HD-1.
