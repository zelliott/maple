The purification of lambda chain-containing IgG fraction from pooled sera of Basilea rabbits, which were bred and selected for the expression of a high level of lambda chains positive for c7 but negative for c21, was carried out. On the basis of specific binding to anti-c7 antiserum, the c7 lambda chain fraction in serum IgG was shown to account for up to 70% of the total immunoglobulin light chains, the remaining 30%, bearing the expected k2 bas isotype. Peptide mapping of the mixed light chains (lambda + k2 bas) followed by microsequencing of the constant region fragments indicated that the C lambda region originated from the cDNA sequence derived from a c7+,c21- Basilea rabbit (i.e. identical to gene C lambda 6), as described in the preceding report (Hayzer, D. J. et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 1990. 20: 2707). In addition, a synthetic peptide encompassing residues 139-159 of the constant region derived from the predicted sequence of gene C lambda 6 was shown to partially inhibit the c7-anti-c7 binding reaction in a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Taken together, the chemical and immunochemical data clearly demonstrate that gene C lambda 6 indeed encodes c7 epitopes.
