A real time RT-PCR, using the LightCycler, was developed and compared with rapid antigen enzyme immunoassay (AgEIA) and enhanced virus culture for rapid detection of influenza A viruses in stored and prospectively collected respiratory specimens. Specific hybridization probes were used for simultaneous detection and differentiation between H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes. The sensitivity of the RT-PCR for influenza A H1N1 was 120 copies and H3N2 350 copies of in vitro transcribed RNA. A specimen was considered positive for influenza A when it was culture positive or at least two methods yielded a positive test result. Using these criteria, with stored samples, the RT-PCR sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 82.9, 95.5, 98.9 and 52.5%, respectively. In specimens collected prospectively the RT-PCR sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 100, 87.9, 82.8 and 100%, respectively. There was complete concordance with subtype differentiation by hybridization probe melting temperature analysis and haemagglutination inhibition assay.
