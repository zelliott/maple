The presence of high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16, 18 and 33 in cell lines established from several malignancies including 5 of cervical cancer and 6 of head and neck cancer was studied. HPV DNA, either type 16 or 18, was detected by polymerase chain reaction, and by Southern blot hybridization in all of the cell lines derived from cervical cancers. The hybridization patterns of HPV DNA after endonuclease digestion differed among cell lines, suggesting that all of these cell lines were independent isolates. Accordingly, high-risk types of HPV DNA seem to be ubiquitous in cervical cancer. HPV DNA was not detected in the cell lines derived from head and neck cancers or from any other malignancies besides cervical cancer in this study.
