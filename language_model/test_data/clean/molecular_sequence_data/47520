Tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen (TIN-ag) is an extracellular matrix protein and is expressed in the renal tubular basement membranes. Its role in metanephric development was investigated. TIN-ag cDNA, isolated from the newborn mouse library, had an ORF of 1,425 nucleotides, a putative signal sequence, and an ATP/GTP-binding site. The translated sequence had approximately 80% identity with rabbit TIN-ag. Among various tissues, TIN-ag mRNA was primarily expressed in the newborn kidney. In the embryonic metanephros, TIN-ag expression was confined to the distal convolution or pole of the S-shaped body, the segment of the nascent nephron that is the progenitor of renal tubules. Treatment with TIN-ag antisense oligodeoxynucleotide induced dysmorphogenesis of the embryonic metanephroi, malformation of the S-shaped body, and a decrease in the tubular population, whereas the glomeruli were unaffected. Treatment also led to a decrease of TIN-Ag mRNA, de novo synthesis of TIN-ag protein, and its antibody reactivity. The mRNA expression of glomerular epithelial protein 1 (a marker for renal podocytes), anti-heparan-sulfate-proteoglycan antibody reactivity, and wheat germ agglutinin lectin staining of the metanephros were unaffected. The anti-TIN-ag antibody treatment also caused deformation of the S-shaped body and a reduction in the tubular population, whereas the glomeruli were unchanged. The data suggest that the TIN-ag, unlike other basement membrane proteins, selectively regulates tubulogenesis, whereas glomerulogenesis is largely unaffected.
