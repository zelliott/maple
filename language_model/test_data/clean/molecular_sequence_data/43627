The nucleotide sequence and chromosomal localization of a human pseudogene is reported. Sequence data suggest that this pseudogene was derived via reverse transcription from the gene encoding the cytosolic isoform of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase. In addition, a heteroduplex analysis of this pseudogene among several species of nonhuman primate indicates a relatively high degree of sequence conservation.
