Two carp tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) genes have been cloned and sequenced. Both TNF1 and TNF2 sequences have several polymorphisms in the 3' UTR and TNF2 has a polymorphism in the coding sequence. Lipopolysaccharide and the protozoan blood flagellate Trypanoplasma borreli induced expression of TNFalpha in carp head kidney phagocytes when added in vitro. Differential expression was observed, with TNF2 being higher expressed than TNF1. We used the TNFalpha-specific inhibitor pentoxifylline to demonstrate the involvement of carp TNFalpha in the induction of nitric oxide and in the stimulation of cell proliferation. In addition, two carp lines differing in their resistance to T. borreli were typed for the TNF2 polymorphism and association between one isoform and resistance was found.
