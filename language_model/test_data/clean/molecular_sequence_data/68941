We have investigated functional common T-cell epitopes between human thyroglobulin (hTg) and human thyroid peroxidase (hTPO) in mice. Four hTg peptides, Tg-P1, Tg-P2, Tg-P3 and Tg-P4, in which 5 amino acid residues are identical to those of hTPO, and 1 hTPO peptide, TPO-P4 relevant to Tg-P4, were prepared. Among these peptides, only Tg-P4 (residues 2730-2743) and TPO-P4 (residues 118-131) were highly antigenic and both peptides shared the common T-cell epitope. In addition, when the spleen cells from mice immunized with mouse Tg (mTg) were restimulated in vitro by Tg-P4 or TPO-P4 as well as by mTg, these cells transferred thyroiditis to naive recipient mice. These findings indicate that this common T-cell epitope between hTg and hTPO is immunogenic and related to the development of murine experimental autoimmune thyroiditis.
