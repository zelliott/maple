Tapasin is a transmembrane glycoprotein located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Its function is to assist the assembly of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. The chicken Tapasin gene includes 8 exons and is localized inside the major histocompatibility complex between the 2 class IIbeta genes. The aim of the current study was the estimation of single nucleotide polymorphism frequency within the avian Tapasin gene. The Tapasin gene sequence from exon 5 to exon 6 was amplified for the chicken, turkey, and pheasant, and sequences of different lengths were obtained. The sequence analysis based on PolyBayes identified 25 putative single nucleotide polymorphism sites when the 3 species were compared. The coding sequences were further translated and analyzed to identify amino acid substitutions. The results indicated that polymorphisms within this region of the gene was mainly observed in the heterozygous state. The level of conservation of the Tapasin gene sequence among species is likely to be related to the functional importance of the gene.
