To verify that the circular forms of bocavirus genome exist in their host, bocavirus episomes were detected in fecal samples of healthy piglets using a semi-nested PCR method. Two species of porcine bocaviruses (PBoVG2-episome and PBoVG3-episome) were identified for the first time. The relevant terminal sequences of the noncoding region (405 and 511 nt, respectively) were also obtained. Sequence analyses and secondary structure prediction indicated that the PBoVG2-episome was more similar to that of human bocavirus 3 (HBoV3) but the PBoVG3-episome was quite different from that of other members of the genus Bocavirus. Discovery of episomal forms of porcine bocaviruses (PBoV) suggested that PBoV, like HBoV, used a different replication mechanism from other parvoviruses. The sequencing of episome Inverted Terminal Repeats (ITRs) also contributes to a possible alternative strategy for constructing infectious molecular clones of bocavirus in a future study.
