(S)-Mandelate dehydrogenase (MDH) from Pseudomonas putida, a member of the flavin mononucleotide-dependent alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase/dehydrogenase family, is a membrane-associated protein, in contrast to the more well-characterized members of this protein family including glycolate oxidase (GOX) from spinach. In a previous study [Mitra, B., et al. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 12959-12967], the membrane association of MDH was correlated to a 53 amino acid segment in the interior of the primary sequence by construction of a chimeric enzyme, MDH-GOX1, in which the membrane-binding segment in MDH was deleted and replaced with the corresponding 34 amino acid segment from the soluble GOX. Though MDH-GOX1 was soluble, it was an inefficient, nonspecific enzyme that involved a different transition state for the catalyzed reaction from that of the wild-type MDH. In the present study, it is shown that the membrane-binding segment in MDH is somewhat shorter, approximately 39 residues long. Partial or total deletion of this segment disrupts membrane localization of MDH. This segment is not important for substrate oxidation activity. A new chimera, MDH-GOX2, was created by replacing this shorter membrane-binding segment from MDH with the corresponding 20 amino acid segment from GOX. The soluble MDH-GOX2 is very similar to the wild-type membrane-bound enzyme in its spectroscopic properties, substrate specificity, catalytic activity, kinetic mechanism, and lack of reactivity toward oxygen. Therefore, it should prove to be a highly useful model for structural studies of MDH.
