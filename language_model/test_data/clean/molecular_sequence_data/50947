Four new steroid saponins, kingianosides A-D, were isolated from the rhizome of Polygonatum kingianum, together with two known steroid saponins. On the basis of chemical and spectral evidence, the structures of kingianosides A-D were established as gentrogenin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl (1-->4)-beta-D-galactopyranoside, gentrogenin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->4)-beta-D-fucopyranoside, 26-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-22-hydroxy-25(R)-furost-5-en-12-on-3 beta, 22-diol 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->4)-beta-D-galactopyranoside and 26-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-22-hydroxy-25(R)-furost-5-en-12-on-3 beta,22-diol 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->4)-beta-D-fucopyranoside, respectively.
