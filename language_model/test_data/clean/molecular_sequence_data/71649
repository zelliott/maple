Nucleoporins are the main components of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. Starting with an expressed DNA fragment retrieved by exon trapping from pooled human BAC clones mapped to the short arm of chromosome 5, we identified a human nucleoporin cDNA sequence by PCR from a human testis cDNA library. The coding sequence showed high homology to that of the rat nucleoporin 155 (Nup155) cDNA. FISH analysis with the human BAC clone as probe localized the human NUP155 gene to chromosome band 5p13. Northern analysis showed that the human NUP155 gene was expressed at different levels in all tissues tested. Two species of transcripts were observed with estimated lengths of 5.4 and 4.7 kb, respectively, in concordance with the finding of two alternative polyadenylation sites in the cDNA. The genomic location of the human NUP155 gene suggests a possible role in the mental and developmental retardation associated with hemizygous deletions of the 5p13 region.
