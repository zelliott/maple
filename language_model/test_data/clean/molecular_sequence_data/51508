We have used an in vitro reconstitution system to determine the effects of a large number of mutations in the highly conserved 5' terminal domain of the yeast U2 snRNA on pre-mRNA splicing. Whereas many mutations have little or no functional consequence, base substitutions in two regions were found to have drastic effects on pre-mRNA splicing. A previously unrecognized function for the U2 snRNA in the second step of splicing was found by alteration of the absolutely conserved sequence AGA upstream of the branch point recognition sequence. The effects of these mutations suggest the formation of a structure involving the U2 snRNA similar to the guanosine-binding site found in the catalytic core of group I introns.
