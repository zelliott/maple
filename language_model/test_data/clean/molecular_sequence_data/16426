We sequenced all exons and exon-intron junctions of the CYP2B6 gene from 200 Japanese individuals. We found three novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (1375A>G, 1427G>A and 1454A>T) causing amino acid substitutions (Met(459)Val, Gly(476)Asp and Gln(485)Leu in exon 9), respectively. The detected SNP was as follows: 1) SNP, 031226Hiratsuka01; GENE NAME, CYP2B6; ACCESSION NUMBER, AC023172; LENGTH, 25 base; 5'-CAGAACTTCTCCA/GTGGCCAGCCCCG-3'. 2) SNP, 031226Hiratsuka02; GENE NAME, CYP2B6; ACCESSION NUMBER, AC023172; LENGTH, 25 base; 5'-CCCAGGAGTGTGG/ATGTGGGCAAAAT-3'. 3) SNP, 031226Hiratsuka03; GENE NAME, CYP2B6; ACCESSION NUMBER, AC023172; LENGTH, 25 base; 5'-CCCCAACATACCA/TGATCCGCTTCCT-3'.
