Genomic clones containing the vitellogenin (Vg) gene from the gypsy moth were isolated from two genomic libraries and characterized. The nucleotide sequence of a 16,132 bp region of the gypsy moth genome was determined which included a 3,666 bp region upstream from the transcription initiation site and 499 bp region downstream from the transcribed region. Primer extension analysis was performed to identify the transcription initiation site. Gene sequence confirmed the sequence of VgmRNA recently reported [Hiremath and Lehtoma, J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. (1997) 27:27-35] and indicated that the gypsy moth Vg gene contains seven exons interrupted by six introns. Sequence analysis of the promoter region revealed presence of several motifs associated with sex-specific and developmentally regulated genes in other systems. The nucleotide sequence comparison analyses showed that the gypsy moth Vg gene had considerably similarity with the Bombyx mori Vg gene but not with those from Anthonomous grandis and Aedes aegypti.
