The differential display technique was applied to compare mRNAs from two clinical isolates of Candida albicans with different virulence; high (potent strain, 16240) and low (weak strain, 18084) extracellular phospholipase activities. Complementary DNA fragments corresponding to several apparently differentially expressed mRNAs were recovered and sequenced. A complementary DNA fragment seen distinctly in the potent phospholipase producing strain was highly homologous to the yeast translation initiation factor (TIF). The selected DNA fragment was then used as a probe to isolate its corresponding complementary DNA clone from a library of C. albicans genomic DNA. The sequence of isolated gene revealed an open reading frame of 1194 nucleotides with the potential to encode a protein of 397 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 43 kDa. Over its entire length, the amino acid sequence showed strong homology (78-89%) to Saccharomyces cerevisiae TIF and (63-80%) to mouse eIF-4A proteins. Therefore, our C. albicans gene was identified to be TIF (Ca TIF). Northern blot analysis in the two strains of C. albicans revealed that Ca TIF expression is 1.5-fold higher in the potent phospholipase producing strain. The restriction endonuclease digestion of genomic DNA from this potent strain revealed at least two hybridized bands in Southern blot analysis, suggesting two or more closely related sequences in the C. albicans genome.
