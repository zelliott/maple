The bona fide 5S rRNA genes in the rat are found in a 1.8-kb tandem repeat and the pseudogenes occur in a 2.5-kb tandem repeat. Three bona fide 5S rRNA genes and one gene variant with one base substitution in the coding region were isolated from the 1.8-kb repeat. Six pseudogenes were isolated from the 2.5-kb repeat. The total number of genes/gene variants/pseudogenes is 700-1200 copies per haploid genome, and the pseudogene repeat contains about 50% more 5S rDNA related sequences compared with the bona fide gene repeat. Various well-defined 5' - and 3'-flanking sequences of the bona fide gene and of the pseudogene were used for in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes. The results showed that the bona fide 5S rRNA gene repeat Rn5s maps to chromosome 19q12 and the pseudogene repeat Rn5sp maps to 12q12.
