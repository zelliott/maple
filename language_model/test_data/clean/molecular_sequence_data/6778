We isolated and sequenced cDNAs for the murine synaptonemal complex protein 1 (SCP1). The whole cDNA sequence displays respectively 93% and 90% identity with the previously reported rat and hamster cDNAs. We show, however, that the encoded amino acid sequence extends for an additional stretch of 51 residues at its amino-terminal end.
