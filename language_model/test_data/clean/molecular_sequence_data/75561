An open reading frame of 74 codons was identified downstream of the nifB gene of Bradyrhizobium japonicum 110. The predicted amino acid sequence shared 63% similarity with the Rhodopseudomonas palustris ferredoxin I sequence. We propose to name the gene frxA. The frxA gene was found to be cotranscribed with the nifB gene. An insertion mutation within frxA hardly affected nitrogen fixation activity.
