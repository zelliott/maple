NeuB, a sialic acid synthase catalyzes the last committed step of the de novo biosynthetic pathway of sialic acid, a major element of bacterial surface structure. Here we report a functional NeuB homologue of Streptococcus suis, a zoonotic agent, and systematically address its molecular and immunological role in bacterial virulence. Disruption of neuB led to thinner capsules and more susceptibility to pH, and cps2B inactivation resulted in complete absence of capsular polysaccharides. These two mutants both exhibited increased adhesion and invasion to Hep-2 cells and improved sensibility to phagocytosis. Not only do they retain the capability of inducing the release of host pro-inflammatory cytokines, but also result in the faster secretion of IL-8. Easier cleaning up of the mutant strains in whole blood is consistent with virulence attenuation seen with experimental infections of both mice and SPF-piglets. Therefore we concluded that altered architecture of S. suis surface attenuates its virulence.
