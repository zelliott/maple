A 23-kDa protein that was present at higher levels in diapausing 2nd instar larvae than in feeding 2nd instar larvae of Choristoneura fumiferana was purified, and polyclonal antibodies were raised against this protein. The antibodies were subsequently used to screen a cDNA library that was constructed using RNA from 2nd instar larvae. Eight identical cDNA clones were isolated. The cDNA clone had a 665-bp insert and the longest open reading frame coded for a 203-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 23.37 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence showed high similarity to glutathione S-transferases and therefore, the cDNA clone was named C. fumiferana glutathione S-transferase (CfGST). Identity of CfGST was confirmed by using affinity-purification as well as enzyme activity assay. CfGST was closer in similarity to insect GST2 members than GST1 members. The apparent Vmax of the purified CfGST towards the substrates glutathione and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenezene (CDNB) were similar. However, the enzyme had a three-fold higher affinity towards CDNB than glutathione. Analyses using Northern blot, immunoblot and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the fat body was the major tissue where the enzyme was synthesized and stored. Higher levels of CfGST protein were present in diapausing 2nd instar larvae compared to feeding 2nd and 6th instar larvae, suggesting that besides detoxification CfGST may have other roles during insect development that are not readily apparent at present. The CfGST cDNA was expressed in a recombinant baculovirus expression system and an active enzyme was produced.
