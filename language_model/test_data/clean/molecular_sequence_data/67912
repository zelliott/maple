Since Loss (1907) established the genus Eurytrema, there were more than eleven species found worldwide from America, Europe to Asia. Adult worms are generally found in pancreatic and bile ducts of wild and domestic ruminants. Some species from wild animal and domestic animal have already differentiated. In this study, we amplified and sequenced the partial 18S rRNA sequences of some Eurytrema species found in wild and domestic animals. The phylogenetic analysis was conducted to show the genetic relationship of these Eurytrema species. The results demonstrated that same species of Eurytrema from domestic animal and wild animal or from separated geological region have a considerable degree of genetic differentiation. Analysis of the 18S rRNA sequences indicated that Eurytrema fukienensis is an independent species and suggested that it may represent the intermediate species between wild and domestic animal.
