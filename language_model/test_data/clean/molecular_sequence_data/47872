The minimal sequence requirement of Crithidia tubulin polyglutamylase is already fulfilled by tubulin-related peptides carrying a free alpha-carboxylate on a glutamic acid residue. Since the product of each glutamylation step fulfills the substrate requirements necessary for the next cycle, very long side chains are generated with brain tubulin as a substrate. Up to 70 mol of glutamic acid was incorporated per alphabeta-heterodimer. We speculate that the strict choice of a particular glutamate residue for the formation of the isopeptide bond initiating a novel side chain is made by a tubulin monoglutamylase which requires the entire tubulin as substrate.
