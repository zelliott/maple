We investigated 21 affected individuals in two unrelated monilethrix families of Indian origin and identified point mutation (g.4624G>A) in the HTM motif (exon-7) of the KRTHB6 gene in all the affected members leading to E413K change in this basic keratin. The HTM motif of KRTHB1, however, showed previously unreported two allelic variants, one with three novel variations (SNPs) in cis: g.4421insT (intronic); g.4461T>C (exonic); g.4485A>G (exonic) and second with only intronic variation (SNP) (g.4421insT). Interestingly, the two distinct phenotypes of: localized severe hair defect with beaded appearance confined to the scalp of all the affected members of Family 1 and of generalized unbeaded hair defect of moderate severity in Family 2, segregated in the two families, respectively, correlating with the two separate genotypes for the functionally critical HTM region of KRTHB1 gene in the background of E413K mutation in the KRTHB6 gene. Presence of E413K mutation in the HTM of KRTHB6 gene was not observed in the background of the allelic variant with three SNPs in KRTHB1 gene in homozygous condition in all the affected members of Family 1, affected with a localized but severe form of the disease. However, the same (E413K) mutation existed in the KRTHB6 gene in the background of the allelic variant with three SNPs in the KRTHB1 gene in homozygous condition, consistently in all the affected members of Family 2, where all its affected members showed the segregation of a milder form of the disease. Presence of both E413K mutation in the KRTHB6 and the variations in the KRTHB1 genes were not observed together in randomly selected 150 unaffected controls outside the two affected families. This is also the first report of HTM mutation of KRTHB6 gene in monilethrix cases of Indian origin and the first report of SNPs in the KRTHB1 gene in literature to our knowledge.
