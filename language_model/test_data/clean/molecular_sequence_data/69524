We describe a system to isolate 30S ribosomal subunits which contain targeted mutations in their 16S rRNA. The mutations of interest should be present in so-called specialized 30S subunits which have an anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence that is altered from 5' ACCUCC to 5' ACACAC. These plasmid-encoded specialized 30S subunits are separated from their chromosomally encoded wild-type counterparts by affinity chromatography that exploits the different Shine-Dalgarno complementarity. An oligonucleotide complementary to the 3' end of wild-type 16S rRNA and attached to a solid phase matrix retains the wild-type 30S subunits. The flow-through of the column contains close to 100% mutant 30S subunits. Toeprinting assays demonstrate that affinity column treatment does not cause significant loss of activity of the specialized particles in initiation complex formation, whereas elongation capacity as determined by poly(Phe) synthesis is only slightly decreased. The method described offers an advantage over total reconstitution from in vitro transcribed mutant 16S rRNA since our 30S subunits contain the naturally occurring base modifications in their 16S rRNA.
