We have isolated a POU domain-containing cDNA (ZFPOU1) from a cDNA library of zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio). The ZFPOU1 cDNA contained an open reading frame encoding a 425 amino acid peptide. The conserved POU domain was located near the carboxy terminus. The deduced amino acid sequence of the reading frame was most similar to that of the mouse class III POU-domain gene, Brain-1. Northern blot analysis revealed that the ZFPOU1 transcripts first appeared at the early neurula stage of embryogenesis and transiently increased thereafter. A significant level of expression, however, was not found in adult tissues except in the brain. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that the ZFPOU1 transcripts were localized in the neural tissues of embryos, but not in mesodermal, endodermal or ectodermal tissues. In adult zebrafish, the ZFPOU1 transcripts were detected in the restricted regions of the brain. Spatial and temporal expression patterns suggest that ZFPOU1 has distinct roles in the early neural development of zebrafish.
