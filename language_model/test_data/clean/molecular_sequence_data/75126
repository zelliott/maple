The bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) genome was analysed by Southern blot hybridization using the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) DNA polymerase gene as a probe. A 2.5 kilobase region which hybridized specifically to the HSV-1 DNA polymerase gene was identified within the Hind III G fragment at approximate map units 0.334-0.352. In order to provide further evidence that this is the location of the BHV-1 DNA polymerase gene, the 2.5 kilobase region was cloned and part of it sequenced. An uninterrupted stretch of over 800 nucleotides was obtained and an open reading frame spanning the entire sequence was identified. The amino acid sequence that it encodes shows striking homology to a region within the C-terminal half of other herpesvirus DNA polymerases.
