A cDNA library from amoebae of Physarum polycephalum was screened by differential hybridization. Two clones contained inserts for mRNAs present in amoebae and absent in plasmodia. The LAV3-4 cDNA encodes a 402 aa protein (ABP-46) that shows sequence similarity to the actin binding site in the N-terminal region of the alpha-actinin family. The LAV3-5 cDNA is 76% identical to the Dictyostelium actin bundling protein, which cross-links and stabilizes actin filaments in amoebal filopodia.
