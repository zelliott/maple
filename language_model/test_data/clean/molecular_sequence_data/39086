This study was performed to generate and evaluate recombinant antigens for use in a species-specific Chlamydia trachomatis immunoassay. In a molecular genetic approach, fragments of the C. trachomatis major outer-membrane protein (MOMP) were produced as fusion proteins to create three different constructs encompassing the variable domains I, II and IV of selected C. trachomatis serovars. The recombinant MOMP polyantigens were affinity-purified and used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody detection was evaluated with 103 patient sera and the results were compared with titres obtained in the micro-immunofluorescence test. The results showed that the generated MOMP polyantigens detected the presence of C. trachomatis-specific human antibodies with little cross-reaction to C. pneumoniae-specific antibodies. When compared to the micro-immunofluorescence assay the MOMP polyantigen detected the presence of anti-C. trachomatis IgG antibodies with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 91%.
