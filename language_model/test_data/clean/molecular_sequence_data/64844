Cell lines derived from polydnavirus-associated wasps should constitute a valuable tool for investigations of polydnavirus replication, but none is yet available. In this work, we describe the first cell lines, named Hd-AA, -AD, -BBA and -K, to have been established from the ichneumonid wasp Hyposoter didymator, associated with the polydnavirus H. didymator ichnovirus (HdIV). Southern blot analysis indicated that the viral DNA was present in all four cell lines and co-localized with high molecular mass DNA, probably the wasp chromosomes. Northern blot analysis of mRNAs extracted from the AA cell line showed transcription of some HdIV-encoded genes, although at low level. The effects of ecdysone treatment, HdIV re-infection and 42 degrees C heat-shock were analysed in the AA cell line. No effect was detected at the DNA (virus replication) or RNA (gene expression) levels, which may be due to the limitation of the present available tools.
