The O-specific polysaccharide (OPS) of Mesorhizobium loti mutant Mlo-13 was obtained by mild-acid degradation of the lipopolysaccharide and studied by sugar and ethylation analyses, Smith degradation, as well as (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy. The O-polysaccharide has a trisaccharide repeating unit composed of 6-deoxy-L-talose (L-6dTal), 4-O-acetyl-6-deoxy-L-talose (L-6dTal-4Ac) and L-rhamnose residues. An analysis of NMR spectra revealed that the rhamnose residue was substituted nonstoichiometrically with O-methyl group at C-3. The following structure of the repeating unit of the Mlo-13 OPS was established: [structure: see text].
