Western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) have been identified as the natural reservoir of the parasites that were the immediate precursor of Plasmodium falciparum infecting humans. Recently, a P. falciparum-like sequence was reported in a sample from a captive greater spot-nosed monkey (Cercopithecus nictitans), and was taken to indicate that this species may also be a natural reservoir for P. falciparum-related parasites. To test this hypothesis we screened blood samples from 292 wild C. nictitans monkeys that had been hunted for bushmeat in Cameroon. We detected Hepatocystis spp. in 49% of the samples, as well as one sequence from a clade of Plasmodium spp. previously found in birds, lizards and bats. However, none of the 292 wild C. nictitans harbored P. falciparum-like parasites.
