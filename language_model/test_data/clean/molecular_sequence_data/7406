The complete coding sequence of the rabbit galectin-3-encoding cDNA (LGALS3) has been cloned in a single step by using RT-PCR and specific human LGALS3 cDNA primers. The putative protein contains three domains with different degrees of homology to other known LGALS3. The homology is high in the C-terminal moiety corresponding to the carbohydrate-binding domain and is relatively low in the N-terminal moiety.
