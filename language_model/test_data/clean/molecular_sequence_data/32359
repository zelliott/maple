Six proteins, one null allele and 22 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G alleles were found in humans. Bonobo, chimpanzee and gorilla only show one allele and orangutan shows five alleles. All Cercopithecus alleles show stop codons at position 164 (Macaca mulatta with seven DNA alleles, Macaca fascicularis with seven DNA alleles and Cercopithecus aethiops with three DNA alleles). Cotton-top tamarin New World monkeys showed 20 DNA and protein alleles; the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-G New World sequences seem to be closer to MHC-E and lack typical MHC-G primates intron 2-specific deletion. This seems to suggest that MHC-G genes in New World primates are not orthologous and that their function may be similar to that of classical presenting MHC genes.
