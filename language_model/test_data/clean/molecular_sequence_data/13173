In summary, all three tachykinin receptors appear to be important modulators of physiological systems in the spinal cord. However, although there is a good deal of data concerning binding characteristics in peripheral tissues, work done in the spinal cord is scanty, leading to a number of unanswered questions. Firstly, Lui et al. (1993) have suggested a discrepancy between the location of SP binding sites and SP containing terminals. This might explain the conflicting evidence on the role of NK1 receptors in the dorsal horn. Furthermore, evidence that NK2 receptors are involved in nociception is increasing, however binding sites for these receptors in the spinal cord have not been demonstrated. This appears to be due to the difficulty in locating an ideal receptor specific ligand. The role of NK2 receptors in autonomic function is also unclear, perhaps for the same reason. Finally, there is evidence indicating that NK3 binding sites are increased following transection of the LIV-VI dorsal roots, however, studies on the effects of inflammation have not been done, as they have with the NK1 and NK2 receptors. All of these and many more unanswered questions require further investigation.
