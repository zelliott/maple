Twenty-four kinds of the acylated, amidated or esterified derivatives of N-acetylglucosaminyl (GlcNAc)-beta(1-->4)-N-acetylmuramyl (MurNAc)-L-alanyl (Ala)-D-isoglutaminyl (isoGln)-(L)-meso-2,6-diaminopimeric acid (A2pm)-(D)-amide (GMP3-A) which were prepared by chemical modifications of an enzymatic hydrolysate of Lactobacillus plantarum cell-wall peptidoglycans were examined for oral adjuvant activity by gastric intubation with bovine serum albumin (BSA) in liposomes into BALB/c mice. The gastric intubation of GlcNAc-beta(1-->4)-MurNAc-L-Ala-D-isoGln-(L)- stearoyl-(D)-meso-A2pm-(D)-amide-(L)-O-octyl, -nonyl and -dodecyl esters exhibited the most marked oral adjuvant activity in terms of enhanced production of serum anti-BSA IgG antibody. Some derivatives showed a less marked adjuvanticity and others were totally inactive. Thus the oral adjuvanticity of test lipophilic derivatives of GMP3-A in liposomes was dependent upon their chemical structure.
