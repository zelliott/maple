Phosphoramide mustard-induced DNA interstrand cross-links were studied both in vitro and by computer simulation. The local determinants for the formation of phosphoramide mustard-induced DNA interstrand cross-links were defined by using different pairs of synthetic oligonucleotide duplexes, each of which contained a single potentially cross-linkable site. Phosphoramide mustard was found to cross-link dG to dG at a 5'-d(GAC)-3'. The structural basis for the formation of this 1,3 cross-link was studied by molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry. Molecular dynamics indicated that the geometrical proximity of the binding sites also favored a 1,3 dG-to-dG linkage over a 1,2 dG-to-dG linkage in a 5'-d(GCC)-3' sequence. While the enthalpies of 1,2 and 1,3 mustard cross-linked DNA were found to be very close, a 1,3 structure was more flexible and may therefore be in a considerably higher entropic state.
