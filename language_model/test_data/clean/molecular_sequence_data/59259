An enrichment cloning method was evaluated for the isolation of microsatellite loci from eastern white pine and the resulting markers were examined for polymorphisms. A 200-fold enrichment was achieved for highly abundant (AC)n repeats, but for much less abundant (ACAG)n repeats an enrichment of only 20-fold was obtained. Using a single set of PCR conditions, 19 microsatellite loci were identified from 77 primer pairs evaluated. Genotyping of 16 (AC)n loci in 16 unrelated white pines from the north-central United States revealed an average of 5.4 alleles per locus and an average observed heterozygosity of 0.515. Five loci were scored among megagametophytes from a single pine to obtain a haploid genotype of the segregating female meiotic products. All loci segregated according to Mendelian expectations and linkage was established for two of the loci. It was concluded that (AC)n loci are highly variable in this species and that SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers can be efficiently developed for genome mapping and population genetics studies.
