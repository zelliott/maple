The nucleotide sequence of the promoter region and its flanking regions which span - 1855 to +2083 in the chicken cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene was determined. The transcription initiation site was located at 119 nucleotides downstream of the previously reported chicken kidney transcription initiation site of this gene. The nucleotide sequences of exons 1, 2, and 3 were highly homologous to the corresponding exons of the rat gene. Homology of the sequence - 1 to - 500 to that of rat gene was 52% and most of the hormone-responsive sequences in rat gene, such as the glucocorticoid-responsive region, were not conserved in the chicken gene, in accord with the species-specific responsiveness to starvation. In contrast, in the region of - 1 to - 300, some sequence motifs conserved both in the chicken and rat genes were found at essentially the same positions in the promoters. Such sequence motifs included a cAMP-responsive element (CRE), a nuclear factor-1 (NF-1/CTF)-binding site, and a hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (HNF-1)-binding site. Transient expression of the reporter luciferase gene ligated to the 3' end of this chicken sequence (-1855 to +7) was observed in a primary culture of chick hepatocytes when dibutyryl cyclic AMP was added to the culture medium.
