5-Aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) catalyzes the first step of the heme biosynthetic pathway in mammalian cells. Separate genes encode the two isoforms: ubiquitously expressed ALAS (ALAS1) and erythroid-specific ALAS (ALAS2). Transcription of the ALAS2 gene is only activated during erythroid cell differentiation. This stimulation allows for the formation of hemoglobin-specific heme. The 5'-flanking region of the mouse ALAS2 gene was studied in order to define its erythroid-specific function in transcriptional activation. Putative binding sites for the erythroid-specific nuclear factors GATA-1, NF-E2, and EKLF were identified within the first 300bp region of the mouse ALAS2 5'-flanking region. However, this 300bp region alone did not efficiently activate transient expression in erythroid MEL and K562 cell lines. Additional DNA regulatory sequences found within 300-718bp upstream of the transcription start site were required for maximal transcriptional activation, even though these regions stimulated similar expression in the non-erythroid HeLa and NIH/3T3 cells. This suggests that cis-acting elements present in the 5'-flanking region are not responsible for maintenance of transcriptional silencing in non-erythroid cell lines and that tissue-specific regulation of ALAS2 depends on other regions of the gene or on chromatin remodeling. A putative hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) response element was identified within the 300-718bp upstream region. Significantly, two proximal GATA-1-binding sites (-118/-113 and -98/-93) and a region located within -518 to -315bp of the mouse ALAS2 promoter were essential for transcriptional activation during chemically induced differentiation of MEL cells, implying their importance in conferring erythroid specificity to the ALAS2 transcriptional activation. This is the first study to delimit the cis-acting region responsible for activation of the ALAS2 promoter upon dimethyl-sulfoxide induction in MEL cells.
