PCR is a highly sensitive, convenient and rapid method for detection of viral DNA in fixed tissue samples which allows one to analyse the material from the pathology files, mainly biopsies. PCR in a fixed material requires larger amounts of DNA-polymerase and longer duration of every stage of thermo-cycles compared to PCR in the purified DNA samples.
