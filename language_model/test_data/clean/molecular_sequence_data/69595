The murine adenosine deaminase gene has a structurally archetypal TATAA-box-deficient G+C-rich promoter. The three Sp1 binding sites of the promoter are neither necessary nor sufficient for promoter function. Minimal basal promoter activity resides within a 48-bp element downstream of the Sp1 binding sites. This element shows an imperfect dyad symmetry around the promoter's major transcriptional initiation site and contains at least two nuclear protein binding sites. The distinctive sequence characteristics and nuclear protein binding locations of this element led us to propose a model for how such promoters may function.
