A study was made of the transposition of the mercury resistance transposon Tn5041 which, together with the closely related toluene degradation transposon Tn4651, forms a separate group in the Tn3 family. Transposition of Tn5041 was host-dependent: the element transposed in its original host Pseudomonas sp. KHP41 but not in P. aeruginosa PAO-R and Escherichia coli K12. Transposition of Tn5041 in these strains proved to be complemented by the transposase gene (tnpA) of Tn4651. The gene region determining the host dependence of Tn5041 transposition was localized with the use of a series of hybrid (Tn5041 x Tn4651) tnpA genes. Its location in the 5'-terminal one-third of the transposase gene is consistent with the data that this region is involved in the formation of the transposition complex in transposons of the Tn3 family. As in other transposons of this family, transposition of Tn5041 occurred via cointegrate formation, suggesting its replicative mechanism. However, neither of the putative resolution proteins encoded by Tn5041 resolved the cointegrates formed during transposition or an artificial cointegrate in E. coli K12. Similar data were obtained with the mercury resistance transposons isolated from environmental Pseudomonas strains and closely related to Tn5041 (Tn5041 subgroup).
