A halotolerant, round-endospore-forming, aerobic, Gram-positive bacterium, designated BH724(T), was isolated from a solar saltern at Taean in Korea. Cells of this strain were rod-shaped and found to be non-motile. Strain BH724(T) grew at salinities of 0-10 % (w/v) NaCl with an optimum of 3 % (w/v) NaCl and at temperatures of 15-50 degrees C with an optimum of 40 degrees C. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain BH724(T) belonged to the genus Bacillus and that Bacillus aquimaris TF-12(T), Bacillus marisflavi TF-11(T) and Bacillus vietnamensis JCM 11124(T) were its closest neighbours, sharing 97.3, 97.2 and 97.0 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, respectively. The genomic DNA G+C content was 39 mol% and the predominant menaquinone was MK-7. Its major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(16 : 0) and iso-C(14 : 0). The peptidoglycan type was A1alpha, linked directly through l-lysine. On the basis of morphological, chemotaxonomic, physiological and phylogenetic properties, strain BH724(T) represents a novel species of the genus Bacillus, for which the name Bacillus seohaeanensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is BH724(T) (=KCTC 3913(T)=DSM 16464(T)).
