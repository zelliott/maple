Prolactin was purified from chum salmon pituitaries. It was resolved into two variants by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. A cDNA library was prepared from Pacific chinook salmon pituitaries. Salmon prolactin gene was screened using a synthetic oligonucleotide based on partial protein sequence. A positive clone (PRL-10) was identified and sequenced. It is a full-size clone containing 1.1 kb and coding for a preprolactin of 211 amino acids. A modified prolactin plasmid (PRL-10A), in which the 5' untranslated sequence and the nucleotide sequence coding for the signal peptide of prolactin were deleted, was reconstructed into an expression vector using the heat-inducible lambda pL promotor. Mature prolactin, a single polypeptide of 22 kDa, was efficiently expressed in the bacteria at an elevated temperature.
