The characteristics and primary structure of AJL-1, one of the lectins in the skin mucus of the Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica), were examined. This lectin exhibited beta-galactoside specific activity in a Ca2+ independent manner. We previously reported that its molecular mass was 16,091Da, although it was approximately 30 kDa as determined by gel filtration, indicating that it is a homodimer having non-covalent bonds. This lectin was composed of 142 amino acid residues having no half-cystinyl residues, and showed homology to members of the galectin family, especially to proto-type galectins. Gene expression of this lectin was detected in skin only, and relative expression was high in an individual that exhibited resistance to infectious disease. AJL-1 showed agglutinating activity against pathogenic bacteria, Streptococcus difficile. This suggests that AJL-1 functions as an important defensive factor at the body surface.
