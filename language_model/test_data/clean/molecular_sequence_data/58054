The role of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in the cytotoxic action of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was examined. Recently, we described the characterization of TNF-resistant sublines isolated from TNF-sensitive cell line L929 (Hayakawa, M., Oku, N., Takagi, T., Hori, T., Shibamoto, S., Yamanaka, Y., Takeuchi, K., Tsujimoto, M., and Ito, F. (1991) Cell Struct. Funct. 16, 333-340). The most remarkable features of these TNF-resistant sublines were the defects in TNF-stimulated arachidonate metabolism. In this study, we characterized the PLA2 activities of these sublines and found a significant decrease in the activity in one of the TNF-resistant sublines, C12 cells. The enzymological features, such as Ca2+ requirement and substrate specificity, suggested that the high molecular weight arachidonoyl-selective cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) was involved in the TNF action. Northern hybridization analysis demonstrated the reduced expression of high molecular weight cPLA2 in C12 cells. Furthermore, expression of a cloned cPLA2 cDNA in C12 cells increased the sensitivity of cells to the TNF cytotoxicity. These results indicate the crucial role of the high molecular weight cPLA2 in the TNF-induced cytolysis.
