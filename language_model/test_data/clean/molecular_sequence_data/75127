The Escherichia coli aroE gene encoding shikimate dehydrogenase was sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence was confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and amino acid analysis of the overproduced protein. The complete polypeptide chain has 272 amino acid residues and has a calculated Mr of 29,380. E. coli shikimate dehydrogenase is homologous to the shikimate dehydrogenase domain of the fungal arom multifunctional enzymes and to the catabolic quinate dehydrogenase of Neurospora crassa.
