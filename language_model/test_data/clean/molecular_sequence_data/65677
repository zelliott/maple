In-gel digestion is commonly used after proteins are resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, 2-DE). It can also be used on its own in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for the direct analysis of complex proteins. Here, we describe a strategy combining isolation of purified plasma membrane, efficient digestion of plasma membrane proteins in polyacrylamide gel, and high-sensitivity analysis by advanced mass spectrometry to create a new rapid and high-throughput method. The plasma membrane protein mixture is directly incorporated into a polyacrylamide gel matrix, After formation of the gel, proteins in the gel section are digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides are subjected to reversed-phase, high-performance liquid chromatography followed by electrospray ion-trap tandem mass analysis. Using this optimized strategy, we have identified 883 rat liver membrane proteins, of which 490 had a gene ontology (GO) annotation indicating a cellular component, and 294 (60%) of the latter were known integral membrane proteins or membrane proteins. In total, 333 proteins are predicted by the TMHMM 2.0 algorithm to have transmembrane domains (TMDs) and 52% (175 of 333) proteins to contain 2-16 TMDs. The identified membrane proteins provide a broad representation of the rat plasma membrane proteome with little bias evident due to protein p I and molecular weight (MW). Also, membrane proteins with a high GRAVY score (grand average hydrophobicity score) were identified, and basic and acidic membrane proteins were evenly represented. This study not only offered an efficient and powerful method in shotgun proteomics for the identification of proteins of complex plasma membrane samples but also allowed in-depth study of liver membrane proteomes, such as of rat models of liver-related disease. This work represents one of the most comprehensive proteomic analyses of the membrane subproteome of rat liver plasma membrane in general.
