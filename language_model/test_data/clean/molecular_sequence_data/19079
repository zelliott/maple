Effects of NO3(-)/SO4(2-) ratio on denitrification and sulfate removal efficiency were investigated in model experiments applying haloalkaliphilic bioreactor. The reduction of both substrates performed well at different NO3(-)/SO4(2-) ratios ranging from 17.6 to l.5. The removal rates of nitrate and sulfate were 6 and 1.39kgm(-3)d(-1), respectively, at NO3(-)/SO4(2-) ratio 3.0, while sulfide concentration reached up to 703gm(-3). The major sulfate-reducing and denitrifying bacteria were Desulfonatronovibrio sp. and Halomonas campisalis, respectively. Decrease in NO3(-)/SO4(2-) ratio led to obvious changes in bacterial community. Although the sulfate reducers became dominant, the population of denitrifying ones also increased as it was demonstrated by analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA fragments, which suggested that SRB and DB coexisted well in bioreactor.
