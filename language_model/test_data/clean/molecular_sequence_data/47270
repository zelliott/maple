We describe here the isolation and characterization of a B-type DNA polymerase (PolB) from the archaeon Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum DeltaH. Uniquely, the catalytic domains of M. thermoautotrophicum PolB are encoded from two different genes, a feature that has not been observed as yet in other polymerases. The two genes were cloned, and the proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified individually and as a complex. We demonstrate that both polypeptides are needed to form the active polymerase. Similar to other polymerases constituting the B-type family, PolB possesses both polymerase and 3'-5' exonuclease activities. We found that a homolog of replication protein A from M. thermoautotrophicum inhibits the PolB activity. The inhibition of DNA synthesis by replication protein A from M. thermoautotrophicum can be relieved by the addition of M. thermoautotrophicum homologs of replication factor C and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. The possible roles of PolB in M. thermoautotrophicum replication are discussed.
