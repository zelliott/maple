Estrogen, which acts through estrogen receptors (ERs) alpha and beta, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of benign and malignant human prostatic tumors, i.e. benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer, thought to originate from different zones of the prostate [the transition zone (TZ) and peripheral zone (PZ), respectively]. Here, we examined the cellular distribution of ERalpha and ERbeta in human normal and hyperplastic prostate tissues, using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. ERalpha expression was restricted to stromal cells of PZ. In contrast, ERbeta was expressed in the stromal cells of PZ as well as TZ. ERbeta-positive epithelial cells were evenly distributed in PZ and TZ of the prostate. Our results suggest that estrogen may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia through ERbeta.
