Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are components of the immune system of both vertebrate and invertebrate animals. This study describes the isolation, primary structure, cDNA cloning, and tissue expression profile of two cysteine-rich AMPs from the hemolymph of the cattle tick Boophilus microplus. A 10,204 Da polypeptide, with six cysteine residues and no sequence similarity to any known molecule, was isolated from the cell-free hemolymph. Because of its sequence originality, this peptide was named microplusin. The second AMP was isolated from the hemocytes of B. microplus. This peptide, with a molecular mass of 4285 Da and six cysteines, is a defensin with similarity to the insect defensin family members. The cDNA cloning established that microplusin is synthesized as a prepeptide while the tick defensin is synthesized as a prepromolecule. Interestingly, despite the fact that microplusin and defensin have been isolated from different compartments, their gene expression was found to have similar tissue distribution.
