A Gram-positive-staining, facultatively anaerobic bacterial strain, CTT-37T, was isolated from a marine sediment sample collected from Tottori city, located on the shore of the Sea of Japan. A 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison indicated that the isolate represents a novel clade that clusters with members of the families Cellulomonadaceae and Sanguibacteraceae. Strain CTT-37T shared maximum 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 96.4% with Oerskovia paurometabola DSM 14281T and 96.2% with Oerskovia enterophila DSM 43852T. The DNA-DNA hybridization value between strain CTT-37T and O. enterophila JCM 7350T was 10-12%. The following chemotaxonomic characteristics of strain CTT-37T were markedly different from those of strains in the genus Oerskovia. The cell wall contained L-serine in the peptidoglycan interpeptide bridge. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9 (H4); other quinones detected were MK-9 and MK-9(H2). The only polar lipid was phosphatidylglycerol and the G+C content of the DNA was 70 mol%. Differences in phenotypic characteristics and large phylogenetic distances between strain CTT-37T and all members of the genus Oerskovia supported the classification of CTT-37T within a new genus and species, for which the name Paraoerskovia marina gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Paraoerskovia marina is CTT-37T (=NBRC 104352T=DSM 21750T).
