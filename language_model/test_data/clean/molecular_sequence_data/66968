P6 outer membrane protein is one of the candidates for a vaccine formulation against non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) infection. However, otitis-prone children who have recurrent episodes of acute otitis media due to NTHi fail to respond adequately to P6. An innovative approach to vaccination is therefore required to augment such children's immune response. To develop an effective peptide vaccine, we established P6-specific CD4(+) T-cell lines (TCLs) restricted by the human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR9 molecule, and revealed a human T-cell epitope on P6 and its core peptide sequence (p77-85; EYNIALGQR). Furthermore, we found that 3 analog peptides, E77D (the substitution of E at position 77 with D), N79G, and R85K, induced high proliferative responses as well as marked cytokine production when compared to the T-cell epitope peptide. These peptides may be candidates for a peptide vaccine formulation effective against NTHi infections, even in otitis-prone children.
