Lipophilic peptides and proteins present specific problems during preparation and analysis which require the use of modified methodology. This chapter discusses some of the methods that have been employed in the isolation and structural studies of the pulmonary surfactant-associated proteins B and C (SP-B and SP-C), other proteins with lipid-like physicochemical properties, and the SP-B precursor. In particular, methods for separation and analysis of peptide/lipid mixtures, high-resolution separation of lipopeptides, analysis of fatty acylated peptides, and secondary and tertiary structure analysis of lipopeptides are discussed.
