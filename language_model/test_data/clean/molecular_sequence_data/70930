Synthetic peptides reproducing the amino and carboxyl terminal region of CK2beta subunit have been analyzed for their ability to mimic different properties of full length beta subunit. Peptide beta[1-77], containing both the autophosphorylation site and the down-regulatory domain 55-64, is readily phosphorylated by alpha subunit whose activity is concomitantly inhibited. Such inhibition is accompanied by a weak interaction detectable by BIAcore sensograms but not by far Western blots, and is not reversed by polylysine which conversely overcome inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation by full length beta subunit. A strong interaction with alpha is observed with beta[155-215] but not with its shorter derivative beta[170-215] as judged from far Western blotting and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation analysis. Both peptides, however, affect the regular interaction between alpha and beta subunits altering the autophosphorylation pattern and responsiveness to salt. beta[155-215], unlike beta[170-215] tends to aggregate more readily than full length beta subunit. This behaviour which is reminiscent of the homodimerization of full length beta subunit, would indicate that tight self-association of beta[155-215] crucially depends on residues in the 155-170 sequence. Failure of beta[1-77] fragment to mediate responsiveness to polybasic peptides and accentuated self-association propensity of beta[155-215] suggest that other structural elements between the sequences 1-77 and 155-215 are required in order to confer optimal functionality to the beta subunit.
