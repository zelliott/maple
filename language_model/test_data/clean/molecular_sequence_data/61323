The sequence of the rpoB gene from Listeria monocytogenes was determined. Rifampin-resistant (Rif(r)) mutants arising from L. monocytogenes cultures exposed to rifampin were isolated, and by partial sequencing of their rpoB genes, seven different point mutations affecting five different amino acids (473Asp-->Asn or Gly, 479Gly-->Asp, 483His-->Tyr or Leu, 528Ile-->Phe, and 530Ser-->Tyr), which led to MICs of 0.5 to 100 microg/ml for the organisms, were determined. These mutants showed various deficiencies for growth at 42 degrees C, with only one being comparable to the wild-type strain. The interaction of these Rif(r) mutants with human Caco-2 cells was examined by using an immunofluorescence technique. Three mutants failed to interact, while three showed a reduced interaction compared to that of the wild type. It is believed that these pleiotropic phenotypes have arisen as a result of mutations within the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase holoenzyme.
