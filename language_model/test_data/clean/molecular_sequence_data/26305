The comparison of protective effects of native ceruloplasmin (CP) and of preparation CP1 containing carbohydrate fragment GlcNAc(beta(1,4]GlcNAc which specifically binds on RBC (alpha(1,6)Fuc receptors showed that CP1 exhibits much more powerful protective effect on RBC in copper-induced lysis. It was found, however, that CP2 (native CP devoided of CP1) protected RBC as well as CP despite its inability of binding to RBC membrane. CP and CP1 in a similar way decrease copper concentration in RBC. It was shown that copper accumulation and GSH decrease in RBC are two independent and concurrent processes; the copper and GSH concentrations are not the factors determining RBC resistance to hemolysis. CP inhibits the reaction of superoxide radicals generation as a result of Cu interaction with -SH groups of RBC membrane; the effect is more pronounced than the effect of catalase or superoxide dismutase. CP and CP1 preparations equally inhibit this reaction. Apparently CP reception on RBC leads not only to membrane protection from superoxide and hydroxyl radicals but represents a more complex process.
