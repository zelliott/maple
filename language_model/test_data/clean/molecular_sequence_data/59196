Immunization of C57BL/6 mice with AChR provokes symptoms similar to those seen in the disease myasthenia gravis. To elucidate the structural requirements for T cell recognition of AChR and to identify TcR features which might provide targets for immunotherapy, a panel of T cell hybridomas was generated after immunization of mice with the immunodominant peptide of the AChR alpha chain. The TcR genes expressed by these hybridomas were sequenced. TcR-V beta 6 was preferentially employed, but other V beta genes were also observed. A conserved acidic residue was present in all CDR3 regions, regardless of the V beta. The TcR-V alpha repertoire was somewhat skewed with three V alpha families accounting for 82% of the sequences. The utilization of multiple T cell receptor V beta genes may contribute to the inability to inhibit EAMG by elimination of V beta 6+ T cells.
