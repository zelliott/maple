The development of a sandwich enzyme immunoassay for rat retinol-binding protein using molecular biological techniques was described. Rat retinol-binding protein gene cloned by the PCR method was expressed by a fusion vector pEZZ18 in Escherichia coli strain HB101. A recombinant retinol-binding protein fused with IgG-binding domain ZZ of protein A was purified with IgG-Sepharose. Antibody against the recombinant protein was found to be specific to rat retinol-binding protein in plasma by immunoblot analysis. Affinity-purified anti-recombinant protein IgG was biotinylated and used for the sandwich enzyme immunoassay. In this assay, the measurable range is 1.9-60 ng/ml and the coefficients of variation within and between the assay series (assay range: 4-30 ng/ml) are 4.30 +/- 4.33 and 5.32 +/- 1.45%, respectively. Cross-reactivity of the immunoassay was examined using bovine, human, and mouse serum. There was a cross-reaction only with mouse serum. In an in vitro experiment, retinol-binding protein produced by rat hepatocytes could be measured by the sandwich enzyme immunoassay.
