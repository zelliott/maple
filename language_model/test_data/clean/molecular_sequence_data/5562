Twenty-four-hour-old, aerobically grown, Luria-Bertani broth cultures of Salmonella typhimurium F98 suppressed the growth of a spectinomycin-resistant (Spcr) derivative of the same strain inoculated at 10(3) CFU ml(-1). This growth suppression is genus specific and RpoS independent, and it is not solely a result of nutrient depletion (P. A. Barrow, M. A. Lovell, and L. Zhang-Barber, J. Bacteriol. 178:3072-3076, 1996). Mutations in three genes are shown here to significantly reduce growth suppression under these conditions. The mutations were located in the nuo, cyd, and unc operons, which code for the NADH dehydrogenase I, cytochrome d oxidase, and F0F1 proton-translocating ATPase complexes, respectively. When cultures were grown under strictly anaerobic conditions, only the unc mutant did not suppress growth. Prior colonization of the alimentary tract of newly hatched chickens with the S. typhimurium F98 wild type or nuo or cyd mutants suppressed colonization by an S. typhimurium F98 Spcr derivative inoculated 24 h later. In contrast, the S. typhimurium unc mutant did not suppress colonization. The nuo and unc mutants showed poorer growth on certain carbon sources. The data support the hypothesis that growth suppression operates because of the absence of a utilizable carbon source or electron acceptor.
