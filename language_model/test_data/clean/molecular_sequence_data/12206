This paper is devoted to an analysis of the intrinsic structure of the gene from the point of view of the redundancy of different structural units--exons and introns. Human genes for which the exon-intron structure has been clearly established were studied. The redundancy of each exon and intron in the gene was determined. It was shown that, in human genes, introns are more redundant than exons. Redundancy is determined as the smallest length of a word (oligonucleotide) beginning with which all words in the studied nucleotide sequence are found exactly once. Mechanisms leading to the disruption of the general pattern of ratios of redundancy of exons and introns are studied.
