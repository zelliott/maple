A 650-bp portion of the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region was sequenced in 47 species of Pinus, representing all recognized subsections of the genus, and 2 species of Picea and Cathaya as outgroups. Parsimony analyses of these length variable sequences were conducted using a manual alignment, 13 different automated alignments, elision of the automated alignments, and exclusion of all alignment ambiguous sites. High and moderately supported clades were consistently resolved across the different analyses, while poorly supported clades were inconsistently recovered. Comparison of the topologies highlights taxa of particularly problematic placement including Pinus nelsonii and P. aristata. Within subgenus Pinus, there is moderate support for the monophyly of a narrowly circumscribed subsect. Pinus (=subsect. Sylvestres) and strong support for a clade of North and Central American hard pines. The Himalayan P. roxburghii may be sister species to these "New World hard pines," which have two well-supported subgroups, subsect. Ponderosae and a clade of the remaining five subsections. The position of subsect. Contortae conflicts with its placement in a chloroplast DNA restriction site study. Within subgenus Strobus there is consistent support for the monophyly of a broadly circumscribed subsect. Strobi (including P. krempfii and a polyphyletic subsect. Cembrae) derived from a paraphyletic grade of the remaining soft pines. Relationships among subsects. Gerardianae, Cembroides, and Balfourianae are poorly resolved. Support for the monophyly of subgenus Pinus and subgenus Strobus is not consistently obtained.
