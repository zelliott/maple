We report a discovery that, of the 226 C2H2 zinc-finger (C2H2-ZNF) genes on human chromosome 19, 12 genes each have two open reading frames (ORFs) that are in different reading frames but that can be translated into the same type of C2H2-ZNF proteins. We came to this observation after using standard tools in an original manner. First, we found that the both ORFs of such a gene contained the same type of significant C2H2-ZNF domain with e-values of e-2 or better. Second, the both ORFs had a promoter, a transcription start site, a start codon, a Kozak pattern and a poly(A) site; hence, each of them can be viewed as a gene in terms of a gene's primary structure. Third, both the ORFs matched not only human C2H2-ZNF expressed sequence tags (ESTs) but also human C2H2-ZNF proteins with e-values of e-50 or better. This indicates that the both ORFs can be transcribed and translated into the same zinc-finger proteins. More importantly, we observed that the phenomenon-a DNA can be translated into the same type of proteins after a frameshift-also occurred in a set of 160 human C2H2-ZNF ESTs and in a set of nine cDNAs of human C2H2-ZNF proteins. This observation based on the two sets of wet-experimental data much strengthened our confidence on the discovery. Our discovery is useful in the deeper understanding of a gene's regulatory mechanism to maintain its function.
