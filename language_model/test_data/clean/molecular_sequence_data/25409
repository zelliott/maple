Near-full length complementary DNA (cDNA) clones encoding turkey growth hormone (GH) have been isolated from a pituitary library. The longer of the two turkey GH cDNA clones that were sequenced is 803 base pairs (bp) in length and contains 41 nucleotides of the 5'-untranslated region (UTR), an open reading frame of 648 bp that encodes a 25 amino acid leader polypeptide segment as well as a 191 amino acid mature turkey GH protein, and a 3'-UTR that is 92 bp long followed by a 22 bp poly A tract. Comparison of the turkey GH nucleotide sequence to that of other avian GH clones shows the coding region to be greater than 93% homologous while the homology to mammalian GH sequences is between 68 and 78%. Northern blot analysis showed an approximate 800 bp turkey GH processed mRNA transcript that hybridized to the turkey GH cDNA probe. A large up-regulation of turkey GH transcription occurred when intact cultured pituitaries were treated with 1 nM human growth hormone releasing hormone but only modest changes were observed when cultures were treated with thyroid releasing hormone or somatostatin.
