Physical mapping of human chromosomes at a resolution of 100 kb to 1 Mb will provide important reagents for gene identification and framework templates for ultimately determining the complete DNA sequence. Sequence-tagged site (STS) content mapping, coupled with large fragment cloning in yeast artificial chromosomes, provides an efficient mechanism for producing first-generation, low-resolution maps of human chromosomes. Previously, we produced a set of standardized STSs for human chromosome 11 regionally localized by fluorescence in situ hybridization or somatic cell hybrid analysis. In this paper, we used these as well as other STS content, and identify 109 islands spanning an estimated 218 Mb on the 126-Mb chromosome. Since about 62% of the islands contain markers ordered on chromosome 11 by genetic or radiation hybrid analysis, this data set represents a first-order approximation of a physical map of human chromosome 11. This set of clones, contigs, and associated STSs will provide the material for the production of a continuous overlapping set of YACs as well for high-resolution physical mapping based upon sampled and complete DNA sequencing.
