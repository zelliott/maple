In Vibrio alginolyticus, the flagellar motor can rotate at a remarkably high speed, ca. three to four times faster than the Escherichia coli or Salmonella motor. Here, we found a Vibrio-specific protein, FlgT, in the purified flagellar basal body fraction. Defects of FlgT resulted in partial Fla⁻ and Mot⁻ phenotypes, suggesting that FlgT is involved in formation of the flagellar structure and generating flagellar rotation. Electron microscopic observation of the basal body of ΔflgT cells revealed a smaller LP ring structure compared to the wild type, and most of the T ring was lost. His₆-tagged FlgT could be coisolated with MotY, the T-ring component, suggesting that FlgT may interact with the T ring composed of MotX and MotY. From these lines of evidence, we conclude that FlgT associates with the basal body and is responsible to form an outer ring of the LP ring, named the H ring, which can be distinguished from the LP ring formed by FlgH and FlgI. Vibrio-specific structures, e.g., the T ring and H ring might contribute the more robust motor structure compared to that of E. coli and Salmonella.
