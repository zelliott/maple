Six related polyoxypregnane glycosides were isolated and characterised from Caralluma retrospiciens leaves. The compounds were identified as 12beta-benzoyloxy-8beta,14beta-dihydroxypregn-20-one-3-O-[3-O-methyl-6-deoxy-beta-D-allopyranosyl-(1 --> 4)-beta-D-cymaropyranosyl-(1 --> 4)-]-beta-D-cymaropyranoside], 12beta-benzoyloxy-8beta,14beta-dihydroxypregn-20-one-3-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 --> 4)-3-O-methyl-6-deoxy-beta-D-allopyranosyl-(1 --> 4)-beta-D-cymaropyranosyl-(1 --> 4)-beta-D-cymaropyranoside], 12beta-benzoyloxy-8beta,14beta-dihydroxypregn-20-one-3-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 --> 4)-3-O-methyl-6-deoxy-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 --> 4)-3-O-methyl-6-deoxy-beta-D-galactopyranoside], 12beta-benzoyloxy-8beta,14beta-dihydroxypregn-20-one-3-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 --> 6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 --> 4)-3-O-methyl-6-deoxy-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 --> 4)-3-O-methyl-6-deoxy-beta-D-galactopyranoside], 12beta-benzoyloxy-11alpha-isovaleroyloxy-8beta,14beta-dihydroxypregn-20-one-3-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 --> 4)-3-O-methyl-6-deoxy-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 --> 4)-3-O-methyl-6-deoxy-beta-D-galactopyranoside], and 12beta-benzoyloxy-11alpha-isovaleroyloxy-8beta,14beta-dihydroxypregn-20-one-3-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl (1 --> 4)-3-O-methyl-6-deoxy-beta-D-allopyranosyl-(1 --> 4)-beta-D-cymaropyranosyl-(1 --> 4)-beta-D-cymaropyranoside]. The structures were determined by detailed analysis of one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra as well as by chemical means. The compounds showed cytotoxic activities towards brine shrimp having IC50 values of 1.19 x 10(-4), 8.83 x 10(-5), 2.64 x 10(-4), 2.26 x 10(-4), 2.39 x 10(-4) and 1.70 x 10(-4) M, respectively. This is the first report of the isolation of these compounds from a natural source.
