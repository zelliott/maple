A fully automated instrument for multiple simultaneous peptide synthesis was constructed to provide large numbers of peptides for immunological research. The synthesis is performed in a flow-through mode with the conventional solid supports contained in 48 individual reaction columns. The instrument is based on a commercial autosampler equipped with a motor-driven syringe for accurate delivery of reagents and a robot arm carrying a dispenser needle. Dedicated software was developed to compile overlapping peptides from a given protein sequence and to control all functions of the robot. In situ activation by BOP was chosen as the optimized chemistry protocol. The peptides are cleaved from the resin in the reactors used for synthesis, thus minimizing handling. Performance of the instrument was demonstrated by synthesis of overlapping 14-mer peptides derived from the sequence of HIV reversed transcriptase. A second mode of operation allows the synthesis to be carried out on the surface of polyethylene pins. Peptides derived from the sequence of human TNF were synthesized using this method and used to characterize antibodies raised against the intact protein.
