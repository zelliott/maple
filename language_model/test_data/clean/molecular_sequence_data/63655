RING finger proteins are zinc finger proteins containing the RING motifs. They act mainly as E3 ubiquitin ligases, bind the ubiquitin E2 conjugating enzyme and promote degradation of targeted proteins, Many novel genes have been isolated and differentially expressed in human adult and embryo testis by a testis cDNA-array differential display technique. A novel RING finger cDNA is highly expressed in adult testis and at low level in fetal testis. It was named Spg2. It contains a 2055 nucleotide ORF, encodes a 685-amino-acid RNF6 protein, and has a RING finger in its C terminal. NCBI Blast shows that the gene is located on chromosome 13 and contains five exons. A multiple tissue expression profile also indicates that it is highly expressed in human testis, so we speculate that it may be associated with human spermatogenesis by virtue of the action of its RING domain.
