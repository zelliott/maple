A ferric uptake regulatory gene (fur) was cloned from Vibrio parahaemolyticus WP1 by a polymerase chain reaction-based technique followed by functional complementation of a fur mutation in Escherichia coli. A sequence analysis showed that, at the amino acid level, the V. parahaemolyticus Fur protein is 81% identical with the Fur protein from E. coli and over 90% identical with those of the Vibrio species.
