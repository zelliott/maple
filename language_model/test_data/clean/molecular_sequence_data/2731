A secretory expression system for Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI) was established in a heterologous host, Streptomyces lividans 66, by introducing the 1.8-kbp BglII/SalI fragment containing SSI gene into the Streptomyces multicopy vector, pIJ 702. The expression of SSI did not depend on the orientation of the 1.8-kbp BglII/SalI fragment or on the promoter for tyrosinase gene (mel) in pIJ 702, which suggested that this fragment also carries the SSI promoter. The expressed SSI in S.lividans 66 was secreted into the culture medium in a large amount, as observed with the original strain, S. albogriseolus S-3253. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that the SSI secreted from S. lividans 66 contained three additional amino acid residues in the NH2-terminal region. The inhibitory activity toward subtilisin BPN' and the antigenic activity of the SSI secreted from S. lividans 66 were found to be identical with those of authentic SSI.
