Translation of the open reading frame 2 (ORF-2) of the human respiratory syncytial virus M2 gene initiates at one of the three initiation codons located upstream of the termination codon for the first ORF. Replacement of ORF-2 with the major ORF of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene followed by systematic mutagenesis of the putative initiation codons demonstrated the usage of these codons as the translational initiators for ORF-2 expression both in vitro and in vivo. While the efficiency of translation was maintained when only the first and second AUG codons were preserved in vivo, there was no apparent preference in vitro for any of the three codons when only one was present. Mutagenesis studies showed that the location of the termination codon of ORF-1 protein plays a crucial role in directing translation of ORF-2 from the upstream initiation codons in vivo. This indicates that the second ORF is accessed by the ribosomes that are departing from the first ORF and that these ribosomes reinitiate on AUG codons 5' to the point of translation termination.
