The cDNA synthesized from mRNA of Dirofilaria immitis female adult worms was cloned into the expression vector lambda gt11. Screening the library with a hyperimmune rabbit antiserum raised against adult worm homogenates yielded several antigen positive clones. One of these clones, lambda cDi2, was recognized by rabbit antisera raised against either D. immitis L-3, adult, Brugia malayi L-3 or Onchocerca volvulus adult worm antigen, as well as by antisera from humans naturally infected with O. volvulus or Wuchereria bancrofti. Affinity-purified anti-lambda cDi2 antibodies reacted with a 97-kDa protein on Western transfers of adult D. immitis antigen extracts that were reduced with beta-mercaptoethanol. The whole rabbit anti-D. immitis adult antiserum depleted of anti-lambda cDi2 antibodies exhibited decreased reactivity to this 97-kDa band. A monoclonal antibody (IA6) that specifically binds Schistosoma mansoni paramyosin also recognised a 97-kDa protein in D. immitis extracts upon Western transfer. The deduced amino acid sequence of partial DNA sequence from lambda cDi2 showed some similarity to nematode myosin, and gave a stretch of 82 amino acids that is 91.5% identical to Caenorhabditis elegans paramyosin: thus, lambda cDi2 encodes D. immitis paramyosin.
