The transforming region of the genome of herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) encodes a peptide that raises the mutation frequency of cells. To find the effect of this peptide on cell phenotype, three types of cells were transfected with a shuttle vector plasmid that expressed the peptide. When immortalised rat fibroblasts were transfected they rapidly became anchorage-independent with high efficiency, but were not tumorigenic in nude mice. When monkey kidney cells were transfected, five clonal cell lines were isolated, of which one became anchorage-independent but was not tumorigenic in nude mice. When human oral keratinocytes were transfected they did not become immortalised. The peptide therefore induced some of the features of transformation in different cell types, but did not induce a malignant phenotype in any cell. This suggests that interaction with co-factors would be necessary for the peptide to contribute to the development of oral cancer.
