Using low-stringency Southern blot analysis and cloning in lambda bacteriophage, two new human papillomavirus types (HPV-43 and HPV-44) were identified and their DNAs were cloned from vulvar tissues. The isolates were characterized by restriction endonuclease mapping and shown to be new HPV types on the basis of their minimal hybridization with all other known HPV types at high stringency. Both HPVs are most closely related to types 6, 11, and 13. HPV-43 did not exhibit any cross-reactivity with these HPV types at high stringency. HPV-44 showed minimal cross-reactivity to HPV-13, which was in the range of 20 to 25% according to liquid hybridization analysis. The deduced genomic organization of each of the two new HPVs was colinear with HPV-6b. Prevalence studies revealed that HPV-43 and HPV-44 together were found in 6 of 439 normal cervical tissues, in 8 of 195 cervical intraepithelial neoplasms, but in none of 56 cervical cancers tested thus far.
