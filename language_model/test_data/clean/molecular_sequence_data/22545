A multiplex PCR was developed for simultaneous detection of the cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) genes of Campylobacter jejuni. Three primer pairs targeting each one of the cdtA, cdtB and cdtC genes were designed and combined in the same PCR reaction. The assay was evaluated with 100 C. jejuni strains recovered from humans and animals and it was found to be rapid and specific. Two isolates presented several deletions affecting both cdtA and cdtB genes. High prevalence (98%) of the three cdt genes was found among isolates of different geographic origins.
