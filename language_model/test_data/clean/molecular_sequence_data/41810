A computer program, SUBCUR, is described which permits analysis and rapid identification of geometrical differences and patterns of variance between two DNA duplexes. The program is compatible with the CURVES 3.1 package and allows graphical visualization of the structural differences. Examples are provided which illustrate the applicability of the program in analyzing the different backbone conformations of two helices and the different curvatures of two helices.
