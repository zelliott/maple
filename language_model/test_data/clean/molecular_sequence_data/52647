Tissue-specific expression patterns of petunia zinc-finger genes, ZPT2-10 and ZPT3-3, were analyzed by using GUS reporter system. The GUS expression directed by ZPT2-10 promoter was specifically found in the stylar transmitting tissue of pistil, and that by ZPT3-3 promoter in stigmatic and stylar transmitting tissues. These tissues play important roles in reproductive process. We discuss possible roles of the zinc-finger proteins in these specialized tissues.
