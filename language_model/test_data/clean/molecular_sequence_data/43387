We have purified 13 large subunit proteins of the mitochondrial ribosome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and determined their partial amino acid sequences. To elucidate the structure and function of these proteins, we searched for their genes by comparing our sequence data with those deduced from the genomic nucleotide sequence data of S. cerevisiae and analyzed them. In addition, we searched for the genes encoding proteins whose N-terminal amino acid sequences we have reported previously [Grohmann, L., Graack, H.-R., Kruft, V., Choli, T., Goldschmidt-Reisin, S. & Kitakawa, M. (1991) FEBS Lett. 284, 51-56]. Thus, we were able to identify and characterize 12 new genes for large subunit proteins of the yeast mitochondrial ribosome. Furthermore, we determined the N-terminal amino acid sequences of seven small subunit proteins and subsequently identified the genes for five of them, three of which were found to be new.
