Hydroxylamine oxidation was measured in four recently isolated heterotrophic nitrate-reducing bacteria belonging to the genera Pseudomonas, Moraxella, Arthrobacter and Aeromonas. A hydroxylamine-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity was detected in periplasmic fractions of the Pseudomonas and Aeromonas spp. and in total soluble fractions of the Arthrobacter sp. A monomeric 19-kDa non-haem iron hydroxylamine-cytochrome c oxidoreductase was purified from the Pseudomonas species and shown to be similar to hydroxylamine-cytochrome c oxidoreductase of Paracoccus denitrificans.
