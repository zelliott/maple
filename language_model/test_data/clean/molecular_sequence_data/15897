The gene for Saccharomyces cerevisiae inorganic pyrophosphatase, PPA, has been cloned by hybridization of "long" oligonucleotide probes with both cDNA and genomic S. cerevisiae libraries. The nucleotide sequence of 1612 bp from a genomic subclone that includes the entire coding region gives a deduced amino acid sequence that has nine differences (out of a total of 286 residues) from the previously published amino acid sequence that was determined directly. The codon usage in PPA is as expected for a "highly expressed" yeast gene. The upstream region contains a poly dA/dT sequence that might comprise a constitutive promoter. The PPA gene appears to be present in a single copy within the S. cerevisiae genome and has been localized to chromosome II.
