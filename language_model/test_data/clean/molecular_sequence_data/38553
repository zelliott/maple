Microbial and plant secondary metabolites were screened for compounds that are selectively cytotoxic to mutant p53-expressing mouse fibroblasts. As a result, furcreastatin, a novel steroidal saponin, was isolated from an EtOH extract of the leaves of Furcraea foetida. Furcreastatin consisted of hecogenin as the aglycone and a hexasaccharide containing D-galactose, L-rhamnose and four D-glucose residues. The structure was determined to be (3 beta,5 alpha,25R)- 3-hydroxyspirostan-12-one 3-O-[alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1-->3)-¿beta-D-Glcp-(1-->3) -beta-D- Glcp-(1-->2)¿-beta-D-Glcp-(1-->4)-beta-D-Galp] by extensive NMR spectroscopic studies. Furcreastatin decreased the viability of mutant p53-over-expressing cells with an ED50 of 4.0 micrograms/mL, and decreased that of the parental cell-line with an ED50 of 9.6 micrograms/mL.
