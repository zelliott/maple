RNA from IdUrd-treated P3HR1 cells was used for the construction of a cDNA library and screened with B95-8 EBV DNA BamHI fragment B and G probes. One clone, BG9, containing a 1.7 kb cDNA insert was further studied. Complete DNA sequence analysis revealed that BG9 encompassed the B95-8 EBV DNA sequences from nucleotide 120,747 to nucleotide 122,412 and corresponded to the BGLF5 open reading frame of the EBV DNase gene. Comparison of the sequences of BG9 with that of published B95-8 EBV DNA indicated that there were 14 different bases which results in 7 amino acid residue changes. The product of in vitro transcription/translation of a subclone, pGEM-BG9, contained the EBV DNase activity and a 52 kDa protein was immunoprecipitated from the in vitro translation products using serum from a patient with nasopharyngeal carcinoma which contained a high level of anti-DNase activity. Northern hybridization of P3HR1 RNA with the BG9 probe revealed a complex pattern of transcription in this region. Subgenomic DNA fragments were then used to map these RNA species to the B95-8 EBV DNA sequence. The result of S1 nuclease analysis indicated that a DNase ORF containing transcript sized 2.0 kb is initiated at nucleotide 122,435 +/- 1 and terminated at nucleotide 120,741 of the EBV genome.
