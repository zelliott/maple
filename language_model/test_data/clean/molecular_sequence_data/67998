The antigenic, pathogenic and molecular characteristics of Turkish sheep encephalitis (TSE) virus, strain TTE80, were compared with other members of the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus complex. Monoclonal antibodies with defined specificity for the flavivirus envelope glycoprotein distinguished TSE virus from louping ill (LI), western or far eastern TBE, Langat and Powassan virus in indirect immunofluorescence, haemagglutination-inhibition and neutralization tests. On the other hand, TSE virus, which produces an LI-like disease in sheep, resembled LI virus in mouse neurovirulence tests. Molecular homology data of all the structural genes of TSE virus compared with other tick-borne flaviviruses demonstrated that TSE virus is a distinct member in the TBE virus subgroup. The data are consistent with the conclusion that TSE virus has evolved by a separate evolutionary pathway as compared with the close antigenic relatives, western European, far eastern TBE viruses and LI virus. By aligning the encoded amino acids in the viral envelope glycoprotein of mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses, we have also identified subgroup-specific pentapeptide motifs for the tick-borne encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis and dengue subgroup viruses of the genus Flavivirus. These pentapeptides have important implications for the evolution, classification and diagnosis of flaviviruses.
