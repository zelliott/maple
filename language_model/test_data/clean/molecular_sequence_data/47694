Differential DNA methylation of the parental alleles has been implicated in the establishment and maintenance of the monoallelic expression of imprinted genes. H19 and IGF2 are oppositely imprinted with only the maternal and the paternal alleles expressed, respectively. In Wilms tumor, a childhood renal neoplasm, loss of the H19/IGF2 imprinted expression pattern results in silencing of H19 and biallelic expression of IGF2. This was shown to be associated with biallelic methylation of the H19 promoter in the tumor and the adjacent kidney tissue suggesting that epigenetic H19 silencing is an early event in Wilms tumorigenesis. An imprinting mark region characterized by paternal allele-specific methylation has been suggested to reside in a GC-rich region of 400-base pair direct repeats starting at -2 kilobase pairs (kb) relative to the H19 transcription start and extending upstream. The upstream boundary of the potential paternal methylation imprint of the H19 gene has yet to be defined. We sought to define this upstream imprint boundary and investigate whether Wilms tumors with loss of imprinting are biallelically methylated in this imprinting mark region. The analysis of 6.6 kb of new upstream H19 sequence determined in this study identified a series of the direct 400-base pair repeats that extends to approximately -5.3 kb relative to the transcription start. DNA methylation analyses indicated that the upstream boundary of the potential imprint may coincide with the 5' end of the direct repeats. We found that Wilms tumors with loss of imprinting are biallelically methylated in the H19 upstream repeat region, and we suggest that pathological methylation in this region is the epigenetic error that initiates H19 silencing.
