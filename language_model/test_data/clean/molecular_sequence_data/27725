An 800 bp fragment of Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus genomic DNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction method using primers designed from conserved regions of the V-type H+ ATPase regulatory subunits from the archaebacterium Sulfolobus, and several eukaryotes. Although more than one product was obtained, only one of them had the expected size and was exclusively amplified in the presence of the left and right primers. The DNA and the deduced protein sequences of the putative Methanococcus H+ ATPase subunit revealed homology to the corresponding sequences in Sulfolobus and eukaryotes (about 60% identical residues) and a less evident homology to the eubacterial F1-ATPase alpha-subunit (22% identical residues with E. coli).
