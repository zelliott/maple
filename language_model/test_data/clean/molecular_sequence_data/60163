For interpretation of intraspecific polymorphism and the considerable differences in the size of mtDNAs among three groups of A. carbonarius, restriction maps were constructed from several enzymes. Functional maps were also developed to compare genome organisations and gene content. The appearance of various mtDNAs of A. carbonarius strains are different in size, but their gene content is almost identical. The 1.1 kb size difference between two closely related subgroups (1a, 1b) can be attributed to the presence or absence of an intron in cox2 gene. This phenomenon demonstrates that the migration of introns is possibly responsible for the development of variable mitochondrial genomes in nature. The striking differences in size and restriction patterns between two main mtDNA groups might derive from both the intronal variations and the altered intergenic organisation.
