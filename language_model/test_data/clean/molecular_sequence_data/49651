Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) ORF45 is encoded by an immediate-early gene in the KSHV genome. This protein was recently shown to interact with interferon regulatory factor 7 and inhibit virus-mediated alpha/beta interferon induction (Zhu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99:5573-5578, 2002). ORF45 was characterized as a phosphorylated protein, and it is localized in the cytoplasm of infected cells. In this report, we provide evidence that ORF45 is associated with KSHV virions. (i) ORF45 was detected in gradient-purified virions by Western blotting along with known structural proteins of KSHV including gB, K8.1, and major capsid protein. In contrast, ORF50/Rta, K8alpha, and ORF59/PF8 were not detected in the same virion preparation. (ii) ORF45 comigrates with KSHV virions in sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. (iii) Virion-associated ORF45 was resistant to trypsin digestion but became sensitive after the virions were treated with detergent which destroys the viral envelope. (iv) ORF45 remained associated with tegument-nucleocapsid complex when virion-specific glycoproteins were removed after detergent treatment. (v) An ORF45 protein band was visualized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of extensively purified KSHV virions and identified by mass spectrometry. (vi) By immunoelectron microscopy, virus-like structures were specifically stained by anti-ORF45 antibody. Based on the evidence, we conclude that ORF45 is associated with purified KSHV virions and appears to be a tegument protein. The presence of ORF45 in KSHV virions raised the possibility that this protein may be delivered to host cells at the start of infection and therefore have the opportunity to act at the very early stage of the infection, suggesting an important role of ORF45 in KSHV primary infection.
