Thirteen orf virus isolates obtained during the time period between 1995 and 2004 from crusted scab lesions of nine sheep and four goats from different geographical areas of Greece and Italy with suspected contagious ecthyma infection were analyzed. DNA of all isolates was successfully amplified by PCR with the primers 045F-045R and identified them as parapox virus. Partial DNA sequence of orf virus interferon resistant (VIR) gene, phylogenetic analysis of the available isolates and amino acid comparison of the interferon resistance protein encoded by this genomic region was carried out. According to the results of the present report a precise characterisation of the genomic region studied might provide evidence for the genetic variation and movement of the circulating orf virus strains.
