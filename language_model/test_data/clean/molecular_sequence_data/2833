The structures of the rearranged genomic segment 11 of two spontaneous swine rotavirus strains were determined. We found that the rearrangements involved the duplication of normal segment 11 in a head-to-tail orientation, and partial deletions in both monomers. The open reading frame for VP11, the protein encoded by normal segment 11, was maintained. We also showed that the two rearranged genes were transcribed into RNA molecules of the same length as their corresponding genomic segments.
