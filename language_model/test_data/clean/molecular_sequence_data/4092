Expression of higher plant mitochondrial (mt) genes is regulated at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and translational levels, but the vast majority of the mtDNA and RNA-binding proteins involved remain to be identified. Plant mt single-stranded nucleic acid-binding proteins were purified by affinity chromatography, and corresponding genes have been identified. A majority of these proteins belong to a family of RNA-binding proteins characterized by the presence of an N-terminal RNA-recognition motif (RRM) sequence. They diverge in their C-terminal sequences, suggesting that they can be involved in different plant mt regulation processes. Mitochondrial localization of the proteins was confirmed both in vitro and in vivo and by immunolocalization. Binding experiments showed that several proteins have a preference for poly(U)-rich sequences. This mt protein family contains the ubiquitous RRM motif and has no known mt counterpart in non-plant species. Phylogenetic and functional analysis suggest a common ancestor with RNA-binding glycine-rich proteins (GRP), a family of developmentally regulated proteins of unknown function. As with several plant, cyanobacteria, and animal proteins that have similar structures, the expression of one of the Arabidopsis thaliana mt RNA-binding protein genes is induced by low temperatures.
