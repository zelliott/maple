We have isolated a cosmid clone that contains GUSB, the human gene encoding beta-glucuronidase. The 21-kb gene contains 12 exons ranging from 85 to 376 bp in length. Exon 6 corresponds to the 153-bp deletion in the shorter of two types of cDNAs reported earlier, supporting the hypothesis that this cDNA arose by alternate splicing leading to exon skipping. The insert contains 4.2 kb of sequence upstream from the first exon and 6 kb 3' of the last exon. The clone expresses human beta-glucuronidase in stably transformed rat XCtk- cells. Comparison of the human gene organization with that recently reported for the murine beta-glucuronidase gene revealed that the intron/exon boundaries are identical. In the splice junctions, the most highly conserved regions are those identified as consensus sequences, and these are at least as highly conserved as bases encoding the translated portion of the gene.
