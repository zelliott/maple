Pediocin PA-1 production, immunity and secretion are specified by a cluster of four genes in Pediococcus acidilactici PAC1.0. The production by, secretion of, and immunity to lactococcin A of Lactococcus lactis are also determined by four genes. Here, expression of the pediocin operon in Lactococcus lactis is reported, which could only be achieved by placing it under control of a lactococcal promoter. Expression of the lactococcin A operon in Pediococcus is also described: recombinant clones of Pediococcus were obtained that produced and secreted both active pediocin PA-1 and lactococcin A.
