Wood decomposition is an important component in forest ecosystems but information about the diversity of fungi causing decay is lacking. This is especially true for the temperate rain forests in Chile. These investigations show results of a biodiversity study of white-rot fungi in wood obtained from Chilo√© National Park in Los Lagos region, Chile. Culturing from white-rotted wood followed by sequencing of the complete internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) or partial large subunit region of the rDNA, identified 12 different species in the Basidiomycota. All of these fungi were characterized as white rot fungi and were identified with a BLAST match of 97 % or greater to sequences in the GenBank database. Fungi obtained were species of Phlebia, Mycoacia, Hyphodontia, Bjerkandera, Phanerochaete, Stereum, Trametes, and Ceriporiopsis. This report identifies for the first time in Chile the species Ceriporiopsis subvermispora, Hyphodontia radula, Phlebia radiata, Phanerochaete affinis, Peniophora cinerea, Stereum gausapatum, Phlebia setulosa and Phanerochaete sordida. Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize the type of decay caused by the fungi that were isolated and a combination of selective lignin degraders and simultaneous white rot fungi were found. Fungi that cause a selective degradation of lignin are of interest for bioprocessing technologies that require modification or degradation of lignin without cellulose removal.
