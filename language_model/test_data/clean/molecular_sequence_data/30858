The sequence of 1,973 nucleotides encompassing the region at and directly adjacent to the CysB-dependent promoter controlling expression and synthesis of the sulfate-thiosulfate transport system of Escherichia coli has been determined. The transcription start site has been mapped by primer extension. One open reading frame representing the first gene of the presumed sulfate transport operon was identified and designated cysP. The deduced amino acid sequence of the CysP polypeptide indicates the presence of a signal peptide. Expression of the cysP gene in the T7 promoter-polymerase system revealed the location of the gene product in the periplasm. Construction of a cysP insertional mutant and assays of binding and uptake of sulfate and thiosulfate by this mutant allowed the identification of the cysP gene product as a thiosulfate-binding protein. The TGA termination codon of cysP was found to overlap the putative ATG initiation codon of the next open reading frame, inferred as being essential for the sulfate transport system, and it was designated cysT. Preliminary sequence data from the corresponding region of the Salmonella typhimurium chromosome showed strictly homologous counterparts of the E. coli cysP and cysT genes.
