We found that the peptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser-Pro (GRGESP) inhibited spreading of human fibroblasts inside collagen gels and markedly decreased gel contraction, but this peptide had no effect on cell spreading on collagen-coated surfaces. On the other hand, the peptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro (GRGDSP), which inhibited cell spreading on collagen-coated surfaces, did not inhibit cell spreading within collagen gels and was a less effective inhibitor of collagen gel contraction than GRGESP. Based on these findings, we conclude that human fibroblasts can interact with different collagen cell recognition sequences depending upon topographical organization of the collagen.
