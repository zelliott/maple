A synthetic gene encoding human interleukin-2 (IL-2) was designed such that the codon usage bias resembled that found in highly expressed Escherichia coli genes. The percentage of preferred codons was increased from 43% in the native cDNA sequence to 85% in the synthetic sequence. The cDNA and synthetic IL-2 genes were placed under the control of the trc promoter and expressed in E. coli JM101. While Northern blot analysis of IL-2 mRNA from each genetic construct demonstrated equivalent message half-lives, immunoblot and bioactivity analyses showed the synthetic gene to direct the synthesis of up to 16 times more IL-2 than the native cDNA sequence.
