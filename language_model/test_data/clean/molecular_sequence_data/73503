Microsomal glutathione S-transferase-II (GST-II) has recently been discovered and characterized as a member of the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP)/5(S)-hydroxy-6(R)-S-glutathionyl-7,9-trans-11, 14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (LTC4) synthase gene family, which also includes microsomal glutathione S-transferase-I (GST-I) as a distant member of this gene family. This new enzyme is unique as it is the only member of this family capable of efficiently conjugating reduced glutathione to both 5,6-oxido-7,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (LTA4) and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Although microsomal GST-II has been demonstrated to display both general glutathione S-transferase (GST) and specific LTC4 synthase activities, its biological function remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the physiological location of microsomal GST-II as well as the relative importance of this enzyme versus LTC4 synthase for the production of LTC4 in various human tissues and cells that have been previously demonstrated to possess LTC4 synthase activity. As determined by Western blot, microsomal GST-II was predominantly expressed in human liver microsomes, human endothelial cell membranes, and sparsely detected in human lung membranes. In contrast, LTC4 synthase was prevalent in human lung membranes, human platelet homogenates, and human kidney tissue. Concomitant to the formation of LTC4, microsomal GST-II also produces a new metabolite of LTA4, a postulated LTC4 isomer. This isomer was used to distinguish between microsomal GST-II and LTC4 synthase activities involved in the biosynthesis of LTC4. Based on the relative production of LTC4 to the LTC4 isomer, microsomal GST-II was demonstrated to be the principal enzyme responsible for LTC4 production in human liver microsomes and human endothelial cells and played a minor role in the formation of LTC4 in human lung membranes. In comparison, LTC4 synthase was the main enzyme capable of catalyzing the conjugation of reduced glutathione to LTA4 in human lung membranes and human platelet homogenates. Therefore, microsomal GST-II appears to be an integral component in the detoxification of biological systems due to its marked presence in human liver, in accordance with its known GST activity. Microsomal GST-II, however, may also be pivotal for cysteinyl leukotriene formation in endothelial cells, and this could change our current understanding of the regulation of leukotriene biosynthesis in inflammatory disorders such as asthma.
