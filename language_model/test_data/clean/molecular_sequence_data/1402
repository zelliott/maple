Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is associated with a number of human diseases; therefore, its protease is a potential target for chemotherapy. To compare the specificity of HTLV-1 protease with that of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease, oligopeptides representing naturally occurring cleavage sites in various retroviruses were tested. The number of hydrolyzed peptides as well as the specificity constants suggested a substantially broader specificity of the HIV protease. Amino acid residues of HTLV-1 protease substrate-binding sites were replaced by equivalent ones of HIV-1 protease. Most of the single and multiple mutants had altered specificity and a dramatically reduced folding and catalytic capability, suggesting that mutations are not well tolerated in HTLV-1 protease. The catalytically most efficient mutant was that with the flap residues of HIV-1 protease. The inhibition profile of the mutants was also determined for five inhibitors used in clinical practice and inhibitor analogs of HTLV-1 cleavage sites. Except for indinavir, the HIV-1 protease inhibitors did not inhibit wild type and most of the mutant HTLV-1 proteases. The wild type HTLV-1 protease was inhibited by the reduced peptide bond-containing substrate analogs, whereas the mutants showed various degrees of weakened binding capability. Most interesting, the enzyme with HIV-1-like residues in the flap region was the most sensitive to the HIV-1 protease inhibitors and least sensitive to the HTLV-1 protease inhibitors, indicating that the flap plays an important role in defining the specificity differences of retroviral proteases.
