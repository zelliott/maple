Many cultivated mushroom strains, such as Pleurotus ostreatus TD300, displayed symptoms of degeneration. A spherical virus POSV and four dsRNA segments were extracted from mycelium of P. ostreatus TD300. POSV had a diameter of 23 nm and encapsidated a 2.5kb dsRNA segment with coat proteins whose molecular weights were 39 kDa and 30 kDa. Four dsRNA segments were 8.2 kb, 2.5 kb, 2.0 kb, and 1.1 kb in size, respectively. The 1.1 kb dsRNA segment often escaped detection. The cDNA and the amino acid sequences of the 8.2 kb dsRNA were homologous to those of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRP) of ssRNA oyster mushroom spherical virus (OMSV), and contained conserved motifs A to D which were almost identical to those in RDRP of OMSV. The cDNA and amino acid sequences of the 2.5 kb and 2.0 kb dsRNA segments were homologous to that of RDRP and capsid protein of dsRNA virus P. ostreatus virus 1 (PoV1), respectively. In particular, the amino acid sequence of 2.5 kb dsRNA segment had high identity with the conserved motifs A to C in RDRP of PoV1, a Partiviridae virus. After eliminating the viruses in P. ostreatus TD300, the symptoms of degeneration completely disappeared. The results reveal that P. ostreatus TD300 was at least infected by a particle virus POSV, and two naked viruses, one was a dsRNA virus with a 2.0 kb dsRNA segment, the other was an ssRNA virus whose replicating form of genome was an 8.2 kb dsRNA segment. Mycoviruses infection is a causative agent of mushroom strain degeneration.
