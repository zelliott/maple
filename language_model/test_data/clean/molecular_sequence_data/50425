T4 endonuclease V [endodeoxyribonuclease (pyrimidine dimer); deoxyribonuclease (pyrimidine dimer), EC 3.1.25.1] initiates repair of damaged DNA by hydrolysis of the N-glycosyl bond at the 5' side of a pyrimidine photodimer in double-stranded DNA. To study one of the active sites of T4 endonuclease V, systematic site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the synthetic T4 endonuclease V gene, in parallel with three-dimensional structure analysis by x-ray crystallography. The mutant proteins were evaluated for DNA glycosylase activity using an oligonucleotide duplex (14-mer) containing a single thymidine dimer as a substrate. Replacement of either Glu-23 with glutamine or asparatic acid or Arg-3 with glutamine completely abolished DNA glycosylase activity. Mutation of Arg-3 to lysine or of Arg-26 to glutamine or lysine in a basic amino acid cluster caused serious defects in DNA glycosylase activity, which are reflected in the increases in Km and decreases in kcat of DNA glycosylase activity. On the other hand, substitutions of lysine for Arg-22 or of glutamine for Arg-117 or Lys-121 resulted in increases in the Km value. The completely inactive mutant proteins, E23Q and R3Q, in which glutamine was substituted for Glu-23 and Arg-3, respectively, were further investigated by CD spectroscopy for their ability to bind the oligonucleotide substrate. It was found that the E23Q protein retained specific substrate-binding ability, whereas the R3Q protein did not. These results indicate that Glu-23 plays an important role in catalysis of the DNA glycosylase reaction, and that Arg-3 is a crucial residue for substrate binding. In addition, Arg-22, Arg-26, Arg-117, and Lys-121 in the basic amino acid cluster also participate in substrate binding. We conclude that the basic amino acid cluster in T4 endonuclease V is an essential structure for DNA glycosylase activity.
