The gene fragments encoding outer membrane protein 1 (P1) and heat-shock protein B (HspB) amplified from genomic DNA of Coxiella burnetii Xinqiao by PCR were inserted into prokaryotic expression vector pQE30 to construct recombinant expression plasmids pQE30/p1 and pQE30/hspB, respectively. The p1 fragment from pQE30/p1 was ligated with hspB of pQE30/hspB to construct pQE30/p1-hspB. Recombinant proteins, P1, HspB, and P1-HspB, were expressed in Escherichia coli cells transformed with pQE30/p1, pQE30/hspB, and pQE30/p1-hspB, respectively. The purified recombinant proteins and whole-cell antigen (WCA) of C. burnetii were used to immunize BALB/c mice. The antibody detection, T-cell proliferation assay, and cytokine detection demonstrated that the animals immunized with P1-HspB or WCA exhibited stronger humoral and cellular immune responses compared with animals immunized with P1 or HspB individually. Seven days after challenge of 10-fold 50% infection dose of C. burnetii, mice were euthanized and their spleens were collected. The splenic weights of mice immunized with P1-HspB or WCA were significantly lighter than that of mice immunized with P1 or HspB. By real-time PCR assay, the coxiella loads of spleens of mice immunized with P1-HspB or WCA were also significantly lower than that of mice immunized with P1 or HspB. The data from this study indicate that fusion antigen P1-HspB is a good immunogen for eliciting immunoresponses against C. burnetii, and it may be a more suitable candidate for preparing subunit vaccine against Q fever.
