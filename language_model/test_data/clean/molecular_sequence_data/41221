Glycoprotein 5 (GP5) and membrane (M) protein are the major proteins in the envelope of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Although viral neutralization epitopes are reported in GP5 and M of type 2 PRRSV, their significance as targets of porcine humoral immunity is not well described. Thus, we constructed recombinant polypeptides containing ectodomain neutralization epitopes to examine their involvement in porcine antibody neutralization and antiviral immunity. PRRSV infection elicited ectodomain-specific antibodies, whose titers did not correlate with the neutralizing antibody (NA) response. Ectodomain-specific antibodies from PRRSV-neutralizing serum bound virus but did not neutralize infectivity. Furthermore, immunization of pigs with ectodomain polypeptides raised specific antibodies and provided partial protection without a detectable NA response. Finally the polypeptides did not block infection of porcine macrophages. These results suggest that the GP5/M ectodomain peptide epitopes are accessible for host antibody recognition, but are not associated with antibody-mediated virus neutralization.
