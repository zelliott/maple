Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (Parg) is the main enzyme of poly(ADP-ribose) degradation. To understand its structure-and-function relationship, we purified Parg from rat testis 9,740-fold using an improved affinity column; the purified product was a 60 kDa protein. Based on the determined sequences of three peptide fragments, degenerated primers were synthesized and a Parg cDNA comprising 3,974 nucleotides, encoding a 109 kDa protein, was isolated. The 60 kDa Parg purified from rat testes corresponded to the C-terminal half of the 109 kDa deduced peptide. When recombinant rat Parg was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli, Parg activity was observed for the full-length and C-terminal half proteins but not in for the N-terminal half protein. Taken together, these data indicate that the catalytic domain of Parg is located in the C-terminal half. Further, we newly identified the presence of a potential nuclear export signal in the N-terminal half in addition to the previously reported nuclear localization signals in rat and other mammalian Pargs. Northern blot analysis showed the ubiquitous expression of a single 4.0 kb Parg mRNA in various rat tissues. The findings suggest that the 60 kDa Parg is produced by post-transcriptional processing.
