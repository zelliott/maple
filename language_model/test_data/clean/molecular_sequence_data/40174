Two new phenolic glycosides, ilexpubsides A and B, along with four known lignan glycosides were isolated from the roots of Ilex pubescens. By spectral evidence, the structures of the new compounds were elucidated as 4-O-beta-D-[6'-O-(4''-O-beta-D-glucopyranosylvanilloyl)glucopyranosyl] vanillic acid (1) and syringinic 6'-O-beta-D-xylopyranoside (2). The known compounds were identified to be liriodendrin (3), (-)-olivil (4), tortoside A (5) and (+)-cyclo-olivil (6). All compounds were first isolated from Ilex pubescens.
