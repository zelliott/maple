In our previous cDNA microarray analysis, we identified 53 mature anther-specific genes, whose function was unknown, in rice. We reanalyzed these genes from the viewpoint of the specific amino acid motif. Out of 53 genes, three genes, Os-26, Os-32, and Os-169 (renamed as OsSCP1, OsSCP2, and OsSCP3), encoded cysteine-rich motif (Cys-X3-Cys-X13-Cys-X3-Cys), indicating that they were novel small cysteine-rich proteins. From the search of specific elements in promoter regions, several pollen-specific elements were found. In order to determine whether three promoters were functional in pollen or not, the gene constructs with promoter regions fused to the beta-glucuronidase gene were transformed into tobacco. Histochemical analysis showed that these promoters were active in the mature pollen grains and pollen tubes. Furthermore, OsSCP1 and OsSCP3 formed a multigene family tandemly in the rice genome. From the results, OsSCPs might have important roles in mature pollen development and pollen tube growth.
