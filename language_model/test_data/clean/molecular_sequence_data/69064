A tuber-specific cDNA library of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) was constructed and a full-length cDNA for granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS, also known as waxy protein), the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of amylose in reserve starch, was cloned. Sequencing of the cloned cDNA showed that it has 74% identity with potato GBSS and 60-72% identity with GBSS from other plant species. The cDNA encodes a 608 amino acid protein of which 78 amino acids form a chloroplast/amyloplast transit peptide of 8.37 kDa. The mature protein has a predicted molecular mass of 58.61 kDa (530 amino acids). Comparison of the GBSS proteins of various plant species and glycogen synthase of bacteria showed extensive identity among the mature form of plant GBSS proteins, in which the monocots and dicots form two separate branches in the evolutionary tree. From analysis of the genomic DNA of allotetraploid cassava, it is shown that GBSS is a low-copy-number gene. GBSS transcript is synthesized in a number of different organs, but most abundantly in tubers. Potato plants were transformed with the cassava GBSS cDNA in antisense orientation fused between the potato GBSS promoter and the nopaline synthase terminator. The expression of the endogenous GBSS gene in these transgenic potato plants was partially or completely inhibited. Complete inhibition of GBSS activity by the cassava antisense gene resulted in absence of GBSS protein and amylose giving rise to almost complete amylose-free potato starch. This shows that also heterologous genes can be used to achieve antisense effects in other plant species.
