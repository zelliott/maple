The compounds, named aesculiosides Ia-Ie, IIa-IId, and IVa-IVc, were isolated from an ethanol extract of the fruits of North American Aesculus pavia, along with two known compounds. Their structures were characterized as polyhydroxyoleanene pentacyclic triterpenoid saponins by spectroscopic and chemical analyses. These saponins were divided into three elution zones by chromatography according to the polarity because of the acyl substitution at C-21 and C-22 of the aglycone saponins moiety. These are structurally different from those isolated from Eurasian Aesculus hippocastanum and Aesculus chinensis in their oligosaccharide moieties.
