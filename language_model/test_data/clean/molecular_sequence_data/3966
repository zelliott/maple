Neuronal Cdc2-like kinase (Nclk) plays an important role in a variety of cellular processes, including neuronal cell differentiation, apoptosis, neuron migration, and formation of neuromuscular junction. The active kinase consists of a catalytic subunit, Cdk5, and an essential regulatory subunit, neuronal Cdk5 activator (p35(nck5a) or p25(nck5a)), which is expressed primarily in neurons of central nervous tissue. In our previous study using the yeast two-hybrid screening method, three novel p35(nck5a)-associated proteins were isolated. Here we show that one of these proteins, called C42, specifically inhibits the activation of Cdk5 by Nck5a. Co-immunoprecipitation data suggested that C42 and p35(nck5a) could form a complex within cultured mammalian cells. Deletion analysis has mapped the inhibitory domain of C42 to a region of 135 amino acids, which is conserved in Pho81, a yeast protein that inhibits the yeast cyclin-dependent protein kinase Pho85. The Pho85.Pho80 kinase complex has been shown to be the yeast functional homologue of the mammalian Cdk5/p35(nck5a) kinase.
