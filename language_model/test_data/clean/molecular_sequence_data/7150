The Cyp 2d-9 gene encodes the male-specific steroid 16 alpha-hydroxylase in mouse liver and shares a conserved regulatory element (-100TTCCGGGC-93) with another male-specific Slp promoter. As shown with the Slp promoter (N. Yokomori, R. Moore, and M. Negishi, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:1302-1306, 1995), the male-preferential demethylation also occurs at CpG/-97 in the Cyp 2d-9 promoter. The transcription factor which specifically binds to the demethylated element has been purified. The peptide sequences reveal that the factor consists of GABP alpha and GABP beta 1 with Ets and Notch motifs, respectively. Both DNase I footprinting and gel shift assays indicate that the bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase-GABP fusion proteins bind to the regulatory element only when CpG/-97 is demethylated. Moreover, Cyp 2d-9 promoter is trans-activated by coexpression of GABP proteins in HepG2 cells. Given the additional results that CpG/-50 of the female-specific steroid 15 alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp 2a-4) promoter is preferentially demethylated in the females, the sex-specific expressions of the P450 genes correlate very well with DNA demethylation. We also conclude that GABP is a methylation-sensitive transcription factor and is a potential transcription activator of the male-specific Cyp 2d-9 promoter.
