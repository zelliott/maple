Coagulation factor VII bound to its cofactor tissue factor is the physiological initiator of blood coagulation. The interaction between factor VII and tissue factor involves all four of the structural modules found in factor VII, with the most significant contribution coming from the first EGF-like domain. In this study, the synthesis and biological activity of several analogues derived from the first EGF-like domain of FVII comprising the sequence 45-83 are reported on. The six cysteine residues found in the native protein were replaced by Abu. The peptides were isolated from a multicomponent mixture following standard Fmoc solid phase synthesis. Purification and characterisation of the heterogeneous product showed that aspartimide formation was a major side-reaction, occurring predominantly at the Asp46-Gly47 and Asn57-Gly58 dipeptides. Although relatively common in peptide synthesis, the extent to which this side-reaction had taken place was considered surprising. Reported herein are the analytical methods used to isolate and characterise several of the modified products. Also, the inhibitory effect of these peptides on the formation and enzymatic activity of the factor VIIa/tissue factor complex have been compared. Surprisingly, the peptide containing an iso-Asp residue at position 57 possessed 66-fold higher inhibitory activity compared with the original target peptide. A possible explanation for this increase in observed activity is presented.
