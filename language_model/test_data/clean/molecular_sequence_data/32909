Alkyl glycosides are surfactants with good biodegradability and low toxicity, attractive to produce by an enzymatic method to get a well-defined product. In this paper, we report a novel thermostable variant of a family 3 beta-glucosidase to be an efficient catalyst in alkyl-glucoside forming reactions using transglycosylation with hexanol or octanol as the acceptor molecule. The enzyme has an apparent optimum for hydrolysis at 90 degrees C, which coincides with its unfolding temperature. The total activity is lower at lower temperature (60 degrees C), but the ratio of alcoholysis/hydrolysis is slightly more favourable. This ratio is however more heavily influenced by the water content and the pH. Optimal reaction conditions for hexyl glucoside synthesis from p-nitrophenyl-beta-glucopyranoside were a water/hexanol two-phase system containing 16% (v/v) water, pH 5.8, and a temperature of 60 degrees C. Under these conditions, the total initial reaction rate was 153 micromol min(-1)mg(-1) and the alcoholysis/hydrolysis ratio was 5.1. Comparing with alcoholysis/hydrolysis ratios of other beta-glycosidases, TnBgl3B can be considered to be a very promising catalyst for alkyl glucoside production.
