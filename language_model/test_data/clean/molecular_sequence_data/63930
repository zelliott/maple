A mixture of arabinoxylan oligosaccharides from wheat seedling was permethylated and analyzed by electrospray ion trap MS and GC-MS. The presence of isomeric structures differing in degree of branching and position of the branched residue along the xylose backbone was demonstrated for oligosaccharides with four and five monosaccharide residues. No isomeric structures were found for oligosaccharides with three monosaccharide residues. Linkage analysis by GC-MS reveals that xylose residues were substituted with single arabinoxyl residues at C-3.
