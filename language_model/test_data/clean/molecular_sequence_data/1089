Addressing the genetic variability in Echinococcus granulosus is epidemiologically important, as strain characteristics may influence the local transmission patterns of zoonotic cystic echinococcosis. To classify the genotype(s) present in intermediate (pig, cattle and sheep) and definitive (jackal and wolf) hosts in Bulgaria, a DNA-based approach was used to assess parasite protoscoleces or strobiles. Genes corresponding to coding and non-coding regions of the nuclear and mitochondrial genome ( ND-1, HBX, Act II, AgB-1) were amplified by PCR and subsequently sequenced. The sequences resolved were all found to be identical to those published for the common sheep strain of E. granulosus, indicating that the G1 genotype is predominant in Bulgaria. One microvariant for ND-1 was found in the pig isolates; however no epidemiological significance was attributed to this finding.
