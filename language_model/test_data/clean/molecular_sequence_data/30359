Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is an inborn error of metabolism, inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder and caused by a decrease in the activity of fructose-1-phosphate aldolase (aldolase B) in affected individuals. Investigation of the molecular basis of HFI is reported here by the identification of two molecular lesions in the aldolase B gene of the HFI individual. Using polymerase chain reaction to specifically amplify exons at this locus and T7 polymerase for the sequence determination of these double-stranded fragments, we show the mutational heterogeneity of the proband. One allele, previously indicated by restriction analysis, was confirmed as A149P (Ala 149 to Pro in exon 5). The other allele was identified as a 4-bp deletion found in exon 4, a deletion which causes a frameshift at codon 118, resulting in a truncated protein of 132 amino acids. Segregation of these mutant alleles in the proband's family was shown by using allele-specific oligodeoxynucleotides to probe blots of amplified DNA. The techniques employed here represent a rapid and efficient method for detection of other mutations in families with this disease. In addition, the ability to detect mutant alleles by allele-specific hybridization offers a new method for definitive diagnosis, a method which avoids a fructose loading or liver-biopsy examination.
