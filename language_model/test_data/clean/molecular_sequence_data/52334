A glutamic acid-specific protease has been purified to homogeneity from Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 14580 utilizing Phe-Leu-D-Glu-OMe-Sepharose affinity chromatography and crystallized. The molecular weight of the protease was estimated to be approximately 25,000 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This protease, which we propose to call BLase (glutamic acid-specific protease from B. licheniformis ATCC 14580), was characterized enzymatically. Using human parathyroid hormone (13-34) and p-nitroanilides of peptidyl glutamic acid and aspartic acid, we found a marked difference between BLase and V8 protease, EC 3.4.21.9, although both proteases showed higher reactivity for glutamyl bonds than for aspartyl bonds. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate and benzyloxycarbonyl Leu-Glu chloromethyl ketone completely inhibited BLase, whereas EDTA reversibly inactivated the enzyme. The findings clearly indicate that BLase can be classified as a serine protease. To elucidate the complete primary structure and precursor of BLase, its gene was cloned from the genomic DNA of B. licheniformis ATCC 14580, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. Taking the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified BLase into consideration, the clones encode a mature peptide of 222 amino acids, which follows a prepropeptide of 94 residues. The recombinant BLase was expressed in Bacillus subtilis and purified to homogeneity. Its key physical and chemical characteristics were the same as those of the wild-type enzyme. BLase was confirmed to be a protease specific for glutamic acid, and the primary structure deduced from the cDNA sequence was found to be identical with that of a glutamic acid-specific endopeptidase isolated from Alcalase (Svendsen, I., and Breddam, K. (1992) Eur. J. Biochem. 204, 165-171), being different from V8 protease and the Glu-specific protease of Streptomyces griseus which consist of 268 and 188 amino acids, respectively.
