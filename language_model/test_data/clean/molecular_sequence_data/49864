A poly G tract in tbpA of Histophilus ovis strain 3384Y was suspected of being responsible for the transferrin (Tf)-dependent expression of TbpA. The region encompassing the poly G tract was amplified using DNA from H. ovis strains 9L and 3384Y grown under iron-replete conditions and under iron-restricted conditions in the presence of bovine Tf. Sequence analysis of the amplification products revealed that regardless of the growth conditions, the poly G tract in strain 9L contained eight Gs, a situation that maintains the correct reading frame of the gene. Similarly, the poly G tract in strain 3384Y contained eight Gs when the organisms were grown under iron-restricted conditions in the presence of bovine Tf but when grown under iron-replete conditions, the poly G tract contained nine Gs resulting in a frame shift and the introduction of a premature stop codon. It is concluded that the Tf-dependent expression of TbpA in H. ovis strain 3384Y is due to a form of phase variation.
