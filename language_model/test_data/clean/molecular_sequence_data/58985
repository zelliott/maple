Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis is required for the onset of anaphase. We show that protein dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is also essential for initiating anaphase in fission yeast. PP1 may directly or indirectly regulate the 20S cyclosome/APC (anaphase-promoting complex) required for anaphase-promoting proteolysis. Using anti-phosphopeptide antibodies, PP1 is shown to be dephosphorylated at the C-terminus, upon the onset of anaphase, for reactivation. sds23+, a novel gene, is a multicopy suppressor for mutations in PP1 and the 20S cyclosome/APC, implying that the gene dosage increase can relieve the requirement for PP1 and the cyclosome/APC for the onset of anaphase. The sds23+ gene is not essential for cell viability, but a mutant with the gene deleted cannot form colonies at 22 and 36 degrees C. In the sds23 deletion mutant, the progression of anaphase and cytokinesis is retarded and cell shape is aberrant. These defects are overcome by plasmids carrying the genes encoding subunits of the 20S cyclosome/APC or PP1. These results demonstrate functions other than promoting anaphase for the components of the 20S cyclosome/APC and also a close functional relationship of Sds23 with PP1 and 20S cyclosome/APC.
