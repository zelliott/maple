Rhizobium melioti DctD activates transcription from the dctA promoter by catalysing the isomerization of closed complexes between sigma54-RNA polymerase holoenzyme and the promoter to open complexes. DctD must make productive contact with sigma54-holoenzyme and hydrolyse ATP to catalyse this isomerization. To define further the activation process, we sought to isolate mutants of DctD that had reduced affinities for sigma54-holoenzyme. Mutagenesis was confined to the well-conserved C3 region of the protein, which is required for coupling ATP hydrolysis to open complex formation in sigma54-dependent activators. Mutant forms of DctD that failed to activate transcription and had substitutions in the C-terminal half of the C3 region were efficiently cross-linked to sigma54 and the beta-subunit of RNA polymerase, suggesting that they bound normally to sigma54-holoenzyme. In contrast, some mutant forms of DctD with amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal half of the C3 region had reduced affinities for sigma54 and the beta-subunit in the cross-linking assay. These data suggest that the N-terminal half of the C3 region of DctD contains a site that may contact sigma54-holoenzyme during open complex formation.
