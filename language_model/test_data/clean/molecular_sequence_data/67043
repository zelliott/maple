Beta-lactamase-mediated resistance was investigated in 59 putative extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-positive Salmonella spp. from the paediatric ward of a tertiary hospital in Durban, South Africa. Three Salmonella enterica serotype Isangi cultured from stool samples were multidrug resistant, with susceptibility only to meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and cefoxitin. Isoelectric focusing revealed beta-lactamases with isoelectric points of pI 5.8, 6.8 and 7.2. Sequencing identified beta-lactamases CTX-M-37 and TEM-1. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CTX-M-37 from S. enterica serotype Isangi in South Africa.
