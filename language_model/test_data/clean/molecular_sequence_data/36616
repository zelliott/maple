Using a gel retardation assay, a protein factor that specifically interacts with a 33 bp intragenic sequence of the highly expressed and glucose-inducible SRP1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been detected. This binding site is located in a transcribed region and within the open reading frame (positions +710 to +743 relative to the first base of the initiation codon). A mutant strain carrying a deletion of this binding site showed a dramatic decrease in steady-state levels of SRP1 transcripts. This decline is not the result of a decrease in mRNA stability, since expression of hybrid genes in which the SRP1 promoter was replaced by the heterologous CYC1 promoter was not affected by the binding site deletion. These findings suggest that the 33 bp sequence contains a cis-acting downstream activating element which is involved in the transcriptional activation of the SRP1 promoter. Sequence comparisons showed similarities between a site located within the 33 bp sequence and the high-affinity consensus binding site of the RAP1/GRF1 (also named TUF) factor and methylation interference experiments confirmed that this site was involved in the protein-DNA interaction. Both the results of competition experiments with upstream activating sequences of ribosomal protein genes (UASrpg), which are targets for RAP1 binding, and determination of the apparent molecular weight of the affinity-purified DNA-binding protein indicated that RAP1 factor recognized the SRP1 33 bp element. The 33 bp sequence was found to be unable to provide UAS activity when placed upstream of the TATA box and transcription start site.
