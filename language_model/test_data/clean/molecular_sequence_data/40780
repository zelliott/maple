Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive spasticity in the lower extremities. Mutations in the atlastin GTPase 1 (ATL1) gene cause approximately 10% of autosomal dominantly inherited HSP. For many subjects with an ATL1 mutation, spastic gait begins in early childhood and does not significantly worsen, even over many years; such cases resemble spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. Herein we report a heterozygous R239C mutation in the ATL1 gene in a Korean family. The family members exhibited early onset pure spastic paraplegia and had been previously diagnosed with the diplegic form of cerebral palsy. We suggest that spastic paraplegia type 3 (SPG3A) be included in the differential diagnosis of early onset spastic paraplegia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a genetically confirmed family affected with SPG3A in Korea.
