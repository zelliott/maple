The nucleotide sequence of a 1520 bp region, spanning the coding region for the meta-cleavage pathway enzyme, 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, was determined. This enzyme, encoded by the phnG, is the first of three sequential enzymes required for conversion of 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde, which is produced from catechol by the PhnE catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, to 2-hydroxypent-2,4-dienoate in the dehydrogenative branch of the pathway. The deduced protein sequence is 484 amino acid residues long with a M(r) of 51504. The phnG has a high degree of homology with genes encoding isofunctional proteins from other Pseudomonas strains. We now show that the relative position of the phnG dehydrogenase gene in the phn operon is unique compared to the other meta-cleavage operons which have a dehydrogenative branch of the pathway.
