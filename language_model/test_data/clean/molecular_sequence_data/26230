The replaceability of amino acids as reflected in their neighbourhood selectivity is analyzed in this paper. Neighbourhood selectivity was found to be more characteristic of the individual amino acids than the other commonly used parameters. The residue replacement rank obtained was compared with other proposed ranks and was tested on naturally accepted point mutations in homologous proteins.
