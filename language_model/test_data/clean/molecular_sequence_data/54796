The cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (CPV) from the family Reoviridae belongs to a subgroup of "turreted" reoviruses, in which the mRNA capping activity occurs in a pentameric turret. We report a full atomic model of CPV built from a 3D density map obtained using cryoelectron microscopy. The image data for the 3D reconstruction were acquired exclusively from a CCD camera. Our structure shows that the enzymatic domains of the pentameric turret of CPV are topologically conserved and that there are five unique channels connecting the guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase regions. This structural organization reveals how the channels guide nascent mRNA sequentially to guanylyltransferase, 7-N-methyltransferase, and 2'-O-methyltransferase in the turret, undergoing the highly coordinated mRNA capping activity. Furthermore, by fitting the deduced amino acid sequence of the protein VP5 to 120 large protrusion proteins on the CPV capsid shell, we confirmed that this protrusion protein is encoded by CPV RNA segment 7.
