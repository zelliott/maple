A cDNA expression library was constructed in the lambda gt 11 phage vector using ovine (o) pituitary mRNA. The clone, pOP1, carrying a 934-bp insert contains an open reading frame beginning with the first nucleotide (nt) and ending with the stop codon TAA at nt position 781. Two potential translation start codons (ATGs) are present in the 5' region of this cDNA. Translation initiation could occur at the 5' proximal ATG at nt position 61. The nucleotide sequence around this ATG (TCCATGG), resembles the optimum sequence context for translation initiation by the eukaryotic ribosomes, as defined by mutational analysis [Kozak, Cell 44 (1986) 283-292)], with its substitution of the A at -3 of the consensus sequence by a T residue in this clone. Translation initiated at this codon could potentially code for the entire pre-prolactin (pre-PRL) molecule. The 3'-untranslated region is 154 nt long and contains a polyadenylation signal AATAAA. The deduced amino acid sequence agrees in totality with the published amino acid sequence of the mature hormone. The present study reports on the nucleotide sequence of o-PRL mRNA and the deduced amino acid sequence in the signal peptide of the hormone.
