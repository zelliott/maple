The effects on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 virion morphogenesis and on virus replication of mutations that affect posttranslational processing of the capsid precursor protein are described. A change in the glycine residue at position two from the N terminus abolishes the myristoylation of the precursor proteins and also prevents virus particle release. Mutations in the viral protease gene abolish proteolytic cleavage of the capsid precursor but do not prevent the formation and budding of virion particles of immature appearance. Mutations that alter the sequence of the sites normally used for cleavage of the major capsid protein p24 from the capsid precursor alter virion morphogenesis and prevent virus replication.
