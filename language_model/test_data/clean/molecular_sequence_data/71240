GEM is a new family of repetitive sequences detected in the D. subobscura genome. Two of the four described GEM elements encompass a heterogeneous central module, with no detectable ORF, flanked by two long inverted repeats. These elements are composed of a set of repetitive modules, which are inverted repeat (IR), direct repeat (DR), palindromic sequence (PS), long sequence (LS) and short sequence (SS). These five modules can be found either clustered or dispersed as single modules in the D. subobscura genome, in euchromatic and heterochromatic regions. In addition to the 3' region of Adh retrosequences, single IR and LS blocks were found associated with the promoter region of different genes, in particular, LS-like blocks have also been found associated with functional genes in D. melanogaster and D. virilis. Conversely, the DR block is highly similar to satellite DNAs from some other species of the obscura group. In addition, GEM elements share some structural features with IS elements described in different Drosophila species. It is likely that both GEM and IS sequences would be vestiges of an ancestral transposable element.
