Twenty-four independent phosphate starvation-inducible (psi) transcriptional fusions made with Mu d1(lacZbla) were analyzed by sequencing the psi::lacZ(Mu d1) chromosomal junctions by using DNAs amplified with the polymerase chain reaction or mini-Mu cloning. Our DNA sequence analysis showed that the MuR DNA in Mu d1 has an unexpected structure that is comprised of 104 bases of MuR DNA in the form of a large inverted repeat, which we denoted Mu d1-R. Also, Mu d1s in the phoA and phn (psiD) loci of the phosphate regulon showed regional specificities for the insertion sites despite the randomness of Mu d1 insertions into the genome as a whole. Gene products or open reading frames were identified for seven unknown psi::lacZ(Mu d1) transcriptional fusions by searching DNA data bases with the sequences adjacent and upstream of the Mu d1s. One psiC::lacZ(Mu d1) lies in the ugpB gene of the ugpBAEC operon, which encodes a periplasmic sn-glycerol-3-phosphate-binding protein; two psiQ::lacZ(Mu d1)s lie in the gltB gene, and one psiQ::lacZ(Mu d1) lies in the gltD gene of the gltBDF operon, encoding the large and small subunits of glutamate synthase, respectively; and the psi-51::lacZ(Mu d1) lies in the glpB gene of the glpABC operon, which codes for the anaerobically regulated glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. psiE and psiF::lacZ(Mu d1)s lie in uncharacterized open reading frames near the xylE and phoA genes, respectively. Six other psi::lacZ(Mu d1)s lie in yet unreported Escherichia coli sequences.
