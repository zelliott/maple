Our studies of the spatiotemporal availability of neurotrophic factors, coupled with tagged ligand binding assays that identify cell bearing receptors for these factors, should lead toward defining the physiological roles of these molecules in the animal. The use of the tagged ligands to identify factor-responsive cell lines has also provided new model systems for the examination of ligand-receptor interactions, as well as for the study of the subsequent induction of intracellular response pathways. To obtain insights into such intracellular pathways, we have molecularly cloned genes encoding a family of serine-threonine protein kinases, most closely related to kinases involved in the yeast response to pheromones. These kinases may be crucial regulators of early steps in the response of mammalian cells to neurotrophic factors as well as other extracellular signals.
