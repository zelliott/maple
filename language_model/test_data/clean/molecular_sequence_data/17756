In order to elucidate the function of the IS1 insA gene derivatives of plasmid pUC19::Tn9' with insertions of synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained. The latter are equal or multiple of 9 b.p. in length and are located in the Pst1 site within each of the two IS1 copies of the Tn9' transposon. The insertions of the nine base oligonucleotides code for the neutral amino acids and do not shift the reading frame. One of the mutant transposon obtained - Tn9'/X was studied on the ability to form simple insertions and plasmid cointegrates. For this purpose the pUC19 derivatives carrying the wild type and mutant transposon were mobilized by conjugative plasmid pRP3.1. It was found that the damage of the insA gene does not influence the ability of transposon to form simple insertions and plasmid cointegrates in both recA - and rec+ cells of E. coli. However, the frequency of the cointegrate formation in the subsequent transposition of the mutant transposon from pRP3.1::Tn9'/X to pBR322 was by 10-20 times lower in comparison to the wild type transposon. Instable (dissociating) Tn9'/X-mediated plasmid cointegrates formed by interaction pUC19::Tn9'/X and pRP3.1 were obtained. It was shown that in the E. coli recA-cells such cointegrates dissociate, as a rule, "correctly", i.e. they segregate mainly plasmids of types pUC19::Tn9'/X and pUC19::IS1/X. The data obtained correspond with the notion that the gene insA product is not essential for transposition, but is, possibly, involved in the formation of the IS1-generated deletions.
