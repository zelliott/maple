PML, a Ring-finger protein, participates in the disruption of normal myeloid differentiation when fused to the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) by the translocation between chromosomes (Chrs) 15 and 17 in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). As an initial step in the characterization of PML in species other than human, a murine cDNA clone of the PML gene was isolated and sequenced, and the intron/exon organization of the murine locus determined. The predicted amino acid sequence of the mouse PML protein shows 80% similarity to that of its human homolog. However, the mouse and human proteins show greater than 90% similarity in the proposed functional domains of the proteins. Despite its role in the etiology of APL, PML expression is not detectably altered during granulocytic differentiation in a murine in vitro system. Chromosomal localization of the Pml locus by somatic cell hybrids and by linkage analysis indicates that the gene maps to a region of mouse Chr 9 with known linkage homology to the region on human Chr 15q to which PML has been localized.
