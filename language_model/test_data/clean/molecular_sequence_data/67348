Marine bacterium Catenovulum agarivorans YM01(T) can produce highly thermostable agarases. The draft genome of YM01(T) is about 5.36 Mb and harbors approximately 4,913 genes, including 15 agarase (2 α-agarase and 13 β-agarase)-encoding genes, which will provide references to functional characterization of various agarases from marine bacteria.
