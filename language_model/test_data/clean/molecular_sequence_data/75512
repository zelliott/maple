A lambda recombinant phage, carrying a radish rDNA fragment spanning the complete external spacer and its borders, has been isolated and characterized by sequencing. The fragment is 2911 bp long and includes 486 bp of the 3' end of the 25S rRNA sequence, 2349 bp of spacer and the first 76 bp of the 5' end of the 18S rRNA sequence. The spacer can be divided into three regions: two unique domains flanking a 830-bp region of repeated sequences. Seven repeats ranging from 80 to 103 bp can be recognized. They are separated by short arrays of 12-21 adenylic residues. Each repeat slightly differs from the others by single-nucleotide changes or short deletions. Examination of single-nucleotide changes common to two units suggests that a duplication arose during the evolution of this sequence. The repeated region was subcloned and used as a probe to demonstrate that it is highly species-specific: in stringent conditions it does not cross-hybridize with the spacer of ribosomal genes from closely related species such as Brassica. Transcription products, starting or finishing within the spacer sequence, were mapped by northern blotting, primer extension and S1 mapping. Two major precursors were identified starting respectively at positions 2095 and 2280. The region surrounding the start at 2095 presents extensive homology with an analogous region in maize, rye, mung bean, Xenopus and tse-tse fly. However, longer transcripts can be detected. Several 3' ends downstream of the 25S terminus were also observed. Taken together these results indicate that rDNA transcription and pre-rRNA processing in plants are more complex than anticipated from previous studies.
