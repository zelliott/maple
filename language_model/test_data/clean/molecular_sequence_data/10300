Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to rifampin results from nucleotide changes in the gene encoding the beta-subunit of the RNA polymerase (rpoB). We developed a reverse hybridization-based line probe assay (LiPA; the INNO-LiPA Rif. TB) carrying one oligonucleotide probe for the detection of M. tuberculosis complex strains and nine probes designed to detect nucleotide changes in the relevant part of rpoB. This assay was evaluated with 107 M. tuberculosis isolates with known rpoB sequences, 52 non-M. tuberculosis complex strains, and 61 and 203 clinical isolates found to be sensitive and resistant, respectively, by in vitro testing. The results indicated that (i) the M. tuberculosis complex probe was 100% specific, (ii) when compared to the results of nucleotide sequencing, no discrepancies with the results of INNO-LiPA Rif. TB were observed, (iii) all strains sensitive by in vitro susceptibility testing were correctly identified, and (iv) among the strains resistant by in vitro susceptibility testing, only 4 (2%) yielded conflicting results. The INNO-LiPA Rif. TB is therefore a reliable and widely applicable assay and a valuable tool for routine diagnostic use, given its simplicity and rapid performance.
