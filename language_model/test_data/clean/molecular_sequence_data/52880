Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) are important in many types of mesenchymal cell. Here we identify a new PDGF, PDGF-C, which binds to and activates the PDGF alpha-receptor. PDGF-C is activated by proteolysis and induces proliferation of fibroblasts when overexpressed in transgenic mice. In situ hybridization analysis in the murine embryonic kidney shows preferential expression of PDGF-C messenger RNA in the metanephric mesenchyme during epithelial conversion. Analysis of kidneys lacking the PDGF alpha-receptor shows selective loss of mesenchymal cells adjacent to sites of expression of PDGF-C mRNA; this is not found in kidneys from animals lacking PDGF-A or both PDGF-A and PDGF-B, indicating that PDGF-C may have a unique function.
