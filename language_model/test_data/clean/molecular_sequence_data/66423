Pumilio protein regulates translation of specific mRNAs in morphogenesis and germ-line development of the flies by binding nucleotide motifs GUUGU (A) and AUUGUA (B) in 3'untranslated regions. A human homologue, PUMILIO2 has been recently identified in the germ-line stem cells and the question was raised whether it regulates translation. We designed software to screen the GeneBank for A and B motifs and found that they are not uncommon in the human genome. Moreover, some of the genes containing motifs A and B are germ cell specific, but some others are expressed in a number of other tissues. This may indicate that PUMILIO mediated translational regulation is universally used in developmental processes of the human body.
