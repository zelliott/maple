We studied DNA sequences homologous to HTLV-1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 30 patients with neurological disorders in Kyushu, where HTLV-1 is highly endemic. The regions of HTLV-1 amplified by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) included U3, U5, gag, pol, env and pX. Our system specifically detected HTLV-1 sequences only from HTLV-1-positive cells and was sufficiently sensitive to detect one proviral copy per 10(3) PBMC. All PCR-positive cases were seropositive, including 4 cases of tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM) (4/4), and one case each of myasthenia gravis (1/7) and multiple sclerosis (1/8). The PCR-positive rate of patients, excluding 4 TSP/HAM cases, was 8% (2/26), which is similar to the seroprevalence of the adult population in the area. The data suggest that multiple sclerosis is not associated with prototype HTLV-1.
