A region of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)/Glasgow-8 external envelope glycoprotein (env) incorporating the third and fourth variable regions (V3/V4) was cloned, inserted into the pGEX vector and expressed in Escherichia coli to yield milligram quantities of the recombinant polypeptide as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. The fusion protein V3/V4GST was used in lymphocyte proliferation assays, where it consistently caused peripheral blood lymphocytes from naive cats to proliferate in a dose-dependent manner. Other FIV fusion proteins produced under identical conditions (V5GST and p24GST) and glutathione S-transferase alone did not cause proliferation in this system. The monoclonal antibody vpg15, which has been shown to block infection of susceptible cells in vitro, did not decrease the response to V3/V4GST. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes did not proliferate in response to V3/V4GST.
