The cellular complement of calcimedins was identified in Trypanosoma brucei by Ca(2+)-dependent association with phenyl-Sepharose. Predominant calcimedins with molecular mass of 23-26 kDa and 44 kDa, along with minor calcimedins of 96, 120 and 230 kDa, were obtained. The trypanosome calcimedins were unrelated to vertebrate annexins, based upon antibody cross-reactivity and an inability to associate in a Ca(2+)-dependent way with phospholipid vesicles comprised of phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylcholine (1:1, w/w). Partial sequence analysis demonstrated that 44 kDa calcimedin (Tb-44) contained an EF-hand calcium-binding loop. Five CNBr/tryptic fragments exhibited a total of 93% similarity with Tb-17, a 23 kDa EF-hand protein in T. brucei. The trypanosome calcimedins appeared to comprise a family of proteins, based on sequence similarities and antibody cross-reactivity of affinity-purified anti-Tb44 with the 23-26 kDa cluster. No evidence was found for Tb-44 in the related species T. cruzi, Leishmania taraentolae or Crithidia fasciculata. Antibodies against Tb-44 were localized by immunofluorescence along the flagellum of T. brucei. Immunoblot analysis of flagella-enriched preparations demonstrated that Tb-44 and the 23-26 kDa cluster were present in this structure. We conclude that annexin family members are not among the predominant trypanosome proteins that associate with phenyl-Sepharose in a Ca(2+)-dependent way. Instead, the major trypanosome calcimedins comprise a family of flagellar EF-hand calcium-binding proteins.
