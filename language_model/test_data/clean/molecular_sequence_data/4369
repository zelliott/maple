The 2032 nucleotide sequence of the 3' terminal region of onion yellow dwarf virus (OYDV) isolated from Allium wakegi, bearing the genes for viral coat protein (CP) and a truncated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, has been determined. Respective homologies of the nucleotide sequence in the corresponding region and the deduced amino acid sequence of CP with the equivalents of leek yellow stripe virus (LYSV) from garlic were 68.0 and 59.3%. Variation in the nucleotide sequence is concentrated in the boundary region between the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene and the CP gene as well as in the 3' noncoding region. These sequence divergencies, including the deletion of 79 nucleotides, resulted both in alterations to the amino acid sequence and the absence of 28 amino acid residues in the amino terminal region of OYDV CP in comparison with LYSV CP. In addition, the length of the 3' noncoding sequence of OYDV was one-third that of LYSV. Comparison of the 3' terminal 1197 nucleotides sequence of OYDV with sequences of the respective cDNAs cloned by RT-PCR directly from the total RNA of infected Allium plants that included two varieties of A. fistulosum, "Wakenegi" and "Shimonita-negi", and A. chinense, showed 90.7% overall identities, even though they have long been cultivated in locally restricted area in Japan. These findings appear to suggest that a single strain of OYDV invaded Japanese Allium plants long ago and spread throughout them.
