Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) transcription factor has been identified as a key protein in cholesterol metabolism through the transactivation of the LDL receptor and cholesterol biosynthesis genes. Here, we generated mice lacking microRNA (miR)-33, encoded by an intron of the Srebp2, and showed that miR-33 repressed the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) protein, a key regulator of HDL synthesis by mediating cholesterol efflux from cells to apolipoprotein A (apoA)-I. In fact, peritoneal macrophages derived from miR-33-deficient mice showed a marked increase in ABCA1 levels and higher apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux than those from WT mice. ABCA1 protein levels in liver were also higher in miR-33-deficient mice than in WT mice. Moreover, miR-33-deficient mice had significantly higher serum HDL cholesterol levels than WT mice. These data establish a critical role for miR-33 in the regulation of ABCA1 expression and HDL biogenesis in vivo.
