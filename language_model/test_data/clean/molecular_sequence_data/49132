A novel CXC chemokine was identified for the first time in fish from common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). The gene was obtained from the head kidney (HK) stimulated with LPS and Con A. The cDNA consists of 619 bp with a 37 bp 5' UTR and a 287 bp 3' UTR. An open reading frame of 368 bp encodes a 97 amino acid peptide, with a putative signal peptide of 20 aa. The gene has four cysteines residues, which are conserved, with first two cysteines separated with phenylalanine. By homology and phylogenetic analysis, the chemokine was found to be closer to human IP-10. Identities were significantly low to the CXC chemokines cloned from lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis), flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss) and zebrafish (Danio rerio). The carp CXC chemokine contains three exons interrupted by two introns. The gene was transcribed from an early time point by stimulation with LPS and Con A. Organs in resting phase as well as stimulated expressed the gene.
