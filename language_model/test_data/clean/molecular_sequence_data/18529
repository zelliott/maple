The CRF08_BC strain is one of the most predominant circulating Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains in the Chinese pandemic. A simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) encoding HIV-1 CRF08_BC env is highly desirable to evaluate candidate AIDS vaccines in non-human primates.

SHIV-KBQJ-12, which carries the envelope glycoprotein from QJ001, an infectious molecular clone of HIV-1 CRF08_BC, was generated. The replication capacity of SHIV-KBQJ-12 was determined both in human and rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in Chinese rhesus macaques.

SHIV-KBQJ-12 replicated efficiently in human and macaque PBMCs and displayed a preference for CCR5 as an entry coreceptor. Productive infection of two macaques by intravenous inoculation with SHIV-KBQJ-12 was confirmed.

SHIV-KBQJ-12 is an R5-tropic chimeric virus that can establish productive infection both in vitro and in vivo in Chinese rhesus macaques and will be useful to assess candidate HIV-1 CRF08_BC vaccines in China.
