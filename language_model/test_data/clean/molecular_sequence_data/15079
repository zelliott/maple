Eukaryotic elongation factor one alpha (eEF1A) encoding genes are part of the large GTP binding protein family. The eEF1A family is important for protein synthesis and actin filament and bundle formation. In this study, the expression of four eEF1A genes in Arabidopsis thaliana is reported. Microarray analyses of the gene family showed high expression levels in germinating seeds, embryos, and shoot and root meristems. Quantitative real time RT-PCR was used to determine individual eEF1A gene expression. Unlike animals, in Arabidopsis tissues all four eEF1A genes were expressed in all tissues sampled. However, the abundance of each transcript varied spatially. Knocking out expression of one eEF1A gene produced seedlings with stunted roots and a subsequent change in expression of the other three eEF1A genes. The varying abundance of each gene in different tissues may indicate different concentration requirements for each message product. These results will be very useful for elucidating the role of each gene in growth, development, and stress responses of the plant.
