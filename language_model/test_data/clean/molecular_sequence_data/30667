The protein components that direct and activate accurate transcription by rat RNA polymerase I were studied in extracts of Novikoff hepatoma ascites cells. A minimum of at least two components, besides RNA polymerase I, that are necessary for efficient utilization of templates were identified. The first factor, rat SL-1, is required for species-specific recognition of the rat RNA polymerase I promoter and may be sufficient to direct transcription by pure RNA polymerase I. Rat SL-1 directed the transcription of templates deleted to -31, the 5' boundary of the core promoter element (+1 being the transcription initiation site). The second factor, rUBF, increased the efficiency of template utilization. Transcription of deletion mutants indicated that the 5' boundary of the domain required for rUBF lay between -137 and -127. Experiments using block substitution mutants confirmed and extended these observations. Transcription experiments using those mutants demonstrated that two regions within the upstream promoter element were required for optimal levels of transcription in vitro. The first region was centered on nucleotides -129 and -124. The 5' boundary of the second domain mapped to between nucleotides -106 and -101. DNase footprint experiments using highly purified rUBF indicated that rUBF bound between -130 and -50. However, mutation of nucleotides -129 and -124 did not affect the rUBF footprint. These results indicate that basal levels of transcription by RNA polymerase I may require only SL-1 and the core promoter element. However, higher transcription levels are mediated by additional interactions of rUBF, and possibly SL-1, bound to distal promoter elements.
