Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHB) is an autosomal codominant disorder characterized by abnormally low plasma levels of apoB and LDL cholesterol. Heterozygotes for FHB almost always have plasma LDL cholesterol levels < 70 mg/dL and are asymptomatic. Because the low cholesterol levels may protect FHB heterozygotes from coronary heart disease, the mechanisms for FHB are of considerable interest.

The plasma lipoproteins of 29 subjects with LDL cholesterol levels < 70 mg/dL were examined by SDS-PAGE. One subject who had virtually undetectable levels of LDL cholesterol had a truncated apoB, apoB-44.4, in his lipoproteins; a second subject with an LDL cholesterol level of 44 mg/dL had apoB-55 in his lipoproteins. The apoB-44.4 (2014 amino acids in length) resulted from a frameshift caused by an 11-bp insertion in exon 26 of the apoB gene; the apoB-55 (2494 amino acids) was caused by a nonsense mutation in exon 26 of the apoB gene. The apoB-55 mutation occurred at a CpG dinucleotide pair, a mutational hot spot, and was identical to a mutation described previously in a subject with hypobetalipoproteinemia. Our subject with apoB-55, however, had a different haplotype than the subject described previously, suggesting that the two apoB-55 mutations may have arisen independently. Of note, the apoB-55 proband's father, who had very low cholesterol levels and who probably carried the apoB-55 mutation, had significant coronary and aortic atherosclerosis at autopsy.

In a study of adults with low LDL cholesterol levels, we discovered two subjects with truncated apoB proteins and identified the responsible mutations. ApoB gene mutations causing truncated apoB are not particularly rare in subjects with low cholesterol levels. The role of these mutations in preventing atherosclerosis deserves further study.
