Various studies have provided evidence for the existence of spontaneously active cytosolic species of protein phosphatase 1, but these enzymes have never been purified and characterized. We have used chromatography on microcystin-Sepharose and Resource Q to purify cytosolic protein phosphatases from rat liver. Two of the isolated enzymes were identified by Western analysis and peptide sequencing as complexes of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 and either the inhibitor NIPP1 or the myosin-binding subunit MYPT1, which reportedly is not present in chicken liver. In contrast, PCR cloning revealed the expression of two MYPT1 splice variants in rat liver.
