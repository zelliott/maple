The sdhB gene, encoding the iron-sulfur protein (Ip) subunit of succinate dehydrogenase (Sdh, EC 1.3.99.1), has been cloned from the violet root rot fungus, Helicobasidium mompa, and characterized. The promoter region contains a CCAAT box, TATA-like box, and CT-rich region. The gene is interrupted by eight introns and is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 291 amino acid residues. The putative amino acid sequence of the encoded product of sdhB gene from H. mompa shows high homology to the other known sdhB genes and is 79% identical to the Ip subunit of SdhB of Uromyces fabae. Three cysteine-rich clusters associated with the iron-sulfur centers involved in electron transport were particularly well conserved. One of these clusters contains a critical histidine residue implicated in carboxin sensitivity in the basidiomycetes. Only one copy of the gene was present in the genome of H. mompa, and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis of mRNA expression showed that the sdhB gene was transcribed in potato dextrose broth.
