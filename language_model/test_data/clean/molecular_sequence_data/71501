Human neuropeptide Y (hNPY) and the Q34-->P34 mutant (P34-hNPY) have been characterized by CD spectroscopy. hNPY self-associates in aqueous solution with a dimerization constant in the micromolar range. The self-association correlates with an increase in secondary-structure content which was studied as a function of concentration, temperature and pH. The effects of temperature were measured in water (5-84 degrees C) and in ethanediol/water (2 : 1) (-90 degrees to +90 degrees C). A single-residue mutation, Q34-->P34, affects the pH, thermal and self-association properties of NPY. The CD results are correlated with photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization NMR experiments which show that the tyrosines at the interface between two monomer units present limited accessibility to a photoreactive dye. An equilibrium state is described, involving a PP-fold monomer form and a handshake dimer form, that accommodates the physicochemical properties of NPY.
