Mutations of the EYA1 gene (8q13.3) are the most common known cause of the branchio-oto-renal dysplasia (BOR), an autosomal dominant disease that includes developmental defects of branchial arch structures, middle and/or inner ear and kidney. The distinction between BOR and other dysplasias, such as oto-facio-cervical syndrome (OFC), is challenged by frequent association of the former to other diverse malformations, and by variable expressivity even within the same family. OFC is characterized by trophic alterations of the facies and shoulder girdle in addition to the malformations seen in BOR. Recent characterization of one OFC patient shed some light on the controversy over whether OFC and BOR are the same disease, and led to the hypothesis that OFC is caused by contiguous deletions of EYA1 and adjacent genes. By contrast, we show here that an OFC patient bears a single-nucleotide substitution in a splice site of EYA1. Our results indicate that not only major rearrangements, but also point mutations altering the EYA1 reading frame, can be found in patients with OFC syndrome.
