Two conserved regions in the sequence of the NS5 gene of Flaviviruses were identified. Primers were designed from the consensus sequence of these regions and were used in a reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) to amplify a region of the central european tick-borne encephalitis virus Kumlinge NS5 gene. The authenticity of the amplified fragment was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. A band of the expected size was also obtained when this RT/PCR was applied to 13 other flaviviral RNAs. This method may be useful for characterisation of the NS5 genes of flaviviruses and as a potential pan-flavivirus diagnostic tool.
