Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), the most important human systemic mycosis in Latin America, is known to be caused by at least four different phylogenetic lineages within the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis complex, including S1, PS2, PS3, and Pb01-like group. Herein, we describe two cases of PCM in patients native from the Amazon region. The disease was originally thought to have been caused by P. brasiliensis. Despite the severity of the cases, sera from the patients were negative in immunodiffusion tests using the standard exoantigen from P. brasiliensis B-339. However, a positive response was recorded with an autologous preparation of Paracoccidioides lutzii exoantigen. A phylogenetic approach based on the gp43 and ARF loci revealed high similarity between our clinical isolates and the Pb01-like group. The occurrence of PCM caused by P. lutzii in the Brazilian Amazon (Par√° State) was thus proven. The incidence of PCM caused by P. lutzii may be underestimated in northern Brazil.
