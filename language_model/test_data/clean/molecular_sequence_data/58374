Pinnipeds (Otariidae, Odobenidae, and Phocidae) in the order Carnivora have one or two types (Hb I and Hb II) of hemoglobin components. These hemoglobins consist of identical beta chains and different alpha chains. We determined the complete amino acid sequences of the hemoglobin beta chain of three species of Otariidae (Australian sea lion, South American sea lion, and northern sea lion) and two species of Phocidae (ringed seal and harp seal) from intact beta chain and chemical cleavage fragments. The sequences are similar to beta chains of the already known sequences of pinnipeds. These sequences were compared with those of other carnivores (Mustelidae, Ursidae, Canidae, and Felidae) and adult human hemoglobin beta chain. Using Artiodactyla (pig) as an outgroup, we find that the tree constructed by means of phylogenetic analysis shows that Odobenidae is closest to Otariidae, and that Otariidae and Odobenidae are closer to Mustelidae than to Phocidae.
