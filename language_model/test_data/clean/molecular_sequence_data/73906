The equine SCID defect is more severe than its murine counterpart in that SCID foals are incapable of forming either coding or signal joints, whereas SCID mice manifest normal signal joint formation. To determine the basis of this difference and whether DNA-dependent kinase, catalytic subunit (DNA-PK(CS)), is involved in signal joint formation, equine DNA-PK(CS) transcripts were cloned and sequenced from normal and SCID cell lines. In the mutant allele, a frame-shift mutation truncates the protein N terminal of the domain with homology to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family resulting in complete absence of full length DNA-PK(CS) and accounting for the kinase-negative phenotype of these cells; the mutation in SCID mice allows for some DNA-PK(CS) expression. The difference in DNA-PK(CS) expression in SCID mice and foals explains the more severe phenotype of equine SCID, and definition of DNA-PK(CS) as the defect in equine SCID demonstrates that DNA-PK(CS) is required for both coding and signal joint formation.
