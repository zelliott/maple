The cydAB operon encodes the two subunits of the cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase from Escherichia coli. This enzyme is one of two terminal oxidases in the aerobic respiratory chain of E. coli. It has been demonstrated that expression of the cyd operon is transcriptionally regulated by oxygen via both the fnr and arcA gene products. Whereas arcA clearly serves as a positive regulator at low oxygen tension, there is no consensus concerning the role of the fnr gene product (FNR). In this paper, the transcriptional start site of the cyd operon is identified at position -287 with respect to the translational start. This is located 53 basepairs downstream from the center of dyad symmetry of the putative FNR recognition sequence.
