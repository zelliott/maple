A gonadotropin receptor was cloned from amago salmon (Oncorhynchus rhodurus) ovarian follicles. This receptor (sGTH-R) belongs to the glycoprotein hormone receptor family with a large extracellular and seven-transmembrane domains. Its sequence homology is highest with mammalian LH receptors. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that sGTH-R is grouped with mammalian and chicken FSH and LH receptors, but not with mammalian TSH receptors. sGTH-R is expressed dominantly in the ovary and testis. Functional characterization examined with transiently transfected mammalian cells revealed increased intracellular cAMP level when exposed to mammalian and fish gonadotropins; the most potent hormone was salmon GTH II. These results indicate that the cloned cDNA encodes a functional amago salmon GTH receptor protein.
