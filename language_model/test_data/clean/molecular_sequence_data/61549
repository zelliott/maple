The objective of this study was to evaluate the low weight (10-30 kDa) protein profile of bovine seminal plasma using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and to determine if any of these proteins was associated with semen freezability. Seminal plasma was collected from 16 bulls of high or low semen freezability. Twelve protein spots were identified from the 2D gel (15%); six of these were present in all samples. Of the 12 proteins found, three spots, present in all samples, 3 (15-16 kDa), 5 (16-17 kDa), and 7 (10-12 kDa) had nonsignificant variation among bulls, regardless of their freezability classification. Four proteins were more abundant (P<0.05) in seminal plasma samples collected from bulls with high semen freezability than in samples of bulls with low semen freezability: the spots 3 (15-16 kDa, pI 4.7-5.2), 7 (11-12 kDa, pI 4.8-4.9), 11 (13-14 kDa, pI 4.0-4.5), and 23 (20-22 kDa, pI 4.8-5.2). On the other hand, spot 25 (25-26 kDa, pI 6.0-6.5) was more abundant (P<0.05) on seminal plasma samples from bulls with low semen freezability. The N-terminus sequence of protein 7 was identical to the acidic seminal fluid protein (aSFP). Protein 23 (after trypsin digestion) had structural similarity to bovine clusterin. We concluded that there were differences in the seminal plasma protein profile from bulls with low and high semen freezability; aSFP, clusterin, proteins 3 and 11 may be used as semen freezability markers; and protein 25 was related to low semen freezability.
