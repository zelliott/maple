The flavivirus fusion protein E contains a "stem" region which is hypothesized to be crucial for driving fusion. This sequence element connects the ectodomain to the membrane anchor, and its structure in the trimeric postfusion conformation is still poorly defined. Using E trimers of tick-borne encephalitis virus with stem truncations of different lengths, we show that the N-terminal part of the stem increases trimer stability and also modulates the trimer structure outside the stem interaction site.
