Multiple species of metastrongylid lungworm (Nematoda: Metastrongyloidea) have been reported to infect members of the Felidae. This study describes two metastrongylid species infecting cats in Ibiza, Spain, including clinical features of infection and diagnosis via morphological and molecular characterisation of larval stages. Cats (n=7) presented with suspect lungworm infection, exhibiting coughing and other respiratory signs of infection. Faecal samples were collected from each cat and were subjected to the Baermann method for the detection of first stage larvae. In four cats, two different species of larvae were observed on the basis of morphology and were further molecularly characterised by PCR and sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene. Sequence data confirmed the presence of Aelurostrongylus abstrusus and an unknown species of Troglostrongylus. Molecular characterisation of Oslerus rostratus is also reported for the first time. Given the diversity of metastrongylid species capable of infecting cats, and morphological similarity of larval stages, an emphasis should be placed on the use of molecular characterisation for accurate diagnosis of infection.
