An O-polysaccharide (O-antigen) was isolated by mild acid degradation of the lipopolysaccharide of Providencia alcalifaciens O60 and studied by sugar and methylation analyses as well as (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy, including 2D ROESY and (1)H,(13)C HMBC experiments in D(2)O and a ROESY experiment in a 9:1 H(2)O-D(2)O mixture to reveal correlations for NH protons. It was found that the polysaccharide is built up of linear pentasaccharide repeating units containing an amide of d-glucuronic acid with l-serine and has the following structure: The O-antigen studied is structurally and serologically closely related to the O-antigen of Proteus vulgaris O44.
