We have investigated the mutagenic properties of an abasic site in DNA by transfecting SOS-induced and uninduced cells of E. coli with a single-stranded M13mp7-based vector that carries a single example of this lesion at one or other of two unique and adjacent sites. Random samples of progeny phage were sequenced to determine the nature of the replication events that occurred at and around these locations. 5% to 7% of the vectors could be replicated in SOS-induced cells, but only 0.1% to 0.7% of them gave plaques in the absence of SOS induction. In SOS-induced cells, 93% and 96% of the phage replicated resulted from the insertion of a nucleotide opposite the abasic site, while the remainder resulted from a targeted omission of a single nucleotide. At one of the sites, nucleotide insertions were 54% dAMP, 25% dTMP, 20% dGMP and 1% dCMP. At the other site they were 80% dAMP, 4% dTMP, 15% dGMP and 1% dCMP. The sequence variation in all but two of the 204 sequences analyzed was restricted to the abasic site itself. In the remaining two, a change at the abasic site was accompanied by a mutation at an immediately flanking nucleotide.
