The prevalence of herpesvirus DNA was examined in inflammatory bowel disease tissue. DNA was extracted from resection and biopsy specimens of the large intestine from patients with ulcerative colitis (n = 21), patients with Crohn's disease (n = 29), and patients with noninflammatory bowel disease (controls) (n = 21). The nested polymerase chain reaction was used to detect viral DNA using primer pairs specific for either cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6), varicella zoster virus (VZV), or Epstein Barr virus (EBV). HSV1 and VZV DNA were not detected in any of tissue samples. There was a high prevalence of CMV (81%), HHV6 (76%), and EBV (76%) DNA in ulcerative colitis tissue compared to Crohn's disease tissues (CMV 66%, HHV6 45%, EBV 55%). Control tissue had a relatively low frequency of CMV (29%) and EBV (19%) DNA but a prevalence of HHV6 DNA similar to that of ulcerative colitis (86%). However, the simultaneous presence of HHV6 and CMV and/or EBV DNA in ulcerative colitis tissue (76%) was much greater than in either Crohn's disease tissues (38%) or control tissue (29%) (P < 0.05). There was a low prevalence of CMV, HHV6, and EBV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from all patient groups. CMV and EBV are capable of reactivating HHV6: the high prevalence of coexistent HHV6 infection with either or both of these two viruses in ulcerative colitis tissue suggests that they may play a synergistic role in the pathogenesis of this disease.
