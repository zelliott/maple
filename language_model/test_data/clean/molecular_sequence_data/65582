Electron detachment from peptide dianions is studied as a function of the laser wavelength. The first step for the detachment is a resonant electronic excitation of the dianions. Electronic excitation spectra are reported for three peptides, including gramicidin. A comparative study of the detachment yield for 13 peptides was performed at 260 nm and at 220 nm. At 260 nm, the detachment yield is mainly driven by the sum of the absorption coefficients of the aromatic amino acids that are contained in the peptide. At 220 nm, no direct relation is observed between the electron photodetachement yields and the sum of absorption efficiencies. At this wavelength, the sequence and the structure of the peptide may have an influence on the photodetachment process.
