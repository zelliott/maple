Lactating mothers of 7.5-day neonatal rats were injected intraperitoneally with 500 mg kg-1 clofibrate for 3 consecutive days at 24-hour intervals; 24 hours after the final injection, the maternal cytochrome P450 4A (CYP4A) mRNA levels had risen 14- and 2.5-fold above the constitutive levels of expression seen in the liver and kidney, respectively. Lactational transfer of clofibrate to the suckling 10.5-day litter was demonstrated by the 15- and 5-fold elevation observed in the neonatal hepatic and renal CYP4A mRNAs, respectively, following suckling from drug-induced mothers. A significant decrease in the relative liver weights of these neonatal pups was seen following clofibrate exposure via maternal milk, in total contrast to the normally observed increase in liver/body weight ratios of rats treated with clofibrate. Western blot analysis using a polyclonal goat anti-rat CYP4A1 antibody also demonstrated a rise in the CYP4A protein levels in both the mothers and their litters following maternal clofibrate treatment.
