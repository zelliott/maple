The spliceosomal UsnRNAs U2, U4 and U6 from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cre) were sequenced using a combination of RNA and cDNA sequencing methods and were compared to other sequenced UsnRNAs. The lengths of Cre U6 and Cre U2 RNAs are similar to those of their higher plant equivalents. Cre U4 RNA is shorter (139 nt) than its counterpart from higher plants (150-154 nt), and contains stem IV and loop D which are absent, with the exception of the Tetrahymena U4 RNA, from the U4 RNAs of other unicellular organisms studied to date. Base-pairing interactions between U6 and U4 RNAs and between U6 and U2 RNAs, identical to those described for mammalian and yeast systems, are structurally feasible in the Cre system. In addition, based on comparative analyses of the predicted U4/U6 RNA duplex from various species, an evolutionary conserved third putative U6-U4 interaction was found. Interestingly, it can also be formed with the recently discovered U6atac and U4atac RNAs. This is a strong support in favor of the possible biological significance of this third putative interaction. Based on comparative analysis, an extension of the earlier described U6-U2 interaction patterns is also proposed.
