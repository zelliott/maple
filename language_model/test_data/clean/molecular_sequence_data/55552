The infection rate of Helicobacter pylori is high all over the world, especially in the Chinese Tibetan Plateau. Here, we report the genome sequence of Helicobacter pylori strain XZ274 isolated from a Tibetan patient with gastric cancer. The strain contains 1,634,138 bp with 1,654 coding sequences and a pXZ274 plasmid of 22,406 bp with 26 coding sequences. This is the first complete genome sequence of Helicobacter pylori from the Tibetan Plateau in China.
