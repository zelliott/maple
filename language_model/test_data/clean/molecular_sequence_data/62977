We examined changes in the levels of prostacyclin (PGI2) synthase mRNA and 6-keto-PGF1alpha, a stable metabolite of PGI2, in the caprine corpus luteum (CL) during its development and subsequent maintenance. We also looked at the effects of a potent GnRH antagonist (GA), which is known to suppress the release of luteinizing hormone (LH), on the PGI2 synthase mRNA level and the 6-keto-PGF1alpha content during CL development. Goats were divided into a control group (n=12) and a GA-treated group (n=6). They were treated with saline or GA (50 microg/kg, s.c.) on days 0 (day of ovulation), 4, and 8 (control only), and the CL were collected from a subset of goats (n=3 for each day) on days 0 (no saline), 4, 8, or 14 (control only). Ribonuclease protection assay was performed to quantify the mRNA in the CL using specific cRNA probes generated by RT-PCR and in vitro transcription. The 6-keto-PGF1alpha content in the CL was measured by radioimmunoassay. The level of PGI2 synthase mRNA and the 6-keto-PGF1alpha content in the CL in the control group decreased from day 0 to day 4 (P<0.01), and did not change thereafter from day 4 to day 14. Levels of PGI2 synthase mRNA and 6-keto-PGF1alpha content in the CL on days 4 and 8 were not affected by treatment with GA. These results suggest that PGI2 synthesis is regulated upward at the beginning of caprine CL formation; this may play a role in initiating CL development. This study also suggests that changes of PGI2 synthesis during CL development are probably not regulated by LH.
