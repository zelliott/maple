The autoantibodies (aAbs) directed against the ribosomal P proteins (RPP aAbs) are known to react mainly against epitopes localized within the common C-terminal sequence of the three acidic ribosomal P proteins, P0, P1 and P2. In order to investigate the opportunity to select short recombinant peptides of this common C-terminal sequence to detect the RPP-aAbs, the location of the epitopes recognized by ribosomal proteins (RP) aAb(+)sera of systemic lupus erythematosus patients (SLE) was investigated. Immunoblotting and ELISA techniques using extracted or recombinant, entire or cleaved RPP showed that 55% of the RP aAbs were directed against the three ribosomal P0, P1, and P2 proteins. The epitopes recognized by the RPP aAbs are located not only within the C-terminal sequence common to the three proteins but also within the N-terminal sequence of the P2 or P1 protein. The other RP aAbs sera (45%) did not react with all three proteins but with some of them, and showed the following pattern: P0(+)P1(+); P1(+); P2(+); P0(+)and P1(+). They recognized epitopes located in the region of the C-terminal sequence of the protein but not common to the three proteins. In addition two out of the six monoclonal Abs produced by immunization of mice using the P1 protein did not react with the peptide N-65 or N-71 of the P2 protein or with the C-terminal sequence of the three proteins. In conclusion, this study showed that the RPP aAb in SLE patients are not only directed against epitopes within the C-terminal sequence shared by the three acidic ribosomal P proteins. In view of these data it seems necessary to be cautious in using only a C-terminal peptide of ribosomal P proteins in tests performed to detect RPP aAb in human sera.
