Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase phosphatase (CaMKP) is a member of the serine/threonine protein phosphatases and shares 29% sequence identity with protein phosphatase 2Calpha (PP2Calpha) in its catalytic domain. To investigate the functional domains of CaMKP, mutational analysis was carried out using various recombinant CaMKPs expressed in Escherichia coli. Analysis of N-terminal deletion mutants showed that the N-terminal region of CaMKP played important roles in the formation of the catalytically active structure of the enzyme, and a critical role in polycation stimulation. A chimera mutant, a fusion of the N-terminal domain of CaMKP and the catalytic domain of PP2Calpha, exhibited similar substrate specificity to CaMKP but not to PP2Calpha, suggesting that the N-terminal region of CaMKP is crucial for its unique substrate specificity. Point mutations at Arg-162, Asp-194, His-196, and Asp-400, highly conserved amino acid residues in the catalytic domain of PP2C family, resulted in a significant loss of phosphatase activity, indicating that these amino acid residues may play important roles in the catalytic activity of CaMKP. Although CaMKP(1-412), a C-terminal truncation mutant, retained phosphatase activity, it was found to be much less stable upon incubation at 37 degrees C than wild type CaMKP, indicating that the C-terminal region of CaMKP is important for the maintenance of the catalytically active conformation. The results suggested that the N- and C-terminal sequences of CaMKP are essential for the regulation and stability of CaMKP.
