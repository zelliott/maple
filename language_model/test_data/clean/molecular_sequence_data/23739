HIV-1 strain diversity was examined in a study population that consisted of hospital and clinic patients from seven cities and villages located in the northwestern regions of Cameroon. Specimens were screened using a serological algorithm designed to identify HIV-1 group M, N, and O, and SIVcpz-like infections followed by RT-PCR amplification to characterize the infecting virus. The results show that the HIV epidemic in northwest Cameroon is dominated by HIV-1 group M CRF02_AG infections (57%). Additional group M subtypes present include A, D, F2, G, and CRF01_AE. Based on discordant subtype classification between gag and env sequences, a high percentage (23%) of viral strains appear to be unique intersubtype recombinants with the majority (88%) involving recombination with CRF02_AG. Group O prevalence is low accounting for only 0.4% of HIV infections. However, group O strain diversity is high; isolates from clades I, IV, and V, as well as unclassified and recombinant strains, were found. Three dual infections by HIV-1 group M and group O were identified and characterized. In two specimens, both group M and O sequences were amplified in gag, pol, and env suggesting the presence of both viruses. Analysis of the third specimen shows the presence of a group O virus and an intergroup M/O recombinant virus. Finally, no infections due to HIV-1 group N or SIVcpz-like strains were found in the study population.
