A Lactococcus lactis subspecies-specific primer was designed based on their repetitive genome sequences. This primer enabled L. lactis subspecies to be identified simultaneously at both the species level and also the strain level. Based on studies using 70 strains of L. lactis and 60 strains of other non-target bacteria, the identification completely matched that obtained by the sequence of the 16S rRNA gene. However, inconsistency between phenotypic and genotypic characteristics was observed in some strains isolated from milk.
