A novel tripeptide motif called a nest has recently been described in proteins with the function of binding anionic, or partially anionic, atoms such as carbonyl O atoms. In the present work, a search for nests in small polypeptides stored in the Cambridge Structural Database is reported. 37 unique examples were found: over half form part of hydrogen-bond arrangements resembling those in proteins, such as Schellman/paperclip loop motifs, various types of beta-turn and Asx-turns or Ser/Thr-turns, while a third are in novel situations, some involving binding to anionic groups from other molecules within the crystal complex. An example is the antibiotic vancomycin, which incorporates a prominent nest forming part of a peptide-binding site. This nest binds the carboxylate of the C-terminal D-alanine of the bacterial cell-wall precursor peptide, thereby inhibiting the final step of bacterial cell-wall synthesis. As in proteins, a number of nests occur in short peptides with an alternating glycine/L-amino-acid sequence but, uniquely to non-ribosomally synthesized short peptides, several nests within them are constructed from alternating D- and L-amino acids, and such sequences seem to specially favour nests.
