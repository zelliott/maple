The isolation of a cDNA corresponding to a portion (amino acid 943 to 1073) of the cytoplasmic domain of the mouse EGF receptor surrounding the auto phosphorylation sites was obtained by using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach. Deduced amino acid sequence of mouse EGF receptor (EGFr) shows a 92% and 76% homology to corresponding regions in the human and the chicken EGFr, respectively. This cDNA was used to develop a sensitive RNase protection assay to investigate EGF receptor mRNA expression in mouse C3H teratoma derived cell lines with increased tumorigenic properties which display a progressive decrease of EGF binding and response. The results show that increased tumorigenicity was not accompanied by a change in EGF receptor mRNA expression. Moreover, they indicate that the RNase protection assay developed using the probe described here is a sensitive approach to investigate EGF receptor expression in murine cells.
