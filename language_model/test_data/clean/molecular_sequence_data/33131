Cell cycle progression is tightly controlled by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). CDK2 plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression, but how CDK2 is regulated is still incompletely understood. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a novel gene CAC1 that regulates CDK2 activity. The open reading frame sequence of this gene encodes a protein of 369 amino acids which contains a Cullin domain, and this protein is physically associated with CDK2. As such, we have designated it Cdk-Associated Cullin1, or CAC1. CAC1 is highly expressed in cancer tissues and cancer cell lines. Interestingly, CAC1 is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner and its expression is high in late G(1) to S phase. Knockdown of CAC1 by RNAi inhibits cell proliferation and induces G(1)/S arrest. Since CAC1 interacts with CDK2 and promotes the kinase activity of CDK2 protein, we propose that CAC1 is a novel cell cycle associated protein capable of promoting cell proliferation. Our data provide insight into the mechanism by which CDK2 is regulated and the molecular basis of cell cycle progression in cancer.
