Mouse monoclonal antibody AA4 inhibits the binding of IgE to high affinity IgE receptors on the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3. As shown by immunostaining of thin layer chromatograms, antibody AA4 binds avidly to two disialogangliosides (antigen I and antigen II) that occur in this cell line. The two antigens were purified by anion exchange chromatography followed by short-bed continuous thin-layer chromatography. About 230 micrograms of antigen I and 60 micrograms of antigen II were obtained from 20 g (wet weight) of leukemia cells. The structures of both purified antigens were determined to be alpha-galactosyl derivatives of the ganglioside GD1b by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, by chemical ionization-mass spectrometry of permethylated samples, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of partially methylated alditol acetates, and by treatment with exoglycosidases and mild acid hydrolysis. The structure of antigen I is: (formula; see text) Antigen II has an additional alpha-galactosyl residue as follows: (formula; see text) The ceramide of antigen I contains approximately equal amounts of C24:0, C22:0, C20:0, C18:0, and C16:0 N-acyl fatty acids. The ceramide base is predominantly sphingosine along with a small amount of dihydrosphingosine. In contrast, the ceramide of antigen II contains mainly C24:0 N-acyl fatty acid with much lower amounts of C22:0, C20:0, and C18:0 fatty acids. Moreover, the ceramide base is approximately 55% sphingosine and 45% dihydrosphingosine. No unsaturated N-acyl fatty acids were detected in either antigen.
