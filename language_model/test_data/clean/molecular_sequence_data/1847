Kcv is a 94-amino acid protein encoded by chlorella virus PBCV-1 that corresponds to the pore module of K(+) channels. Therefore, Kcv can be a model for studying the protein design of K(+) channel pores. We analyzed the molecular diversity generated by approximately 1 billion years of evolution on kcv genes isolated from 40 additional chlorella viruses. Because the channel is apparently required for virus replication, the Kcv variants are all functional and contain multiple and dispersed substitutions that represent a repertoire of allowed sets of amino acid substitutions (from 4 to 12 amino acids). Correlations between amino acid substitutions and the new properties displayed by these channels guided site-directed mutations that revealed synergistic amino acid interactions within the protein as well as previously unknown interactions between distant channel domains. The effects of these multiple changes were not predictable from a priori structural knowledge of the channel pore.
