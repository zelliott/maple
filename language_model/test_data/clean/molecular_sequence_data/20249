The Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is comprised of at least 10 closely related species of Gram-negative proteobacteria that are associated with infections in certain groups of immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with cystic fibrosis. Infections in humans tend to occur in the lungs, which present an iron-restricted environment to a prospective pathogen, and accordingly members of the Bcc appear to possess efficient mechanisms for iron capture. These bacteria specify up to four different types of siderophore (ornibactin, pyochelin, cepabactin and cepaciachelin) that employ the full repertoire of iron-binding groups present in most naturally occurring siderophores. Members of the Bcc are also capable of utilising some exogenous siderophores that they are not able to synthesise. In addition to siderophore-mediated mechanisms of iron uptake, the Bcc possess mechanisms for acquiring iron from haem and from ferritin. The Bcc therefore appear to be well-equipped for life in an iron-poor environment.
