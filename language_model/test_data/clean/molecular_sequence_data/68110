We report here the isolation and characterization of a novel human elongation factor-1 beta (EF-1 beta) gene by cDNA selection from YAC mapping on chromosome 5q12-q14. This gene is specifically transcribed in fetal brain and in skeletal muscle and is characterized by a complete sequence homology with previously described EF-1 beta cDNAs. We also assigned the loci for three other EF-1 beta isoforms, to human chromosomes 2, 15 and X. The multiple chromosomal assignments of EF-1 beta loci demonstrates the genetic heterogeneity of human EF-1 beta peptides.
