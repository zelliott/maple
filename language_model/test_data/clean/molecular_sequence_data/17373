The nucleotide sequences of the DNA gyrase B subunit gene (gyrB) of Fusobacterium necrophorum subsp. necrophorum, F. necrophorum subsp. funduliforme and F. varium were determined and analyzed together with those of F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum and F. nucleatum subsp. vincentii. On the phylogenetic tree constructed, the strains of each fusobacterial species formed distinct clusters with deep sublines. The degree of sequence similarity within each cluster was 93.2% or more, whereas similarities between clusters ranged from 70.1 to 72.7%. These clusters were recovered with 100% bootstrap probabilities and are in very good agreement with the species of Fusobacterium. These data suggest that gyrB is an accurate genealogical marker for the classification of the fusobacterial taxa considered in this study.
