The structure of enterocin NKR-5-3C, an anti-listerial bacteriocin produced by a multiple bacteriocin producer, Enterococcus faecium NKR-5-3, was determined. Enterocin NKR-5-3C is a novel class IIa bacteriocin that possesses an YGNGL motif sequence and two disulfide bridges in its structure. It is encoded on gene ent53C together with an 18-amino-acid-residue double glycine leader peptide.
