The dynamic changes in mRNA expression levels for vasotocin (AVT) and isotocin (IT) receptor gene levels were assessed in a time-course response study in immature male specimens of the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) submitted to hyper- (55‰ salinity) and hypo-osmotic (5‰ salinity) challenges. Two different cDNAs for the AVT receptor and one for the IT receptor (V1a2-type and V2-type AVTR, and ITR, respectively) were cloned by screening an S. aurata brain cDNA library. Genes for these receptors were expressed differentially and is nearly ubiquitously in 26 of the examined tissues. In the gills, both environmental salinity challenges up-regulated AVTR V1a2-type gene expression concomitantly with mRNA expression protein activity of Na(+), K(+)-ATPase gene expression and protein, whereas the AVTR V2-type and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mRNA levels were associated with mRNAs environmental salinity, indicating a possible connection between AVTRs and these transporters. In kidney, AVTR V1a2-type gene expression peaked rapidly and lasted only a short time (12-24h) in response to both osmotic challenges. In contrast, AVTR V2-type mRNA levels were enhanced in specimens exposed to hyperosmotic conditions, whereas they decreased under hypoosmotic environments, suggesting an antidiuretic role related to the vasoconstriction function. In the hypothalamus, only the expression of the AVTR V2-type gene was enhanced at 7 and 14 days under both experimental conditions. In the liver, both AVTRs had increased mRNA levels, with the upregulation of their AVTR V2-type gene increasing faster than the V1a2-type. The ITR gene was not sensitive to variations of external salinity in any of the analyzed tissues. Our results demonstrate the involvement of the vasotocinergic, but not the isotocinergic, pathway as well as the hypothalamic function, in the adjustments of both osmoregulatory and metabolic processes after osmotic challenges.
