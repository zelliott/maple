Microcell hybrids containing various regions of human chromosome 8 were formed by microcell-mediated transfer of neo-tagged chromosome 8 into the cells derived from severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse. Thus, 110 cosmid markers were isolated from SV40-transformed SCID fibroblast cell line (SCVA) containing a p12-q11.1 region of human chromosome 8 and were assigned to eight regions in 8p12-q11.1, using a microcell-hybrid panel. For positional cloning of a human gene that restores the DNA-repair defect in a mouse with SCID on 8p11.1-q11.1 (SCID region), we constructed a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig of about 4.5 Mb. Overlapping YACs were further aligned by restriction mapping, using rare-cutting restriction endonucleases. The cosmids and YAC contig should facilitate isolation of the SCID gene and other genes, such as the Werner syndrome-responsible gene in or near this region.
