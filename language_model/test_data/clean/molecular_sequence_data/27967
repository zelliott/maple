The membrane bound acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo marmorata was photolabeled by the noncompetitive channel blocker ]3H]chlorpromazine under equilibrium conditions in the presence of the agonist carbamoylcholine. The radioactivity incorporated into the AChR subunits was reduced by addition of phencyclidine, a specific ligand for the high-affinity side for noncompetitive blockers. The alpha-subunit was purified and digested with trypsin and/or CNBr and the resulting fragments fractionated by HPLC. Sequence analysis resulted in the identification of Ser-248 as a major residue labeled by [3H]chlorpromazine in a phencyclidine-sensitive manner. This residue is located in the hydrophobic and putative transmembrane segment M2 of the alpha-subunit, a region homologous to that containing the chlorpromazine-labeled Ser-262 in the delta-chain [1] and Ser-254 and Leu-257 in the beta-chain [2]. Extended sequence analysis of the hydrophobic segment M1 further showed that no labeling-occurred in this region.
