Streptococcus canis isolates, also including S. canis of artificially contaminated milk, could be identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using oligonucleotide primers designed according to species-specific parts of the 16S rRNA gene and, after sequencing, according to S. canis-specific parts of the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region and with oligonucleotide primers detecting an internal fragment of the group G streptococcal CAMP factor gene cfg. The 16S rRNA gene- and CAMP factor gene cfg-specific oligonucleotide primers could be used together in a multiplex PCR. No cross-reactivities could be observed with other group G streptococcal isolates or with any of the other control strains of various streptococcal species and serogroups. The PCR methods presented in this study allowed a rapid and reliable identification of S. canis and might help to improve the diagnosis of this bacterial species in animal and human infections.
