Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. They play a crucial role in the initiation and progression of cancer. Some of these genes are found to be altered in human cancers, i.e., mutated, amplified, deleted, translocated, or abnormally regulated. Recently, the protein products of the genes have been purified, and antibodies against them have been developed. Studies of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes at the DNA, mRNA, or protein level may reveal new ways for diagnosis, monitoring, prognosis, and treatment of cancer. In this article, the area of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes is reviewed, with emphasis on clinical applications and biochemical testing. Although most of the currently known genetic markers are not sufficiently specific or sensitive, it is anticipated that the discovery of newer markers and the application of new analytical techniques may help in devising biochemical testing suitable for screening and early diagnosis of malignant diseases.
