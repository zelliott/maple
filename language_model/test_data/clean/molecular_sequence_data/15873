Homozygous mutations at the suppressor of Hairy-wing [su(Hw)] locus reverse the phenotype of gypsy-induced alleles in a number of genes located throughout the Drosophila genome. To understand the molecular basis of this phenomenon, the su(Hw) locus was isolated by chromosomal walking from a cloned homeo-box-containing sequence. The exact location of the gene was determined by Southern analysis of the DNA alterations associated with several su(Hw) alleles. A 9.5-kb KpnI-SalI fragment, where all the DNA changes associated with su(Hw) mutations were mapped, was able to rescue the su(Hw) mutant phenotype after P-element-mediated germ-line transformation. This DNA fragment encodes a 3.3-kb RNA that is expressed in all stages of Drosophila development; the size or abundance of this RNA is affected in several su(Hw) alleles tested. This transcript encodes a protein that contains a highly acidic region and 12 repeats of the 'Zn finger' domain characteristic of some DNA-binding and transcription-activating proteins, supporting the hypothesis that the su(Hw) locus might encode a transcription factor that plays a role in the expression of the gypsy element.
