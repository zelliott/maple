We compared the relaxant effect of original pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP)1-27 with that of a newly developed, synthetic PACAP1-27 analogue, [Arg15,20,21 Leu17]-PACAP-Gly-Lys-Arg-NH2, in human bronchi in vitro (n=4-5 in each group). Using precontraction by carbachol (0.1 microM), cumulative administration of PACAP1-27 and salbutamol caused concentration-dependent smooth muscle relaxation with similar potencies and maximum relaxant effects. Non-cumulative administration of the PACAP1-27 analogue and the original PACAP1-27 caused concentration-dependent relaxation with a similar maximum relaxant effect and potency as well. However, the onset and offset of action was markedly slower for the PACAP1-27 analogue than for the original PACAP1-27 (>90% versus <10% of peak relaxation remaining 5 h after administration). Peptidase inhibition by captopril (10 microM) and phosphoramidon (1 microM) significantly increased the maximum relaxant effect and duration of action of PACAP1-27 but not of the PACAP1-27 analogue, during the 3 h of observation in the human bronchi. We conclude that [Arg15,20,21 Leu17]-PACAP-Gly-Lys-Arg-NH2 produces significant concentration-dependent and sustained bronchial smooth muscle relaxation in vitro. The sustained relaxant effect is due, at least in part, to the synthetic PACAP1-27 analogue being less susceptible to cleavage by peptidases than the original peptide PACAP1-27.
