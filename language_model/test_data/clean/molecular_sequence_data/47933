The complete cDNA nucleotide sequence of a novel cathepsin derived from mouse placenta, termed cathepsin P, was determined. mRNA for cathepsin P was expressed in placenta and at lower levels in visceral yolk sac, but could not be detected in a range of adult tissues. The expression pattern of this protease indicates that it probably plays an important role during implantation and fetal development.
