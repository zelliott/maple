A recently identified Helicobacter pylori gene, hrgA, was previously reported to be present in 70 (33%) of 208 strains examined (T. Ando, T. M. Wassenaar, R. M. Peek, R. A. Aras, A. I. Tschumi, L.-J. Van Doorn, K. Kusugami, and M. J. Blaser, Cancer Res. 62:2385-2389, 2002). Sequence analysis of nine such strains indicated that in each strain hrgA replaced hpyIIIR, which encodes a restriction endonuclease and which, together with the gene for its cognate methyltransferase, constitutes the hpyIII locus. As a consequence of either the hrgA insertion or independent mutations, hpyIIIM function was lost in 11 (5%) of the 208 strains examined, rendering chromosomal DNA sensitive to MboI digestion. The evolutionary history of the locus containing either hpyIII or hrgA was reconstructed. By homologous recombination involving flanking sequences, hrgA and hpyIIIR can replace one another in the hpyIII locus, and there is simultaneous replacement of several flanking genes. These findings, combined with the hpyIM/iceA2 locus discovered previously, suggest that the two most strongly conserved methylase genes of H. pylori, hpyIIIM and hpyIM, are both preceded by alternative genes that compete for presence at their loci.
