To express the 3'-region (1152 bp) of the cag7 gene of Helicobacter pylori 51 strain, encoding the C-terminal 383 amino acid (ct383 aa) region of Cag7 protein that is known to cover the needle region of T4SS, in a live delivery vehicle Lactococcus lactis, the cag7-ct383 gene was amplified by PCR. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the amino acid sequence of Cag7-ct383 of H. pylori 51 shared 98.4% and 97.4% identity with H. pylori 26695 and J99, respectively. Intramuscular injection of the GST-Cag7-ct383 fusion protein into a rat could raise the anti-Cag7 antibody, indicating the immunogenicity of the Cag7-ct383 protein. When the cag7-ct383 gene was cloned in Escherichia coli-L. lactis shuttle vector (pMG36e) and transformed into L. lactis, the transformant could produce the Cag7-ct383 protein, as evidenced by Western blot analysis. The Cag7-ct383 protein level in the L. lactis transformant reached a maximum at the early stationary phase without extracellular secretion. The oral administration of the L. lactis transformant into mice generated anti-Cag7 antibody in serum in five of five mice. These results suggest that L. lactis transformant expressing Cag7-ct383 protein may be applicable as an oral vaccine to induce mucosal and systemic immunity to H. pylori.
