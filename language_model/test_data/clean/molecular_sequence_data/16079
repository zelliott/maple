1. The bovine kappa-casein gene has been isolated as a series of overlapping lambda clones and shown to consist of five exons distributed over a total length of approximately 13 kb. Most of the mature protein-coding sequence is contained in a single large exon. 2. Approximately 65% of the gene has been sequenced together with portions of the 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences. The immediate 5'-flanking sequence contains several motifs which are characteristic of upstream regions including a TATA box, a CAAT box, a sequence similar to that recognized by transcription factor AP-1 and a purine-rich sequence resembling that found upstream in all other lactoprotein genes. Other possible regulatory sequences are found upstream of exon 4. 3. The organization of the kappa-casein gene, together with its upstream sequence, confirms previous conclusions that it is unrelated to the calcium-sensitive-casein gene family to which it is linked. Evidence is presented which supports a previous suggestion that kappa-casein and the fibrinogens are evolutionarily related. 4. Intron sequences contain several examples of the A family of the artiodactyl Alu-like repeated sequences, together with a single example of a C-family sequence. The remainders of the introns of the kappa-casein gene, compared with the repeat elements and exons, are A + T-rich. 5. Among the lambda clones isolated, representatives were found of the A and B genetic variants which can be distinguished by restriction-enzyme analysis. Several other examples of polymorphisms in the non-coding region were found.
