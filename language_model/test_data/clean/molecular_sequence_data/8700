Peptide VP1 (11-25) of the capsid of hepatitis A virus was synthesized by the Fmoc-polyamide solid phase method, and administered to mice in different forms: (1) free, (2) encapsulated in multilamellar liposomes, (3) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KHL), and (4) incorporated into a tetrameric branched lysine core. The highest anti-VP1 peptide responses were generated by synthetic peptides entrapped into liposomes and coupled to KLH. No anti-HAV response was generated with the free peptide, while all the other forms induced both anti-HAV and HAV-neutralizing antibodies. Maximum neutralization indices were observed in ascites from mice treated with liposome-entrapped and KLH peptides.
