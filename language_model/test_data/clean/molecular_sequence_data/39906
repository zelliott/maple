Orf virus (ORFV), the type species of Parapoxvirus, is responsible for contagious ecthyma in sheep and goats. In the present report, sequence analysis of major envelope gene (B2L) of four Indian orf virus isolates originating two each from sheep and goats was carried out. These recent isolates belonged to different outbreaks that occurred in Kumaon hills and adjoining plains during 2004-2005. Preliminary screening of the scab samples was carried out by diagnostic PCR. Full-length B2L gene encoding for immunogenic major envelope protein from all the four ORFV isolates was amplified by PCR and the amplicons (1206 bp) were cloned and sequenced. Comparative sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1137 nucleotides (nt) encoding a polypeptide of 378 amino acids (aa). Indian isolates were highly related amongst themselves with sequence identity of over 97% at the nt and aa level. Further, they showed 97-98% sequence identity with sequences of other ORFV isolates from around the world; while 94-95 and 82.7-83.8% sequence identity was observed, respectively, with pseudocowpox and bovine papular stomatitis viruses--the other members of the genus. Phylogenetic analysis also showed that these Parapoxviruses from sheep and goats are closely related to other orf viruses reported worldwide.
