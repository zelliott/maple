Dectin-1 is a small C-type lectin receptor for fungal cell wall beta-glucan. Its homologues in some species, including mouse and human, have been characterized, and their importance in antifungal immunity has also been clarified. However, its homologue in the rat has not yet been identified. In this study, DNA/amino acid sequences of rat dectin-1 were analyzed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The sequence of rat dectin-1 was found to be highly homologous to that of the mouse. It possesses essential motifs for the recognition of beta-glucan and signal transduction. However, the position of the start codon in the detected sequence was not conserved, and its cytoplasmic tail was shorter than that observed in other species. Similar to mouse dectin-1, two major isoforms of rat dectin-1 that were generated by alternative splicing were identified: a full-length isoform and a shorter isoform deficient in the stalk domain. It was also demonstrated that rat dectin-1 is capable of binding fungal beta-glucan and activating nuclear factor-kappa B via Syk and the CARD9/Bcl10-mediated pathway. These results suggest that rat dectin-1 also plays essential roles in immune responses against fungi.
