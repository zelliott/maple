We previously demonstrated that there existed extremely abundant NH2-terminal big gastrin immunoreactivity (NT G-34-IR) in human urine. This report describes the purification and sequence of NT G-34-IR from the urine of an achlorhydric patient. The purification was carried out by a combination of Sep-Pak C18 cartridges, Sephadex G-25, and HPLC steps using a radioimmunoassay specific for NH2-terminus of G-34 and ultraviolet absorption at 214 nm as monitors. Three peptides were isolated. The amino acid analysis, mass spectrometry, and sequence analysis confirmed the structures of urinary NT G-34 fragments being less than Glu-Leu-Gly-Pro-Gln-Gly-Pro-Pro, less than Glu-Leu-Gly-Pro-Gln-Gly- Pro-Pro-His, and less than Glu- Leu-Gly-Pro-Gln-Gly-Pro-Pro-His-Leu. NH2-terminal octapeptide of G-34 was the main component of urinary NT G-34-IR.
