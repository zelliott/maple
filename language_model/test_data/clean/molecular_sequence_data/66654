Penicillium expansum is a fungal species highly damageable for the postharvest conservation of numerous fruits. In vineyards, this fungus is sometimes isolated from grape berries where its presence may lead to the production of geosmin, a powerful earthy odorant, which can impair grapes and wines aromas. However, the discrimination of P. expansum from related fungi is difficult because it is based on ambiguous phenotypic characters and/or expensive and time-consuming molecular tests. In this context, the complete sequences and secondary structures of Penicillium expansum and Penicillium thomii mitochondrial SSU-rRNAs were achieved and compared with those of two other phylogenetically related Ascomycota: Penicillium chrysogenum and Emericella nidulans. The comparison has shown a high conservation in size and sequence of the core and of the variable domains (more than 80% of nt identity) of the four SSU-rRNAs, arguing for a close phylogenetic relationship between these four species of the Trichocomaceae family. Large (from 10 to 18 nt) inserted/deleted (indel) sequences were evidenced in the V1, V5 and V6 variable domains. The size variations (10 to 18 nt) of the V1 indel sequence allowed the distinction of the four species; the V5 indel (15 nt) was specifically recovered in E. nidulans; the V6 indel (16 nt), shared by the three Penicillium species, was lacking in E. nidulans. A couple of conserved primers (UI/R2) were defined to generate a PCR product containing the V1 to V5 variable domains. This product contained the two regions of the four SSU-rRNAs showing the highest rates of nt substitutions, namely the V2 variable domain and, surprisingly, a helix (H17) of the core. The H17 sequence was shown to specifically possess in P. expansum a recognition site for the ClaI restriction endonuclease. Hence, this enzyme generates a digestion pattern of the PCR product with two bands (350 bp+500 bp), specific to P. expansum and easily separable by agarose gel electrophoresis. This leads to a CAPS test usable for P. expansum discrimination among grape berries isolated filamentous fungi. The CAPS test was validated by a comparative analysis involving 29 strains belonging to 17 species currently isolated from grape berries in the Bordeaux vineyards.
