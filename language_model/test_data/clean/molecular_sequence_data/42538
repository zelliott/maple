The t(8;21) translocation is one of the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities in acute myeloid leukaemia and results in gene fusion between AML1 on chromosome 21 and MTG8 (= ETO or CDR) on chromosome 8. AML1 contains a region of sequence homology to the Drosophila runt gene and the mouse polyomavirus enhancer binding protein PEBP2 alpha gene. The rearrangement occurs within a specific intron of the AML1 gene and results in the formation of a chimaeric protein with the consistent feature that the region of sequence homology of AML1 is fused with almost the entire MTG8 protein. MTG8 (ETO, CDR) is predicted to be a transcription activation factor from its sequence with zinc-finger motifs and proline-rich domains. Thus the rearrangement is a fusion between two probable transcription activation factors.
