The mechanism of action of microbial adjuvants in promoting the differentiation of autoimmune effector cells remains to be elucidated. We demonstrate that CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) can completely substitute for heat-killed mycobacteria in the priming of encephalitogenic myelin-reactive T cells in vivo. The adjuvanticity of the CpG ODN was secondary to their direct ability to induce IL-12 or to act synergistically with endogenous IL-12 to promote Th1 differentiation and encephalitogenicity. T cells primed in the absence of CpG with Ag and IFA alone appeared to be in a transitional state and had not undergone differentiation along a conventional Th pathway. Unlike Th2 cells, they expressed low levels of the IL-12R beta 2 subunit and retained the ability to differentiate into encephalitogenic effectors when reactivated in vitro under Th1-polarizing conditions. These results support the use of CpG ODN as adjuvants but also suggest that they could potentially trigger autoimmune disease in a susceptible individual.
