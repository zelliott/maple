A genomic region encompassing 800 bp of the promoter-regulatory region and exon 1 of the gene (LGP) encoding rat liver glycogen phosphorylase has been isolated and characterized. Transcripts of the LGP gene initiate predominantly within an 8-bp region 48-bp upstream from the start codon. Additional transcripts were detected that initiate as far as 95 bp upstream from the start codon. To identify cis-acting sequences involved in regulating transcription, HepG2 cells were transfected with vectors containing serial deletions of the promoter-regulatory region of LGP ligated to the cat reporter gene. Two upstream regions were found to enhance transcription. One of these regions contains an alternating purine-pyrimidine sequence. LGP, which lacks a consensus TATA sequence, is like TATA-less and CAAT-less housekeeping genes in that it contains G + C-rich domains upstream from multiple transcription start points. Nuclear proteins from adult rat tissues bound in a tissue-specific fashion to one of these G + C-rich regions.
