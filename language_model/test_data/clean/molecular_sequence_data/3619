The coronavirus membrane (M) protein is the most abundant virion protein and the key component in viral assembly and morphogenesis. The M protein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is an integral membrane protein with a short ectodomain, three transmembrane segments, and a large carboxy-terminal endodomain facing the interior of the viral envelope. The carboxy terminus of MHV M has previously been shown to be extremely sensitive to mutation, both in a virus-like particle expression system and in the intact virion. We have constructed a mutant, M(Delta)2, containing a two-amino-acid truncation of the M protein that was previously thought to be lethal. This mutant was isolated by means of targeted RNA recombination with a powerful host range-based selection allowed by the interspecies chimeric virus fMHV (MHV containing the ectodomain of the feline infectious peritonitis virus S protein). Analysis of multiple second-site revertants of the M(Delta)2 mutant has revealed changes in regions of both the M protein and the nucleocapsid (N) protein that can compensate for the loss of the last two residues of the M protein. Our data thus provide the first genetic evidence for a structural interaction between the carboxy termini of the M and N proteins of MHV. In addition, this work demonstrates the efficacy of targeted recombination with fMHV for the systematic genetic analysis of coronavirus structural protein interactions.
