The ALL-1 gene located at human chromosome 11 band q23 is rearranged in acute leukemias with interstitial deletions or reciprocal translocations between this region and chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 9, 10, or 19. The gene spans approximately 100 kb of DNA and contains at least 21 exons. It encodes a protein of more than 3910 amino acids containing three regions with homology to sequences within the Drosophila trithorax gene, including cysteine-rich regions that can be folded into six zinc finger-like domains. The breakpoint cluster region within ALL-1 spans 8 kb and encompasses several small exons, most of which begin in the same phase of the open reading frame. The t(4;11) chromosome translocation results in two reciprocal fusion products coding for chimeric proteins derived from ALL-1 and from a gene on chromosome 4. This suggests that each 11q23 abnormality gives rise to a specific oncogenic fusion protein.
