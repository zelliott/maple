In this study, a polyphasic approach was adopted to investigate natural freshwater (river and stream) samples of Rivularia colonies and isolated strains of cyanobacteria with a high degree of trichome tapering (genera Rivularia and Calothrix). Analysis of the phycocyanin (PC) operon and the intervening intergenic spacer (cpcBA-IGS) and 16S rRNA gene sequences were used for genetic characterization. In addition, a molecular fingerprinting method, temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis, which allows sequence-dependent separation of PCR products, was used to assess genotypic diversity in environmental samples and isolated strains. The results showed a high variability of the PC-IGS among the genotypes that was not associated with the morphologies observed. This study underlines the importance of choosing a low-nutrient-content culture medium, especially one with a low phosphorus concentration, for studying typical morphological features of Rivularia for taxonomic purposes. Molecular fingerprinting methods and morphological analyses confirmed the diversity in Rivularia colonial structure and trichome features corresponding to genetic diversity within a single colony. Phylogenetic analysis of cpcBA-IGS was largely consistent with that obtained from 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and confirmed the high level of divergence between genotypes. The sequences of Rivularia and Calothrix from this study and database sequences showed great heterogeneity and were clearly not monophyletic. The results of this genetic and morphological study of field samples and fresh isolates indicated that the current classification of these genera needs to be revised.
