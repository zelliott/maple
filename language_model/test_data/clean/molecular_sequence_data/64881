The oligomeric recombinant protein DB-1 containing the immunodominant sites of the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum and tetanus toxin was constructed to optimize the schemes of presentation of B-cell epitopes during vaccination with chimeric proteins without the use of adjuvants. A fragment of the pentameric coiled-coil human cartilage oligomeric matrix protein was used as an oligomerization matrix. The expression of the protein in Escherichia coli cells was studied, a method for its purification was developed, and it was biochemically characterized.
