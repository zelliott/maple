Modern concepts on the chromatin loop-domain organization and the role of the DNA regions specifically binding the nuclear matrix (nuclear scaffold, or S/MARs) in its formation, maintenance, and regulation are discussed. Some S/MAR structural features, properties of binding the nuclear matrix, and probable mechanisms of their involvement in regulation of gene activity are considered.
