The primary structures of all the subunits of thermophilic ATP synthase were determined, and its alpha, beta and gamma subunits could be over-expressed in Escherichia coli, because these subunits were stable and reconstitutable. DNA of 7500 base pairs in length was found to contain a cluster of nine genes for subunits of ATP synthase. The order of their reading frames (size in base pairs) was: I(381): a(630): c(216): b(489): delta(537): alpha(1507): gamma(858): beta(1419): epsilon(396), I being a gene for a small hydrophobic, basic protein expressed in vitro. All the termini of TF0F1 subunits were confirmed by peptide sequencing. Large quantities of the overexpressed thermophilic alpha, beta and gamma subunits were prepared from the extract of E. coli, by a few purification steps.
