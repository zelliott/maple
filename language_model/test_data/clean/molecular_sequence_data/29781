We identified a Drosophila melanogaster gene encoding a peptide that dramatically decreases spontaneous muscle contractions and, correspondingly, named the peptide flatline (FLT). This gene consisted of 4 exons and was cytologically localized to 32D2-3. Processing of a predicted 122 amino acid precursor would release pEVRYRQCYFNPISCF that differs from Manduca sexta allatostatin (Mas-AST) by one amino acid, Y4-->F4. FLT does not act as an allatostatin. In situ tissue hybridization further suggests FLT is a novel brain-gut peptide and specifically, the measured activity indicates that it is a potent myotropin. Despite its profound myotropic effect, pupae injected with FLT eclosed.
