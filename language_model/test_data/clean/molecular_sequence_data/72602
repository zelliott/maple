Ferritin from alfalfa (Medicago sativa) seeds was isolated, purified, and characterized. The apparent molecular mass of the native protein was found to be 560 kDa. Electrophoresis in denaturing gradient polyacrylamide-SDS gels revealed subunits of 28-26.5 kDa. The average iron cores were 4 nm in diameter and contained about 1400 iron atoms, with an iron-to-phosphorus ratio of 4:1. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the 28 kDa subunit revealed close homology with other plant proteins. Immunochemical analysis using polyclonal antibodies raised against pea-seed ferritin has confirmed, in agreement with previous reports, that plant proteins share common epitopes.
