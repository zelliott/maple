Terminal nucleic acid sequences were determined for all 11 segments of the IDIR strain of group B rotavirus. Consensus sequences were defined at both ends of the (+) RNA strands as 5' GGN(A/U)NA(A/U)(A/U)(A/U)---and---(A/U)NA(A/G)N(A/C)(C/A)CC3 '. The 5' and 3' terminal sequences of the (+) strand IDIR RNA were not complementary to one another. The IDIR terminal sequences and those of group A rotaviruses (GAR) were similar in that each of the (+) strands began with "GG" and ended with "CC." Otherwise, the IDIR terminal sequences did not match the consensus sequences that have been reported for the ends of the GAR genomic segments.
