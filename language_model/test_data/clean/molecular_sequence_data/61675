The 26S proteasome consisting of a 20S proteasome and a pair of 19S regulatory particles (RP) plays important roles in degradation of the ubiquitinated protein in eukaryotic cells. The RP consists of six different ATPase subunits and, at least, 11 non-ATPase subunits. In rice, we previously identified duplicated genes encoding four ATPase subunits, OsRpt1, OsRpt2, OsRpt4, and OsRpt5. In this study, the genomic sequences of all rice ATPase subunits were identified from the rice genome database and the genomic structure of ATPase subunit genes was determined. The rice RP was purified, and the ATPase subunit isoforms encoded by three pairs of duplicated genes, OsRpt2a/OsRpt2b, OsRpt4a/OsRpt4b, and OsRpt5a/OsRpt5b, were identified in RP by using electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The relative amounts and the expression patterns of these ATPase subunit isoforms in the bran were found to be different from those of the callus, suggesting the presence of multiform 19S regulatory particles engaged in the tissue-specific protein metabolism.
