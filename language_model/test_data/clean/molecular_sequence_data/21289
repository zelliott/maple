Regulated proteolysis serves as a mechanism to control cellular processes. The SPS (Ssy1-Ptr3-Ssy5) sensor in yeast responds to extracellular amino acids by endoproteolytically activating transcription factors Stp1 and Stp2 (Stp1/2). The processing endoprotease Ssy5 is regulated via proteasomal degradation of its noncovalently associated N-terminal prodomain. We find that degradation of the prodomain requires a conserved phosphodegron comprising phosphoacceptor sites and ubiquitin-accepting lysine residues. Upon amino acid induction, the phosphodegron is modified in a series of linked events by a set of general regulatory factors involved in diverse signaling pathways. First, an amino acid-induced conformational change triggers phosphodegron phosphorylation by the constitutively active plasma membrane-localized casein kinase I (Yck1/2). Next the prodomain becomes a substrate for polyubiquitylation by the Skp1/Cullin/Grr1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (SCF(Grr1)). Finally, the modified prodomain is concomitantly degraded by the 26S proteasome. These integrated events are requisite for unfettering the Ssy5 endoprotease, and thus Stp1/2 processing. The Ssy5 phosphoacceptor motif resembles the Yck1/2- and Grr1-dependent degrons of regulators in the Snf3/Rgt2 glucose-sensing pathway. Our work defines a novel proteolytic activation cascade that regulates an intracellular signaling protease and illustrates how general signaling components are recruited to distinct pathways that achieve conditional and specific signaling outputs.
