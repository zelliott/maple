Pectins are major components of primary plant cell walls and the seed mucilage of Arabidopsis. Despite progress in the structural elucidation of pectins, only very few enzymes participating in or regulating their synthesis have been identified. A first candidate gene involved in the synthesis of pectinaceous rhamnogalacturonan I is RHM2, a putative plant ortholog to NDP-rhamnose biosynthetic enzymes in bacteria. Expression studies with a promoter beta-glucuronidase construct and reverse transcription PCR data show that RHM2 is expressed ubiquitously. Rhm2 T-DNA insertion mutant lines were identified using a reverse genetics approach. Analysis of the rhm2 seeds by various staining methods and chemical analysis of the mucilage revealed a strong reduction of rhamnogalacturonan I in the mucilage and a decrease of its molecular weight. In addition, scanning electron microscopy of the seed surface indicated a distorted testa morphology, illustrating not only a structural but also a developmental role for RGI or rhamnose metabolism in proper testa formation.
