In human cervical carcinomas papillomavirus DNA is frequently integrated in the cell genome. We have cloned the integration site of human papillomavirus-18 DNA in human chromosome region 12q13-15 present in the SW756 cervical carcinoma cell line. Viral DNA is broken from nucleotides 2643 to 3418 in the E1 and E2 open reading frames, resulting in a deletion of 775 bases of viral DNA. Cloning and sequence analysis of the rearranged and germline alleles shows that there is no homology between the target cellular and viral DNA, suggesting it is a nonhomologous recombination. The target cellular region is called papillomavirus associated locus 2 (PAL2). The 5'- and 3'-flanking probes derived from the hybrid viral-cellular clone detect completely different germline restriction fragments in DNA from cells with normal chromosome 12. There is no overlap between the restriction maps of the target germline clones obtained with 5'- and 3'-flanking probes. Probes from these germline clones beyond the breakpoint position do not detect any DNA rearrangement in SW756 cells DNA. These data prove that there is a deletion of cellular DNA as consequence of the integration, with an estimated minimum size of 14 kilobases. Both cellular flanking probes are outside the amplicon of this chromosome region identified in the OSA and RMS13 sarcoma cell lines, comprising SAS-CHOP-CDK4-MDM2 genes and where translocation breakpoints are located in liposarcomas. The integration at 12q13-15 might have been selected by its contribution to the tumor phenotype.
