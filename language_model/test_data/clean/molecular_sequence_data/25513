Asexual development in Neurospora crassa proceeds through a series of discrete morphological stages that culminate in the production of dormant spores called conidia. Changes in the pattern of gene expression parallel the morphological transformations associated with conidiation. As a prerequisite to the analysis of developmental gene expression in N. crassa, several genes of unknown function that are preferentially expressed during conidiation were isolated [Berlin and Yanofsky, Mol. Cell. Biol. 5 (1985) 849-855]. The molecular structure and nucleotide sequence of one of these genes, designated con-13, is presented. The con-13 gene specifies a relatively rare 1.35-kb message which is first detected about 8 h following the induction of conidiation. Sequence analysis of both cDNA and genomic clones indicates that the con-13 gene consists of three exons divided by two small introns. It encodes a polypeptide of 340 amino acid residues (37.1 kDa). The Con-13 protein is weakly acidic and hydrophilic. A comparison of the regions upstream from the con-8, con-10, and con-13 genes revealed several short sequence motifs which may be important in developmental gene regulation.
