The newly developed Transdirect in vitro translation system for mRNA templates utilizes an extract from cultured Spodoptera frugiperda 21 (Sf21) insect cells. An expression vector, pTD1, which includes a 5'-untranslated region (UTR) sequence from a baculovirus polyhedrin gene as a translational enhancer, designed to obtain maximum performance from the insect cell-free protein synthesis system. The combination of insect cell extract and the expression vector results in protein productivity of about 50 Î¼g/mL of the translation reaction mixture. This is the highest protein productivity yet recorded among commercialized cell-free protein synthesis systems based on animal extracts.
