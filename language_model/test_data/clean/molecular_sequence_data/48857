A methanogenic archaeon, strain SMA-21(T), was isolated from a permafrost-affected soil by serial dilution in liquid medium. The cells were non-motile, stained Gram-negative and grew as irregular cocci with a diameter of 1.3-2.5 µm. Optimal growth was observed at 28 °C, pH 7.8 and 0.02 M NaCl. The strain grew on H2/CO2, methanol and acetate, but not on formate, ethanol, 2-butanol, 2-propanol, monomethylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine or dimethyl sulfide. Major membrane lipids of strain SMA-21(T) were archaeol phosphatidylglycerol, archaeol phosphatidylethanolamine and the corresponding hydroxyarchaeol compounds. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 40.9 mol%. The 16S rRNA gene sequence was closely related to those of Methanosarcina mazei DSM 2053(T) (similarity 99.9 %) and Methanosarcina horonobensis HB-1(T) (similarity 98.7 %). On basis of the level of DNA-DNA hybridization (22.1 %) between strain SMA-21(T) and Methanosarcina mazei DSM 2053(T) as well as of phenotypic and genotypic differences, strain SMA-21(T) was assigned to a novel species of the genus Methanosarcina, for which the name Methanosarcina soligelidi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SMA-21(T) (=DSM 26065(T) [corrected] = JCM 18468).
