The Escherichia coli dnaX gene encodes both the tau and gamma subunits of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme in one reading frame. The 71.1 kDa tau and the shorter gamma share N-terminal sequences. Mutagenesis of a potential ribosomal frameshift signal located at codons 428-430 without changing the amino acid sequence of the tau product, eliminated detectable synthesis of the gamma subunit, suggesting that the reading frame is shifted at that sequence and gamma is terminated by a nonsense codon located in the -1 frame 3 nucleotides downstream of the signal. This seems to be the first known case of a frameshift which is used, along with the termination codon in the -1 frame, to terminate a peptide within a reading frame. [Mutagenesis of a dibasic peptide (lys-lys) at codons 498-499, the site at which a tau'-'LacZ fusion protein was cleaved in vitro (1) had no effect on gamma formation in vivo, suggesting that cleavage observed in vitro is not the mechanism of gamma formation in vivo.
