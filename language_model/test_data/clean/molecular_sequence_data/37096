Comparison between the cDNA sequence of CYP4A11 and that deduced from a published genomic clone suggested the presence of an additional CYP4A gene in humans, CYP4A22. PCR amplification of genomic DNA yielded overlapping clones covering 13kb of genomic DNA and extending from 1003bp upstream from CYP4A11 translation initiation to 135bp upstream of the mRNA polyadenylation signal. Sequence and Southern blot analysis showed the presence in humans of two highly homologous CYP4A genes, CYP4A11 and CYP4A22. These two genes share 96% sequence identity and have similar intron/exon sizes and distribution. Short nucleotide insertions (< or =10bp) in introns 1, 3, 9, and 11, and deletions (< or =18bp) in introns 4, 6, and 11 differentiate the two genes. RT-PCR amplification of human kidney RNA followed by restriction fragment analysis showed that CYP4A11 is the predominant isoform expressed in kidney.
