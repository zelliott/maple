Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains occur in many signaling proteins, including substrates for the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (IRS proteins). Based on the hypothesis that PH domains may have a common function such as membrane targeting we tested the ability of PH domains from other signaling molecules to link IRS-1 to the insulin receptor. Chimeric IRS-1 proteins containing a homologous PH domain derived from other IRS proteins (IRS-2 or Gab-1) were tyrosine phosphorylated normally in response to insulin. In contrast, heterologous PH domains from the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase, phospholipase Cgamma, or spectrin failed to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of chimeric IRS-1 proteins, even in cells expressing high levels of insulin receptor. Moreover, IRS-1 proteins containing heterologous PH domains did not bind phosphorylated NPEY motifs derived from the insulin receptor, suggesting that the presence of these structures interfered with the function of the adjacent PTB binding domain. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by the insulin receptor specifically requires a PH domain derived from IRS proteins.
