A cDNA clone for cytochrome b(5) was isolated from a cDNA library of an ascidian, Ciona savignyi, by a plaque hybridization method using a digoxigenin-labeled cDNA for the soluble form of human cytochrome b(5). The cDNA is composed of 5'- and 3'-noncoding sequences, and a 396-base pair coding sequence. The 3'-noncoding sequence contains polyadenylation signal sequences. The amino acid sequence of 132 residues deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA showed 61% identity and 82% similarity to the cytochrome b(5) of another ascidian species, Polyandrocarpa misakiensis, which we previously cloned. The amino-terminal hydrophilic domain of 98 residues contains well-conserved structures around two histidine residues for heme binding. A cDNA expression system was constructed to prepare a putative soluble form of Ciona cytochrome b(5). The recombinant soluble cytochrome b(5) showed an asymmetrical absorption spectrum at 560 nm as is shown by mammalian cytochromes b(5) upon reduction with NADH and NADH-cytochrome b(5) reductase. The recombinant Ciona cytochrome b(5) is reduced by NADH-cytochrome b(5) reductase with an apparent K(m) value of 3.3 microM. This value is similar to that of the cytochrome b(5) of Polyandrocarpa misakiensis. The expression of Ciona cytochrome b(5) mRNA during development was examined by an in situ hybridization method and ubiquitous expression in embryonic tissues was observed. The results indicate that cytochrome b(5) plays important roles in various metabolic processes during development.
