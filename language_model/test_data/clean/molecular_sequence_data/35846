We report the sequence of a 12,399 bp DNA fragment from the left arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XI. This fragment is located between the genetic loci mif2 and mak11. We have detected five new open reading frames (ORFs) longer than 300 bp provisionally called YKL248 to YKL252. One of them, YKL248 encodes a homolog of the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase from potato. The product of YKL251 contains the consensus for zinc binding proteins, similar to those of a number of fungal transcriptional activators. The three other ORFs do not show significant homology to known protein.
