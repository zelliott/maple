The predicted extracellular domain of the CD2v protein of African swine fever virus (ASFV) shares significant similarity to that of the CD2 protein in T cells but has a unique cytoplasmic domain of unknown function. Here we have shown that CD2v is expressed as a glycoprotein of approximately 105 kDa in ASFV-infected cells. In the absence of an extracellular ligand, the majority of CD2v appears to localize to perinuclear membrane compartments. Furthermore, we have shown using the yeast two-hybrid system and by direct binding studies that the cytoplasmic tail of CD2v binds to the cytoplasmic adaptor protein SH3P7 (mAbp1, HIP55), which has been reported to be involved in diverse cellular functions such as vesicle transport and signal transduction. A cDNA clone encoding a variant form of SH3P7 could also be identified and was found to be expressed in a wide range of porcine tissues. Deletion mutagenesis identified proline-rich repeats of sequence PPPKPC in the ASFV CD2v protein to be necessary and sufficient for binding to the SH3 domain of SH3P7. In ASFV-infected cells, CD2v and SH3P7 co-localized in areas surrounding the perinuclear virus factories. These areas also stained with an antibody that recognizes a Golgi network protein, indicating that they contained membranes derived from the Golgi network. Our data provide a first molecular basis for the understanding of the immunomodulatory functions of CD2v in ASFV-infected animals.
