We describe a case of disseminated Beauveria bassiana infection in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Her infection was successfully treated with amphotericin B and itraconazole. B. bassiana is rarely reported as a human pathogen. It is commonly found in soil and because of its pathogenicity to many insect species is incorporated into several pesticides.
