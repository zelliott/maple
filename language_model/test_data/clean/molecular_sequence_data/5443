The genes encoding alpha- and beta-subunits of a V-type ATPase in a sulfur-dependent hyperthermophilic archaeum, Thermococcus sp. KI, were cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences were approximately 60, 50 and 25% identical to those of other archaeal, eukaryotic V-type and E. coli F-type ATPase, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Thermococcus ATPase was closely related to that of Thermus, and those of Methanosarcina and Halobacterium.
