We sequenced all nine exons and exon-intron junctions of the cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) gene from a Japanese subject with a lowered capacity of CYP2C19-mediated 4'-hydroxylation after an oral administration of mephobarbital. We found a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of CYP2C19 gene as follows: SNP, 040110MoritaJ001; GENENAME: CYP2C19; ACCESSION NUMBER: NT_030059.8; LENGTH; 25 bases; 5'-GAGGGCCTGGCCC/TGCATGGAGCTGT-3'. The SNP (168946C>T) induced an amino acid alteration (Arg442Cys) located in exon 9 close to the heme-binding region of CYP2C19, which may result in the decrease in the catalytic properties of CYP2C19. A new allele having this SNP was designated as CYP2C19*16.
