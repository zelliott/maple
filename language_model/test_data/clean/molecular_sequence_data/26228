The 95 amino acid-protein encoded by the non-structural vpr gene of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (LAV-1BRU isolate) was chemically synthesized by solid phase methodology. The synthetic vpr protein was characterized by amino acid analysis, sequence analysis, RP-HPLC, and urea-SDS PAGE. Using a radioimmunoassay, antibodies to the synthetic protein were detected in sera of 25% of HIV 1-seropositive patients tested. Western blot analysis suggested that the antibodies preferentially recognize the dimeric form of vpr.
