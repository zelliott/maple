Internal peptide fragments containing tryptophan residues are useful predictors of coding sequence for selection of restriction enzyme fragments or synthetic oligonucleotides to use in isolation of a cDNA or genomic clone. We describe a strategy to identify such fragments which uses an on-line photodiode array spectrophotometric analysis of tryptic fragment elution from an HPLC system to select peptides for amino acid sequence analysis. We applied this information to the identification and subsequent isolation of a cDNA corresponding to bovine placental lactogen from a bovine placental cDNA library which contains numerous closely related gene products.
