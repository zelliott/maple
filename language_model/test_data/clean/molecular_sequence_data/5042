The thioredoxin (Trx) from Bacillus acidocaldarius (BacTrx) was purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography and gel-filtration chromatography, based on its ability to catalyse the dithiothreitol-dependent reduction of bovine insulin disulphides. The protein has a molecular mass of 11577 Da, determined by electrospray mass spectrometry, a pI of 4.2, and its primary structure was obtained by automated Edman degradation after cleavage with trypsin and cyanogen bromide. The sequences of known bacterial Trxs were aligned at the active site: BacTrx has an identity ranging from 45 to 53% with all sequences except that of the unusual Anabaena strain 7120 Trx (37% identity). The gene coding for BacTrx was isolated by a strategy based on PCR gene amplification and cloned in a plasmid downstream of a lac-derived promoter sequence; the recombinant clone was used as the expression vector for Escherichia coli. The expression was optimized by varying both the time of cell growth and the time of exposure to the inducer isopropyl beta-d-thiogalactoside; expressed BacTrx represents approx. 5% of the total cytosolic protein. CD spectra and differential scanning calorimetry measurements demonstrated that BacTrx is endowed with a higher conformational heat stability than the Trx from E. coli. Nanogravimetry experiments showed a lower content of bound water in BacTrx than in E. coli Trx, and a transition temperature approx. 10 degrees C higher for BacTrx. The three-dimensional model of the oxidized form of BacTrx was constructed by a comparative molecular modelling technique, using E. coli Trx and Anabaena strain 7120 Trx as reference proteins. Increased networks of ion-pairs and shorter loops emerged as major features of the BacTrx structure compared with those of the template proteins. The findings are discussed in the light of the current knowledge about molecular determinants of protein stability.
