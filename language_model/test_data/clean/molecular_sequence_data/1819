Five major and several minor PG isoenzymes were identified in a Sclerotinia sclerotiorum isolate from Brassica napus by isoelectric focusing and pectin gel overlays. Using a combination of degenerate PCR and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) four endo-polygalacturonase (PG) genes, designated as sspg1d, sspg3, sspg5, and sspg6, and two exo-PG genes, ssxpg1 and ssxpg2, were identified. SSPG1d is a member of the PG gene family previously described by Fraissinet-Tachet et al. [Curr. Genet. 29 (1995) 96]. The mature SSPG1d is a neutral PG, whereas fully processed SSPG3, SSPG5, and SSPG6 are acidic enzymes. Under saprophytic growth conditions, sspg1d, sspg3, sspg5, and ssxpg1 expression was induced by pectin and galacturonic acid and subject to catabolite repression by glucose. Conditions could not be identified under which sspg6 or ssxpg2 were expressed well. Transfer of mycelia from liquid media to solid substrates induced expression of sspg1d suggesting that it may also be regulated by thigmotrophic interactions. Under pathogenic conditions, sspg1d was highly expressed during infection. sspg3 was also expressed during infection, albeit at lower levels than sspg1d, whereas sspg5, sspg6, and ssxpg1 were expressed only weakly.
