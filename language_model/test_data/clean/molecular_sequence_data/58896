ZAP-70 is a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) that plays a critical role in T cell activation. To study the role of ZAP-70 catalytic activity in this process, a substrate capable of distinguishing between the activities of ZAP-70 and other PTKs would be useful, especially since it has recently been shown that ZAP-70 interacts with another T cell PTK, Lck. We have thus identified a site of phosphorylation on the cytoplasmic fragment of the erythrocyte band 3 protein that is recognized by ZAP-70, but not Lck. A synthetic peptide based on this site has been demonstrated to be a good in vitro substrate for ZAP-70 and a poor substrate for the T cell PTKs Lck and Itk. This peptide molecule should thus prove useful to many investigators working in the field of T cell activation.
