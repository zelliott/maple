The precursor primer RNA for mammalian mitochondrial DNA leading-strand replication remains as a persistent R loop formed during transcription through the mitochondrial DNA control region. We have examined model R loops, which exist in a novel and physiologically accurate preprimer conformation, as potential substrates for mammalian RNase mitochondrial RNA processing (MRP). Mouse RNase MRP accurately cleaves an R loop containing the mouse mitochondrial DNA origin. The multiple cleavage sites on the R-loop substrate match the priming sites observed in vivo, suggesting that RNase MRP alone is capable of generating virtually all of the leading-strand replication primers.
