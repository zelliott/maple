Gene families provide a unique system to study the evolutionary relationships between related genes both within and between organisms. We can ascertain whether members of a gene family in different species are orthologs or paralogs. We may also search for evidence that may explain why duplicate genes are present. The availability of genome sequences for 12 Drosophila species allows us to address these questions with respect to the evolution of one gene family, the glutathione S transferase (GST) omega class. This gene family is of particular interest because of its relationship with human disease and its presence in a wide range of species.
