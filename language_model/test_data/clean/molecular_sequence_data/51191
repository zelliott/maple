In the "barrel-stave" model for voltage-gated alamethicin channels in planar lipid bilayers, proline residues, especially Pro14, are assumed to play a significant role. Taking advantage of a previous synthetic alamethicin analogue in which all eight alpha-aminoisobutyric acids were replaced by leucines, two new analogues were prepared in order to test the effects of Pro14 and Pro2 substitutions by alanines. The alpha-helical content of the three analogues in methanol solution remains predominant (between 63 and 80%). Macroscopic conductance experiments show that a high voltage dependence is conserved, although the apparent mean number of monomers forming the channels is significantly reduced when the substitution occurs at position 14. This is confirmed in single-channel experiments which further reveal faster fluctuations for the modified analogues. These results demonstrate that, although prolines, especially Pro14, are favorable residues for alamethicin-like events, they are not absolute prerequisites for the development of highly voltage-dependent multistate conductances.
