The 5'-flanking proximal region of stress-induced gene encoding choline monooxygenase (CMO) was isolated by Adaptor-PCR and TAIL-PCR from halophyte Suaeda liaotungensis K. A total of 2,204 bp DNA sequence was obtained. The transcription start site, which is located at 128 bp upstream to the start ATG, was predicted by the TSSP-TCM program. The functional elements were analysed by PLACE program. The obtained SlCMO gene promoter contains the basic elements: TATA-box, CAAT-box, and stress-induced elements, for example, salt responsive element (GAAAAA), cold responsive elements (CANNTG), ABA (Abscisic Acid) responsive elements (NAACAA), water stress element (CGGTTG), and WUN responsive elements (GTTAGGTTC). Isolation and analysis of the promoter of the CMO gene from S. liaotungensis lays a foundation for characterising the stress-induced promoter elements, studying the relationship between the structure and function of the promoter, and investigating the molecular mechanism of CMO gene regulation.
