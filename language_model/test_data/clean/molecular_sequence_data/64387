PRKAG1, PRKAG2 and PRKAG3 encode three isoforms of AMP-activated protein kinase gamma chain. A major effect on meat quality and a medium effect on back fat thickness of the RN- mutation in the PRKAG3 gene has previously been reported. We have now mapped PRKAG1 and PRKAG2 at expected locations on SSC5 and SSC18 by analysis of radiation hybrids (IMpRH panel). PRKAG2 has been mapped in a region where no quantitative trait loci (QTL) has been reported. PRKAG1 has been mapped close to (but probably outside) a region containing a QTL influencing fatness traits. We have determined the full coding sequence of PRKAG1. No missense mutation was identified when comparing the coding sequence of one Meishan and one Large White boars. Further work is, however, required to determine if a polymorphism in PRKAG1 could be responsible for a part of the variability observed on fatness traits.
