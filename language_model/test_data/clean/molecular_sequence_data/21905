In the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia, 3',5'-cyclic GMP (cGMP) is one of the second messengers involved in several signal transduction pathways. The enzymes for its production and degradation are well established for these cells, whereas less is known about the potential effector proteins. On the basis of a current Paramecium genome project, we have identified a multigene family with at least 35 members, all of which encode cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKGs). They can be classified into 16 subfamilies with several members each. Two of the genes, PKG1-1 and PKG2-1, were analyzed in more detail after molecular cloning. They encode monomeric enzymes of 770 and 819 amino acids, respectively, whose overall domain organization resembles that in higher eukaryotes. The enzymes contain a regulatory domain of two tandem cyclic nucleotide-binding sites flanked by an amino-terminal region for intracellular localization and a catalytic domain with highly conserved regions for ATP binding and catalysis. However, some Paramecium PKGs show a different structure. In Western blots, PKGs are detected both as cytosolic and as structure-bound forms. Immunofluorescence labeling shows enrichment in the cell cortex, notably around the dense-core secretory vesicles (trichocysts), as well as in cilia. Immunogold electron microscopy analysis reveals consistent labeling of ciliary membranes, of the membrane complex composed of cell membrane and cortical Ca2+ stores, and of regions adjacent to ciliary basal bodies, trichocysts, and trafficking vesicles. Since PKGs (re)phosphorylate the exocytosis-sensitive phosphoprotein pp63/pf upon stimulation, the role of PKGs during stimulated exocytosis is discussed, in addition to a role in ciliary beat regulation.
