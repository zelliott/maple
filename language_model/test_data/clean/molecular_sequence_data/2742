Several proteins from bovine platelet lysate bound to type I collagen immobilized to the beads of formyl derivatives of cellulose. Among these proteins, a protein of about 100,000 daltons was purified to homogeneity by two additional affinity chromatographies, an organomercurial-agarose and a lentil lectin-agarose. This protein consisted of a single polypeptide chain which contains carbohydrate moiety and many intrapolypeptide disulfide bridges. In addition to platelets, this protein was present in plasma and cultured endothelial cells but not in red blood cells, leukocytes, and smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, it was released from platelets upon stimulation by various agonists. The purified 100-kDa protein was labeled with 125I to quantitate its binding to fibrillar type I collagen. The protein specifically bound to fibrillar collagen with the apparent dissociation constant of 5.6 x 10(-8) M for the high affinity site and 5.5 x 10(-7) M for the low affinity site. Analyses of amino acid sequences of both intact and tryptic fragments of this protein revealed that it had strong homology to the propolypeptide of human von Willebrand factor, which is also known as von Willebrand antigen II. Various properties of this protein listed above also strongly suggest that it was indeed the propolypeptide of bovine von Willebrand factor.
