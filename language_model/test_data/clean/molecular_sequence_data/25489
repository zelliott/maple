Two genes code for calcitonin gene-related peptides (CGRPs). One expresses by tissue-specific alternate splicing calcitonin and CGRP I mRNAs, the other CGRP II mRNA. Calcitonin is the marker of sporadic or hereditary human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). CGRP II expression is not well established in normal or tumoral thyroid. After amplification by polymerase chain reaction, CGRP I and II mRNAs were detected in six cases of MTC associated with other endocrine neoplasia (MEN IIa) and in two cases of isolated MTC. CGRP I was detected in all non-C cell tumoral thyroids (6 samples), CGRP II was barely detectable in three out of six cases. CGRP II could be a specific tumoral marker of MTC.
