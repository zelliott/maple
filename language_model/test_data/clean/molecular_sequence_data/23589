We have cloned and characterized the phytochrome C ( PHYC) gene from Stellaria longipes. The PHYC gene is composed of a 110-bp 5'-untranslated leader sequence, a 3,342-bp coding region, and a 351-bp 3'-untranslated sequence. The Stellaria PHYC contains three long introns within the coding region at conserved locations as in most angiosperm PHY genes. DNA blot analysis indicates that the Stellaria genome contains a single copy of PHYC. Stellaria PHYC shares 60%, 58%, and 57% deduced amino acid identities with rice, Sorghum, and Arabidopsis PHYC, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Stellaria PHYC is located in the dicot branch, but is divergent from Arabidopsis PHYC. The Stellaria PHYC is constitutively expressed in different plant organs, though the level of PHYC gene transcript in roots is slightly higher than in flowers, leaves, and stems. When 2-week old seedlings grown in the dark were exposed to constant white light, PHYC mRNA quickly accumulates within 1-12 h. When plants grown in darkness for 7 days were exposed to different red/far-red light (R/FR) ratios, the levels of PHYC mRNA at R/FR = 0.7 are much lower than under R/FR = 3.5. The levels of PHYC mRNA under short-day (SD) photoperiod are higher than under long-day (LD) photoperiod. Plants under SD conditions do not elongate, and are only about 1.7 cm tall at 19 days. In contrast, plants under LD conditions elongate with an average height of 21.2 cm at 19 days. The plants do not flower under SD conditions, but do so at 18-19 days under LD conditions. These results indicate that under SD conditions the high level of PHYC mRNA may inhibit stem elongation and flower initiation. In contrast, under LD conditions the high level of PHYC mRNA may promote stem elongation and flowering.
