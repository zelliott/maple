We report isolation and N-terminal amino acid sequencing of three style glycoproteins, which segregate with three S (self-incompatibility) alleles of Petunia hybrida. The S-glycoproteins were expressed mainly in the upper part of the pistil and showed an increasing concentration during flower development. The glycoproteins were purified by a combination of ConA-Sepharose and cation exchange fast protein liquid chromatography. The amount of S-glycoproteins recovered from style extracts varied from 0.5 to 1.6 micrograms per style, which was 40-60% of the amount recovered by a simplified analytical method. N-terminal amino acid sequences of S1-, S2- and S3-glycoprotein showed homology within the fifteen amino terminal residues. These amino acid sequences were compared with the previously published sequences of S-glycoproteins from Nicotiana alata and Lycopersicon peruvianum.
