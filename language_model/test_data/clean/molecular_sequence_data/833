We describe Hicanonectes teleskopos n. g., n. sp., a heterotrophic flagellate isolated from low-oxygen marine sediment. Hicanonectes teleskopos has a ventral groove and two unequal flagella, and rapidly rotates during swimming. At the ultrastructural level H. teleskopos is a "typical excavate": it displays flagellar vanes, a split right microtubular root, "I,""B," and "C" fibres, a singlet microtubular root, and a possible composite fibre. Small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA) gene phylogenies and an "arched" B fibre demonstrate that H. teleskopos belongs to Fornicata (i.e. diplomonads, retortamonads, and relatives). It forms a clade with the deep-branching fornicate Carpediemonas, with moderate-to-strong bootstrap support, although their SSU rRNA gene sequences are quite dissimilar. Hicanonectes differs from Carpediemonas in cell shape, swimming behaviour, number of basal bodies (i.e. 4 vs. 3), number of flagellar vanes (i.e. 2 vs. 3), anterior root organization, and by having a cytopharynx. Like Carpediemonas and Dysnectes, Hicanonectes has conspicuous mitochondrion-like organelles that lack cristae and superficially resemble the hydrogenosomes of parabasalids, rather than the mitosomes of their closer relatives the diplomonads (e.g. Giardia).
