A novel cadmium-inducible gene, cdr-1, was previously identified and characterized in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and found to mediate resistance to cadmium toxicity. Subsequently, six homologs of cdr-1 were identified in C. elegans. Here, we describe two homologs: cdr-4, which is metal inducible, and cdr-6, which is noninducible. Both cdr-4 and cdr-6 mRNAs contain open reading frames of 831 nt and encode predicted 32-kDa integral membrane proteins, which are similar to CDR-1. cdr-4 expression is induced by arsenic, cadmium, mercury, and zinc exposure as well as by hypotonic stress. In contrast, cdr-6 is constitutively expressed at a high level in C. elegans, and expression is not affected by these stressors. Both cdr-4 and cdr-6 are transcribed in postembryonic pharyngeal and intestinal cells in C. elegans. In addition, cdr-4 is transcribed in developing embryos. Like CDR-1, CDR-4 is targeted to intestinal cell lysosomes in vivo. Inhibition of CDR-4 and/or CDR-6 expression does not render C. elegans more susceptible to cadmium toxicity; however, there is a significant decrease in their lifespan in the absence of metal. Although nematodes in which CDR-4 and/or CDR-6 expression is knocked down accumulate fluid in the pseudocoelomic space, exposure to hypertonic conditions did not significantly affect growth or reproduction in these nematodes. These results suggest that CDR expression is required for optimal viability but does not function in osmoregulation.
