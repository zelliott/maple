Although cells from both epidermis and dermis have been shown to produce a variety of soluble mediators in vitro, it is not clear whether this reflects the in vivo situation. To study in vivo cytokine expression, whole skin as well as dispase-separated epidermis and dermis from normal adult mice were prepared and snap-frozen immediately. RNA was then extracted and analyzed both by conventional and by competitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Molecular analysis showed that murine skin in vivo constitutively expresses several cytokine genes at moderate (e.g., interleukin-1 alpha) or low (e.g., interleukin-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) abundance. A striking, rapid upregulation was observed for some of these cytokines in the process of tissue separation. Of interest, the epidermal and dermal compartments exhibited different induction patterns: interleukin-1 alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression were detected preferentially in the epidermis, whereas upregulation of interleukin-6 was found to be most prominent in the dermis. This pattern of cytokine expression was also reflected in supernatants generated from the respective single-cell suspensions. Thus, this study determines the baseline in vivo cytokine expression in the skin and the occurrence of immediate, compartment-specific alterations on perturbation. These data should contribute to our understanding of both skin homeostasis and the host-defense mechanisms initiated following injury to this organ.
