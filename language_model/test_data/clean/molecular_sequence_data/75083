Ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase is a recently discovered enzyme that catalyzes the activation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase ["rubisco"; ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase; 3-phospho-D-glycerate carboxy-lyase (dimerizing), EC 4.1.1.39] in vivo. Clones of rubisco activase cDNA were isolated immunologically from spinach (Spinacea oleracea L.) and Arabidopsis thaliana libraries. Sequence analysis of the spinach and Arabidopsis cDNAs identified consensus nucleotide binding sites, consistent with an ATP requirement for rubisco activase activity. A derived amino acid sequence common to chloroplast transit peptides was also identified. After synthesis of rubisco activase in vitro, the transit peptide was cleaved and the protein was transported into isolated chloroplasts. Analysis of spinach and Arabidopsis nuclear DNA by hybridization indicated a single rubisco activase gene in each species. Leaves of spinach and Arabidopsis wild type contained a single 1.9-kilobase rubisco activase mRNA. In an Arabidopsis mutant lacking rubisco activase protein, mRNA species of 1.7 and 2.1 kilobases were observed under conditions of high-stringency hybridization with a wild-type cDNA probe. This observation indicates that the lesion in the mutant arises from an error in mRNA processing.
