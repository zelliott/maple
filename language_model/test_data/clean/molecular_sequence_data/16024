A prediction scheme has been developed for the IBM PC and compatibles containing computer programs which make use of the protein secondary structure prediction algorithms of Nagano (1977a,b), Garnier et al. (1978), Burgess et al. (1974), Chou and Fasman (1974a,b), Lim (1974) and Dufton and Hider (1977). The results of the individual prediction methods are combined as described by Hamodrakas et al. (1982) by the program PLOTPROG to produce joint prediction histograms for a protein, for three types of secondary structure: alpha-helix, beta-sheet and beta-turns. The scheme requires uniform input for the prediction programs, produced by any word processor, spreadsheet, editor or database program and produces uniform output on a printer, a graphics screen or a file. The scheme is independent of any additional software and runs under DOS 2.0 or later releases.
