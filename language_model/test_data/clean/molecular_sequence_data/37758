DNA of SpV1-like spiroplasma plectroviruses (rods with single-stranded circular DNA) is scattered in the genome of the phytopathogen Spiroplasma citri and has significant consequences for evolution of the S. citri genome. We determined the complete nucleotide sequence of SVTS2, a SpV1-like virus of S. melliferum, a honeybee pathogen, to ascertain, by comparison with S. citri SpV1 viruses (GenBank U28974 and X51344), the defining features of this important group. The 6,824 nt DNA contains nine ORFs homologous to ORFs of S. citri SpV1 viruses and five ORFs unique to SVTS2. The predicted amino acid sequences of the homologous ORFs were 17-38% identical to those of their S. citri counterparts. The SVTS2 predicted ORF 1 product (Mr 47,031) was considerably smaller than those of known S. citri SpV1 viruses. Also, in contrast to those viruses, SVTS2 lacked an ORF with recognizable similarity to a transposase. ORF 2 of all three viruses had a homologue among the products of genes of MVL-1, a virus of Acholeplasma laidlawii, another plectrovirus. The results suggest that, at most, only slightly more than half of SpV1 genomes consists of genes shared by all spiroplasma viruses of the group.
