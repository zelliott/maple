It is unclear whether the six known human defensin peptides are all encoded by separate genes or whether some of them are allelic. Three of the peptides, HP-1, HP-2, and HP-3, differ by only one amino acid, and it is thought that HP-2 may represent a proteolytic product of HP-1 and/or HP-3. To help determine the relationship of these three proteins, we isolated a nearly full-length cDNA encoding HP-1 with a sequence very similar to, but different from, the previously isolated HP-1 and -3 cDNAs. Gene copy number experiments established that there were at least two but fewer than five defensin genes with a high level of similarity to the HP-1 cDNA (HP-1/3-like). Three genomic clones were isolated that contained two different configurations of the HP-1/3-like sequences. Sequencing established that one encoded the HP-1 peptide, whereas the other encoded HP-3. Analysis of DNAs obtained from 18 unrelated individuals by Southern blot analysis revealed the expected fragments as well as additional fragments that were not present in the genomic clones. This suggested the possibility of alleles; however, when DNAs from families were examined, these fragments did not segregate in an obvious Mendelian fashion. The HP-1/3-like defensin genes are on human chromosome 8. Surprisingly, somatic cell hybrid mapping showed that the number of HP-1/3-like genes on isolated copies of chromosome 8 was variable. We conclude that individuals can inherit versions of chromosome 8 harboring either two or three copies of the genes that encode the HP-1, HP-2, and/or HP-3 peptides.
