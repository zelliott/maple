The 23-kDa protein encoded by the 5' segment of the E1 open reading frame of bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV1) was previously ascribed a negative regulatory function for the replication of viral plasmid DNA. However, results from recent functional and biochemical studies do not readily support this genetic assignment. Therefore, we have reassessed the role of this protein in papillomavirus DNA replication by using a mutant of BPV1 which is unable to express this E1 protein. This mutant viral DNA was found to replicate extrachromosomally with stability and copy number per cell similar to those of wild-type plasmid DNA. Thus, the absence of expression of the 23-kDa E1 protein did not lead to deregulated viral plasmid replication. We conclude that the 23-kDa E1 protein is nonessential for stable plasmid replication.
