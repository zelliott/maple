The design, synthesis, and preliminary evaluation of the first example of synthetic pentasaccharide (1) that shows marked rate enhancement and specificity for the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and orthophosphate (OP) are reported. At the concentration ratios of GTP/1 = 3.6 and GTP/Mg(2+) = 1 (pH 7.1, 50 degrees C), a rate enhancement of about 500-fold was obtained.[reaction: see text]
