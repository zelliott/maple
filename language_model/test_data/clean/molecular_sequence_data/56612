We isolated a gene encoding a 218 kDa myosin-like protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a monoclonal antibody directed against human platelet myosin as a probe. The protein sequence encoded by the MLP1 gene (for myosin-like protein) contains extensive stretches of a heptad-repeat pattern suggesting that the protein can form coiled coils typical of myosins. Immunolocalization experiments using affinity-purified antibodies raised against a TrpE-MLP1 fusion protein showed a dot-like structure adjacent to the nucleus in yeast cells bearing the MLP1 gene on a multicopy plasmid. In mouse epithelial cells the yeast anti-MLP1 antibodies stained the nucleus. Mutants bearing disruptions of the MLP1 gene were viable, but more sensitive to ultraviolet light than wild-type strains, suggesting an involvement of MLP1 in DNA repair. The MLP1 gene was mapped to chromosome 11, 25 cM from met1.
