Designed peptide conjugates molecules are used to direct the synthesis and assembly of gold nanoparticles into complex 1D nanoparticle superstructures with various morphologies. Four peptide conjugates, each based on the gold-binding peptide (AYSSGAPPMPPF; PEPAu ), are prepared: C12H23O-AYSSGAPPMPP (1), C12H23O-AYSSGAPPMPPF (2), C12H23O-AYSSGAPPMPPFF (3), and C12H23O-AYSSGAPPMPPFFF (4). The affect that C-terminal hydrophobic F residues have on both the soft-assembly of the peptide conjugates and the resulting assembly of gold nanoparticle superstructures is examined. It is shown that the addition of two C-terminal F residues (3) leads to thick, branched 1D gold nanoparticle superstructures, whereas the addition of three C-terminal F residues (4) leads to bundling of thin 1D nanoparticle superstructures.
