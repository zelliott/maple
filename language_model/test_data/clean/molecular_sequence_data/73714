We have previously shown that patients with the Hunter syndrome frequently have suffered from a recombination event between the IDS gene and its putative pseudogene, IDS-2, resulting in an inversion of the intervening DNA. The inversion, which might be the consequence of an intrachromosomal mispairing, is caused by homologous recombination between sequences located in intron 7 of the IDS gene and sequences located distal of exon 3 in IDS-2. In order to gain insight into the mechanisms causing the inversion, we have isolated both inversion junctions in six unrelated patients. DNA sequence analysis of the junctions showed that all recombinations have taken place within a 1 kb region where the sequence identity is >98%. An interesting finding was the identification of regions with alternating IDS gene and IDS-2 sequences present at one inversion junction, suggesting that the recombination event has been initiated by a double-strand break in intron 7 of the IDS gene. The results from this study suggest that homologous recombination in man could be explained by mechanisms similar to those described for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The results also have practical implications for diagnosis of patients with the Hunter syndrome.
