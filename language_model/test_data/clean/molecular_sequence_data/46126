Pathogen attack triggers a multifaceted defence response in plants that includes the accumulation of pathogenesis-related proteins and their corresponding transcripts. One of these transcripts encodes for WIR1, a small glycine- and proline-rich protein of unknown function that appears to be specific to grass species. Here we describe members of the HvWIR1 multigene family of barley with respect to phylogenetic relationship, transcript regulation, co-localization with quantitative trait loci for resistance to the barley powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis (DC.) E.O. Speer f.sp. hordei, the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms or gene haplotypes with resistance, as well as phenotypic effects of gene silencing by RNAi. HvWIR1 is encoded by a multigene family of moderate complexity that splits up into two major clades, one of those being also represented by previously described cDNA sequences from wheat. All analysed WIR1 transcripts accumulated in response to powdery mildew attack in leaves and all mapped WIR1 genes were associated with quantitative trait loci for resistance to B. graminis. Moreover, single nucleotide polymorphisms or haplotypes of WIR1 members were associated with quantitative resistance of barley to B. graminis, and transient WIR1 gene silencing affected the interaction of epidermal cells with the pathogen. The presented data provide convergent evidence for a role of the HvWIR1a gene and possibly other family members, during the interaction of barley with B. graminis.
