A clone expressing xylanase activity in Escherichia coli has been selected from a genomic plasmid library of the thermophilic Bacillus strain D3. Subcloning from the 9-kb insert located the xylanase activity to a 2.7-kb HindII/BamHI fragment. The DNA sequence of this clone revealed an ORF of 367 codons encoding a single domain type-F or family 10 enzyme, which was designated as XynA. Purification of the enzyme following over-expression in E. coli produced an enzyme of 42 kDa with a temperature optimum of 75 degrees C which can efficiently bind and hydrolyse insoluble xylan. The pH optimum of the enzyme is 6.5, but it is active over a broad pH range. A homology model of the xylanase has been constructed which reveals a series of surface aromatic residues which form hydrophobic clusters. This unusual structural feature is strikingly similar to the situation observed in the structure determined for the type-G xylanase from the Bacillus D3 strain and may constitute a common evolutionary mechanism imposed on different structural frameworks by which these xylanases may bind potential substrates and exhibit thermostability.
