The gene encoding chick cerebellar Bergmann glia-specific kainate binding protein (chKBP), has been isolated, characterized and expressed in heterologous systems. The structural gene spans 11.2 kb and contains 11 exons and 10 introns. Several of the exons encode specific receptor domains, including each of the predicted transmembrane regions. Exon/intron boundaries flanking the second, putative channel-forming transmembrane domain are conserved between chKBP and other glutamate/kainate receptor subunits. The putative promoter region 5' to the first exon displays high GC content and TATA, CAAT and AP1 consensus sequences. Transcription of the chKBP gene is evident prior to full cerebellar cortical maturation. Transcripts are abundant in cells consistent with Bergmann glia, as revealed by in situ hybridization. Transfection of 293 kidney cell cultures with chKBP cDNA or chKBP gene expression constructs confers CNQX-sensitive kainate binding with the pharmacological specificity displayed by both chKBP and kainate receptors. However, expression of the same constructs in Xenopus oocytes fails to yield detectable agonist-activated currents.
