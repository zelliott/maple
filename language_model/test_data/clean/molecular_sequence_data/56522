We have found the gene (Hb) encoding the B-type of the major hemoglobin (Hb) component in the ciliated protist, Paramecium caudatum, stock K33 of syngen 3. Gene Hb, which encodes a protein consisting of 116 amino acids (aa), had the same sequence as the A-type Hb in this species, with the exception of 10 nucleotides (nt) reflecting 5 single-aa differences. The coding region was interrupted at the position between codons 62 and 63 by one short intron, which was comparable with the second intron of plant Hb in position, phase and nt sequence. The maximum alignment of the P. caudatum Hb aa sequence with the other globin sequences from prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes indicates that these globins can be classified into two groups: one consists of protist and cyanobacterial globins of about 120 aa, and the other consists of fungal and other bacterial globins of about 150 aa having a significant homology with higher eukaryotic Hbs. These proteins share more than 25% homology with one another in each group. Our finding of the P. caudatum Hb intron corresponding to the second intron of plant Hb suggests that all of the globin-encoding genes have a common origin, and that at least two groups had already existed in the globin-encoding gene before prokaryote-eukaryote radiation.
