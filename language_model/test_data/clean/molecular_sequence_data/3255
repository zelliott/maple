We had previously isolated six pre-tRNA splicing mutants of Schizosaccharomyces pombe named ptp1 to ptp6. To investigate the molecular mechanism of tRNA splicing, we cloned the ptp4(+) gene by complementation of the temperature-sensitive growth defect. The ptp4(+) gene consists of three exons and encodes a putative protein of 218 amino acids with a molecular mass of 24.4 kDa. Analysis of the amino acid sequence reveals that the protein is a potential membrane protein with four membrane-spanning regions. The ptp4(+) shows significant similarity to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae putative protein YOR311C. Expression of the ptp4(+) gene in the ptp4(-) mutant restores the ability to splice tRNA. Northern blot analysis showed that the ptp4(+) gene is expressed in both mating-type cells of S. pombe. These results suggest that the Ptp4(+) could be a component involved in tRNA splicing.
