We report here the nucleotide sequence of a full-length cDNA encoding ent-kaurene synthase that was isolated by a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction from Gibberella fujikuroi (Gcps/ks). This cDNA encodes 952 amino acid residues with a relative molecular mass of 107 kDa. The sequence similarity between Gcps/ks and ent-kaurene synthase of the gibberellin A1-producing fungus, Phaeosphaeria sp. L487, is very high, suggesting that Gcps/ks is also a bifunctional diterpene cyclase. Its recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli converted geranylgeranyl diphosphate to copalyl diphosphate and ent-kaurene.
