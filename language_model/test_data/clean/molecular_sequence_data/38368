A full length cDNA encoding the highly immunodominant 41 kDa antigen of Strongyloides stercoralis (P5), recognized by 83% of human patients [Siddiqui et al. (1997) Parasitol Res 83:655-658], is obtained. A clone containing a 1371 bp insert was selected following screening of the S. stercoralis cDNA library with antibodies specific to antigen P5. The nucleotide sequence of this insert identified a cDNA coding for the gamma-subunit of isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD+), GenBank Accession Number AF176568. The conceptually translated amino acid sequence of the open reading frame for the gamma-subunit of S. stercoralis isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD+) encodes a 388 amino acid residue protein with an apparent molecular weight of 43 kDa and a predicted pI of 7.15. The sequence is 71% A/T, reflecting the characteristic A/T codon bias of S. stercoralis. The amino acid sequence of the S. stercoralis gamma-subunit of isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD+) is compared with those of Caenorhabditis elegans, rat and human NAD(+)-ICDH. The diagnostic potential of the S. stercoralis gamma-subunit of isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD+) is also discussed.
