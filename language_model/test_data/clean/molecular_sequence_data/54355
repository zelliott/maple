Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is characterized by elevated pulmonary artery resistance and increased medial thickness due to deregulation of vascular remodeling. Inactivating mutations of the BMPRII gene, which encodes a receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), are identified in ∼60% of familial PAH (FPAH) and ∼30% of idiopathic PAH (IPAH) patients. It has been hypothesized that constitutive reduction in BMP signal by BMPRII mutations may cause abnormal vascular remodeling by promoting dedifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs). Here, we demonstrate that infusion of the amiloride analog phenamil during chronic-hypoxia treatment in rat attenuates development of PAH and vascular remodeling. Phenamil induces Tribbles homolog 3 (Trb3), a positive modulator of the BMP pathway that acts by stabilizing the Smad family signal transducers. Through induction of Trb3, phenamil promotes the differentiated, contractile vSMC phenotype characterized by elevated expression of contractile genes and reduced cell growth and migration. Phenamil activates the Trb3 gene transcription via activation of the calcium-calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) pathway. These results indicate that constitutive elevation of Trb3 by phenamil is a potential therapy for IPAH and FPAH.
