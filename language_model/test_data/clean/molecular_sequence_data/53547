A morphological and physiological description of an alkane-assimilating anamorphic basidiomycetous yeast species, named Trichosporon veenhuisii, is presented. The ability to assimilate several aliphatic and aromatic compounds as sole source of carbon and energy is reported. The phylogenetic position within the genus, based on nuclear base sequencing of the D1/D2 region of the large subunit of rDNA, is discussed. The type strain is CBS 7136T.
