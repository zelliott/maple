Sixteen Gram-negative, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming isolates were obtained from a nitrifying inoculum. Analysis of repetitive sequence-based PCR and SDS-PAGE banding patterns, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and DNA-DNA hybridizations showed that the isolates belonged to various groups within the genus Pseudomonas. One group of isolates could be assigned to Pseudomonas migulae and a second to Pseudomonas veronii. Two groups could be differentiated genotypically from each other and from all other currently known Pseudomonas species. Analysis of the fatty acid composition and physiological and biochemical tests allowed differentiation of these groups from their closest phylogenetic neighbours and they therefore represent two novel species within the genus Pseudomonas, for which the names Pseudomonas peli sp. nov. and Pseudomonas borbori sp. nov. are proposed, with strains LMG 23201(T) (=DSM 17833(T)=R-20805(T)) and LMG 23199(T) (=DSM 17834(T)=R-20821(T)), respectively, as the type strains.
