Alkaline phosphatase (AP) is secreted into the medium when the carboxy-terminal 25 amino acids are replaced by the 60 amino acid carboxy-terminal signal peptide (HlyAs) of Escherichia coli haemolysin (HlyA). Secretion of the AP-HlyAs fusion protein is dependent on HlyB and HlyD but independent of SecA and SecY. The efficiency of secretion by HlyB/HlyD is decreased when AP carries its own N-terminal signal peptide. Translocation of this fusion protein into the periplasm is not observed even in the absence of HlyB/HlyD. The failure of the Sec export machinery to transport the latter protein into the periplasm seems to be due in part to the loss of the carboxy-terminal sequence of AP since even AP derivatives which do not carry the HlyA signal peptide but lack the 25 C-terminal amino acids of AP are localized in the membrane but not translocated into the periplasm.
