Thyroid hormones are responsible for the specific biochemical and structural changes that occur during amphibian metamorphosis. In this study we screened a series of cDNAs from a library constructed from T4-treated premetamorphic tadpole liver poly(A)+ RNA in order to identify a clone that could be used to study the influence of T3 on liver-specific gene expression during Rana catesbeiana metamorphosis. The cDNA from one clone exhibited a greater degree of hybridization to liver RNA from thyroid hormone-treated tadpoles than untreated tadpoles and no hybridization to RNA from tail fins of tadpoles of either group. On Northern blots, the mRNA to which the cDNA hybridized was 2.3 kilobases in size. The pattern of hybridization to genomic DNA digested by various restriction enzymes was consistent with the presence of a single gene. Using slot blot analysis we found that the mRNA levels first rose above basal levels only after 5 days of immersion of tadpoles in 12.5 micrograms/liter T3. The mRNA levels increased approximately 10-fold after 7 and 9 days of treatment. Frog livers had mRNA levels that were intermediate between those in untreated tadpoles and tadpoles immersed in T3 for 7 days. Sequence analysis revealed a significant degree of homology to serum albumin and alpha-fetoprotein. While it is known that serum albumin levels rise dramatically during metamorphosis in Rana species, presumably playing a critical role in maintaining water and electrolyte balance during the animals' terrestrial phase, the molecular basis of the induction has not been fully explained.
