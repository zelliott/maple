The ability of the nuclear oncoprotein Jun to activate transcription is controlled both by level of DNA binding and by the activity of its transactivation domain. Control of DNA binding is achieved by two mechanisms: phosphorylation and redox regulation. Mutation of Ser-226 inhibits phosphorylation of the DNA binding, resulting in enhanced DNA-binding and transactivation activity of Jun. In contrast, mutation of Cys-252, which is the target for repression of DNA-binding activity under oxidative conditions, results in a strong decrease of Jun-specific activation of transcription. However, transactivation by c-Jun-Cys-252 is fully restored upon mutation of Ser-226. Both mutations are also found in the oncogenic counterpart of c-Jun, v-Jun, and are the only differences between these proteins in the DNA-binding domain, suggesting that v-Jun escapes down-modulation of DNA binding by both mechanisms. However, inhibition of phosphorylation of Ser-226 is absolutely required for the ability of v-Jun to activate transcription of AP-1-dependent genes in a redox-independent manner.
