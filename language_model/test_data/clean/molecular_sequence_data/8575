Two types of ferritin heavy (H) chain clones have been isolated from cDNA libraries of human fetal and adult brain: one corresponds to the ferritin H chain mRNA that is abundant in liver and is called "liver-like" brain cDNA; the other contains an additional 279 nucleotide (nt) sequence in the 3' untranslated region and is called brain ferritin H chain cDNA. To map the 279-nt sequence, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was carried out using DNA from rodent x human hybrid cell lines containing single human chromosomes as templates, and oligomeric primers homologous to the 3' end of the 279-nt sequence (primer A) and to a coding sequence just 5' to the 279-nt sequence. Significant PCR product of the size expected from analysis of the brain ferritin H chain cDNA clones and a genomic ferritin H chain clone (487 bp) was generated only from hybrid-cell DNA containing human chromosome 11. This PCR product and the "liver-like" brain cDNA (lacking the 279-nt sequence) both hybridized to chromosome 11 fragments that are known to define the well-characterized functional liver ferritin H chain gene and a putative pseudogene. Preliminary data indicate that primer A (and thus the 279-nt sequence) maps to the functional ferritin H chain gene fragments, but binding to the pseudogene has not been ruled out.
