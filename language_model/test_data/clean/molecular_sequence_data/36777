The well recognized prevalence of infectious agents in products derived from human whole blood and the increasing number of transfusion-transmitted diseases has made urgent the search for a safe alternative to conventional blood transfusion. Sources of hemoglobin (Hb) different from outdated human bank blood are under active scrutiny in several laboratories. Different approaches have been proposed to produce recombinant human Hb in bacteria (E. coli), yeast (S. cerevisiae) and transgenic mammals. These efforts have lead to the synthesis of recombinant human Hb with functional properties similar to those of native human Hb A. Site directed mutagenesis enables one to modify the structure of the recombinant globin chains with the view of lowering the oxygen affinity and increasing the stability of the tetramers. Progress is still necessary to ensure scaling-up and safe purification procedures, and to prolong shelf life of these solutions.
