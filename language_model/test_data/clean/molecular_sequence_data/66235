This paper reports the identification and characterisation of a 60kDa surface protein antigen (P60) of Mycoplasma capricolum subspecies capricolum (Mcc), and describes its diagnostic application. Genomic localization and presence in P60 of conserved functional domains suggested a structural and functional relationship with the immunodominant antigen P48 of Mycoplasma agalactiae, a basic membrane protein. A rP60-ELISA was developed, and it resulted in a high specificity for Mcc infections after evaluation with 125 goat sera. The comparison with an existent ELISA based on whole Mcc cell lysates showed that the two assays have comparable sensitivities, but the rP60-ELISA has the significant advantage of a greater specificity. Results indicate that P60 is a potential marker of Mcc infection, especially useful in areas where the presence of M. capricolum subspecies capripenumoniae is also reported.
