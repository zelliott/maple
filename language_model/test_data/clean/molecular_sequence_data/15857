Using cosmids covering about 117 Kb upstream of the human immunoglobulin chain C mu gene, we have identified a potentially functional VH gene, belonging to the VHVI subgroup. This VHVI gene is only about 95 Kb from the C mu gene and is probably the first functional VH segment of the Igh locus. These results illustrate the proximity of the human VH, DH and JH segments involved in creation of the complete heavy chain genes.
