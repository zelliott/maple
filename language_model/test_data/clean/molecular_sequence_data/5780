We have isolated a cDNA clone encoding the human ribosomal protein L38 (HSRPL38). The longest ORF of the cDNA predicts a lysine-rich small polypeptide identical to the rat RPL38 protein (100% identity), and sharing a 84% of identity to the tomato RPL38 protein sequence. Northern blot analysis of a number of epithelial cell lines showed that the HSRPL38 is encoded by a mRNA ubiquitously expressed. Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA suggested that the RPL38 does not constitute a multigene family but it is encoded by a reduced set of active genes, among which we have also found a RPL38 processed pseudogene located in the promoter region of the human type-1 angiotensin II receptor gene. This RPL38 pseudogene is very unusual among processed pseudogenes in that the poly A tail and the entire 5'-UTR of the original RPL38 mRNA were deleted during the retrotransposition process.
