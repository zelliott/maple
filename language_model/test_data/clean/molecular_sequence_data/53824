In mature male sheep, the level of nutrition acutely influences the secretion of reproductive hormones. The mechanism involved is not fully understood but findings in humans and laboratory rodents would suggest a major role for leptin that is secreted from adipose tissue and then travels via the circulation to the central nervous system. Before we can begin to test this hypothesis, we need to be able to measure leptin concentrations in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. We have therefore developed a radioimmunoassay using antibodies raised against biologically active recombinant bovine-ovine leptin. Using this assay, we found that plasma concentrations of leptin were highly correlated to back-fat thickness and to the ratio of back-fat thickness to liveweight, in female and castrated male sheep. Plasma concentrations of leptin were higher in female sheep than in castrated or intact male sheep. Serial samples (every 5 min) suggested that the secretion of leptin in male sheep is episodic but it does not appear to show clear pulsatility, increases post-prandially, or a diurnal rhythm. Leptin concentrations in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid increased within 5 days in male sheep fed a diet with a high content of energy and protein that also stimulates the secretion of LH pulses. These data suggest that in sheep, as in other species, leptin production is correlated with the mass of adipose tissue and that the hormone passes from the circulation to the cerebrospinal fluid and then to hypothalamic sites. There, it may affect appetite and perhaps GnRH secretion. The role of leptin in the link between nutrition and reproduction needs further investigation.
