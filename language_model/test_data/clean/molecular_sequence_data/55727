Genetic engineering studies of ovomucoid domains have been hindered by the lack of an efficient procedure for overproducing this protein. The novel scheme presented here has led to the isolation of chicken ovomucoid third domain (OMCHI3) at a level of 22 mg pure protein/l Escherichia coli culture medium. The gene coding for OMCHI3 was fused to the 3' end of the gene encoding staphylococcal nuclease (SNase). Expression of the chimeric gene was placed under control of the strong transcription and translation signals of the phage T7 promoter. Upon isopropyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside induction, the cells harboring the target plasmid efficiently overproduced the protein (30% of the total soluble protein). The 56-residue fragment corresponding to OMCHI3 was then liberated by cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage at a genetically engineered methionine residue located at the nuclease--OMCHI3 junction (OMCHI3 lacks an internal methionine). SDS--PAGE, enzyme inhibition studies and NMR spectroscopy all indicated that the recombinant OMCHI3 has properties identical to those of OMCHI3 isolated from its natural source. The expression system was easily adapted for the production of [98% U 15N] OMCHI3. The expression vector was mutated for overexpression of turkey ovomucoid third domain (OMTKY3), which differs from OMCHI3 by three amino acid substitutions. Since many other avian ovomucoid domains also lack methionine residues, this approach should be suitable for large-scale production and isotope labeling of homologous proteinase inhibitors with a variety of inhibitory specificities.
