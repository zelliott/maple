Trauma, disease, developmental deformities, and tumor resection frequently cause bone defects that seriously challenge the skills of orthopedic and maxillofacial surgeons. Currently, repairing osseous deficiencies involves various medical surgical techniques, including autogenous grafts, allografts, internal and external fixation devices, electrical stimulation, and alloplastic implants. The existing technology, though effective in many cases, still is beset with numerous difficulties and disadvantages. A critical need for improved treatment methods exists today. Biotechnology now provides access to new bone repair concepts via administration of protein growth and morphogenic factors. Implantable device and drug delivery system technologies also have advanced. The converging biopharmaceutical, device, and delivery technologies represent an opportunity to improve the quality of health care for individuals with orthopedic and maxillofacial deficiencies. This report reviews current concepts in fracture healing and bone repair and examines existing treatment modalities. It also addresses novel protein drugs that stimulate osseous regeneration and delivery systems for these drugs.
