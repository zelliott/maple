To investigate the mechanism of avian influenza outbreak wildly in water fowls, the co-pathogens, especially that caused immuno-depression were studied. A pair of degenerated primers, which amplified a fragment of 552bp in length, was designed and synthesized based on the published goose and other Circovirus sequences. The specific PCR product was amplified from the goose sample of Yongkang avian influenza case of Zhejiang Province. The fragment was then sequenced and the result showed the existence of the GoCV. The opposite part of the genome was further amplified using inverse primers designed based on the 552bp sequence obtained and the 1821bp full length genomic sequence of GoCV-yk01 was compiled using Seqman program of DNAStar. Sequence analysis showed that the GoCV-yk01 possessed common features of circovirus included potential replication associated stem-loop structure and the Rep protein motifs. Homology analysis showed that the sequence of GoCV-yk01 had 91% approximately 93% similarity to that of Taiwan and Germany strains. Phylogenetic analysis with ClustalW, however, showed that the GoCV-yk01 was on a different branch away from Taiwan and Germany strains. Circovirus usually causes immuno-depression and results in secondary infection, as it infects rapid growing cells as lymphocyte. It is speculated that the infection of GoCV may be a part of the reason of the avian influenza outbreak of the Yongkang case. The GoCV-yk01 is the first GoCV strain reported in mainland of China.
