A novel, strictly anaerobic, cadaverine-oxidizing, defined coculture was isolated from an anoxic freshwater sediment sample. The coculture oxidized cadaverine (1,5-diaminopentane) with sulfate as the electron acceptor. The sulfate-reducing partner could be replaced by a hydrogenotrophic methanogenic partner. The defined coculture fermented cadaverine to acetate, butyrate, and glutarate plus sulfide or methane. The key enzymes involved in cadaverine degradation were identified in cell extracts. A pathway of cadaverine fermentation via 5-aminovaleraldehyde and crotonyl-coenzyme A with subsequent dismutation to acetate and butyrate is suggested. Comparative 16S rRNA gene analysis indicated that the fermenting part of the coculture belongs to the subphylum Firmicutes but that this part is distant from any described genus. The closest known relative was Clostridium aminobutyricum, with 95% similarity.
