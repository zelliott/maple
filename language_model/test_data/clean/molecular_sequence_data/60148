Six new sucrose esters, sibiricoses A(1)-A(6) (1-6), two new xanthone C-glycosides, sibiricaxanthones A (7) and B (8), and a new acetophenone glycoside, sibiricaphenone (9), were isolated from the roots of Polygala sibirica together with six known glycosides. The structures of new compounds were elucidated on the basis of chemical and spectroscopic evidence. The structure of the known xanthone glycoside, polygalaxanthone III (10), was revised.
