Sequence comparison of the alpha-subunit of phosphorylase kinase with alpha-tropomyosin revealed 32% identity, and 49% similarity, between the region of alpha-tropomyosin coded by exon 5 and a 39 amino acid segment of the kinase subunit. A subsequence of the alpha-subunit segment and a sequence overlapping the same alpha-subunit region are homologous with: (a) a region of the cytoplasmic domain of EGF receptor (50% identity) and (b) a Ca(2+)-binding domain of the alpha chain of S-100 protein (50% identity) respectively. Statistical analysis shows that these homologies are significant. The biological implication of the above similarities is discussed.
