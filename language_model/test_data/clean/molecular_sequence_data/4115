cDNA-AFLP, an effective method for mRNA differential display, was employed to compare the gene expression in developing anthers between the male sterile and fertile plants of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivar, Dong A. In the micro-spore stage, there were more differential bands of cDNA-AFLP than that in the meio-phase stage. Among 64 differential fragments produced by cDNA-AFLP, three were randomly selected for further analysis. RNA dot blotting showed that the GHA27 transcript was expressed mainly in floral tissues; on the other hand, the GHA28 and GHA47 transcripts were present specifically in anther. BLAST analysis demonstrated that GHA27 was highly similar to the plant ADP-ribosylation factor genes, while GHA28 and GHA27 were shown no significant similar to any sequences in the available databases.
