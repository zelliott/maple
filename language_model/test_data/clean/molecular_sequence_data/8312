HIV infection is highly prevalent in Burundi.  There are, however, few published reports on the envelope sequence of the prevailing HIV-1 strains in the country.  The authors selected an isolate of HIV-1 from Burundi and characterize the envelope glycoprotein gp120 in detail.  A sample of venous blood was taken from a 36-year-old HIV-1-positive female volunteer from Bujumbura classified as WHO stage IV, exhibiting clinical AIDS and pulmonary tuberculosis.  Nine clones containing complete gp120 genes were derived from the isolate and were designated 91BU009D/1-9.  The sequences have been submitted to the Los Alamos Database under accession numbers L35452-L35459 (two clones had a stop codon in their C1 regions and were not studied further).  The viral sequences from the coculture closely reflect that circulating in the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  That finding is in striking contrast to the rapid adaptation and evolution of HIV-1 passaged onto human T cell lines.  The ability to isolate and culture virus in vitro without the rapid appearance and selection of mutants is important, because it enables relevant observations to be made with regard to the antigenic recognition of the virus by the host.  The authors' study found that although 91BU009D clustered with the D subtype, it contained unique sequences noticeably divergent from other characterized proviruses of the D subtype.  Further work to investigate and clarify the relationship between genotype and serotype of HIV-1 isolates is of the utmost importance if molecular epidemiology is to be of value in designing an effective AIDS vaccine.
