A recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) (EC 2.5.1.18) from the parasitic nematode Ascaris suum (AsGST1) displays specific activity with a variety of model substrates and secondary products of lipid peroxidation. The AsGST1 interacts with a range of model inhibitors, haematin-related compounds, bile acids and anthelminthics. The reported variations in biochemical activity correlate with structural differences observed by homology modelling. Here, differences in the topography of the proposed substrate binding site between the AsGST1 and the host GSTs were identified. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against the glutathione-binding proteins of A. suum and specific antibodies against AsGST1 were affinity-purified using the recombinant protein. These antibodies were used to localize the AsGST1 in adult worms by immunohistochemical staining. The strongest immunostaining for AsGST1 was localized in the intestine in all worms examined. This suggests that the enzyme may be responsible for the metabolism of materials that are incorporated from the environment, as well as for molecules that are excreted or secreted from the parasite to the environment. It also demonstrates the accessibility of the enzyme to an inhibitor or blocking antibody. In addition, the structure and sequence of the gene encoding AsGST1 have been determined. Southern-blot analyses of the AsGST1 gene suggests that it is a single-copy gene. The nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the gene is composed of four exons and three introns, and potential regulatory elements were identified in the 5' flanking sequence.
