A strictly anaerobic, halotolerant and thermotolerant strain, designated C5BEL(T), was isolated in north Tunisia from storage tanks holding waste generated by the recycling of discarded motor oils. Cells of strain C5BEL(T) were Gram-stain-positive, motile by laterally inserted flagella, straight, and spore-forming. Their two major fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0) and iso-C(15 : 0) dimethyl acetal. Growth was observed at temperatures of 25-55 °C (optimum, 40 °C) and at pH 6-9 (optimum, pH 7.5). The salinity range for growth was 0-100 g l(-1) NaCl (optimum, 5 g l(-1)). Yeast extract was required for growth. Strain C5BEL(T) was heterotrophic, able to use glucose, pyruvate, succinate, yeast extract, bio-trypticase and peptone, but unable to grow on Casamino acids. Sulfate, thiosulfate, sulfite, elemental sulfur, fumarate, nitrate and nitrite were not reduced. The DNA G+C content of strain C5BEL(T) was 31.1 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain C5BEL(T) was a member of the family Clostridiaceae, class Clostridia, phylum Firmicutes and was most closely related to Sporanaerobacter acetigenes Lup33(T) ( = DSM 13106(T)) (92.4 % similarity). On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons and physiological characteristics, strain C5BEL(T) can be classified as a novel species in a new genus, for which the name Anaerosalibacter bizertensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the type species is C5BEL(T) ( = DSM 23801(T) = JCM 17239(T)).
