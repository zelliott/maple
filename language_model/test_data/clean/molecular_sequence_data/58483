ATP and other nucleotides can be released from cells through regulated pathways, or following the loss of plasma membrane integrity. Once outside the cell, these compounds take on new roles as intercellular signaling molecules that elicit a broad spectrum of physiological responses through the activation of numerous cell surface receptor subtypes. This review summarizes recent advances in the molecular characterization of ATP receptors and discusses roles for cloned receptors in established and novel physiological processes.
