VDJ genes were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from mRNA isolated from peripheral blood B cells of rabbits immunized with protein C. The amplified genes were cloned into a lambda phage expression vector and packaged. A library of 6 x 10(5) recombinant phages was screened with labelled protein C and 30 positive clones were found. Three of them were plaque purified and the affinity of the single domain antibodies to the antigen determined to be 10(6)-10(7) l M-1. The data indicate the feasibility of generating single domain antibody, specific to protein antigen, from rabbit.
