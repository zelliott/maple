A gene, schC, adjacent to the sch gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of a polyketide spore pigment in Streptomyces halstedii was sequenced. Its deduced product resembled flavin adenine nucleotide-containing hydroxylases involved in the biosynthesis of polycyclic aromatic polyketide antibiotics and in catabolic pathways of aromatic compounds. When schC was disrupted, the normally green spores of S. halstedii became lilac. An schC-like gene was located in an equivalent position next to a large gene cluster (whiE) known to determine spore pigment in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2).
