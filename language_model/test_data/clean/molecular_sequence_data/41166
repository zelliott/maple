A moderately thermophilic, anaerobic, dissimilatory iron(III)-reducing bacterium (strain S3R1(T)) was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent chimney located on the Eastern Lau Spreading Centre in the Pacific Ocean at a depth of about 2150 m. Cells of strain S3R1(T) were ovals to short rods with a single polar flagellum, Gram-stain-negative, 0.5-0.6 µm in diameter and 0.8-1.3 µm long, growing singly or in pairs. The temperature range for growth was 36-62 °C, with an optimum at 50 °C. The pH range for growth was 5.5-7.5, with an optimum at pH 6.5. Growth of strain S3R1(T) was observed at NaCl concentrations ranging from 1.0 to 5.0 % (w/v), with an optimum at 2.0-2.5 % (w/v). The isolate used acetate, fumarate, malate, maleinate, succinate, propanol, palmitate, stearate, peptone and yeast extract as electron donors for growth and iron(III) reduction. All electron donors were oxidized completely to CO(2) and H(2)O. Iron(III) (in the form of ferrihydrite, ferric citrate or ferric nitrilotriacetate) and elemental sulfur (S(0)) were the electron acceptors that supported growth. The DNA G+C content was 64.4 mol%. Results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the novel bacterium was related to representatives of the orders Desulfuromonadales and Syntrophobacterales with 84-86 % sequence similarity and formed a distinct phylogenetic branch in the Deltaproteobacteria. On the basis of its physiological properties and results of phylogenetic analyses, it is proposed that the new isolate represents the sole species of a novel genus, Deferrisoma camini gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Deferrisoma camini is S3R1(T) ( = DSM 24185(T)  = VKM B-2672(T)).
