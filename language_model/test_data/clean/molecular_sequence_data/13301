16 pairs of oligonucleotide primers, complementary to unique DNA sequences of human chromosome 3, were synthesized. For 10 of these, fragments of expected length were generated in polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These fragments may be used as markers for detailed physical mapping of this chromosome. The above primers were used in PCR in order to analyse a hybrid mice-human cell line which contained presumably a fragment of human chromosome 3. The presence of human DNA in the hybrid line has been shown, but no ultimate evidence was received to confirm its location in human chromosome 3. By means of primers, complementary to the butyrylcholinesterase gene (BCHE), pools of clones from the yeast total library of human DNA were analysed, and then the pool and later the individual [correction of undividual] clone, containing a fragment of BCHE gene, were identified.
