Clostridium ljungdahlii sp. nov. strain ATCC 49587T (T = type strain) was isolated from chicken yard waste for its ability to produce ethanol from synthesis gas. This gram-positive, motile, sporeforming rod's metabolism was primarily acetogenic. C. ljungdahlii grew with carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide, ethanol, pyruvate, arabinose, xylose, fructose, or glucose. Methanol, ferulic acid, lactate, galactose, and mannose did not support growth. The G+C content was 22 to 23 mol%. C. ljungdahlii is the first acetogen in clostridial 23S rRNA homology group I.
