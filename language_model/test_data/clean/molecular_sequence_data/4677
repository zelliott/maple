Cytochrome P450s constitute a superfamily of genes encoding mostly microsomal hemoproteins that play a dominant role in the metabolism of a wide variety of both endogenous and foreign compounds. In insects, xenobiotic metabolism (i.e., metabolism of insecticides and toxic natural plant compounds) is known to involve members of the CYP6 family of cytochrome P450s. Use of a 3' RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) strategy with a degenerate primer based on the conserved cytochrome P450 heme-binding decapeptide loop resulted in the amplification of four cDNA sequences representing another family of cytochrome P450 genes (CYP28) from two species of isoquinoline alkaloid-resistant Drosophila and the cosmopolitan species Drosophila hydei. The CYP28 family forms a monophyletic clade with strong regional homologies to the vertebrate CYP3 family and the insect CYP6 family (both of which are involved in xenobiotic metabolism) and to the insect CYP9 family (of unknown function). Induction of mRNA levels for three of the CYP28 cytochrome P450s by toxic host-plant allelochemicals (up to 11.5-fold) and phenobarbital (up to 49-fold) corroborates previous in vitro metabolism studies and suggests a potentially important role for the CYP28 family in determining patterns of insect-host-plant relationships through xenobiotic detoxification.
