Extensive study of the phylogeny and evolution of the complement system has always been hampered by the difficulties involved in functional assays. These tests rely on the compatibility of the components from different species. Whereas all mammalian species appear to have almost identical classical, alternate and lytic pathways, non-mammalian vertebrates show minor differences. The source of the immunoglobulin molecule used to demonstrate classical pathway activation has also been shown to be crucial. The use of antibodies directed against complement components has been beneficial in the study of relationships, but cross-reactivity with non-complement proteins limited their use. The isolation and purification of complement components and the biochemical characterisation including amino acid analysis and peptide sequencing resulted in an enormous increase in our knowledge of the evolution of the complement system. Amino acid sequence analysis together with gene cloning of all human complement components finally revealed a number of sofar unknown features concerning the domain structure of the components and the relation of certain motifs and repeats to other proteins. The use of cDNA probes in Southern blot analysis of chromosomal DNA from various species enabled an extension of our scope of the phylogeny of complement. In this article we summarized the data on the phylogeny and evolution of the first component of complement and the associated molecules. We provide evidence for the conservation of the classical pathway and C1q in particular which appears to predate the divergence of the cartilaginous fish from the higher vertebrates. The possibility that the classical pathway could predate the alternate pathway is discussed.
