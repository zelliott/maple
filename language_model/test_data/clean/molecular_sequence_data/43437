Pneumolysin and proaerolysin are bacterial toxins that form pores in host cells by oligomerization. We propose that they may have similar structures despite a poor sequence identity. The crystal structure of proaerolysin reveals a protein composed of four domains, arranged in the shape of an elongated comma. Electron microscopy of the pneumolysin monomer shows a similar arrangement of domains. The sequence of pneumolysin recognizes the template of proaerolysin from a library of protein folds. A three-dimensional model of pneumolysin has been constructed by the comparative approach using the structure of proaerolysin. This model, together with results on the activity of site-specific mutants and the positions of antigenic sites, has been used to propose functional roles of individual domains.
