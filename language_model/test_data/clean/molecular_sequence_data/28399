The fourth gene from the human cystatin gene family of salivary-type cysteine-proteinase inhibitors has been isolated and partially characterized by DNA analysis. The gene, which we name CST3, codes for human cystatin C, and has the same organization as the CST1 gene for cystatin SN and the CST2 gene for cystatin SA. Southern analysis of EcoR I digested DNAs from 32 independent somatic cell hybrid clones hybridized to a probe from CST1 demonstrated that all members of the cystatin gene family segregate with human chromosome 20. These results indicate that the genes for salivary-type cystatins and cystatin C are members of a multigene family--the cystatin gene family.
