Ras proteins can be modified by two types of lipids--an isoprenoid and the fatty acid palmitate. These lipids help the otherwise cytoplasmic Ras protein to interact with the plasma membrane of a cell. The biological consequences of this association between Ras and membranes are dramatic, and can alter a cell's behavior from normal growth into malignancy. The scope and limits of our knowledge of the steps, structures and enzymes involved in this molecular transformation from soluble inactivity to membrane-bound potency are offered below. The prospects of regulating Ras function by controlling its intracellular location provides a tantalizing opportunity to translate research into a novel therapeutic reality.
