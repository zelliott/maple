We have isolated a cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana for a protein consisting of 323 amino acids with similarity to an extracellular nuclease from Staphylococcus. Nuclease assay using toluidine blue-DNA plates has demonstrated that the gene product has nuclease activity dependent on Ca(2+) and inhibited by Zn(2+), designated CAN (Ca(2+)-dependent nuclease). Differing from the staphylococcal nuclease, CAN has neither a signal peptide nor any long hydrophobic regions, suggesting that it is not a secreted protein.
