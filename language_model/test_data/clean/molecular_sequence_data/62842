Ninety-one bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) clones, selected effectively at random from our library, were used as probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization. Of these, 87 clones gave a specific signal in one, two or three different pair(s) of swine metaphase chromosomes. The ends of 35 BAC clones were sequenced in order to obtain information for comparative mapping. Fifteen of them gave useful comparative mapping information.
