The maize basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor R belongs to a group of proteins with important functions in the regulation of metabolism and development through the cooperation with R2R3-MYB transcription factors. Here we show that in addition to the bHLH and the R2R3-MYB-interacting domains, R contains a dimerization region located C-terminal to the bHLH motif. This protein-protein interaction domain is important for the regulation of anthocyanin pigment biosynthesis by contributing to the recruitment of the C1 R2R3-MYB factor to the C1 binding sites present in the promoters of flavonoid biosynthetic genes. The R dimerization region bares structural similarity to the ACT domain present in several metabolic enzymes. Protein fold recognition analyses resulted in the identification of similar ACT-like domains in several other plant bHLH proteins. We show that at least one of these related motifs is capable of mediating homodimer formation. These findings underscore the function of R as a docking site for multiple protein-protein interactions and provide evidence for the presence of a novel dimerization domain in multiple plant bHLH proteins.
