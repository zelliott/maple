The leukotrienes and lipoxins are biologically active metabolites derived from arachidonic acid. Their diverse and potent actions are associated with specific receptors. Recent molecular techniques have established the nucleotide and amino acid sequences and confirmed the evidence that suggested the existence of different G-protein-coupled receptors for these lipid mediators. The nomenclature for these receptors has now been established for the leukotrienes. BLT receptors are activated by leukotriene B(4) and related hydroxyacids and this class of receptors can be subdivided into BLT(1) and BLT(2). The cysteinyl-leukotrienes (LT) activate another group called CysLT receptors, which are referred to as CysLT(1) and CysLT(2). A provisional nomenclature for the lipoxin receptor has also been proposed. LXA(4) and LXB(4) activate the ALX receptor and LXB(4) may also activate another putative receptor. However this latter receptor has not been cloned. The aim of this review is to provide the molecular evidence as well as the properties and significance of the leukotriene and lipoxin receptors, which has lead to the present nomenclature.
