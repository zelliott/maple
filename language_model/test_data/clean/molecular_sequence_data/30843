The low-calcium response (lcr) region of the virulence plasmid of Yersinia pestis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Yersinia enterocolitica has been associated with calcium-dependent growth of bacteria. Mutations in the previously identified lcrE locus within the lcr region lack the repressor control of production of the lcr specific proteins, Yersinia outer membrane proteins (Yops) and V and W antigens. We sequenced a 3.3-kilobase-pair BamHI-ClaI fragment of the lcrE locus of pYVO3, the virulence plasmid of Y. enterocolitica O:3. The sequence of lcrE locus revealed six tightly packed open reading frames (ORFs), one of which was identified as the structural gene, lcrE, of the 32.9-kilodalton outer membrane protein LcrE (formerly known as Yop4b or YopN). Detection of large (greater than 2.3-kilobase-pair) transcripts strongly supports the conclusion that the lcrE gene and ORF1 to -5 function as an operon. Transcription of the lcrE-containing operon and the adjacent lcrB locus was found to be divergent, and the corresponding transcripts overlapped about 1,200 nucleotides. This extremely long overlap of the 5' ends of the transcripts produced from face-to-face promoters is a new finding; the longest overlap thus far found has been a few hundred nucleotides. Temperature was found to play the major role in regulation of transcription of the lcrE-containing operon of pYVO3, whereas Ca2+ concentration seemed to affect it only moderately.
