Glycan structures can modulate the biological properties and functions of glycoproteins. This has been shown by investigation of the biological activities and glycan structures of several recombinant glycoproteins. Glycan structures of glycoproteins differ according to the species and tissue producing them, and selection of an appropriate host-cell type can generate recombinant glycoproteins with new characteristics.
