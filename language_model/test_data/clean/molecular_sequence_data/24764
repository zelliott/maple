A seven-amino acid epitope GPGRAFY located inside the V3 loop on envelope protein gp120 of HIV-1 is the principal neutralizing epitope (PNE), and a subset of anti-V3 antibodies specific for this epitope show a broad range of neutralizing activity. But this epitope undergoes restricted mutation. In this study, three epitope peptides [C-(GPGRAFY)2, C-(GPGQTFY)2 and C-(GPGQAWY)2] that contain neutralizing epitope GPGRAFY and its two mutated epitope GPGQTFY and GPGQAWY, were synthesized and then conjugated to carrier protein KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin). the epitope-vaccines C-(GPGRAFY)2-KLH, C-(GPGQTFY)2-KLH and C-(GPGQAWY)2-KLH induced high levels of antibodies to three V3 loop peptides that contain these epitopes respectively, and the antibody response induced by each epitope-vaccine showed predefined epitope-specific. When these three epitope-peptides mixed together and conjugated to carrier protein, or conjugated to carrier protein separately and then mixed together, high levels of epitope-specific antibodies which respectively recognized these epitopes on V3 loop peptide and both mutated peptides all can be induced by both of them. In blotting assay, these epitope-specific antibodies all recognized the neutralizing epitope and mutated epitopes on peptides respectively. In addition, the reactivity of the antibodies with whole gp120 molecule which contained the epitope GPGRAFY was tested. Only the GPGRAFY-epitope-specific antibodies but not the other antibodies recognized the gp120 molecule. These results provide experimental evidence that the candidate multi-epitope-vaccine containing neutralizing epitope and mutated epitopes may bring new hope against viral mutation resulting in HIV-1 immune evasion and may be developed as an effective vaccine with a broad neutralizing activity against HIV-1 infection.
