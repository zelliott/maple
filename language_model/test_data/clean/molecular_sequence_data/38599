Asymmetric distribution of maternal mRNAs has not been well documented in zebrafish. Recently, we have shown that dazl mRNA is localized at the vegetal pole. Here we report a novel zebrafish gene, bruno-like (brul), which provides another example of vegetal mRNA localization. brul encodes an Elav-type RNA-binding protein that belongs to the Bruno-like family that includes mammalian CUG-BP, Xenopus EDEN-BP, and Drosophila Bruno. At 24 hpf, brul mRNA was abundant in lens fiber cells. At the onset of embryogenesis, maternal brul mRNA was detected at the vegetal pole, and it then migrated rapidly toward the blastoderm through yolk cytoplasmic streams. During oogenesis, brul mRNA became localized at the vegetal cortex at stage II, later than dazl mRNA. We found that anchoring of brul mRNA was dependent on microfilaments.
