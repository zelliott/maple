The complexity of the proteasome gene family in higher plants was investigated by identification and sequencing cDNA clones from the Arabidopsis thaliana database showing homologies to 20S proteasome subunits. We identified plant counterparts for each of the 14 proteasomal subunit subfamilies. Moreover, several of them were highly related isoforms. Mapping data indicate a random distribution of the proteasome genes over the Arabidopsis genome.
