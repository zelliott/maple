To obtain differentially expressed genes related to human glioma using cDNA microarray and make a preliminary study of one novel full-length gene.

Total RNA was extracted from human glioma tissues and normal brain tissues, and mRNA was used to make probes. After hybridization and washing procedure, the results of hybridization were scanned using computer system. One gene named 507E08 clone was subsequently analyzed by northern blotting, in situ hybridization, bioinformatics and radiation hybridization.

Fifteen differentially expressed novel genes related to human glioma were obtained through four times of hybridization and scanning. Northern blotting and in situ hybridization confirmed that 507E08 clone was lowly expressed in normal human brain tissue and over-expressed in human glioma tissue. BLASTn and BLASTx analysis showed that the clone 507E08 was a novel full-length gene with the length of 2002 bp. This gene, called human ribosomal protein 14.22 gene, codes 203 amino acids and is located on chromosome 14 between D14S1066 Marker and D14S265 Marker.

cDNA microarray technology can be successfully applied to identify differentially expressed genes with small amount of specimen, high quality, high speed, and high sensitivity. The novel full-length human ribosomal protein 14.22 gene may correlate with formation of human glioma.
