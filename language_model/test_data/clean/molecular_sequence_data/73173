New hepatitis viruses, hepatitis G virus(HGV) and hepatitis GB virus C(HGBV-C), were reported from two groups of researchers. Now these two are thought to be similar but HGV genome(U44402) and HGBV-C genome(U36380) do not have the same sequence. We compare these two sequences in both nucleotide and aminoacid analyses. Homology of nucleotide between HGV and HGBV-C is 83.8% in 5'NC region, 88.8% in core, 85.1% in E1, 85.7% in E2, 85.1% in NS2-3, 84.5% in NS4A, 86.8% in NS4B-5A, 88.6% in NS5B and 18.0% in 3'NC. The length of 3'NC is quite different between HGV and HGBV-C. Homology of aminoacid between these two viruses is 82.9% in core region, 87.3% in E1, 91.0% in E2, 97.4% in NS2-3, 93.8% in NS4A, 96.2% in NS4B-5A and 96.6% in NS5B. Especially helicase and replicase regions are highly conserved in 99.0% and 92.7% of aminoacid homology, respectively.
