The genetic defect leading to cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) has been determined in a 12-yr-old patient. Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) activity in cultured skin fibroblasts was reduced to approximately 9% of control fibroblasts. Plasma cholesterol (255 mg/dl) and LDL-cholesterol (215 mg/dl) were elevated whereas HDL-cholesterol was reduced (19 mg/dl). Triglycerides were moderately elevated (141 mg/dl). There were no clinical abnormalities with the exception of hepatosplenomegaly. Both parents have reduced LAL activity in white blood cells. PCR analysis of the LAL mRNA from the propositus revealed a single slightly smaller mRNA species in skin fibroblasts as well as in leukocytes. The mother of the patient and his older brother had two mRNA species: one of normal size and one of the same size as the propositus. The father has a LAL mRNA of normal size only. Sequence analysis of a PCR-amplified cDNA fragment showed a 72-bp in-frame deletion resulting in the loss of the codons for amino acids 254-277. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed that the 72 bp represent an exon, indicating that the deletion in the mRNA is caused by defective splicing. Sequence analysis of the patient's genomic DNA revealed a G-->A substitution in the last nucleotide of the 72-bp exon in one of his alleles. The mutant allele was shown to cosegregate with the truncated mRNA in the pedigree, providing further evidence that the G-->A substitution causes aberrant splicing and exon skipping. No normal-sized mRNA is detectable in the propositus even though he is not homozygous for the splice site mutation. This can be only accounted for by assuming that he is a compound heterozygote with a null allele inherited from his father. In summary, the data presented provide evidence that deletion of the codons for amino acids 254-277 in the LAL mRNA in combination with a null allele cause the clinical expression of CESD in our patient.
