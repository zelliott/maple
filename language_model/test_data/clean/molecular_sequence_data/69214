A number of natural cytokines are characterized as having dipeptidyl peptidase (DP) IV susceptible N-terminal peptide sequences. Here we demonstrate that oligopeptides with sequences analogous to the N-terminal part of human IL-1 beta, IL-2, TNF-beta and murine IL-6 were hydrolyzed by purified DP IV and aminopeptidase N (AP-N). The rate of DP IV-catalyzed hydrolysis of these peptides was negatively correlated with their chain length. In contrast to these results, no degradation was found under our conditions for the intact recombinant cytokines, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-2, G-CSF and for natural IL-2, independent of whether DP IV and AP-N were used separately or in combination.
