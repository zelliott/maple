Simian AIDS-related lymphomas (sARL) of cynomolgus monkeys infected with a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVsm) were studied in relation to growth in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, karyotype abnormalities, and DNA sequence of the first noncoding region of the Bcl-6 gene. The tumors were diffuse large B cell lymphomas and expressed a simian homolog to Epstein-Barr virus (HVMF-1) in 12 of 13 primary tumors and corresponding cell lines. A tested cell line was tumorigenic in SCID mice. Tumors in the SCID mice showed cell growth features similar to those in the original lymphoma, suggesting that no subpopulation with growth advantage was selected for in the mice. Spectral karyotype analysis of sARL cell lines showed normal cytogenetic features except for a trisomy of monkey chromosome 2 (corresponding to human chromosomes 7 and 21) in two of five sARL lines, which was not recovered in SCID tumors established from the same cell line. Sequence analysis of a Bcl-6 gene fragment showed sequence variations indicative of population polymorphism(s) in 10 of 13 sARLs, and no evidence of Bcl-6 mutations. Thus Bcl-6 mutations in the first noncoding region are irrelevant for sARL development in cynomolgus monkeys and for tumorigenicity of sARL cell lines. We also demonstrate that no cytogenetic alterations are needed for the development of highly aggressive lymphomas in the SIV-immunosuppressed host.
