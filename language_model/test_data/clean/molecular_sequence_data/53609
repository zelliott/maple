The function of the highly homologous Rac1A, Rac1B, and Rac1C GTPases of the Dictyostelium Rac1 group was investigated. All three GTPases bound with an equal capacity to the IQGAP-related protein DGAP1, with a preference for the activated GTP-bound form. Strong overexpression of wild-type Rac1 GTPases N-terminally tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP), predominantly induced the formation of numerous long filopodia. Remarkably, expression of the constitutively-activated GTPases resulted in dominant-negative phenotypes: these Rac1-V12 mutants completely lacked filopodia but formed numerous crown shaped structures resembling macropinosomes. Moreover, these mutants were severely impaired in cell motility, colony growth, phagocytosis, pinocytosis, cytokinesis and development. Transformants expressing constitutively-inactivated Rac1-N17 proteins were similar to wild-type cells, but displayed abundant and short filopodia and exhibited a moderate defect in cytokinesis. Taken together, our results indicate that the three GTPases play an identical role in signaling pathways and are key regulators of cellular activities that depend on the re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton in Dictyostelium.
