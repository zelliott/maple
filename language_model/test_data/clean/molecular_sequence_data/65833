Thirty-one isolates of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) isolated within the past 15 years from imported cattle by the Japanese Animal Quarantine Service (AQS) were used in this study in which a 5'-untranslated region of each isolate was genetically analyzed. Twenty-six of the 31 isolates were classified as BVDV1 and the remainder as BVDV2. Phylogenetic analysis of the RT-PCR fragments amplified from the isolates showed the presence of viruses belonging to the BVDV1a, BVDV1b, BVDV1c, unclassified BVDV1 genotypes, and BVDV2. From the cattle of Australian origin, 16 of 17 isolates were classified as BVDV1c. This result was in agreement with a report showing that BVDV1c was a predominant subgenotype in Australia. From the cattle of North American origin, BVDV1 and BVDV2 species were both found. BVDV2 from the North American cattle was identified as the same cluster as the BVDV 890 strain, which is the prototype of BVDV2. These results suggest that the BVDVs isolated from exported cattle at the AQS reflect the predominant genotypes of BVDVs found in the exporting countries. The unclassified BVDV1 genotype of Chinese origin was in the same cluster as the ZM-95 strain, which was isolated from pigs in China. In this study, the genomic properties of 31 isolates of BVDV collected in the AQS were investigated. We concluded that isolates are genetically heterogeneous but geographically restricted. The information obtained from this report will be useful when carrying out epidemiological surveys of BVDV isolated in Japan.
