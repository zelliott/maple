Ample evidence confirms that certain cancer cells have the capacity to produce multiple peptides as growth factors and that expression of their receptor may act in tumour cell paracrine and/or autocrine loop mechanisms, either by extracellular release of the growth factor or by the tumour itself. To study the possibility of an autocrine growth mechanism in bladder carcinoma, we investigated the ability of various bladder carcinoma cell lines to proliferate in serum-free medium. A rat bladder carcinoma cell line, BC47, demonstrated exponential and density-dependent growth in serum-free medium. Furthermore, conditioned medium from BC47 cells induced growth-stimulating activity for BC47 cells themselves. Purification and further characterization of this activity was performed by chromatographic methods, SDS-PAGE and N-terminal amino acid analysis. Finally, we have identified that a transferrin-like 70-kDa protein is found to be the main growth-promoting factor in this conditioned medium. In addition, specific antibodies against transferrin and the transferrin-receptor inhibit the in vitro growth of this cell line. Our data suggest that this transferrin-like factor possibly acts as an autocrine growth factor for cancer cells.
