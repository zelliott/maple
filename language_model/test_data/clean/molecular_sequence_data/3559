An optimized semi-automatic protocol for parallel synthesis of up to 96 peptide nucleic acids (PNA) or PNA-peptide conjugates using Boc-protection strategy has been developed using a robotic system. The approach is illustrated by synthesizing PNA and PNA-peptide libraries varying between 15 and 27  amino acid  units. The peptides (NLS (nuclear localization signal) or Tat-peptide) were attached to N-terminus of the PNA. The method was found to be far superior to that based on the SPOT/Fmoc protocol by which PNA oligomers are synthesized on a modified cellulose membrane. On a 0.5 micromole scale the method typically yielded 2 mg product of 90% purity by HPLC/MALDI-TOF analysis. This approach is suitable for screening of a large number of PNA and/or peptide sequences for biochemical and biological studies.
