D-Mannooligosaccharides (dp 1 to > 17) were released by mild acid hydrolysis from the phosphopeptidomannan of a Candida albicans strain of A serotype (VW.32). Among these, mannooligosaccharides ranging from bi- to hepta-ose, which were obtained in appreciable amounts, were structurally investigated and found to belong to the beta-D-(1-->2)-linked series. The occurrence of such compounds has already been reported in other Candida albicans strains. The complete 1H- and 13C-resonance assignments for manno-tri- to manno-hepta-ose are reported and general rules applicable for the 1NMR spectrum analysis of linear mannooligosaccharide of the general structure, beta-D-Man p-(1-->2)-[beta-D-Man p-(1-->2)]n-beta-D-Man p are proposed.
