In a search for highly polymorphic X-specific loci, the X-chromosome DOE Ch35 phage library (LAOXNL01) was screened with three oligonucleotides representative of minisatellite consensus sequences. A total of 170 clones containing human inserts were isolated by hybridization to the oligonucleotide sequences; each was tested for polymorphism on five random female DNAs with six restriction enzymes. Among the 53 clones demonstrating a polymorphic pattern, 47 were of distinct origin. Twelve of the polymorphisms (23%) were determined to be autosomal. Polymorphisms for the remaining 35 clones were characterized, These polymorphisms represent 33 new X-chromosome RFLP loci, since two pairs of clones detected partially overlapping patterns. A pattern of similar length variation with multiple enzymes ("VNTR-type") was demonstrated in 6 (50%) of the 12 non-X-polymorphic clones. However, only 3 (9%) of the 33 X polymorphic loci showed VNTR-like patterns, suggesting a decreased amount of VNTR polymorphism on the X chromosome. The 33 polymorphic X loci were physically localized with a set of rodent x human somatic cell hybrid DNAs representing nine different X-chromosome breakpoints.
