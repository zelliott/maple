alpha-Crystallin, the predominant eye lens protein with sequence homology to small heat shock proteins, acts like a molecular chaperone by suppressing the aggregation of damaged crystallins and proteins. To gain an insight into the amino acid sequences in alpha-crystallin involved in chaperone-like function, we used a cleavable, fluorescent, photoactive, crosslinking agent, sulfosuccinimidyl-2 (7-azido-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetamido)-ethyl-1,3' dithiopropionate (SAED), to derivatize yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and allowed it to complex with bovine alpha-crystallin at 48 degrees C. The complex was photolyzed and reduced with DTT and the subunits of alpha-crystallin, alpha A- and alpha B-, were separated. Fluorescence analysis showed that both alpha A- and alpha B-crystallins interacted with ADH during chaperone-like function. Tryptic digestion, amino acid sequencing, and mass spectral analysis of alpha B-crystallin revealed that APSWIDTGLSEMR (57-69) and VLGDVIEVHGKHEER (93-107) sequences were involved in binding with ADH.
