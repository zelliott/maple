The O-antigen polymer recovered from the reference strain for Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas or Pseudomonas) maltophilia serogroup O20, by mild acid hydrolysis of the lipopolysaccharide, was found to contain D-rhamnose and D-mannose. By means of chemical degradations and NMR studies, the repeating-unit of the polymer was deduced to be a linear tetrasaccharide with the structure shown. -->2)-alpha-D-Manp-(1-->3)-beta-D-Rhap-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Rh ap-(1-->2)-alpha-D- Rhap-(1-->.
