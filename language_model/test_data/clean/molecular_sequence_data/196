Enterovirus 96 (EV-96) is a recently described genotype in the species Human enterovirus C. So far, only partial genome sequences of this enterovirus type have been available. In this study, we report complete genome sequences for two EV-96 strains isolated from healthy children during enterovirus surveillance in Finland. Sequence analysis revealed substantial nucleotide divergence between EV-96 strains and suggested several recombination events between EV-96 and other HEV-C types.
