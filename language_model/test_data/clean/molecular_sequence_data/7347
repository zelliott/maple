An Entamoeba histolytica gene (hex-A1) that encodes subunit A of the lysosomal enzyme beta-hexosaminidase has been cloned and sequenced. The inferred 59 kDa hex-A1 protein has the same molecular weight and 32% amino acid residue identity with the human and mouse proteins and 28% residue identity with the Dictyostelium protein. Northern blot analysis identified a mRNA of approximately 1.6 kb, which is in agreement with the expected size of a mRNA encoding the 522 amino acid hex-A1 protein. Southern blot analysis indicated the presence of at least two beta-hexosaminidase A subunit genes.
