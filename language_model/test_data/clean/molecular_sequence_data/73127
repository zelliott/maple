The nucleotide sequences of the SH gene of 45 new mumps virus isolates derived from different parts of Europe, Canada and USA were determined. A phylogenetic tree was constructed which confirmed the existence of three major clusters. While clustering according to geographical origin was clear in some cases each of the major clusters included isolates which were widely separated in origin. The degree of variability between the sequences of SH genes of different strains and the ratio of coding to non coding differences were both very high compared to those observed in other genes such as the M and HN. A standardized system of nomenclature of mumps strains was established.
