Analyses of the sequences and structures of many transport proteins that differ in substrate specificity, direction of transport and mechanism of transport suggest that they form a family of related proteins. Their sequence similarities imply a common mechanism of action. This hypothesis provides an objective basis for examining their mechanisms of action and relationships to other transporters.
