Bacteriophage genomic evolution has been largely characterized by rampant, promiscuous horizontal gene transfer involving both homologous and nonhomologous source DNA. This pattern has emerged through study of the tailed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) phages and is based upon a sparse sampling of the enormous diversity of these phages. The single-stranded DNA phages of the family Microviridae, including phiX174, appear to evolve through qualitatively different mechanisms, possibly as result of their strictly lytic lifestyle and small genome size. However, this apparent difference could reflect merely a dearth of relevant data. We sought to characterize the forces that contributed to the molecular evolution of the Microviridae and to examine the genetic structure of this single family of bacteriophage by sequencing the genomes of microvirid phage isolated on a single bacterial host. Microvirids comprised 3.5% of the detectable phage in our environmental samples, and sequencing yielded 42 new microvirid genomes. Phylogenetic analysis of the genes contained in these and five previously described microvirid phages identified three distinct clades and revealed at least two horizontal transfer events between clades. All members of one clade have a block of five putative genes that are not present in any member of the other two clades. Our data indicate that horizontal transfer does contribute to the evolution of the microvirids but is both quantitatively and qualitatively different from what has been observed for the dsDNA phages.
