Eight flavone glycosides were isolated from fronds of Asplenium normale, its two varieties, var. boreale and var. shimurae, and related species, A. oligophlebium. Six of the glycosides were identified: apigenin 7-O-dirhamnoside and 7-O-glucosylrhamnoside, luteolin 7-O-dirhamnoside and 7-O-glucosylrhamnoside, genkwanin 4'-O-glucosylrhamnoside, and vicenin-2. The remaining two glycosides were tentatively characterized as genkwanin 4'-O-glycoside and 6,8-di-C-glycosylluteolin. The four taxa analysed in this survey all had distinctive flavonoid profiles.
