A novel beige-pigmented, Gram-staining-negative, coccoid, motile and facultatively anaerobic bacteria, designated strain CJ24(T), was isolated from the tidal flat sediment of the Yellow Sea in South Korea. Characterization of this strain was performed on the basis of polyphasic taxonomic methods. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA and gyrB genes revealed that strain CJ24(T) belongs to the genus Ferrimonas, sharing the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 96.9 % with Ferrimonas marina DSM 16917(T). Strain CJ24(T) was able to grow optimally at 30 °C, at pH 6.0 and in the presence of 2 % NaCl (w/v). As an isoprenoid quinone, menaquinone (MK-7) was predominantly identified from this strain, while ubiquinone (Q-7) was also present as a minor component. The DNA G+C content of strain CJ24(T) was 60.2 mol%. The most abundant cellular fatty acids were C15 : 0 iso, C18 : 1ω9c, C16 : 0 and C17 : 0 iso. Therefore, strain CJ24(T) represents a novel species in the genus Ferrimonas for which the name Ferrimonas gelatinilytica sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is CJ24(T) ( = KACC 17065(T) = JCM 18720(T)).
