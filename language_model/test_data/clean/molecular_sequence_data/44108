The cDNA and genomic clones for the human counterpart of the mouse mammary tumor gene Int3 were isolated and sequenced. We designated this human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III gene as NOTCH4, since very recently, by sequencing cDNA clones, the complete form of the mouse proto-oncogene Int3 has been clarified and named Notch4. The present human NOTCH4 sequence is the first example of the genomic sequence for the extracellular portion of the mammalian Notch4, and by comparing it with the mouse Notch4 cDNA sequence, the exon/intron organization was clarified. The comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of human NOTCH4 with those of other Notch homologues of a wide range of species revealed four subfamilies for mammalian Notch. In the protein coding region of human NOTCH4, we found (CTG)n repeats showing a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism for different human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes. Ten genes mapped on 6p21.3, including NOTCH4, were found to have counterparts structurally and functionally similar to those mostly mapped on 9q33-q34, indicating segmental chromosome duplication during the course of evolution. Similarity of genes on chromosomes 1, 6, 9 and 19 was also discussed.
