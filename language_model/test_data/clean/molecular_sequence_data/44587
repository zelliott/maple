Several tRNA species have a long variable arm composed of over ten nucleotides, which are relevant to those specific to serine, leucine and tyrosine in prokaryotes, while there are only serine and leucine-specific tRNAs in eukaryotes. To clarify the evolutionary aspects of the identity determination mechanism of these tRNAs, the tRNA(Ser) recognition in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied. Unmodified tRNA(Leu) transcript had serylation ability of low efficiency, but native tRNA(Leu) did not, indicating that some modification of tRNA(Leu) serves as a negative identity determinant for seryl-tRNA synthetase. Changing the discriminator base did not seriously affect the serine accepting efficiency. The tRNA(Leu) transcript possessing the variable arm of tRNA(Ser) was efficiently aminoacylated with serine. Eventually, it was found that only one nucleotide insertion to the variable arm of tRNA(Leu) was sufficient to confer an efficient serine accepting activity. The mode of serine tRNA recognition is similar to that in Escherichia coli in that the end of the long variable arm, but not the anticodon or discriminator base, is important. However, S. cerevisiae seryl-tRNA synthetase adopts a substantially different mechanism for rejection of tRNA(Leu) from that of its E. coli counterpart.
