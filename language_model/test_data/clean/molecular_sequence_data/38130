Psoriasis vulgaris is associated with the HLA-Cw6 and Cw7 antigens. We have previously narrowed down the critical region most likely to contain the psoriasis vulgaris gene to 111 kb spanning 89 kb to 200 kb telomeric of the HLA-C locus by microsatellite mapping. This segment includes three known genes (POU5F1, SC1 and S) and four new expressed genes. Among them, SC1 (TCF19) is the cell growth regulated gene possibly with trans-activator activity. Since psoriasis vulgaris is a common skin disorder characterized by hyperproliferation of epidermal cells, it is tempting to speculate that the SCI gene is one of the strong candidate genes responsible for the development of psoriasis vulgaris. Here, we investigated genetic polymorphisms in the SC1 gene by direct DNA sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) techniques. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms in exon 2, two of which are accompanied by amino-acid substitutions, were identified. Further, one 4-bp deletion polymorphism was detected around the acceptor site of the lariat-shaped structure necessary for RNA splicing in intron 2. No significant difference in the dimorphic or haplotypic distribution at these four polymorphic sites was observed between the patients with psoriasis vulgaris and healthy controls. This suggests that the susceptible gene for psoriasis vulgaris is not the SC1 gene itself, although a unique homozygous haplotype was identified in the patients.
