Both nuclear ribosomal ITS and chloroplast trnL-F sequences were acquired for 57 species (accessions) of Lysimachia and its close relatives, and were analyzed together with sequences retrieved from databases. The results of phylogenetic analyses based on these data (separately or combined) show that Lysimachia is paraphyletic, with the monotypic genus Glaux nested deeply inside. Previous suggestions that Anagallis and Trientalis could be ingroups of Lysimachia were not corroborated by our results. The molecular phylogenies do not support the current infrageneric divisions of Lysimachia. Subgenus Lysimachia contains at least five independent lineages. The Hawaii endemic subgenus Lysimachiopsis was shown to group with subgenera Palladia and Heterostylandra, instead of subgenus Idiophyton as previously suggested. The two North American representatives of Lysimachia, subgenus Seleucia and section Verticillatae of subgenus Lysimachia are group together as the most basal clade of the genus. Parallel and independent evolutions were inferred for morphological characters that were previously used as diagnostic criteria. Molecular phylogenies do not offer clear inferences on the overall historical biogeography of Lysimachia, but Southeast Asia origins of several clades, including the Hawaiian endemic clade and the Iberian Lysimachia ephemerum are strongly supported.
