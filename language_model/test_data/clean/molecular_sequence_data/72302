We have previously reported on the isolation of several differentially expressed genes derived from young and senescent non growing WI-38 human fetal lung-derived fibroblasts. A 0.8-kb cDNA clone, isolate EPC-A2 (early population doubling cDNA-A2), encodes the 3' end of the human homolog of the Twist protein. Twist genes encode basic helix-loop-helix DNA-binding transcription factors that play crucial roles in mesoderm development. Here, we report the cloning and sequencing of the genomic human twist gene. It encodes a protein of 201 amino acids with 96% amino acid sequence identity to mouse Twist, and 100% sequence conservation in the DNA-binding region among all species in which it has been characterized. We further show that expression of human twist is retained in mesodermally-derived tissues and cell lines derived from adult donors.
