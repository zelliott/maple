To understand key processes governing defense mechanisms in poplar (Populus spp.) upon infection with the rust fungus Melampsora larici-populina, we used combined histological and molecular techniques to describe the infection of Populus trichocarpa x Populus deltoides 'BeauprÃ©' leaves by compatible and incompatible fungal strains. Striking differences in host-tissue infection were observed after 48-h postinoculation (hpi) between compatible and incompatible interactions. No reactive oxygen species production could be detected at infection sites, while a strong accumulation of monolignols occurred in the incompatible interaction after 48 hpi, indicating a late plant response once the fungus already penetrated host cells to form haustorial infection structures. P. trichocarpa whole-genome expression oligoarrays and sequencing of cDNAs were used to determine changes in gene expression in both interactions at 48 hpi. Temporal expression profiling of infection-regulated transcripts was further compared by cDNA arrays and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Among 1,730 significantly differentially expressed transcripts in the incompatible interaction, 150 showed an increase in concentration > or =3-fold, whereas 62 were decreased by > or =3-fold. Regulated transcripts corresponded to known genes targeted by R genes in plant pathosystems, such as inositol-3-P synthase, glutathione S-transferases, and pathogenesis-related proteins. However, the transcript showing the highest rust-induced up-regulation encodes a putative secreted protein with no known function. In contrast, only a few transcripts showed an altered expression in the compatible interaction, suggesting a delay in defense response between incompatible and compatible interactions in poplar. This comprehensive analysis of early molecular responses of poplar to M. larici-populina infection identified key genes that likely contain the fungus proliferation in planta.
