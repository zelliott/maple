The role of the immune response to the human hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope proteins in neutralization of viral infectivity has been well documented. The similarity between HBV, prototype member of the hepadnavirus family, and the closely related duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) has allowed, use of the latter as a convenient model for the study of molecular mechanisms of HBV replication and neutralization. In this brief review, we will examine the HBV and DHBV envelope proteins and their role as targets for virus neutralization.
