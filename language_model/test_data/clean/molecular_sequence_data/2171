We determined the DNA sequence of the Rhizobium meliloti gene encoding anthranilate synthase, the first enzyme of the tryptophan pathway. Sequences similar to those seen for the two subunits of the enzyme as found in all other procaryotic species studied are present in a single open reading frame of 729 codons. This apparent gene fusion joins the C terminus of the large subunit (TrpE) to the N terminus of the small subunit (TrpG) through a short connecting segment. We designate the fused gene trpE(G). The gene is flanked by a typical rho-independent terminator at the 3' end and a complex regulatory region at the 5' end resembling those of operons under transcriptional attenuation control. The location of the promoter was determined by S1 nuclease protection, using Rhizobium mRNA. Although this promoter was inactive in Escherichia coli, mutations eliciting activity were easily obtained. One of these was a C----T change at position -9 in the -10 region. The +1 position of the mRNA is the first base of the initiation codon of the leader peptide, implying that unlike trpE(G), which has a normal Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the leader peptide gene lacks a ribosome-binding site.
