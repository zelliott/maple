We report the first case of Kytococcus schroeteri implant-related septic arthritis and osteomyelitis, identified by phenotypic tests and 16S rRNA sequencing, which responded to implant removal and doxycycline. 16S rRNA sequencing was useful for the accurate and rapid identification of the organism as it exhibited three different colonial morphologies in vitro.
