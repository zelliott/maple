Jak2 is a member of the Janus family of tyrosine kinases and is involved in cytokine signaling. As a part of a study to determine biological functions of Jak2, we used molecular modeling to identify W1038 as a residue that is critical for tyrosine kinase function. Mutation of W1038, in tandem with E1046, generates a dominant-negative form of the Jak2 protein. Mice that were engineered to express two copies of this dominant-negative Jak2 protein died in utero. Additionally, heterozygous mice expressing Jak2 with kinase activity that is moderately reduced when compared to wild-type activity appear phenotypically normal. Collectively, these data suggest that Jak2 kinase activity is essential for normal mammalian development.
