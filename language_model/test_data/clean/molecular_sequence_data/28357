Segment 10 genes from a short (RV-5, serotype G2) and a supershort (B37, a new G serotype) strain were cloned and their sequences compared to the (corresponding) segment 11 sequences of Wa, SA11, and UK rotaviruses. The determined nucleotide sequences were 817 (RV-5) and 947 (B37) bases in length and showed extensively conserved 5' noncoding and protein coding regions. The major open reading frame codes for a protein of 200 (RV-5) or 198 (B37) amino acids, and the newly proposed second open reading frame can code for a protein of 92 amino acids. Compared to long strain gene segments, the base sequences of the short and supershort strains were found to contain extended, AT-rich 3' noncoding regions which were not significantly homologous to each other, to other parts of the VP9 gene, or to other rotavirus genes that have been sequenced. The function(s) of these 3' regions is not apparent.
