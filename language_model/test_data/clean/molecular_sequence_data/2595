The DNA sequence of the polyhedrin gene of the Mamestra brassicae multiple nucleocapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus (MbMNPV) was determined and compared with the polyhedrin genes of Autographa californica (Ac) and Panolis flammea (Pf) MNPVs. Using this information, a transfer vector was constructed based on the EcoRI I fragment of AcMNPV in which the polyhedrin promoter was replaced by the homologous region extending 481 nucleotides upstream from the MbMNPV polyhedrin coding sequence. The Escherichia coli lacZ gene was also included downstream from the putative MbMNPV promoter. Cotransfection of this transfer vector with wild-type AcMNPV DNA produced stable recombinant viruses expressing the lacZ gene under the control of the MbMNPV polyhedrin promoter. The levels of beta-galactosidase produced by these recombinants in infected cells were 30% lower than the expression level obtained from viruses with the authentic AcMNPV promoter in front of the lacZ gene. The MbMNPV promoter has thus been shown to function efficiently in the genetic environment of AcMNPV. The implications of this finding for the release of genetically manipulated baculovirus insecticides and for the construction of baculovirus multiple expression vectors are discussed.
