Phage clones containing human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 5' flanking sequences were isolated from a chromosome 19 genomic library. The clones were confirmed to contain CEA sequences flanking the CEA transcriptional start site by restriction endonuclease mapping, PCR analysis, and sequence determination. Restriction endonuclease mapping determined that the clones spanned approximately 26 kbp of contiguous sequence from 14 kbp 5' to 12 kbp 3' of the CEA transcriptional start. The DNA sequence of a 11,288 bp Hind III/Sau 3A restriction endonuclease fragment was determined. This sequence extends from 10.7 kbp 5' to 0.6 kbp 3' of the transcriptional start. This sequence was analyzed for the presence of consensus transcriptional regulatory sequences, repetitive sequences, and other features. Several transcriptional regulatory consensus sequences were identified. These consensus sequences may have significance for the transcriptional regulation of CEA.
