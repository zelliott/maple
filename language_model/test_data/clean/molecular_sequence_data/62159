Pathogenesis, morphogenesis and cell cycle are connected in the fungal pathogen Ustilago maydis. Here we report the characterization of the catalytic subunit of the cyclin-dependent kinase, encoded by the gene cdk1, and the two B-type cyclins present in this organism, encoded by the genes clb1 and clb2. These cyclins are not redundant and appears to be essential for cell cycle. The analysis of conditional mutants in cyclin genes indicates that Clb1 is required for G1 to S and G2 to M transitions, while Clb2 is specifically required for the onset of mitosis. Both Clb1 and Clb2 carry functional destruction boxes, and expression of derivatives lacking D-boxes arrested cell cycle at a post-replicative stage. High levels of Clb1 generated cells with anomalous DNA content that were hypersensitive to microtubule-destabilizing drugs. In contrast, high levels of Clb2 induce premature entry into mitosis, suggesting that Clb2 is a mitotic inducer in U. maydis. In addition, Clb2 affects morphogenesis, and overexpression of clb2 induces filamentous growth. Furthermore, we have found that appropriate levels of Clb2 cyclin are critical for a successful infection. Mutant strains with half a dose of clb2 or high level of clb2 expression are impaired at distinct stages in the infection process. These data reinforces the connections between cell cycle, morphogenesis and virulence in this smut fungus.
