We have previously shown that the tat protein of HIV-1 can be used as a carrier to promote the intracellular delivery of heterologous proteins. Here we have tested if the tat-delivery technology can be used to direct MHC class I presentation of native protein, using ovalbumin (OVA) as a model system. We show that a tat-ovalbumin conjugate (tatOVA) can be delivered into cells and that subsequent processing and presentation occurs, resulting in effective and specific killing of these target cells by an OVA specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) line. Comparison with the E.G7 line that expresses the OVA gene indicates that tat-mediated delivery is as efficient as endogenous expression in this system. Tat-mediated antigenic protein delivery may be useful both as a research technique and, potentially, as a therapeutic or prophylactic vaccine.
