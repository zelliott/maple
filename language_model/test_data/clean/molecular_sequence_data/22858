Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a myocardial disease characterized by progressive depression of myocardial contractile function and ventricular dilatation. Thirty percent of DCM patients belong to the inherited genetic form; the rest may be idiopathic, viral, autoimmune, or immune-mediated associated with a viral infection. Disturbances in humoral and cellular immunity have been described in cases of myocarditis and DCM. A number of autoantibodies against cardiac cell proteins have been identified in DCM. In this study, we have profiled the autoantibody repertoire of plasma from DCM patients against a human protein array consisting of 37,200 redundant, recombinant human proteins and performed qualitative and quantitative validation of these putative autoantigens on protein microarrays to identify novel putative DCM specific autoantigens. In addition to analyzing the whole IgG autoantibody repertoire, we have also analyzed the IgG3 antibody repertoire in the plasma samples to study the characteristics of IgG3 subclass antibodies. By combining screening of a protein expression library with protein microarray technology, we have detected 26 proteins identified by the IgG antibody repertoire and 6 proteins bound by the IgG3 subclass. Several of these autoantibodies found in plasma of DCM patients, such as the autoantibody against the Kv channel-interacting protein, are associated with heart failure.
