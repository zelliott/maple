We have used oligonucleotides corresponding to conserved regions of protein kinase regulators of 14-3-3 gene family as primers to amplify these genes from cDNAs constructed from the human fetal inner ear. Sequence characterization of clones revealed that the 14-3-3 cDNA library from the fetal inner ear has high abundance of clones encoding a protein kinase regulator (theta subtype), a member of 14-3-3 gene family, and relatively lower abundance of clones for two other members of the gene family. One of these genes is identical to the eta subtype of human 14-3-3 genes; there is no cloned gene for the other subtype in the human 14-3-3 gene family in the nucleic acid data bases. A sequence homology search revealed that the latter shared significant homology with the gamma subtype of the rat 14-3-3 family. On the basis of the sequence data, it appears that this clone represents a human homolog of the rat gamma subtype. The results demonstrate the expression of 14-3-3 genes in the inner ear, characterize a human homolog of the rat gamma subtype of 14-3-3, implicate these proteins in ear development, and indicate the utility of gene family polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for investigating gene expression in specific tissues.
