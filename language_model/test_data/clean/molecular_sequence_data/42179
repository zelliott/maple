Serum-free conditioned media (CM) of acute myelogenous leukemia cell lines induce growth stimulation of other leukemic cell lines. A transferrin (Tf)-like iron binding kD 50 protein was found to be the main growth factor of these CM's. Purification and further characterization of this protein was performed by chromatographic methods, SDS-PAGE, peptide mapping and amino acid analysis. In addition m-RNA of leukemic cell lines was analysed by Northern blot analysis with oligonucleotide probes specific for human serum Tf and melanotransferrin (p97) respectively. No hybridization signals for these probes have been detected. Biochemical results show significant differences between human serum Tf and kD 50 growth factor with respect to retention time on reversed phase FPLC, pattern of digestion peptides in SDS-PAGE and amino acid composition, which suggests, that this protein is an additional tumor associated member of the transferrin superfamily.
