A nonautonomous element of 624 bp, called RetroCl1 (Retroelement Colletotrichum lindemuthianum 1), was identified in the plant pathogenic fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum. RetroCl1 contains terminal direct repeats (223 bp) that are surrounded by CTAGT sequences. It has a short internal domain of 178 bp and shows characteristics of terminal-repeat retrotransposon in miniature (TRIM) family. We used RetroCl1 sequence to develop molecular markers for the Colletotrichum genus. IRAP (Inter-Retrotransposon Amplified Polymorphism) and REMAP (Retrotransposon-Microsatellite Amplified Polymorphism) markers were used to analyze the genetic diversity of C. lindemuthianum. Fifty-four isolates belonging to different races were used. A total of 45 loci were amplified. The Nei index showed significant differences among the populations divided according to race, indicating that they are structured according to pathotype. No clear correlation between IRAP and REMAP markers with pathogenic characterization was found. C. lindemuthianum has high genetic diversity, and the analysis of molecular variance showed that 51% of variability is found among the populations of different races. The markers were also tested in different Colletotrichum species. In every case, multiple bands were amplified, indicating that these markers can be successfully used in different species belonging to the Colletotrichum genus.
