Three clustered mouse chemokine genes, ABCD-1, -2 and -3, are all expressed highly in dendritic cells and, at various levels, in activated B cells. T cell-independently activated B cells express ABCD-1 and -2, but not -3. T cell-dependently activated B cells express all three. ABCD-1 attracts activated CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and CD4+ helper T cells of type 1 and 2. ABCD-2 preferentially attracts type 2 helper T cells, while ABCD-3 does not attract T cells at all. Both ABCD-1 and ABCD-2 bind to the same receptor (CCR4). In addition, ABCD-1 binds to a second, unknown, receptor on a separate T cell population. The three chemokines might guide T cell-independent as well as -dependent responses with two types of CD4+ T cells.
