The largemouth bass belongs to the family Centrarchidae, which includes two subspecies: the northern subspecies, Micropterus salmoides salmoides, and the Florida subspecies, Micropterus salmoides floridanus. In this study, the complete mitochondrial genomes of the two subspecies were sequenced, and their genetic differences were identified. The mitogenomes of M. s. salmoides and M. s. floridanus are 16,486 and 16,479Â bp in length, respectively. The two subspecies consisted of 37 genes (13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA, and 22 transfer RNA), which are typical for vertebrate mtDNA. Phylogenetic analysis provided statistical support for the monophyly of the family Centrarchidae. Comparison of the two subspecies' mitogenomes revealed a relatively high number (450) of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in protein-coding genes. We characterized SNPs in the partial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene of different individuals from three cultured populations, one wild northern subspecies population, and one wild Florida subspecies population. Twenty-eight SNPs were fixed with alternative nucleotides in the two subspecies, which could be used for differentiating them. Based on this gene, phylogenetic tree and genetic distance analyses supported that cultured largemouth bass in China belongs to the northern subspecies.
