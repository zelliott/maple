The primary structure of a lectin isolated from the red alga Bryothamnion triquetrum was established by combination of Edman degradation of sets of overlapping peptides and mass spectrometry. It contains 91 amino acids and two disulphide bonds. The primary structure of the B. triquetrum lectin does not show amino acid sequence similarity with known plant and animal lectin structures. Hence, this protein may be the paradigm of a novel lectin family.
