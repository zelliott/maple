The role of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in severe liver failure (LF) following bone marrow transplantation is still uncertain. We therefore decided to determine the presence of HCV-RNA in 31 patients who died of severe LF after BMT and in 26 matched BMT controls who did not develop LF. HCV-RNA was identified by polymerase chain reaction and anti-HCV by second generation enzyme-linked immunoassay and by 4-band recombinant immunoblotting assay in serum samples obtained before and after BMT. Biochemical and clinical parameters of liver disease were obtained by reviewing clinical records. LF developed at a median interval of 80 days (20-570) from transplantation and was clinically assessed as VOD (n = 7), liver GVHD (n = 5) or hepatitis (n = 19). HCV-RNA was detected, respectively, in 15/31 (48%) and in 12/26 (46%) of LF patients and controls (P = 0.9). Conversely, the risk of dying of LF was 62% and 53% (P = 0.5) respectively, for HCV-RNA positive and negative patients. Anti-HCV profile did not correlate with viremia, nor with type of liver disease. These findings indicate that, despite a 47% prevalence of HCV infection in our series, HCV-RNA positivity was neither a predictor of VOD nor a marker for life-threatening liver disease.
