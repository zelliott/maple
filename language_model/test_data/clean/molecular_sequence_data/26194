Antibodies prepared against a peptide corresponding to the site of cyto-adherence of Mycoplasma genitalium adhesine inhibit or reduce the infectivity of the HIV-1BRU and HIV-2ROD strains of Human Immunodeficiency Virus in lymphoid cells. These results strengthen the hypothesis that some mycoplasmas may play an important part in HIV replication and pathogenicity.
