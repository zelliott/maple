Escherichia coli-mycobacteria shuttle vectors, derived from pAL5000 (a mycobacterial plasmid) and pUC19, were frequently found to undergo structural alterations due to transposition of IS1096, a Mycobacterium smegmatis transposable element, at a cluster of sites located within a small region of 60 bp, immediately upstream of a kanamycin resistance gene present in these vectors. The structural alterations led to deletion of large regions of the vector which, in several cases, were found to extend into the ORF2 (RepB) coding sequences of the pAL5000 replication region without affecting its replication capability. This suggests that the entire ORF2 coding sequences of the pAL5000 replication region may not be essential for replication of pAL5000-derived vectors. The deletion derivatives, which contain the minimal sequences required for replication and selection in mycobacteria, were found to be structurally stable and therefore these could be potentially used as stable vector systems for the transformation of mycobacteria.
