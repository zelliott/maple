Sequence analysis was conducted on structural and non-structural genes of 7 strains of dengue virus type-3 (DENV-3 virus) isolated in Indonesia and Thailand in the year 1973, 1994, and 1998 from patients with different clinical manifestations. In general, sequence similarity among isolates was greater than 93%, indicating that the mutation rate of DENV-3 circulating in this region was not more than 7% in the last 3 decades and suggesting that sequences that may responsible for viral architectures and/or biological function were strictly conserved. Mutations unique to viral strains associated with specific clinical manifestations were not found. Alignment of PrM/M and E nucleic acid sequences followed by parsimony analysis of sequences obtained in this study and published elsewhere allowed generation of phylogenetic trees, demonstrating that DENV-3 strains isolated in Indonesia in 1998 belonged to a separate cluster (subtype 2) from those isolated between 1973-1985 (subtype 1).
