Two piggyBac-like elements (PLEs) were identified in the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, and were designated as HaPLE1 and HaPLE2. HaPLE1 is flanked by 16 bp inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) and the duplicated TTAA tetranucleotide, and contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 1794 bp with the presumed DDD domain, indicating that this element may be an active autonomously mobile element. HaPLE2 was found with the same ITRs, but lacks the majority of an ORF-encoding transposase. Thus, this element was thought to be a non-autonomous element. Transposable element displays and distribution of the two PLEs in individuals from three different H. armigera populations suggest that transmobilization of HaPLE2 by the transposase of HaPLE1 may be likely, and mobilization of HaPLE1 might occur not only within the same individual, but also among different individuals. In addition, horizontal transfer was probably involved in the evolution of PLEs between H. armigera and Trichoplusia ni.
