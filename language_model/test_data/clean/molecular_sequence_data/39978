Clinical and murine studies suggest that there is a differential pathogenicity of different genotypes of Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochetal agent of Lyme disease. Comparative genome hybridization was used to explore the relationship between different genotypes. The chromosomes of all studied isolates were highly conserved (>93%) with respect to both sequence and gene order. Plasmid sequences were substantially more diverse. Plasmids lp54, cp26, and cp32 were present in all tested isolates, and their sequences and gene order were conserved. The majority of linear plasmids showed variation both in terms of presence among different isolates and in terms of sequence and gene order. The data strongly imply that all B. burgdorferi clinical isolates contain linear plasmids related to each other, but the structure of these replicons may vary substantially from isolate to isolate. These alterations include deletions and presumed rearrangements that are likely to result in unique plasmid elements in many isolates. There is a strong correlation between complete genome hybridization profiles and other typing methods, which, in turn, also correlate to differences in pathogenicity. Because there is substantially less variation in the chromosomal and circular plasmid portions of the genome, the major differences in open reading frame content and genomic diversity among isolates are linear plasmid driven.
