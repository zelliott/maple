A total of 91 isolates of Fusarium avenaceum were regrouped into 15 phenotypes and 10 vegetative compatibility groups showing specific one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1-D SDS-PAGE) protein profiles and less-specific internal transcribed spacer rDNA profiles. Each isolate possessed reproducible signature protein bands. Indeed, the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages clustering revealed that the protein profile of each group of isolates correlated with fungus virulence. The use of SDS-PAGE offers a simple and sensitive technique for routine differentiation between pathogenic and nonpathogenic isolates within unknown F. avenaceum populations. The discovery has significant implications for risk assessment of cereal yield to ensure food and feed safety. This low-cost approach has the potential to be optimized and extended to a broad spectrum of Fusarium head blight pathogens.
