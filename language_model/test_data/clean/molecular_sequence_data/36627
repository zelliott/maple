Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been isolated from brain extracts of the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and subjected to structural analyses. Plasma desorption mass spectroscopy estimated the molecular mass of the purified peptide as 4303.9 Da. Automated Edman degradation unequivocally established the sequence of a 36 amino acid residue peptide as: Tyr-Pro-Pro-Lys-Pro-Glu-Asn-Pro-Gly-Glu-Asp-Ala-Pro-Pro-Glu-Glu-Leu-Ala- Lys- Tyr-Tyr-Thr-Ala-Leu-Arg-His-Tyr-Ile-Asn-Leu-Ile-Thr-Arg-Gln-Arg-Tyr. The molecular mass calculated from this sequence (4304 Da) is consistent with that obtained by mass spectroscopy. The presence of a C-terminal amide was established by radioimmunoassay. Rainbow trout NPY is identical in primary structure to coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) pancreatic polypeptide (PP). These data may indicate that, in this group of salmonid fishes, a single member of the NPY/PP peptide family is expressed in both neurons and peripheral endocrine cells.
