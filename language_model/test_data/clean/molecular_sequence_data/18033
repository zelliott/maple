The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was applied in genomic analysis of families at risk for haemophilia A using the intragenic Bel I and Hind III polymorphism in introns 18 and 19, respectively, of factor VIII gene. For the latter the primers derived from exon 19 and 20 sequences allowed to amplify the whole intron 19 resulting in a 730 bp fragment. Hind III restriction of this fragment provides polymorphic fragments of 250 bp or 160 bp and 90 bp respectively. An also occurring 480 bp fragment can be used as internal control to circumvent misdiagnosis due to incomplete or failure of restriction. The Hind III polymorphism was successfully used in prenatal diagnosis of an affected male in the first trimenon of pregnancy. Fetal sexing was also performed by PCR technique using Y specific primers.
