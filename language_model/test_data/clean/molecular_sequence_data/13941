A C terminal fragment (SR1) of SPAG-1, a sporozoite surface antigen of Theileria annulata, has been expressed as a fusion protein in the e1 loop of hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg). This recombinant antigen (HBcAg-SR1) is produced in the form of self-assembling polyhedral particles which have been visualised under the electron microscope. Cattle immunised with HBcAg-SR1 produced high titres of neutralising antibodies. A significant T cell response to both the HBcAg and SR1 determinants was observed but evidence of a T suppressor determinant in SR1 was also revealed. Immunised cattle showed some evidence of protection to sporozoite challenge as assessed by severity of the disease. The significance of these findings for the development of a sub-unit vaccine against T. annulata is discussed.
