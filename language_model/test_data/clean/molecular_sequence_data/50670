Screening of a bovine renal cDNA library with MAbs resulted in the isolation of a 1447 bp cDNA. This cDNA (pBk2.1) was sequenced and shown to contain an open reading frame with a putative protein of 261 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 29,573 (minute leader sequence) and a hydrophobic leader sequence of 16 amino acids. pBk2.1 was shown to share a high level of nucleic acid sequence homology over portions of its sequence to human, porcine, mouse, and rat osteopontins (40-60%). The peptide (osteopontin-k) had a potential glycosylation site (Asn-X-Ser/Thr), a GRGDS receptor binding region, a high level of asparagine residues, and a high abundance of acid amino acids characteristic of osteopontin-like cell adhesion molecules. The N-terminal amino acid region of pBk2.1 (the first 82 amino acids) and 42 amino acids at the C terminus had the highest level of homology with the osteopontins at 86%. The middle portion of the peptide had greatly reduced homology, ranging from 50% (amino acids 83-174) to 12% (amino acids 175-219). There were also deletions and additions of sequence in osteopontin-k that were not found in the other osteopontins. The homologies suggest that these proteins are highly related and may be derived from a common gene by alternative splicing. A 678 bp cRNA probe constructed from pBk2.1, containing a region with low homology to the osteopontins (amino acids 183-219 with less than 20% homology, plus amino acids 220-261 and untranslated sequence), was used in northern blots and RNAse protection assays.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
