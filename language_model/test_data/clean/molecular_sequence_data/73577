SpHox8 is the paralog group 8 Hox gene of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. This identification follows from an analysis of the sequence of the complete open reading frame of a late-gastrula-stage cDNA clone; from direct linkage to adjacent Hox genes in a fosmid contig; and from blot hybridizations carried out on pulse field gel electrophoretic separations. SpHox8 is a single-copy gene, and there is only one Hox gene cluster per genome in S. purpuratus.
