Heterozygous missense mutation in codon 15 of the rhodopsin gene was detected in a patient with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP), where a transition of adenine to guanine at the second nucleotide in codon 15 (AAT-->AGT), corresponding to a substitution of serine residue for asparagine residue (Asn-15-Ser) was detected. None of the remaining unrelated 42 ADRP, 24 autosomal recessive RP (ARRP) and 34 normal individuals had this alteration. Her funduscopic findings were sectorial in type similar to that of the patients with the same mutation found in an Australian pedigree (Sullivan et al., 1993). This study shows phenotypic similarities in patients with the same mutation of a different ancestry.
