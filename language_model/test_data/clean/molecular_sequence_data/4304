The bovine-specific pathogen Haemophilus somnus is capable of undergoing structural and antigenic phase variation in its lipooligosaccharide (LOS) components after in vivo and in vitro passage. However, commensal isolates from the reproductive tract have not been observed to vary in phase (T. J. Inzana, R. P. Gogolewski, and L. B. Corbeil, Infect. Immun. 60:2943-2951, 1992). We now report that specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the LOSs of Haemophilus aegyptius, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Haemophilus influenzae, as well as H. somnus, reacted with some phase-variable epitopes in H. somnus LOS. All reactive MAbs bound to LOS components of about 4.3 kDa in the same H. somnus isolates, including a non-phase-varying strain. Following in vitro passage of a clonal variant of strain 738 that was nonreactive with the MAbs, 11.8% of young colonies shifted to a reactive phenotype. A digoxigenin-labelled 5'-CAATCAATCAATCAATCAATCAATCAAT-3' oligonucleotide probe hybridized to genomic DNA from strain 738 but did not react with DNA from a non-phase-varying strain. Sequence analysis of the gene containing 5'-CAAT-3' tandem sequences revealed 48% amino acid homology with the lex-2B gene-encoded protein of H. influenzae type b. Our results indicate that some LOS epitopes are conserved between H. somnus and other Haemophilus and Neisseria species, that LOS phase variation may occur at a high rate in some strains of H. somnus, and that phase variation may, in part, be due to 5'-CAAT-3' tandem sequences present in H. somnus genes.
