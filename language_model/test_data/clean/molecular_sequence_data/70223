The nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding chicken ribosomal protein L7a was determined. The gene contains eight exons and seven introns, which spread over 3613 nucleotides. The transcription initiation sites were located on four consecutive nucleotides GCCC, which are at the 5' terminus of a short polypyrimidine tract of eight base-pairs flanked by G + C-rich regions. Neither a canonical TATA nor a CAAT box was found in the 5'-flanking region. Instead, a short A + T-rich stretch was found at the position where the TATA box is expected to be. There is an intensive nuclear protein binding motif repeated four times in the region -134 to -50. This motif is common to many ribosomal protein genes and may play an important role in the control of ribosomal protein gene expression.
