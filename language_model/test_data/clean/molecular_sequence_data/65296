An aerobic, Gram-negative bacterium, strain KMM 329(T), was isolated from a deep-sea sponge specimen from the Philippine Sea and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic investigation. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain KMM 329(T) clustered with the species of the genus Lysobacter. The highest level of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (97.0 %) was found with respect to Lysobacter concretionis KCTC 12205(T); lower values (96.4-95.2 %) were obtained with respect to the other recognized Lysobacter species. The value for DNA-DNA relatedness between strain KMM 329(T) and L. concretionis KCTC 12205(T) was 47 %. Branched fatty acids 16 : 0 iso, 15 : 0 iso, 11 : 0 iso 3-OH and 17 : 1 iso were found to be predominant. Strain KMM 329(T) had a DNA G+C content of 69.0 mol%. On the basis of the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, DNA-DNA hybridization and phylogenetic data, strain KMM 329(T) represents a novel species of the genus Lysobacter, for which the name Lysobacter spongiicola sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KMM 329(T) (=NRIC 0728(T) =JCM 14760(T)).
