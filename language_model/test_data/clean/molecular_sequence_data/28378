A small cryptic plasmid, pLJ1, was isolated from Lactobacillus helveticus subsp. jugurti and was cloned into Escherichia coli HB101 by using pBR329 as a vector. Plasmid pLJ1 was 3,292 base pairs long and had single restriction endonuclease sites for PvuII, KpnI, AvaII, Acci, HindIII, and EcoRI. In a maxicell system, pLJ1 produced a protein of about 41 kilodaltons.
