Neutral reduced oligosaccharides are in general not sufficiently retained to achieve adequate separation and reproducible chromatography using high-pH anion-exchange chromatography. We describe a method to increase the retention using two columns in series. This method has been applied to the separation of oligosaccharides purified from human meconium glycoproteins, obtained as their alditols after alkaline-borohydride release of oligosaccharides. The neutral oligosaccharide alditols were significantly retained upon two CarboPac PA-100 columns, connected in series, and eluted in 80 mM sodium hydroxide between 4 and 10 min. Three sialylated alditols studied were substantially retained and could be eluted in a gradient of 0-500 mM sodium acetate-80 mM sodium hydroxide between 10 and 45 min. The elution patterns were based on their size, charge and linkage, such that oligosaccharide alditol isomers could be separated.
