In recent years, several endogenous mammalian antibacterial peptides have been described. An amphipathic cationicalpha-helix is a common feature in many cases; therefore, other peptides with this characteristic might also possess antibiotic activity. In fact, a 30-mer peptide of apoprotein E 133-162 (LRVRLASHLRKLRKRLLRDADDLQKRLAVY) was found to have antibiotic activity comparable to those of a classic antibiotic (Gentamicin) and a neutrophil-derived antibiotic peptide (CAP18). Calculation of cationicity, hydrophobicity, and hydrophobic moment and the helical wheel diagram of apoprotein E 133-162 revealed close similarities to CAP18.
