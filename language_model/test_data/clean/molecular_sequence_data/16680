In 1998, domestic pigs originating from villages within a 40 km radius of Ulongwe in the northern Tete Province of Mozambique were held in a quarantine facility for a 3-month period prior to their importation into South Africa. Eight of a total of 25 pigs died within the first 3 weeks of quarantine of what appeared clinically and on post mortem examination to be African swine fever (ASF). Organs were collected and preserved in formol-glycerosaline and the presence of ASF virus in these specimens was confirmed by three independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Two gene regions were characterised, namely the C-terminus end of the major immunodominant protein VP72 and the central variable region (CVR) of the 9RL open reading frame (ORF). Results confirmed the presence of two genetically distinct viruses circulating simultaneously within a single outbreak focus. However, despite the pigs being housed within the same facility, no evidence of co-infection was observed within individual animals. Comparison of the two 1998 virus variants with viruses causing historical outbreaks of the disease in Mozambique revealed that these viruses belong to two distinct genotypes which are unrelated to viruses causing outbreaks between 1960 and 1994. In addition, the CVR and p72 gene regions of one of the 1998 Mozambique virus variants (variant-40) was shown to be identical to the virus recovered from an ASF outbreak in Madagascar in the same year, whilst the other (variant-92) was identical to a 1988 pig isolate from Zambia.
