The expression of the vho and vht operons from Methanosarcina mazei Gö1, which each encode a membrane-bound hydrogenase and a cytochrome b, was analyzed under various growth conditions. Synthesis of both hydrogenases was induced at the level of transcription during methanogenesis from H2/CO2 or methanol. Transcripts of the vho operon were also detected when Ms. mazei Gö1 was grown on acetate, indicating that this operon is constitutively expressed. In contrast, mRNA from the vht operon was not found in acetate-grown cells. Downstream of the structural genes vhtG and vhtA and the cytochrome-b-encoding gene vhtC, an additional open reading frame (vhtD; 486 bp) was identified. vhtD is followed by six tandem repeats of an 11-bp sequence, which is probably a termination site of transcription. Northern blots revealed that vhtD is part of the vht operon. In the vho operon, a vhtD-like gene and a terminator composed of tandem repeats could not be identified. The physiological function of two genetically distinct, membrane-bound hydrogenases from Ms. mazei Gö1 is discussed.
