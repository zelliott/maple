We have isolated the complete cDNA of a human SEL-1L gene, termed TSA305, that is abundantly expressed only in the pancreas. The cDNA contained an open reading frame of 2382 nucleotides, encoding a deduced protein of 794 amino acids whose predicted sequence showed 46% identity and 64% similarity with SEL-1 of Caenorhabditis elegans. SEL-1 is thought to be a negative regulator of the NOTCH, LIN-12, and GLP-1 receptors, which are required for differentiation and maturation of cells as well as cell-cell interactions during development in C. elegans. The degree of homology among these proteins suggests that the TSA305 gene product may be a member of the SEL-1 family and therefore involved in downregulation of mammalian Notch signaling. Direct sequencing revealed at least 20 coding exons in TSA305. We localized the gene to chromosome bands 14q24.3-q31 by radiation hybrid (RH) mapping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The IDDM11 locus has been mapped in this region, and TSA305 may represent a candidate gene for predisposition in some families whose insulin-dependent diabetes is not linked to the HLA locus.
