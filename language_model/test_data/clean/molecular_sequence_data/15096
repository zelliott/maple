Immunocapture followed by the detection of viruses using polymerase chain reaction is a versatile, sensitive and robust diagnostic technique. The application of this hybrid method of virus detection in plants is particularly useful in species or tissues containing inhibitory substances. In addition, antibody-mediated virus purification is usually simpler than other methods of isolation.
