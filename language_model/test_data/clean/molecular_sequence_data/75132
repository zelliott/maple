A cDNA encoding human lysozyme was isolated from a human placenta cDNA library. The cDNA was 1.5 kb in size and coded for a signal peptide consisting of 18 amino acids and mature lysozyme. The amino acid sequence of the mature lysozyme, deduced from the nucleotide sequence, was identical with the published sequence. In the 3'-noncoding region of the cDNA, an Alu sequence was found in the reverse orientation. In a protein coding region, the human lysozyme cDNA shows 60.1% and 51.3% similarity with chicken lysozyme and human alpha-lactalbumin cDNAs, respectively. When the cDNA was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an active and correctly processed human lysozyme was secreted efficiently into the culture medium.
