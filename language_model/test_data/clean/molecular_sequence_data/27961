Dystrophin is the recently discovered defective gene product in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD and BMD). Dystrophin transcripts have been amplified and identified in diagnostic needle muscle biopsy samples using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure. Using 5'- and 3'-primers, dystrophin transcripts can be detected in both DMD and BMD muscle biopsies, on either side of defined deletions within the dystrophin gene.
