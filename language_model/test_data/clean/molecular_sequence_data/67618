In this study a Kuwaiti camel rotavirus strain, RVA/Camel-wt/KUW/s21/2010/G10P[15], is characterized by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The strain had multiple genes with high nucleotide sequence similarities to ovine and bovine strains (VP2, ≤ 96%; NSP2 and NSP5, ≤ 97%, NSP3, ≤ 94%), or, to porcine strains (VP1, ≤ 89%). Other genes had moderate sequence similarities (VP4, ≤ 87%; VP6, ≤ 81%; VP7, ≤ 82%) with reference strains from ruminants. The NSP4 gene shared limited sequence identity (≤ 71%) with other mammalian and avian rotavirus NSP4 types, and was designated a novel genotype, E15. This study demonstrates genetic diversity in the outer capsid and some backbone genes of an old-world camelid rotavirus strain and uncovers its common evolutionary roots with strains from other ruminants.
