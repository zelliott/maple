Two-dimensional 1H NMR experiments that achieve band-selective, homonuclear decoupling in both the indirectly detected F1 and directly detected F2 dimensions were used to assign the highly overlapped 1H NMR spectrum of the peptide Ac-SRGKARVRAKVKDQTK-NH2, both free in solution and bound to heparin. Band-selective, homonuclear decoupling during the evolution period was achieved using a double pulsed field gradient spin-echo (DPFGSE) with semi-selective shaped pulses; band-selective, homonuclear decoupling during the acquisition period was achieved by time-shared semi-selective shaped pulse decoupling. Regular TOCSY, ROESY and NOESY spectra and TOCSY, ROESY and NOESY spectra measured with band-selective, homonuclear decoupling in the evolution (F1) dimension (BASHD-TOCSY, ROESY and NOESY spectra) and with band-selective, homonuclear decoupling in both the F1 and F2 dimensions (D-(or Double)-BASHD-TOCSY, ROESY and NOESY spectra) are reported and compared for the peptide and its heparin complex. Complete assignment of the 1H-NMR spectra of the free and heparin-complexed peptide was achieved with the high resolution of the D-BASHD-TOCSY, ROESY and NOESY spectra. Characterization of the heparin-complexed peptide is of interest because of the ability of the peptide to neutralize the anticoagulant activity of heparin.
