Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has infected millions of people worldwide and emerged as a global health crisis. This review reports approaches currently being taken to combat the virus. Viral targets have received the most attention, particularly the NS3 serine protease where potent inhibitors have been described. Crystal structures of key replicative enzymes, NS3 protease, NS3 helicase, NS5B polymerase and now full-length NS3 protease-helicase, are available. More recently, targeting the host system has become of interest, particularly inhibitors of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. Research aimed at novel treatments for HCV disease is gathering pace and very recent developments in cell-based assay systems can only hasten the discovery of improved therapies.
