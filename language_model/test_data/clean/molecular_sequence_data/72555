Glycoproteins are a diverse group of complex macromolecules that are present in virtually all forms of life. Their presence in prokaryotes, however, has been demonstrated, and accepted, only recently. Bacterial glycoproteins have been identified in many archaeobacteria and in eubacteria. They comprise a wide range of different cell envelope components such as membrane-associated glycoproteins, surface-associated glycoproteins and crystalline surface layers (S-layers), as well as secreted glycoproteins and exoenzymes. Even their occurrence in the cytoplasm cannot yet be ruled out. This minireview tries to cover the whole subject as completely as possible and refers to available information on presence, structure, biosynthesis, and molecular biology of bacterial glycoproteins.
