Nematodes are the only group of organisms in which both cis- and trans-splicing of nuclear mRNAs are known to occur. Most Caenorhabditis elegans introns are exceptionally short, often only 50 bases long. The consensus donor and acceptor splice site sequences found in other animals are used for both cis- and trans-splicing. In order to identify the machinery required for these splicing events, we have characterized the C. elegans snRNAs. They are similar in sequence and structure to those characterized in other organisms, and several sequence variations discovered in the nematode snRNAs provide support for previously proposed structure models. The C. elegans snRNAs are encoded by gene families. We report here the sequences of many of these genes. We find a highly conserved sequence, the proximal sequence element (PSE), about 65 bp upstream of all 21 snRNA genes thus far sequenced, including the SL RNA genes, which specify the snRNAs that provide the 5' exons in trans-splicing. The sequence of the C. elegans PSE is distinct from PSE's from other organisms.
