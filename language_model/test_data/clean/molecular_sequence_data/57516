We have performed mRNA in situ hybridization studies and northern blot analysis in the mouse and human, respectively, to determine the normal gene expression patterns of FMR-1. Expression in the adult mouse was localized to several regions of the brain and the tubules of the testes, which are two of the major organs affected in fragile X syndrome. Universal and very strong expression was observed in early mouse embryos, with differentially decreasing expression during subsequent stages of embryonic development. The early embryonic onset and tissue specificity of FMR-1 gene expression is consistent with involvement in the fragile X phenotype, and also suggests additional organ systems in which clinical manifestations of reduced FMR-1 gene expression may occur.
