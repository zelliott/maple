To detect and analyse Onchocerca volvulus mRNAs possessing a spliced leader (SL) sequence, a SL cDNA library was constructed from O. volvulus RNA using a PCR method. Three of the sixty cDNAs analysed displayed significant homology to a known sequence. These cDNAs encode a hsp70, a collagen-like protein and a 60S ribosomal protein. The remaining cDNAs analysed either encoded proteins with no apparent homology to known sequences or they appeared to be generated from RNAs with an internal SL and did not possess an open reading frame.
