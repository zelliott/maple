The phylogenetic position of the phylum Porifera (sponges) is near the base of the kingdom Metazoa. During the last few years, not only rRNA sequences but, more importantly, cDNA/genes that code for proteins have been isolated and characterized from sponges, in particular from the marine demosponge Geodia cydonium. The analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of these proteins allowed a molecular biological approach to the question of the monophyly of the Metazoa. Molecules of the extracellular matrix/basal lamina, with the integrin receptor, fibronectin, and galectin as prominent examples, and of cell-surface receptors (tyrosine kinase receptor), elements of sensory systems (crystallin, metabotropic glutamate receptor) as well as homologs/modules of an immune system (immunoglobulin-like molecules, scavenger receptor cysteine-rich [SRCR]- and short consensus repeats [SCR]-repeats), classify the Porifera as true Metazoa. As living fossils, provided with simple, primordial molecules allowing cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion as well as processes of signal transduction as known in a more complex manner from higher Metazoa, sponges also show pecularities not known in later phyla. In this paper, the adhesion molecules presumably involved in the sponge immune system are reviewed; these are the basic adhesion molecules (galectin, integrin, fibronectin, and collagen) and especially the highly polymorphic adhesion molecules, the receptor tyrosine kinase as well as the polypeptides comprising scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) and short consensus repeats (SCR) modules. In addition, it is reported that in the model sponge system of G. cydonium, allogeneic rejection involves an upregulation of phenylalanine hydroxylase, an enzyme initiating the pathway to melanin synthesis.
