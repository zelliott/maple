This paper reports the first genetic characterization of Anaplasma (Ehrlichia) platys in Spain from a naturally infected dog. The dog presented clinical signs compatible with canine ehrlichiosis. After DNA extraction and PCR amplification, 16S rRNA gene and citrate synthase gene ( gltA) of this agent were amplified. The GenBank accession number for the nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of this strain is AY530806. The A. platys strains registered in France and Japan showed the highest similarity to the 16S rRNA gene sequence obtained from the Spanish strain. In the amplification of the gltA gene, a 1443 bp fragment was obtained, and three nucleotide differences were detected in comparison with other strains sequences. These data confirm the presence of A. platys in a dog showing clinical signs compatible with ehrlichiosis in Spain.
