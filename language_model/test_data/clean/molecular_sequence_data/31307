Two distinct forms of cDNA encoding rat aldosterone synthase were cloned from an adrenal capsular tissue cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequences showed that one of the enzymes (P-450(11 beta),aldo-1) had a long extension peptide composed of 34 amino acid residues while the other (P-450(11 beta),aldo-2) had an extension peptide identical to that of rat P-450(11 beta). Glu at the 320th position of P-450(11 beta),aldo-1 was replaced with Lys in P-450(11 beta),aldo-2. The amino acid sequence of the aldosterone synthase was highly homologous (81%) to rat P-450(11 beta). Constructed expression vector containing the cDNA for extension peptide of P-450(11 beta) and the mature protein of P-450(11 beta),aldo-1 was transfected into COS-7 cells. The cells converted 11-deoxycorticosterone into corticosterone, 18-hydroxycorticosterone, and aldosterone.
