Cyclic GMP (cGMP) signals through protein kinases, ion channels, and possibly other effector systems as a second messenger. Its synthesis is regulated by guanylyl cyclase, whose activity is found in various cellular compartments including the plasma membrane and cytosol. A soluble form of guanylyl cyclase, which occurs as a heterodimer, appears to serve as a receptor for nitric oxide or nitrosothiols, or both. Recent research suggests the presence of multiple subtypes of the soluble form of guanylyl cyclase and tissue-specific expression of the different forms. At least two different forms of the plasma membrane guanylyl cyclase are known to occur in various mammalian tissues. One form, GC-A, is a receptor for atrial natriuretic peptide, and the binding of ligand causes marked increases in cGMP production. The other form, GC-B, is stimulated more effectively by a brain natriuretic peptide than by atrial natriuretic peptide, but its natural ligand remains in question. Both plasma membrane forms of the enzyme contain a single, putative transmembrane domain. The intracellular region of both forms contains a protein kinase-like domain just within the transmembrane domain. The protein kinase-like domain is followed by a cyclase catalytic region near the carboxyl terminus that is homologous to two internally homologous domains found in a bovine brain adenylyl cyclase. The possibility that other guanylyl cyclase receptor subtypes exist is now being explored. If they do, we may subsequently find that a diversity of specific ligands signals through cGMP.
