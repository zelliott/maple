We have isolated the swine homologs of human CDKN2A and CDKN2B exon 2 sequences. As in the human and mouse genomes, the exon 2 sequences of these two genes present a high level of sequence homology and are tightly linked. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we have mapped swine CDKN2A and CDKN2B to chromosome 1q25. This confirms the comparative mapping data among man, mouse, and swine, showing a conserved synteny among chromosome segments 9p21, 4C3-C6, and 1q25, respectively.
