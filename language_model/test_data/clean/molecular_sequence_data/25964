We have identified two nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced polypeptides (Mr 80,000 and 90,000) in PC12 cells that are heat stable and not sulfated. Indirect immunofluorescence localization of these polypeptides in NGF-treated PC12 cells reveals a punctate pattern concentrated in neurites. Immunoperoxidase staining of rat tissue shows that these polypeptides are found throughout the brain in selected subsets of neurons and are absent in the pituitary or adrenal medulla. Several of these characteristics are similar to a recently described NGF-induced secretory protein (VGF8a), which has sequence similarities to secretogranins. The property of NGF inducibility and the distribution of these polypeptides within rat tissues are both novel features for secretogranin proteins.
