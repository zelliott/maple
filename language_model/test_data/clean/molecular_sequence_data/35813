A myotropic peptide, named orcokinin, was isolated from approximately 1200 abdominal nerve cords of the crayfish, Orconectes limosus. Its amino acid sequence was determined as follows: Asn-Phe-Asp-Glu-Ile-Asp-Arg-Ser-Gly-Phe-Gly-Phe-Asn. This structure was confirmed by synthesis. There is no sequence similarity to any known neuropeptide. Orcokinin exhibits high potency on the crayfish hindgut, enhancing both frequency and amplitude of spontaneous contractions. The threshold of biological activity in vitro was determined to be approximately 5 x 10(-11) M.
