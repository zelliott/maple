As part of an attempt to understand the androgen-regulated expression of seminalplasmin, a major basic protein of bovine seminal vesicle secretion, we have characterized the bovine seminalplasmin gene. The compact gene of approximate size of 2.1 kb is organized in four exons and three introns. Regulatory sequences involved in regulation of transcription could not be identified by simple sequence homologies. A putative promoter element TATAA is located 29 bp upstream of exon 1.
