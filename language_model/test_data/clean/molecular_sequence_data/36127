Protein glycosylation is more abundant and structurally diverse than all other types of post-translational modifications combined. Protein-bound saccharides range from dynamic monosaccharides on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, to enormously complex 'recognition' molecules on extracellular N- or O-linked glycoproteins or proteoglycans. Recent elucidation of a few of the myriad functions of these saccharides has finally opened a crack in the door to one the last great frontiers of biochemistry.
