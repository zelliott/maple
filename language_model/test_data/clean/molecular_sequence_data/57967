A stepwise approach has been used in the syntheses of pentamannosyl tetraphosphate HO-[-6Man(alpha)-PO4-]4-6Man(alpha)-OMe and tetra(N-acetylglucosaminyl) triphosphate HO-[-3GlcNAc(alpha)-PO4]3- 3GlcNAc(beta)-OC6H4NO2, which are fragments of the yeast and bacteria extracellular phosphoglycans. Elongation of the chain was performed with the use of suitably protected glycosyl hydrogenphosphonate derivatives for successive introduction of glycosyl phosphate residues. Partially protected monosaccharide derivatives and oligomeric blocks served as hydroxylic components.
