The locations of crossover junctions and gene conversion tracts, isolated in the rosy gene of Drosophila melanogaster, were determined using DNA sequencing and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Frequent DNA sequence polymorphisms between the parental genes served as unselected genetic markers. All conversion tracts were continuous, and half of the reciprocal crossover events had conversion tracts at the crossover junction. These experiments have also identified the sequence polymorphisms responsible for altered gene expression in two naturally occurring rosy variants.
