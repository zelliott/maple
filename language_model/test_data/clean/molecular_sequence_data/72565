The carbohydrate chains of the mucins which constitute the jelly coat surrounding the eggs of Rana temporaria were released by alkaline borohydride treatment. Neutral and acidic oligosaccharide-alditols were purified by ion-exchange chromatography and HPLC. From the structural analysis, based upon 1H and 13C-NMR spectroscopy in combination with MALDI-TOF, the following glycan units are proposed.
