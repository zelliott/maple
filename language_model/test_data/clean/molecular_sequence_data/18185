The complete DNA sequence of the circular GC2 plasmid from the red alga Gracilaria chilensis was obtained. It contains 3827 bp and has a base composition of 75% A + T nucleotides. The sequence revealed that GC2 has two inverted repeats, each of 290 nucleotides, that border four long direct tandem repeats of 216 nucleotides. five short, direct, tandem repeats of 21-22 nucleotides were also found in the plasmid. The plasmid sequence has one major open reading frame that could encode a 411 amino acid polypeptide. Finally, the GC2 plasmid is transcriptionally active.
