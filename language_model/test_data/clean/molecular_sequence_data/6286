Evidence shows the presence on the chromosome of Methanobacterium wolfei of a defective prophage which, by DNA-DNA hybridization, is closely related to the virulent archaeophage psi M1 of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum Marburg. Partial sequencing of a M. wolfei 16S rRNA gene and phylogenetic analysis indicated that this organism is more closely related to other representatives of the genus Methanobacterium than to M. thermoautotrophicum Marburg. The chromosomal region of M. wolfei encoding the putative prophage was found to be deleted for two non-contiguous segments of the phage psi M1 genome and thus encompassed only 80 to 90% of the psi M1 DNA. The prophage region was mapped to a 30 kb restriction fragment on the physical map of the M. wolfei chromosome. A randomly chosen DNA fragment was cloned from phage psi M1 DNA, as was its homologous counterpart from the chromosome of M. wolfei. The 126-bp region present in both clones exhibited 100% sequence identity.
