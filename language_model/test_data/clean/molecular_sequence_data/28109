The nucleotide sequence of bacteriophage T3 gene 10 and surrounding regulatory elements has been determined and compared to the analogous region of bacteriophage T7. T3 genes 9, 10 and 11 have been shown to complement T7 mutants. The DNA sequences of T3 and T7 gene 10A are homologous, as are the amino acid sequences of the respective products. The translational shift to the -1 frame is predicted to occur at the same position in gene 10 of T3 and T7, though different nucleotide sequences are probably responsible. The resulting gp10B products have completely different C termini.
