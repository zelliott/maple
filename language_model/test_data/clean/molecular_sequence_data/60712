The rate of infection with TT virus (TTV), a novel single-strand DNA virus was evaluated and the clinical and laboratory features in affected Japanese medical workers were analysed. TTV DNA was measured in 356 medical workers and in 150 age-matched controls using a seminested polymerase chain reaction. TTV DNA was detected in 62 of 356 medical workers (17.4%). There were no differences in the prevalence of TTV infection between medical workers and controls (18.9%) and in the characteristics of medical workers with TTV infection and medical workers without it, except that the mean age of patients with TTV infection was higher than that of patients without TTV. The medical workers were drawn from three groups: medical doctors, nurses and clinical laboratory technicians. There was no statistically significant difference between the rate of TTV infection in the three groups. These findings suggest that the risk of TTV infection in medical workers is low and not related to liver dysfunction.
