Thirteen polymorphic microsatellite markers were developed to investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of Pinus koraiensis. •

Using the Fast Isolation by AFLP of Sequences COntaining repeats (FIASCO) method with three specific PCR primers for screening the positive clones, 13 loci were found to be polymorphic in 78 individuals of P. koraiensis. Across all of the P. koraiensis samples, the number of alleles per locus ranged from two to 11. •

These polymorphic markers will be useful for conservation genetics studies of this species and to inform the development of effective P. koraiensis conservation programs.
