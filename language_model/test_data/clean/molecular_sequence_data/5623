Hormonal stimulation of Gq-protein coupled receptors triggers Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores. This is followed by a Ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane. Drosophila Trp and Trpl proteins have been implicated in Ca2+ entry and three mammalian homologues of Drosophila Trp/Trpl, hTrp1, hTrp3 and bTrp4 (also bCCE) have been cloned and expressed. Using mouse brain RNA as template, we report here the polymerase chain reaction-based cloning and functional expression of a novel Trp, mTrp6. The cDNA encodes a protein of 930 amino acids, the sequence of which is 36.8, 36.3, 43.1, 38.6, and 74. 1% identical to Drosophila Trp and Trpl, bovine Trp4, and human Trp1 and Trp3, respectively. Transient expression of mTrp6 in COS.M6 cells by transfection of the full-length mTrp6 cDNA increases Ca2+ entry induced by stimulation of co-transfected M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor with carbachol (CCh), as seen by dual wavelength fura 2 fluorescence ratio measurements. The mTrp6-mediated increase in Ca2+ entry activity was blocked by SKF-96365 and La3+. Ca2+ entry activity induced by thapsigargin was similar in COS cells transfected with or without the mTrp6 cDNA. The thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ entry could not be further stimulated by CCh in control cells but was markedly increased in mTrp6-transfected cells. Records of whole cell transmembrane currents developed in response to voltage ramps from -80 to +40 mV in control HEK cells and HEK cells stably expressing mTrp6 revealed the presence of a muscarinic receptor responsive non-selective cation conductance in Trp6 cells that was absent in control cells. Our data support the hypothesis that mTrp6 encodes an ion channel subunit that mediates Ca2+ entry stimulated by a G-protein coupled receptor, but not Ca2+ entry stimulated by intracellular Ca2+ store depletion.
