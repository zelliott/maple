Rearrangements of the RET and TRK proto-oncogenes, which generate fusion oncogenes, are frequent in papillary thyroid carcinomas in Caucasian populations. To determine the spectrum of gene rearrangements in Japanese patients, we systematically examined 40 papillary thyroid carcinomas for all possible types of gene fusion events involving RET or TRK genes. RET rearrangements were found in ten tumors (25%): ret/PTC1 had occurred in two tumors, ret/PTC2 in one, ret/PTC3 in six, and a novel RET rearrangement in the remaining patient. In this last patient, the 5' novel sequence was fused in-frame to the RET amino acid sequence; thus, the fusion gene may encode a protein with a RET kinase domain at the carboxy terminus. The RET gene was fused to 5' donor sequences at the beginning of exon 12 in all ten tumors. No rearrangements involving the TRK gene were found in this panel of carcinomas. Our results indicated that constitutive activation of the RET by gene rearrangement is a frequent mechanism of papillary thyroid carcinogenesis in Japanese adults.
