The steroid 21-hydroxylase (21-OH) gene is selectively expressed in the adrenal cortex and is transcriptionally regulated by ACTH. We examined the role of the 5'-flanking sequences of 21-OH in this regulated expression by analyzing their ability to direct the expression of a human growth hormone (hGH) reporter gene upon transfection into Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cells. The 330 bp of 5'-flanking sequences directed basal and hormonally-inducible expression of hGH in Y1 cells, but did not direct expression in I-10 mouse testicular Leydig cells. Both constitutive and hormonally-inducible expression required a functional cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These results indicate that the first 330 bp of 5'-flanking sequences of the 21-OH gene contain sufficient information for cell-specific and hormonally regulated expression, and that this expression requires the integrity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Markedly lower expression of hGH was seen when 156 bp of 5'-flanking sequences were placed in front of the reporter gene, suggesting that sequences between -330 and -156 are essential for expression. The addition of sequences from -330 to -150 to the p-156GH plasmid, in either the correct or the reverse orientation, restored promoter activity to approximately the level obtained with the 330 bp of 5'-flanking sequences. Moreover, the addition of sequences from -230 to -150 increased by 5-fold the expression of hGH driven by the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter. Based on these results, we conclude that an enhancer element is contained within the sequences from 230 to 150 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site.
