We have identified and characterized a novel murine gene, Ectoderm-Neural Cortex-1 (ENC-1), that is an early and highly specific marker of neural induction in vertebrates. ENC-1, which encodes a kelch family related protein, is expressed during early gastrulation in the prospective neuroectodermal region of the epiblast and later in development throughout the nervous system (NS). ENC-1 expression is highly dynamic and, after neurulation, preferentially defines prospective cortical areas. The only apparent expression of ENC-1 outside the NS is restricted to the rostral-most somitomere of the presomitic mesoderm, at the times corresponding to the epithelialization that precedes somite formation. Cellular expression of epitope-tagged ENC-1 shows extensive co-localization of ENC-1 with the actin cytoskeleton, and immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate a physical association between ENC-1 and actin. ENC-1 functions as an actin-binding protein that may be important in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton during neural fate specification and development of the NS.
