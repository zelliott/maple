We have used 600 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy data to determine the solution structure of a 31-residue domain of a murine class II major histocompatibility (MHC) protein. This domain, I-Ab(beta)-(60-90), binds to the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A. Distance geometry and dynamical simulated annealing calculations were performed using NOESY- and COSY-deduced constraints. I-Ab(beta)-(60-90), which is mostly alpha-helical, is more similar to the corresponding region of the class II MHC protein HLA-DR1 than to the class I MHC protein HLA-A2. Arg-72 and Arg-80 lie on the same side of the helix and face away from the antigenic peptide binding groove. His-81, implicated in both superantigen and peptide binding, is located midway between the surface defined by Arg-72/Arg-80 and residues that define the inside of the peptide binding groove, allowing for its participation in both types of binding.
