Bovine rhinovirus 2 (BRV2), a causative agent of respiratory disease in cattle, is tentatively assigned to the genus Rhinovirus in the family Picornaviridae. A nearly full-length cDNA of the BRV2 genome was cloned and the nucleotide sequence determined. BRV2 possesses a putative leader proteinase, a small 2A protein and a poly(C) tract, which are characteristic of aphthoviruses. Alignment of BRV-2 and FMDV polyproteins showed that 41% of amino acids were identical within the P1 region. Furthermore, 2A, 2C, 3B(3), 3C and 3D proteins are as much as 67%, 52%, 52%, 50%, and 64% identical, respectively. BRV2 leader protein is rapidly released from the viral polyprotein and cleaves eIF4G at a rate similar to FMDV leader proteinase, suggesting a functional relationship between the leader protein in these viruses. The results suggest that BRV2 is closely related to FMDV and should therefore be considered as a new species within the genus Aphthovirus.
