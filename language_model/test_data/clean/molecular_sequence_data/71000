Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were determined for a 436 bp reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) cDNA fragment from genome segment 8 and a 1151 bp RT-PCR cDNA fragment from genome segment 2 of the North American isolate of infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) and compared to the published sequences of Norwegian isolates of ISAV. The North American ISAV isolate exhibited 82.9% identity with the Sotra 92/93 ISAV isolate from Norway in the partial cDNA sequence of genome segment 2, which encodes a polymerase component protein (PB1). The North American ISAV exhibited 88 and 89% identity with 2 partial cDNA sequences of genome segment 8 (nonstructural, NS, gene) reported for the Glesvaer/2/90 isolate from Norway. The North American ISAV exhibited 96.6% similarity with the Sotra 92/93 ISAV isolate from Norway in the deduced amino acid sequences of the PB1 protein. The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein encoded in the partial cDNA fragment of open reading frame (ORF) 1 of genome segment 8 of the North American ISAV exhibited only 71.2 and 66.7% similarity with the 2 sequences of the Norwegian Glesvaer/2/90 isolate. However, the North American ISAV isolate exhibited 96.2 and 87.2% similarity with the 2 sequences of the Norwegian Glesvaer/2/90 isolate in the deduced amino acid sequences of the protein encoded in the partial cDNA of ORF 2. Comparison of these partial cDNA nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences confirmed that the North American isolate is ISAV. However, the differences observed in these genomic sequences suggest that the North American isolate may represent a distinct genomic variant from the previously described Norwegian strains.
