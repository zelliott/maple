The interaction between "switch I/effector domain" of Ha-Ras and the Ras-binding domain (RBD, amino acid 51-131) of Raf-1 is essential for signal transduction. However, the importance of the "activator domain" (approximately corresponding to amino acids 26-28 and 40-49) of Ha-Ras and of the "cysteine-rich region" (CRR, amino acids 152-184) of Raf-1 have also been proposed. Here, we found that Raf-1 CRR interacts directly with Ha-Ras independently of RBD and that participation of CRR is necessary for efficient Ras-Raf binding. Furthermore, Ha-Ras carrying mutations (N26G and V45E) in the activator domain failed to bind CRR, whereas they bound RBD normally. On the contrary, Ha-Ras carrying mutations in the switch I/effector domain exhibited severely reduced ability to bind RBD, whereas their ability to bind CRR was unaffected. Mutants that bound to either RBD or CRR alone failed to activate Raf-1. Ha-Ras without post-translational modifications, which lacks the ability to activate Raf-1, selectively lost the ability to bind CRR. These results suggest that the activator domain of Ha-Ras participates in activation of Raf-1 through interaction with CRR and that post-translational modifications of Ha-Ras are required for this interaction.
