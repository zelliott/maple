Untreated sewage samples from 12 cities in the United States were screened for the presence of recently characterized RNA and DNA viruses found at high prevalence in the stool specimens of South Asian children. Genetic variants of human cosaviruses and cardioviruses in the Picornaviridae family and of DNA circoviruses and human bocaviruses were detected, expanding the known genetic diversity and geographic range of these newly identified viruses. All four virus groups were detected in sewage samples of less than a milliliter from multiple U.S. cities. PCR screening of particle-protected viral nucleic acid in sewage samples could therefore rapidly establish the presence and determine the diversity of four newly described enteric viruses in large urban populations. More frequent and deeper sampling of viral nucleic acids in sewage samples could be used to monitor changes in the prevalence and genetic composition of these and other novel enteric viruses.
