Heart fatty acid binding protein (hFABP) is an abundant 14-kDa cytosolic protein thought to be involved in trafficking of fatty acids from the plasma membrane to sites of beta-oxidation in mitochondria and peroxisomes and to the endoplasmic reticulum for lipid synthesis. A human hFABP cDNA isolated by polymerase chain reaction was used as a probe for in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes. A fragment of the gene for human hFABP was used as a probe for fluorescence in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes. The cDNA and genomic probes both localized the gene for human hFABP to chromosome 1p32-1p33.
