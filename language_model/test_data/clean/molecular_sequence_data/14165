We developed the first set of microsatellite markers for the passion fruit, Passiflora cincinnata, to provide tools for further study of its genetic diversity and to support current conservation and genetic studies.

We used a microsatellite-enriched library approach to isolate and characterize 25 new molecular markers. Seven primer pairs successfully amplified polymorphic microsatellite regions, with an average of five alleles per locus. The mean values of expected and observed levels of heterozygosity were 0.516 and 0.525, respectively.

The microsatellite markers identified in this study may be valuable tools for population genetic studies, and this set of markers also may be useful in the design of a genetic conservation strategy, mating system, and hybridization studies.
