Cultures of a novel nutritionally specialized, fermentative yeast species were isolated from 34 water tanks of five bromeliad species, two mangrove sediment samples and one swamp water sample in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Sequence analysis of the D1/D2 domains of the large subunit of the rRNA gene showed that the novel species belongs to the genus Kazachstania. The novel species differs from Kazachstania martiniae by 11 substitutions and 2 gaps in the sequence of the domains D1/D2 of the LSU rRNA gene. The name Kazachstania bromeliacearum sp. nov. is proposed for the novel species. The type strain is IMUFRJ 51496T (=CBS 7996T=DBVPG 6864T=UFMG BR-174T).
