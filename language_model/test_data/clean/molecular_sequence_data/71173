A competitive ELISA employing a polyclonal antiserum raised against leucokinin-I was used to isolate and purify a myokinin (muscakinin) from 1.05 kg of adult houseflies (Musca domestica). Following solid-phase purification, seven HPLC column steps were used to purify 4.8 nmol of leucokinin-immunoreactive material. Sequence analysis and mass spectrometry were consistent with the structure Asn-Thr-Val-Val-Leu-Gly Lys-Lys-Gln-Arg-Phe-His-Ser-Trp-Gly NH2. This peptide was synthesized and co-eluted with the natural peptide on three different HPLC columns. The activities of natural and synthetic muscakinin were identical, with both producing a 4-5 fold increase in fluid secretion by housefly Malpighian tubules at nanomolar concentrations. The presence of a pair of basic residues (Lys-Lys) suggested muscakinin might be processed further, with the peptide pGlu-Arg-Phe-His-Ser-Trp-Gly NH2 being produced by conversion of an N-terminal glutamine to pyroglutamic acid. However, this analog was 1000-fold less active than the intact peptide, comparable to the activity of AK-V which shares the same C-terminal pentapeptide sequence. The diuretic activity of muscakinin is more than double that of a previously identified CRF-related diuretic peptide (Musca-DP) from the housefly, and the two peptides act synergistically in stimulating fluid secretion. Muscakinin also increased the frequency and amplitude of contractions by housefly hindgut which might further contribute to the excretory process.
