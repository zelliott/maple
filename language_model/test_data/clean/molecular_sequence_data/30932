Clones carrying the white and topaz eye color genes have been isolated from genomic DNA libraries of the blowfly Lucilia cuprina using cloned DNA from the homologous white and scarlet genes, respectively, of Drosophila melanogaster as probes. On the basis of hybridization studies using adjacent restriction fragments, homologous fragments were found to be colinear between the genes from the two species. The nucleotide sequence of a short region of the white gene of L. cuprina has been determined, and the homology to the corresponding region of D. melanogaster is 72%; at the derived amino acid level the homology is greater (84%) due to a marked difference in codon usage between the species. A major difference in genome organization between the two species is that whereas the DNA encompassing the D. melanogaster genes is free of repeated sequences, that encompassing their L. cuprina counterparts contains substantial amounts of repeated sequences. This suggests that the genome of L. cuprina is organized on the short period interspersion pattern. Repeated sequence DNA elements, which appear generally to be short (less than 1 kb) and which vary in repetitive frequency in the genome from greater than 10(4) copies to less than 10(2) copies, are found in at least two different locations in the clones carrying these genes. One type of repeat structure, found by sequencing, consists of tandemly repeating short sequences. Restriction site and restriction fragment length polymorphisms involving both the white and topaz gene regions are found within and between populations of L. cuprina.
