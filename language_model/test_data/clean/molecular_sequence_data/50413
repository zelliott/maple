The gene encoding the 49-kDa subunit of RNA polymerase A in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been identified by formation of a hybrid enzyme between the S. cerevisiae A49 subunit and Saccharomyces douglasii subunits based on a polymorphism existing between the subunits of RNA polymerase A in these two species. The sequence of the gene reveals a basic protein with an unusually high lysine content, which may account for the affinity for DNA shown by the subunit. No appreciable homology with any polymerase subunits, enzymes, or transcription factors is found. Complete deletion of the single-copy RPA49 gene leads to viable but slowly growing colonies. Insertion of the HIS3 gene halfway into the RPA49 coding region results in synthesis of a truncated A49 subunit that is incorporated into the polymerase. The truncated and wild-type subunits compete equally for assembly in the heterozygous diploid, although the wild type is phenotypically dominant.
