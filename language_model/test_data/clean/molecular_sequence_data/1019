Microarray analysis of large-scale temporal and tissue-specific plant gene expression changes occurring during a susceptible plant-pathogen interaction revealed different gene expression profile changes in cotton root and hypocotyl tissues. In hypocotyl tissues infected with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum, increased expression of defense-related genes was observed, whereas few changes in the expression levels of defense-related genes were found in infected root tissues. In infected roots, more plant genes were repressed than were induced, especially at the earlier stages of infection. Although many known cotton defense responses were identified, including induction of pathogenesis-related genes and gossypol biosynthesis genes, potential new defense responses also were identified, such as the biosynthesis of lignans. Many of the stress-related gene responses were common to both tissues. The repression of drought-responsive proteins such as aquaporins in both roots and hypocotyls represents a previously unreported response of a host to pathogen attack that may be specific to vascular wilt diseases. Gene expression results implicated the phytohormones ethylene and auxin in the disease process. Biochemical analysis of hormone level changes supported this observation.
