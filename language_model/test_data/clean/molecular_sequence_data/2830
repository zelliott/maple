The nucleotide sequence of the small (S) RNA segment of the Bunyamwera virus genome has been determined. The S RNA is 961 bases in length and, in common with other bunyaviruses, encodes two proteins, N and NSs, in overlapping reading frames. A six-way alignment of the amino acid sequences of the N and NSs proteins of viruses representing three serogroups within the Bunyavirus genus indicates regions which are strongly conserved, and provides targets for future analysis of protein function.
