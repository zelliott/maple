Flagellar motility is the result of specific interactions between axonemal microtubular proteins and the dynein motors. Tubulin, the main component of microtubule, is a very polymorphic protein resulting from the expression of several isogenes and from the existence of various post-translational modifications. In order to characterize tubulin isoforms and tubulin domains that are important for flagellar movement, we prepared monoclonal antibodies against axonemal proteins from whole sea-urchin sperm tails. The monoclonal antibodies obtained were screened for their potency to inhibit demembranated-reactivated sperm models and for their monospecific immunoreactivity on immunoblot. Among the different antibodies we obtained, D66 reacted specifically with a subset of beta-tubulin isoforms. Limited proteolysis, HPLC, peptide sequencing, mass spectroscopy and immunoblotting experiments indicated that D66 recognized an epitope localized in the primary sequence Gln423-Glu435 of the C-terminal domain of Lytechinus pictus beta2-tubulin, and that this sequence belongs to class IVb. The use of synthetic peptides and immunoblotting analysis further narrowed the amino acids important for antibody recognition to Asp427-Glu432. Because the primary effect of this antibody on sperm motility is to decrease the flagellar beat frequency, we suggest that this sequence is involved in the tubulin-dynein head interaction.
