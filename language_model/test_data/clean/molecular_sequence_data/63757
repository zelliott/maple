In addition to the numerous cathelicidin peptides that are associated with the antimicrobial activity exhibited by a crude extract from ovine blood, a further three peptides with antimicrobial activity have been identified. These were part of the precursor cathelin domain of cathelicidins, a large fragment of platelet factor 4 and a small peptide similar to signal peptide of the T-cell glycoprotein CD4 precursor. Fragments of proteins that are involved in protecting the host from infection may have a secondary purpose as antimicrobial agents once they have carried out their primary purpose and are cleaved the main protein.
