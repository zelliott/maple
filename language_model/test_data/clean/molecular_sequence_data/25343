The idiotypy of antibodies (Ab) specific for oligosaccharide determinants of blood groups of the human ABO system was studied through a cascade. Xenogenic antiidiotypic Ab (Ab2) raised in rabbits to the murine monoclonal anti-A61 (Ab1) were screened for reactivity with various anti-ABH Ab. Three anti-A and three anti-A,B monoclonal antibodies (mAb) which were developed in the same mouse strain as that producing Ab1, as well as a human polyclonal anti-A, were found to share cross-reactive idiotopes (CRI) with Ab1. CRI on murine mAb could be due to a Biozzi recurrent Id on anti-A Ab reacting with anti-Id "Ã  la Oudin", while CRI on human anti-A Ab suggested the presence of paratope-induced anti-Id. Inhibition by Ab2 of haemagglutination of A, B or O human red blood cells by many murine anti-ABH mAb, and by polyclonal or monoclonal human anti-A, strongly supported the occurrence of anti-Id mimicking ABH epitopes belonging to type 2 determinants carried by human erythrocytes. Furthermore, a rabbit immunized with Ab2 produced a potent Ab3 response characterized by anti-H-type-2 specificity. Altogether, these results are consistent with the first successful production of anti-Id Ab that mimics the tridimensional shape of a well defined and strictly carbohydrate epitope, eliciting a haemagglutinating Ab3.
