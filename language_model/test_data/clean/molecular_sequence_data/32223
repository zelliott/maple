We previously demonstrated that the gene for a member of the humoral C-type lectin family is transiently expressed in the regenerating legs of the American cockroach [Arai et al., Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 28, 987-994 (1998)]. To identify candidate lectin(s) involved in tail regeneration in the Xenopus laevis tadpole, we isolated a 35-kDa Ca(2+)-dependent lectin (XCL-1) from adult Xenopus serum and cloned its cDNA. Although XCL-1 gene expression was not induced in the regenerating tails, we isolated a cDNA for an XCL-1-related protein (XCL-2) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In contrast to the XCL-1 gene, XCL-2 gene expression was significantly increased in the regenerating tails, suggesting its role in tail regeneration. Although both XCL-1 and XCL-2 belong to a recently identified Xenopus lectin family (X-lectins), XCL-1 and XCL-2 exhibit distinct developmental gene expression from two other known X-lectin members, both of which are expressed principally in the embryonic stage, whereas the XCL-1 and XCL-2 genes are predominantly expressed in the adult and middle/late tadpole stages, respectively, suggesting multiple functions of X-lectin family members. Thus, the presence of multifunctional Ca(2+)-dependent lectin family and the induction of the member gene in regenerating organs are conserved among insects and vertebrates.
