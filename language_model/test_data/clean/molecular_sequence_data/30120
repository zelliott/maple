Our laboratory recently isolated a cDNA for cytochrome P-450g (IIC13), a male-specific, highly polymorphic P-450 isozyme, from livers of the high phenotype (+g) of Sprague-Dawley rats [McClellan-Green et al. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 5832-5839]. Hybridization studies using a specific oligonucleotide probe for P-450 (+g) indicated that equivalent amounts of P-450g mRNA were present in livers of both the high and low phenotypes (+g and -g) of male Sprague-Dawley, Fischer (inbred -g), or ACI (inbred +g) rats. In the present study, we isolated one full-length and one nearly full-length cDNA clone coding for the unexpressed form of cytochrome P-450g from a cDNA library constructed from mRNA from a (-g) male Sprague-Dawley rat. The longest cDNA had an open reading frame of 1473 nucleotides which coded for a 490 amino acid polypeptide of Mr 55,839. Although the 5'-noncoding leader sequence and the 3'-noncoding region were unchanged, the coding sequence of the (-g) phenotype differed from that of the cDNA isolated from the (+g) phenotype by nine bases changes. These base changes would result in seven amino acid differences between the protein sequences for the two phenotypes. Two specific oligonucleotide probes for (+) P-450g and (-) P-450g containing three base differences between the (+g) and (-g) sequences hybridized differentially to mRNA from the (+g) and (-g) phenotypes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
