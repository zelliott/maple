The spliceosome catalyzes pre-mRNA splicing in two steps. After catalytic step I, a major remodeling of the spliceosome occurs to establish the active site for step II. Here, we report the isolation of a cDNA encoding hSlu7, the human homolog of the yeast second step splicing factor Slu7. We show that hSlu7 associates with the spliceosome late in the splicing pathway, but at a stage prior to recognition of the 3' splice site for step II. In the absence of hSlu7, splicing is stalled between the catalytic steps in a novel complex, the CDeltahSlu7 complex. We provide evidence that this complex differs significantly in structure from the known spliceosomal complexes, yet is a functional intermediate between the catalytic steps of splicing. Together, our observations indicate that hSlu7 is required for a structural alteration of the spliceosome prior to the establishment of the catalytically active spliceosome for step II.
