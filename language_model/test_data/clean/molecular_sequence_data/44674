We isolated a cDNA encoding a human homologue of ZF5 (hZF5), which has five Kruppel-like C2H2 type zinc fingers at carboxyl terminus and the BTB/POZ (poxvirus and zinc finger) at the amino terminus, using autoimmune sera from a patient with overlap syndrome (dermatomyositis and scleroderma). Sequencing of the entire cDNA revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 1349 bp with a deduced protein sequence of 449 amino acid residues and a calculated molecular weight of 51.3 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of hZF5 is highly homologous to mouse ZF5 (99.3% identity). Immunofluorescence studies revealed that HA-tagged hZF5 transiently expressed in COS-7 cells showed the nuclear dot pattern in the BTB/POZ domain-dependent manner.
