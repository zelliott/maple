Allele and genotype frequencies of five microsatellites on the short arm of chromosome 6 have been determined in 158 subjects from 14 large Italian families, using polymerase chain reaction amplification and a non-radioactive method of detection. The markers studied were: D6S89, D6S109, D6S105, pLR12 and HLA-F; their heterozygosity ranged from 0.65 to 0.78. Two point and three point linkage analysis among these markers and HLA-A serological types--available for all the studied samples--allowed construction of a partial genetic map telomeric to HLA-A. Our results may be useful for linkage analysis of genetic disorders mapping on this region of 6p.
