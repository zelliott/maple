A full length cDNA whose corresponding mRNA is down-regulated during the mouse embryonic brain development was isolated. The cDNA contains a single long open reading frame which could encode a protein with relative molecular mass of 41 kDa. The predicted gene product contains long stretches of prolines towards the NH2-terminus, followed by a leucine/proline rich region. The cDNA probe detected a number of mRNA species in Northern blot analysis. The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of mRNA from adult mouse tissues indicated that heart and testis expressed this gene (named NDPP-1) at relatively high levels, while lower levels of mRNA were detected in a number of other tissues. Expression of NDPP-1 was also detected in embryonic carcinoma and pheochromocytoma cell lines, but not in fibroblasts. The cDNA hybridized to genomic DNA from several vertebrates species in Southern blot analysis indicating interspecies conservation of this gene. The interesting pattern of expression of the NDPP-1 gene during mouse brain development and the structure of its putative protein product indicate that this gene may play an important biological role in the development of mouse central nervous system.
