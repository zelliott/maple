Genome of GBV-C have 5' and 3' untranslated region and a coding region of 2842 amino acid. In comparison with other flaviviruses, GBV-C lacks the sequence coding typical CORE protein at the N terminus of putative polyprotein. In the putative structure region, E1 and E2, three potential glycosylation sites(Asn-X-Ser/Thr) were conserved in all isolates. In the putative NS3 region, conserved elements found in RNA helicases with nucleotide triphosphate(NTP) binding motif, GSGKS(residue 1097-1101) and DECH(residue 1184-1187), were observed. In addition, a sequence motif found in all viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, GDD(residue 2587-2589) was also conserved in NS5B region.
