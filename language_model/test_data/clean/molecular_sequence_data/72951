The activation of pectin lyase (Pnl) production in Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora strain 71 occurs upon DNA damage via a unique regulatory circuit involving recA, rdgA and rdgB. In a similar Pnl-inducible system reconstituted in Escherichia coli, the rdgB product was found to activate the expression of pnlA, the structural gene for pectin lyase. The kinetic data presented here also show that transcription of pnlA followed that of rdgB in Er. carotovora subsp. carotovora, indicating a temporal order of gene expression. By deletion analysis we have localized the promoter/regulatory region within a 66 bp DNA segment upstream of the pnlA transcriptional start site. This region contains the -10 consensus sequence but not the sequences corresponding to the E. coli -35 region. For DNA-binding studies, rdgB was overexpressed in E. coli and a 14 kDa polypeptide was identified as the gene product. RdgB from crude extracts or a purified preparation caused an identical gel mobility shift of a 164 bp DNA segment containing the pnlA promoter/regulatory region. Utilizing DNase I protection assay the RdgB-binding site was localized between nucleotides -29 and -56, i.e. overlapping the position of the putative -35 box. The findings reported here, taken along with our previous observation that the rdgE product is required for pnlA expression, establishes that rdgB encodes a transcriptional factor which specifically interacts with the pnlA promoter/regulatory region.
