High resolution chemical footprinting and cross-linking experiments have provided a basis for elucidating the overall architecture of the complex between the core DNA binding domain of p53 (p53DBD, amino acids 98-309) and the p21/waf1/cip1 DNA response element implicated in the G1/S phase cell cycle checkpoint. These studies complement both a crystal structure and earlier biophysical studies and provide the first direct experimental evidence that four subunits of p53DBD bind to the response element in a regular staggered array having pseudodyad symmetry. The invariant guanosines in the highly conserved C(A/T)|(T/A)G parts of the consensus half-sites are critical to the p53DBD-DNA binding. Molecular modeling of the complex using the observed peptide-DNA contacts shows that when four subunits of p53DBD bind the response element, the DNA has to bend approximately 50 degrees to relieve steric clashes among different subunits, consistent with recent DNA cyclization studies. The overall lateral arrangement of the four p53 subunits with respect to the DNA loop comprises a novel nucleoprotein assembly that has not been reported previously in other complexes. We suggest that this kind of nucleoprotein superstructure may be important for p53 binding to response elements packed in chromatin and for subsequent transactivation of p53-mediated genes.
