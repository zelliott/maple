In this study we have used a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to demonstrate that adult primary human osteoblasts and SaOS-2, a human osteosarcoma-derived cell line with osteoblastic properties, express cellular retinol-binding protein I (CRBP I), cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II (CRABP II), and very low levels of CRABP I. We also show that CRABP II is expressed in the adult liver, which does not express CRABP I. The results suggest that CRABP II is the important isoform in the adult bone as well as in the adult liver. Since the 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (RXR) alpha previously has been shown to be expressed predominantly in the liver, CRABP II might be involved in the transport of 9-cis retinoic acid to its nuclear receptor.
