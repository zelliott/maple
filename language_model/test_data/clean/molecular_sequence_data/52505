To identify the role of the downstream region of a hut promoter in regulation of the Bacillus subtilis hut operon, three single-base substitutions (+9G-->A, +14C-->T, and +23T-->G) were introduced into the hut operon. Analysis of expression of the hut operon containing each of these three single-base substitutions and the hut-lacZ fusions with the single-base substitutions at position +14 showed that the position at +14 and probably the position at +23 were required for amino acid repression at the hut promoter, while the position at +14 was not required for catabolite repression at the hut promoter. The position at +9 was required for a histidine-dependent increase of activity of the hut promoter. Analysis of expression of the hut-lacZ fusions and the hut operon in the codY mutant indicated that the position at +14 and probably the position at +23 were involved in CodY-mediated amino acid repression at the hut promoter and that CodY was not required for catabolite repression at the hut promoter.
