Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) enzyme activities were previously reported to be regulated during development, but the underlying molecular events are unknown. In addition, little is known about LPL evolution. We cloned and sequenced a complete mouse LPL cDNA. Comparison of sequences from mouse, human, bovine, and guinea pig cDNAs indicated that the rates of evolution of mouse, human, and bovine LPL are quite low, but guinea pig LPL has evolved several times faster than the others. 32P-Labeled mouse LPL and rat HL cDNAs were used to study lipase mRNA tissue distribution and developmental regulation in the rat. Northern gel analysis revealed the presence of a single 1.87 kb HL mRNA species in liver, but not in other tissues including adrenal and ovary. A single 4.0 kb LPL mRNA species was detected in epididymal fat, heart, psoas muscle, lactating mammary gland, adrenal, lung, and ovary, but not in adult kidney, liver, intestine, or brain. Quantitative slot-blot hybridization analysis demonstrated the following relative amounts of LPL mRNA in rat tissues: adipose, 100%; heart, 94%; adrenal, 6.6%; muscle, 3.8%; lung, 3.0%; kidney, 0%; adult liver, 0%. The same quantitative analysis was used to study lipase mRNA levels during development. There was little postnatal variation in LPL mRNA in adipose tissue; maximal levels were detected at the earliest time points studied for both inguinal and epididymal fat. In heart, however, LPL mRNA was detected at low levels 6 days before birth and increased 278-fold as the animals grew to adulthood.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
