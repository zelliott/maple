The analysis of recombinant Desmodus salivary plasminogen activator (DSPA alpha 1), a heterogeneous glycoprotein, is demonstrated through the use of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), high-performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE), liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry (LC--ES-MS), and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization--time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI--TOF-MS). The proteins is analyzed at three specific levels of detail: the intact protein, proteolytic digests of the protein, and fractions from the proteolytic digest. A method for "on-column" collection of HPLC fractions for subsequent transfer and analysis by HPCE and MALDI--TOF-MS is shown.
