Primary structure of beta-subunit of the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase has been determined by the parallel analysis of the protein amino acid sequence and the corresponding cDNA nucleotide sequence. The beta-subunit contains 852 amino acid residues, its molecular mass is 98291 Da. A significant homology is found between beta- and alpha-subunit of the cGMP phosphodiesterase.
