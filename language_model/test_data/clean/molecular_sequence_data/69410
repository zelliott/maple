The 34,214 bp DNA sequence of adenovirus type 40 strain Dugan was determined directly from random fragments of virion DNA cloned into a bacteriophage M13 cloning vector. The gene layout is similar to that of other human adenoviruses, and in addition contains two potential protein-coding regions that are conserved, but have not been recognized previously, in other adenovirus genomes. One is oriented rightward, contained within the intron in the protein-coding region for the L4 33K gene, and would encode a protein sharing N-terminal sequence with 33K. The other is a leftward oriented exon located between the E3 and L5 IV (fibre) regions which would specify the N terminus of a novel protein. The region encoding the C terminus of this protein is not apparent from sequence data.
