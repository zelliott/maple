We have compared kinetoplast DNA maxicircles of tunicamycin- and arsenite-resistant variants of repeatedly cloned Leishmania mexicana amazonensis showing DNA amplification with wild-type and arsenite-resistant variants of the same lineage that do not show DNA amplification. DNA restriction patterns and the degree of cross-hybridization between maxicircle DNA fragments of parasites displaying DNA amplification and those of parasites without amplification were examined. In addition, the nucleotide sequence of the cytochrome b (Cyb) gene from the coding region was compared between these two groups of parasites. Extensive changes were found in the nucleotide sequences and the amino acid sequences of the cytochrome gene of the maxicircles of variants with DNA amplification. The Cyb genes from both groups had much shorter open reading frames than the same gene from Leishmania tarentolae and Trypanosoma brucei. The simultaneous changes in maxicircles and minicircles of these variants suggest that they may confer the advantage of maintaining viable mitochondrial function under selective pressure.
