To investigate the association between the polymorphism of the thromboxane synthase gene and Uigur patients with myocardial infarction (MI) in Xinjiang.

Three hundred and fifteen patients with MI and 218 healthy control subjects were detected by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. The serum thromboxane B2 (TXB2) in all subjects was detected with radioimmunoassay kit.

The genotype distributions of the MI group and control group were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Chi-square=0.375,0.029, P>0.05). The frequencies of CC and TC were 0.933 and 0.067 in MI group while they were 0.977 and 0.023 in controls. There was significant difference in frequencies of the TC genotype and T allele but no difference in frequencies of CC genotype between controls and MI cases. There was significant difference in serum TXB2 level between the MI and control group (P<0.05), and between individuals of the TC and CC genotypes (P<0.05). The serum TXB2 level in the MI cases with TC genotype was increased compared with that of other genotypes (P<0.05).

The TC genotype and T allele of thromboxane synthase gene might be risk factors of MI in Uigur population in Xinjiang, which might result from the increased serum TXB2 level.
