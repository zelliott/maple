A gene (eprA1) encoding the extracellular protease of Aeromonas hydrophila AH1 has been cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence analysis of eprA1 predicted a single open reading frame (ORF) of 1038 bp encoding a 346 amino acid (aa) polypeptide, with a potential 21-aa signal peptide. When the eprA1 gene was expressed in minicells, one major band of approx. 37 kDa was identified, while protease activity staining experiments identified a caseinolytic band of approx. 29 kDa determined by SDS-PAGE analysis of the minicells. The deduced C-terminal aa region (Arg-290 to Gly-313) showed sequence homology to partial C-terminal sequences of other zinc metalloproteases including Penicillium citrinum metalloprotease (PlnC), Aspergillus oryzae metalloprotease (NpII), Aspergillus flavus metalloprotease (MepA), and Aspergillus fumigatus metalloprotease (Mep20), particularly with respect to zinc-binding residues.
