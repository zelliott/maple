Two c-type cytochromes from the soluble fraction of a deep-sea moderately piezophilic bacterium, Shewanella violacea, were purified and characterized, and the genes coding for these cytochromes were cloned and sequenced. One of the cytochromes, designated cytochrome c(A), was found to have a molecular mass of approximately 8.3 kDa, and it contained one heme c per molecule. The other, designated cytochrome c(B), was found to have a molecular mass of approximately 23 kDa, and it contained two heme c molecules per protein molecule. The amount of cytochrome c(B) expressed in cells grown at high hydrostatic pressure (50 MPa) was less than that in cells grown at atmospheric pressure, whereas cytochrome c(A) was constitutively expressed under all pressure conditions examined. The results of Northern blotting analysis were consistent with the above-mentioned observations and suggested that the pressure regulation of cytochrome c(B) gene expression occurred at the transcriptional level. These results suggest that the components of the respiratory chain of moderately piezophilic S. violacea could be exchanged according to the growth pressure conditions.
