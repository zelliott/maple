A nonproteolytic, nontoxigenic Clostridium botulinum strain identified by conventional and molecular techniques as type B-, E-, or F-like (BEF-like) was isolated from a human postsurgical wound. All previous reports of such strains have been from environmental sources. Since toxin production is the main taxonomic denominator for C. botulinum, a new name is needed for nonproteolytic, nontoxigenic BEF-like clinical isolates.
