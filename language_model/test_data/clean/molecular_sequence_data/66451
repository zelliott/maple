We postulated that apolysis was processed in accordance with apoptotic changes occurring in a cestode, Spirometra erinacei (Pseudophyllidea). We cloned the novel putative apoptosis-associated gene from S. erinacei via screening of a S. erinacei cDNA library with a ced-3 gene (activator of apoptosis) probe from Caenorhabditis elegans. We identified a 261-bp cDNA sequence, which encodes for an 86-amino acid protein. The cloned gene expression was observed in the neck and gravid proglottids via Northern blotting, using cloned cDNA inserts as probes, but the clone was not expressed in any of other tissues. We suggest that this gene may be involved in the apolysis of S. erinacei during normal tissue development and differentiation in cestode parasites.
