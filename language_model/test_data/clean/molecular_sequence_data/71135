A thermostabilized mutant of Bacillus subtilis 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IPMDH) obtained in a previous study contained a set of triple amino acid substitutions. To further improve the stability of the mutant, we used a random mutagenesis technique and identified two additional thermostabilizing substitutions, Thr22-->Lys and Met256-->Val, that separately endowed the protein with further stability. We introduced the two mutations into a single enzyme molecule, thus constructing a mutant with overall quintuple mutations. Other studies have suggested that an improved hydrophobic subunit interaction and a rigid type II beta-turn play important roles in enhancing the protein stability. Based on those observations, we successively introduced amino acid substitutions into the mutant with the quintuple mutations by site-directed mutagenesis: Glu253 at the subunit interface was replaced by Leu to increase the hydrophobic interaction between the subunits; Glu112, Ser113 and Ser115 that were involved in the formation of the turn were replaced by Pro, Gly and Glu, respectively, to make the turn more rigid. The thermal stability of the mutants was determined based on remaining activity after heat treatment and first-order rate constant of thermal unfolding, which showed gradual increases in thermal stability as more mutations were included.
