Three different ways of detecting insertion/deletion (Ins/Del) genotypes of the apolipoprotein B gene encoding signal peptide were compared. Unequal quantities of the two alleles were observed in 50 Serbian subjects. The low abundance allele was clearly visible only when a modified method of silver staining for polyacrylamide gels was used. This method is more reliable for Ins/Del polymorphism genotyping, avoiding misclassifications by conventional ethidium bromide staining of both agarose and polyacrylamide gels.
