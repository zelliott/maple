A new acylated anthocyanin was isolated from the violet-blue flowers of Pharbitis nil as a minor anthocyanin. The structure of this pigment was determined to be cyanidin 3-O-(2-O-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-6-O-(trans-4-O-(beta-D- glucopyranosyl)caffeyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-5-O-(beta-D-glucopyranosi de) based on spectroscopic methods.
