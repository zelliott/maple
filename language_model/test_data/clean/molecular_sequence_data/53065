The acetyl-CoA transporter gene (Acatn) encodes a hydrophobic, multitransmembrane protein that is involved in the process of O-acetylation of sialic acid residues on gangliosides. O-Acetylated gangliosides have been found to play important roles in tissue development and organization during early embryonic stages. We have cloned the gene for mouse acetyl-CoA transporter. The gene spans approximately 20 kb and is composed of seven exons and six introns. A single transcription initiation site, 371 bp upstream of the ATG start codon, was identified. The promoter region was found to lack a TATA box. However, several potential transcription factor binding motifs such as AP1, AP2, C/EBPalpha, C/EBPbeta, HSF, GATA2 and MZF1 were identified in the promoter region.
