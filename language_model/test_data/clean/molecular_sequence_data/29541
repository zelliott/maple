We describe a chemo-enzymatic synthesis of 3'- and 6'-O-sialyllactose, two trisaccharides occurring in the 'acidic fraction' of the human milk oligosaccharides and endowed with potential antiadhesive activity. The key step is the highly regioselective 6'-O-acylation of benzyllactoside, which gave access to suitably protected lactose building blocks to be used as acceptors in the sialylation reaction. Moreover, the synthesis of the carboxymethyl and sulfo analogues of the title compounds is reported.
