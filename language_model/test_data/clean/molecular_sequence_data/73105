The Choristoneura fumiferana entomopoxvirus (CfEPV) spheroidin gene was identified and localized on three XbaI restriction fragments (total size 4.73 kb). The fragments were cloned and sequenced. The spheroidin gene had an open reading frame of 2997 nucleotides encoding a putative protein with a predicted size of 115 kDa. Sequence analysis indicated that the putative protein contained 14 potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Thr; Asn-X-Ser), that are probably not used since the protein migrates on SDS-PAGE as a 115 kDa band. The protein is rich in cysteine residues (34), which explains the need for reducing agents when dissolving the occlusion bodies with alkali. The spheroidin gene sequence contains motifs characteristic of the late genes of poxviruses. These include the typical TAAATG sequence at the beginning of the coding region and two early gene termination signals (TTTTTNT) in the untranslated region of the gene. The promoter region has three TAA termination signals immediately upstream of the ATG start site. Spheroidin (SPH) appears to be conserved among different EPVs. There was 82.2% identity and 97.2% similarity at the amino acid level between the SPHs of CfEPV and Amsacta moorei EPV. Less conservation was seen with the SPH from Melolontha melolontha EPV (39.8% identity and 73.4% similarity). Transcriptional analyses of the spheroidin gene by Northern blots showed that the transcript had a size of approximately 3 kb, which is in agreement with the length of the ORF. Primer extension results, anchor PCR and sequencing confirmed that there was a poly (A)17 tract at the 5' end of the spheroidin gene transcript, a structure typical of late gene transcripts of poxviruses.
