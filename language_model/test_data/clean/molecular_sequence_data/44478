The Escherichia coli ribonuclease P RNA 15/16 internal bulge loop and the Bacillus subtilis P15 stem loop are important substrate binding sites for the CCA-3' terminus of pre-tRNA. Models of E. coli 15/16 bulge loop and the B. subtilis P15 stem loop have been constructed using MC-SYM, a constraint satisfaction program. The models use covariation analysis data for suggesting initial base pairings, chemical probing, and protection/modification results to determine particular pairing orientations, and mutational experimental analysis data for tRNA-RNase P RNA contacts. The structures from E. coli and B. subtilis, although different in secondary structure, have similar sequence and function. Using MC-SYM, we are able to illustrate how the 3' end of the pre-tRNA is able to interact with this segment of the catalytic RNase P RNA. In addition, we propose additional hydrogen bonding between A76 in the 3' terminus of the tRNA and the 15/16 region of E. coli and to the loop of B. subtilis.
