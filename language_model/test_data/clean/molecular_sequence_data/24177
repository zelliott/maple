An evolutionarily conserved set of proteins consisting of MYB and bHLH transcription factors and a WD40 domain protein is known to act in concert to control various developmental processes including trichome and root hair development. Their function is difficult to assess because most of them belong to multigene families and appear to act in a redundant fashion. In this study we identified an enhancer of the two root hair and trichome patterning mutants triptychon (try) and caprice (cpc), enhancer of try and cpc2 (etc2). The ETC2 gene shows high sequence similarity to the single-repeat MYB genes CPC and TRY. Overexpression results in the suppression of trichomes and overproduction of root hairs similarly as observed for TRY and CPC suggesting that ETC2 has similar biochemical properties. The etc2 single mutant shows an increase in trichome number on leaves and petioles. Double and triple mutant analysis indicates that the ETC2 gene acts redundant with TRY and CPC in trichome patterning.
