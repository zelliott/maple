The UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzyme catalyzes the glucuronidation reaction which is a major metabolic and detoxification pathway in humans. Understanding the mechanisms for substrate recognition by UGT assumes great importance in an attempt to predict its contribution to xenobiotic/drug disposition in vivo.        Spurred on by this interest, 2D/3D-quantitative structure activity relationships and pharmacophore models have been established in the absence of a complete mammalian UGT crystal structure.        This review discusses the recent progress in modeling human UGT substrates including those with multiple sites of glucuronidation. A better understanding of UGT active site contributing to substrate selectivity (and regioselectivity) from the homologous enzymes (i.e. plant and bacterial UGTs, all belong to family 1 of glycosyltransferase (GT1)) is also highlighted, as these enzymes share a common catalytic mechanism and/or overlapping substrate selectivity.
