A novel actinomycete, designated strain FXJ1.034(T), was isolated from acidic soil collected in Jiangxi Province, South-east China. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain FXJ1.034(T) belonged to the genus Lentzea and showed high sequence similarities to Lentzea kentuckyensis NRRL B-24416(T) (98.5%) and Lentzea albida NBRC 16102(T) (98.3%). Morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics supported its assignment to the genus Lentzea. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization, physiological and biochemical tests allowed genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of the novel strain from closely related species. Based on the evidence presented here, strain FXJ1.034(T) represents a novel species of the genus Lentzea, for which the name Lentzea jiangxiensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is FXJ1.034(T) ( = CGMCC 4.6609(T)  = NBRC 106680(T)).
