Using a set of overlapping peptides of the human p53 protein, we have performed an accurate mapping of the p53 antigenic sites, recognized by a panel of 19 monoclonal antibodies from the Bp53 series. The results show that most of the antibodies recognize determinants localized in the amino-terminal domain of the protein. Several antibodies reacted with peptides which correspond to the antigenic determinants localized in the carboxy terminus of p53. None of these antibodies reacted with peptides in the central DNA-binding domain of p53 protein.
