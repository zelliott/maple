A cDNA clone for an mRNA whose level increased within 2 h of the start of treatment with N6-benzyladenine in etiolated cotyledons of cucumber was isolated by differential hybridization. The cDNA was homologous to psaL, which encodes subunit XI (PSI-L) of photosystem I. The accumulation of psaL mRNA was specifically induced by cytokinins or light.
