We recovered a carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate H224 under in vivo meropenem selection pressure. Insertional inactivation of a major porin gene, ompK36, by IS5 element might play a role in acquiring carbapenem resistance in this strain harboring plasmid-borne DHA-1 AmpC beta-lactamase.
