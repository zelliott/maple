Immunization by convergent combinatorial peptide libraries, or 'mixotopes' represents an interesting approach for inducing broadly cross-reactive immune response to hypervariable pathogens. The authors have immunized rabbits with a series of eight HIV-1 V3-loop derived constructs of increasing complexity, and analysed the reactivity of the corresponding antisera towards a set of V3-related peptides. Results were surprisingly homogeneous. Mixotopes containing as many as several billion closely related combinatorial sequences were immunogenic, and able to induce V3-specific antibodies. These results suggest that serological cross-reactivity depends on the sequential similarity of the antigen with the parent immunogen. Such 'mixotopes' could represent a useful approach to vaccination against hypervariable pathogens.
