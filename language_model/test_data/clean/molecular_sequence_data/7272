The cyaA gene from Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb), encoding the adenylate cyclase-hemolysin (AC-Hly), has been cloned and its complete nucleotide sequence has been determined. The deduced amino-acid sequence was compared to the AC-Hly from B. pertussis (Bp) and the main differences were found in the C-terminal repeat region of the molecule.
