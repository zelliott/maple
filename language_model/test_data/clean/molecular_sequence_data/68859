Regions of apoprotein(a) of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] exhibit striking primary sequence homology to the kringles of plasminogen. The kringles of plasminogen are lysine binding structures and mediate interactions of plasmin(ogen) with substrates and inhibitors. In the current study, the lysine binding properties of Lp(a) have been compared to those of plasminogen and isolated kringle 4 of plasminogen (K4). An analytical assay was implemented to quantitate the interaction of kringle-containing molecules with lysine-Sepharose beads. Radioiodinated ligands, Lp(a), plasminogen, and K4, bound to the beads, and their interactions were inhibited by lysine analogues in a dose-dependent fashion. A series of omega-aminocarboxylic acids inhibited Lp(a), plasminogen, and K4 binding to the lysine-Sepharose beads, but marked differences in the effectiveness of these compounds were observed with each ligand. In this series of compounds, 6-aminohexanoic acid was the most potent inhibitor of binding to lysine-Sepharose for all three ligands. The pH had little effect on the inhibition of plasminogen binding by these compounds. For Lp(a), a low pH caused a marked decrease in inhibition by the 5-carbon and 4-carbon omega-amino acids. In addition, tranexamic acid was 750-fold more potent than lysine in inhibiting plasminogen and 55-fold more potent for K4 binding to the beads. In contrast, the differential potency of these compounds on Lp(a) binding was only 3-fold. These results suggest that the kringles of Lp(a) possess lysine binding functions which are similar, but not identical, to those of plasminogen and its K4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
