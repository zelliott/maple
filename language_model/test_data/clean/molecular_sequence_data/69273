Sequence analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified products from the presumed tetranucleotide repeat at the human beta-actin related pseudogene H-beta-Ac-psi-2 (ACTBP2) locus shows far greater variability in both PCR product length and sequence than has been previously reported. Alleles differing in size by 1 bp exist, and accurate sizing is required if the locus is to be used to its full potential.
