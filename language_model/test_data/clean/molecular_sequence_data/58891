We have previously reported on radiation-induction of ptk-3 in rat astrocyte culture [Sakuma et al. (1995) Radiat. Res. 143, 1-7]. Ptk-3 was considered to be a rat version of human DDR (discoidin domain receptor). We cloned and analyzed genomic DNA of the DDR and its promoter region. We discovered that the promoter region contained a consensus sequence of the p53 tumor suppressor binding site. Adenovirus-mediated p53 transfection induced a high level of DDR mRNA in SAOS2 human osteosarcoma cells. These results indicate that DDR is up-regulated by the p53 protein.
