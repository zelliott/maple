A new strategy is advanced for the conformational restriction of peptidyl immunogens. Our approach is to replace putative amide-amide hydrogen bonds with covalent hydrogen-bond mimics. Because on average every other amino acid in a protein engages in this bond, the syntheses of diversely shaped peptides can be contemplated. Synthetic methods for introducing a potential hydrogen-bond mimic into a peptide with alpha-helical potential is reported and the structural consequences are discussed. The replacement of the hydrogen bond with a chemical link will modify as well as shape the peptide. To explore the consequences of these changes, a potential synthetic vaccine for malaria, the repeating tetrapeptide Asn-Pro-Asn-Ala, was conformationally restricted. Antibodies to the shaped malarial peptide showed a strong cross reaction with Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites.
