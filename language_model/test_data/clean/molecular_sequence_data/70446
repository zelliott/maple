Seroepizootiologic surveys among wild rodents were carried out in Japan and Far East Russia in 1995 and 1996. Seropositive animals were only identified in Clethrionomys rufocanus (23/134) in Hokkaido, Japan. On the other hand, seropositives were identified in C. rufocanus (1/8), Apodemus agrarius (2/66), Apodemus spp. (2/26) and Microtus fortis (3/22) in Vladivostok, Far East Russia. Total RNA was isolated from lungs of seropositive animals and the S genome segments were amplified by PCR, cloned and sequenced. The S and M genomes of hantavirus, derived from Japanese C. rufocanus (Tobetsu genotype), were most closely related with Puumala viruses (76-79% nucleotide and 95% amino acid identities for S genome, 70-78% nucleotide and 87-92% amino acid identities for M genome). The recombinant nucleocapsid protein of Tobetsu genotype was antigenically quite similar with that of Sotkamo. These suggest that the virus endemic in Japanese C. rufocanus belongs to Puumala virus. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the genotype forms a distinct lineage within Puumala viruses. Partial S segment (1-1251 nt), derived from seropositive M. fortis in Vladivostok, was sequenced and analyzed. The S genome segment, which was designated Vladivostok genotype, was most closely related with Khabarovsk virus (79% nucleotide and 90% amino acid identities) which was isolated from M. fortis.
