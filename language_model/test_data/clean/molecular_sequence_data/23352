C4ST-1 (chondroitin 4-sulphotransferase-1) and C6ST-1 (chondroitin 6-sulphotransferase-1) transfer sulphate from PAPS (adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulphate) to positions 4 and 6 respectively of the GalNAc residues of chondroitin. We showed previously that C4ST-1 purified from rat chondrosarcoma and recombinant C4ST-1 both transfer sulphate efficiently to position 4 of the GalNAc residues of DSDS (desulphated dermatan sulphate). We report here the specificity of C4ST-1 and C6ST-1 in terms of uronic acid residue recognition around the GalNAc residue to which sulphate is transferred. When [35S]glycosaminoglycans formed from DSDS after incubation with [35S]PAPS and C4ST-1 were digested with chondroitinase ACII, a major part of the radioactivity was recovered in disaccharide fractions and the remainder distributed to tetrasaccharides and larger fractions, indicating that C4ST-1 mainly transferred sulphate to position 4 of the GalNAc residue located at the GlcA-GalNAc-GlcA sequence. Structural analysis of tetrasaccharide and larger oligosaccharide fractions indicated that C4ST-1 mainly transferred sulphate to the GalNAc residue adjacent to the reducing side of the GlcA residue. On the other hand, when [35S]glycosaminoglycans formed from DSDS after incubation with [35S]PAPS and C6ST-1 were digested with chondroitinase ACII, a major part of the radioactivity was recovered in fractions larger than hexasaccharides, indicating that C6ST-1 transferred sulphate to the GalNAc residues located in the L-iduronic acid-rich region. Structural analysis of the tetrasaccharide and larger oligosaccharide fractions indicated that C6ST-1 showed very little preference for the GalNAc residue neighbouring the GlcA residue. These results indicate that C4ST-1 and C6ST-1 differ from each other in the recognition of uronic acid residues adjacent to the targeted GalNAc residue.
