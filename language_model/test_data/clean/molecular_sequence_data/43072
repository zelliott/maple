Human prourokinase (pro-UK) cDNA without the signal peptide was obtained using synthetic oligonucleotide and DNA recombination techniques and was successfully expressed in E. coli. The plasmid pMMUK which contained pro-UK cDNA (including both the entire coding sequence and the sequence for signal peptide) was digested with Hind III and PstI, so that the N-terminal 371-bp fragment could be recovered. A 304-bp fragment was collected from the 371-bp fragment after partial digestion with Fnu4HI in order to remove the signal peptide sequence. An intermediate plasmid was formed after this 304-bp fragment and the synthetic oligonucleotide was ligated with pUC18. Correctness of the ligation was confirmed by enzyme digestion and sequencing. By joining the PstI-PstI fragment of pro-UK to the plasmid we obtained the final plasmid which contained the entire coding sequence of pro-UK without the signal peptide. The coding sequence with correct orientation was inserted into pBV220 under the control of the temperature-induced promoter PRPL, and mature pro-UK was expressed in E. coli at 42 degrees C. Both sonicated supernatant and inclusion bodies of the bacterial host JM101 showed positive results by ELISA and FAPA assays. After renaturation, the biological activity of the expressed product was increased from 500-1000IU/L to about 60,000IU/L. The bacterial pro-UK showed a molecular weight of about 47,000 daltons by Western blot analysis. It can be completely inhibited by UK antiserum but not by t-PA antiserum nor by normal rabbit serum.
