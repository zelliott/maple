Frequent outbreaks of the purulence disease of Chinese oak silkworm are reported in Middle and Northeast China. The disease is produced by the pathogen Antheraea pernyi nucleopolyhedrovirus (AnpeNPV). To obtain molecular information of the virus, the polyhedra of AnpeNPV were purified and characterized. The genomic DNA of AnpeNPV was extracted and digested with HindIII. The genome size of AnpeNPV is estimated at 128 kb. Based on the analysis of DNA fragments digested with HindIII, 23 fragments were bigger than 564 bp. A genomic library was generated using HindIII and the positive clones were sequenced and analysed. The gp64 gene, encoding the baculovirus envelope protein GP64, was found in an insert. The nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the AnpeNPV gp64 gene consists of a 1,530 nucleotide open reading frame (ORF), encoding a protein of 509 amino acids. Of the eight gp64 homologues, the AnpeNPV gp64 ORF shared the most sequence similarity with the gp64 gene of Anticarsia gemmatalis NPV, but not Bombyx mori NPV. The upstream region of the AnpeNPV gp64 ORF encoded the conserved transcriptional elements for early and late stage of the viral infection cycle. These results indicated that AnpeNPV belongs to group I NPV and was far removed in molecular phylogeny from the BmNPV.
