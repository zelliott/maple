The genomic sequence of the human CLN3 gene, which is defective in juvenile onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Batten disease) is being delineated using a variety of methods. A Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene, YHC3 (for Yeast Homologue to human CLN3), which is highly similar to the human disease gene, has been identified by computer-aided homology searching. Topology predictions indicate the CLN3 protein contains six transmembrane segments. Most similarity between the human and yeast proteins lies either in the transmembrane segments or along one face of the predicted protein structure.
