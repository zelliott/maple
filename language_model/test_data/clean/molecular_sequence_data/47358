We developed a polymerase chain reaction based approach using restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the mitochondrial cytochrome c-oxidase subunit I to identify nine genotypes (Trichinella spiralis, Trichinella britovi-European strains, Trichinella britovi-Japanese strains, Trichinella nativa, Trichinella nelsoni, Trichinella T5, Trichinella T6, Trichinella T8 and Trichinella pseudospiralis) in the genus Trichinella. Partial mitochondrial cytochrome c-oxidase subunit I genes of nine genotypes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, sequenced, and digested with three restriction endonucleases (Mse I, Alu I and Bsp1248 I). This polymerase chain reaction based restriction fragment length polymorphism method allowed the identification of Trichinella genotypes. Trichinella spiralis, Trichinella britovi-Japanese strains, Trichinella nelsoni, T5 and Trichinella pseudospiralis were distinguishable by digestion with Mse I. Trichinella britovi-European strains and Trichinella T8 were distinguishable by digestion using Alu I, and Trichinella nativa and Trichinella T6 were distinguishable by double-digestion with Mse I and Bsp1286 I. The results obtained with this polymerase chain reaction based restriction fragment length polymorphism assay confirmed those previously reported by others and support the separation of the Japanese isolates as a new genotype, namely Trichinella T9.
