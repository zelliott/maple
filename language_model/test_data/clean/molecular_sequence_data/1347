We analyzed 64 human metapneumovirus strains from eight countries. Phylogenetic analysis identified two groups (A and B, amino acid identity 93%-96%) and four subgroups. Although group A strains predominated, accounting for 69% of all strains, as many B as A strains were found in persons >3 years of age.
