GdX (also named Ubl4A) is a house-keeping gene located on the X chromosome and encodes a protein harboring an ubiquitin-like domain in human and mouse. Although identified in 1988, the function of GdX remains unknown. To elucidate the role of GdX in vivo, we generated a conditional GdX knockout mouse in which Exon 2 was flanked by two loxP sites. We obtained viable and fertile mice with homozygous GdX(flox/flox) or GdX(flox/Y) allele. Germ-line transmission was confirmed by crossing the mouse bearing conditionally targeted allele with an EIIα-Cre transgenic mouse. GdX was successfully depleted in tissues of EIIα-Cre-GdX-null mice. GdX(-/-) and GdX(-/Y) mice are viable and exhibit normal development compared with wild-type littermates within 6 months during our observation. We also observed that GdX knockout male mice were functionally normal in the reproductive system where Ubl4B was specifically expressed. GdX(flox/flox) and GdX(flox/Y) conditional mice provide a tool for further tissue-specific function analysis of the GdX protein under different conditions.
