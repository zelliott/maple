In previous studies aimed at the sequencing of peptides and proteins from the carboxy terminus, we have derivatized the C-terminus to a thiohydantoin using acetic anhydride and trimethylsilylisothiocyanate (TMS-ITC) and subsequently hydrolyzed it to form a shortened peptide capable of further degradation and an amino acid thiohydantoin which can be identified by reverse-phase HPLC. Current limitations to this chemistry include an inability to derivatize proline and low yields with asparagine and aspartic acid residues (Bailey et al., 1992). In an attempt to solve some of these problems, we have investigated the use of reagents other than acetic anhydride for the activation of the C-terminal carboxylic acid. These include 2-fluoro-1-methylpyridinium tosylate, 2-chloro-1-methylpyridinium iodide, and acetyl chloride. Addition of TMS-ITC to peptides activated by the 2-halo-pyridinium salts formed the expected peptidylthiohydantoin, but in addition formed a peptide chemically modified at the C-terminus which was blocked to C-terminal sequence analysis. This derivative was not obtained when either acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride was used for activation. Formation of this derivative was found to require the presence of an isothiocyanate reagent in addition to the halo-pyridinium salt. Sodium thiocyanate, TMS-ITC, and a new reagent for thiohydantoin synthesis, tributyltinisothiocyanate (TBSn-ITC), were all found to be capable of forming this analogue. Structural elucidation of the C-terminally modified amino acid revealed it to be a 2-imino-pyridinium analogue. Formation of this C-terminally blocked peptide could be minimized by the use of the 2-chloro-pyridinium reagent, rather than the 2-fluoro reagent, and by performing the reaction at a temperature of 50 degrees C or lower. The 2-halo-pyridinium reagents offer potential advantages over the use of acetic anhydride for activation of the C-terminal carboxylic acid. These include: milder reaction conditions, faster reaction times, and the ability to sequence through C-terminal aspartic acid. The TBSn-ITC reagent was found to be comparable to TMS-ITC for formation of peptidylthiohydantoins.
