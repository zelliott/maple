Exchange of organelle ATP with cytosolic ADP through the ADP/ATP carrier is a well-characterized feature of mitochondrial metabolism. Obligate intracellular bacteria, such as Rickettsia prowazekii, and higher-plant plastids possess another type of adenylate transporter, which exchanges bacterial or plastidic ADP for ATP from the eukaryotic (host cell) cytoplasm. The bacterial and plastidic transporters are similar but do not share significant sequence similarities with the mitochondrial carrier. Recent molecular and biochemical studies are providing deeper insight into the functional and evolutionary relationships between the bacterial and the plant transport proteins.
