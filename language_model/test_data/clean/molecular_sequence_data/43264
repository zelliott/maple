The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors E12 and E47 regulate cellular differentiation and proliferation in diverse cell types. While looking for proteins that bind to E12 and E47 by the yeast interaction trap, we isolated the rat (r) homologue of the human (h) polymyositis-scleroderma autoantigen (PM-Scl), which has been localized to the granular layer of the nucleolus and to distinct nucleocytoplasmic foci. The rPM-Scl and hPM-Scl homologues are 96% similar and 91% identical. We found that rPM-Scl mRNA expression was regulated by growth factor stimulation in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells. rPM-Scl bound to E12 and E47 but not to Id3, Gax, Myb, OCT-1, or Max. The C terminus of rPM-Scl (amino acids 283-353) interacted specifically with a 54-amino acid domain in E12 that is distinct from the bHLH domain. Finally, cotransfection of rPM-Scl and E47 specifically increased the promoter activity of a luciferase reporter construct containing an E box and did not affect the basal activity of the reporter construct. rPM-Scl appears to be a novel non-HLH-interacting partner of E12/E47 that regulates E2A protein transcription.
