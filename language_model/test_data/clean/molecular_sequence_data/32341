Microsatellites are useful tools to study the extent of divergence between two taxonomic groups that show high sequence similarity. We have compared microsatellite distribution to illustrate genetic variation between the two rice genomes, Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica and Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica. Microsatellite distribution proved to be non random as certain regions of very high microsatellite density have been identified. Microsatellite density in the subspecies japonica was computed marginally higher than in the subspecies indica in the genomic regions compared between the two subspecies. Unexpectedly high microsatellite densities were observed in 5'-untranslated regions of genes. These regions also displayed a clear motif bias. Some of the longest microsatellite repeats were found in intron sequences. Frequency, as well as motif bias was also noted with respect to the association of microsatellites with transposable elements. Microsatellite mutability values were exemplarily estimated for 90 loci by aligning the microsatellite containing regions between the two genomes. Poor rates of finding an orthologue corresponded with high microsatellite mutability in rice. These insights are likely to play a significant role in selecting microsatellite loci to be used in molecular breeding and studying evolutionary dynamics of the two subspecies.
