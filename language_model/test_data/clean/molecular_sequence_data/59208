Genomic sequences flanking the 5' end of the cDNA encoding isoform C beta 2 of the catalytic subunit of bovine cAMP-dependent protein kinase were cloned, sequenced and analyzed for promoter activity and transcription initiation sites. A region of 913 bp upstream the translation initiator ATG was amplified from genomic DNA by vectorette polymerase chain reaction. In primer extension reactions and RNase protection assays, residues C (at position -91), T (-71) and G (-70) were found to serve as transcription initiation sites of the gene. Amplification products and sub-fragments thereof were ligated upstream of the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase to test for promoter activity. Constructs were transiently transfected into a Chinese hamster ovary cell line which was shown to express endogenous C beta 2 mRNA. The genomic sequence upstream the C beta 2 cDNA does have promoter activity. The region from position -51 to -292 proved sufficient to drive efficient transcription of the reporter gene. The promoter is AT rich (68%), does not contain a TATA box within 50 bp upstream of the first initiation site and possesses putative binding sites for several transcription factors such as PEA-3 and a glucocorticoid receptor.
