Ketopatoate reductase (KPR) is the second enzyme in the pantothenate (vitamin B(5)) biosynthesis pathway, an essential metabolic pathway identified as a potential target for new antimicrobials. The sequence similarity among putative KPRs is limited and KPR itself belongs to a large superfamily of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases. Therefore, it is necessary to discriminate between true and other enzymes. In this paper, we describe a systematic analysis of putative KPRs in the context of this superfamily. Detailed structural analysis allowed us to define key residues for KPR activity and we classified eight structural genomics structures of the KPR family into four functional subclasses. We proposed a semi-automatic protocol, using sequence-structure homology recognition scores, for assigning KPR and related proteins to these subclasses and applied it to a representative set of 103 completely sequenced bacterial genomes. A similar approach can be applied to other enzyme families, which would aid the correct identification of drug targets and help design novel specific inhibitors.
