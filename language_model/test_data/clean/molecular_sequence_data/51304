The bovine gene for the p21ras protein activator (RASA) includes in its 5' untranslated region a (TG)n repeat. Analysis of this (TG)n repeat by PCR amplification of genomic DNA revealed a four-allele polymorphism. A cDNA probe was used to assign RASA to the region 2.4-qter of bovine Chromosome (Chr) 7 by in situ hybridization. PCR analysis of a panel of somatic hybrid lines allowed the assignment of RASA to the unassigned syntenic group 22 (U22) and thus localizes U22 on Chr 7.
