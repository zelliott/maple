Differential display technique was used to study the gene expression of Tamarix androssowii treated with NaHCO(3) solution. Seventeen differentially expressed genes were obtained through Northern detection. The result of BLASTX analysis shows that two of these genes (GenBank accession number CD028574 and CD028579) are homologous to the F-box protein family member, which can regulate diverse cellular processes, including cell cycle transition, transcription regulation and signal transduction, by playing roles in Skp1p-cullin-F-box protein (SCF) complexes or non-SCF complexes. F-box protein plays a very important role in plant defence system. One gene (GenBank accession number CD028589) is highly homologous to the translation initiation factor eIF, which regulates the proteins translation and is an important determinant of sodium tolerance in yeast and plants. Additionally, two genes (GenBank accession numbers CD028584 and CD028586) that are homologous to secretory peroxidase and peroxidases were identified, peroxidases are familiar proteins expressed in plant under stress. Five new genes closely related to salt and alkali resistance were obtained, which were expressed quite differentially when treated by NaHCO(3) solution. Seven differentially expressed genes were obtained which have highly or some homologous to the known genes, their function in stress need to be further studied. These seventeen genes were accepted as novel cDNA sequences by GenBank and were given them new accession numbers, their accession numbers were CD028574- CD028581 and CD028583-CD028591.
