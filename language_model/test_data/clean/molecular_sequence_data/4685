A DNA containing bacteriophage, Kvp1, was isolated from the water of a very polluted river, the Matanza river, near the central district of Buenos Aires City. This bacteriophage infects bacteria belonging to the Kluyvera cryocrescens species (strain 21 g) isolated from the same river. Kvp1 is a lytic bacteriophage and its propagation characteristics are: burst size 30, latent period 13 min and rise period 10 min. Morphologically, Kvp1 is a small icosahedral bacteriophage, 59.1 nm in diameter, which possesses a short wedge-shaped tail. Its buoyant density in ClCs is 1.517 g/cm3. Kvp1 DNA is linear, double stranded and approximately 40,000 bp in size. The viral particle is composed of at least nine proteins. SDS-PAGE patterns of these proteins and of those produced during the host infection, in addition to its morphological and genomic characteristics, suggested that Kvp1 is similar to the coliphage T7. Molecular cloning, sequencing and computer-assisted analysis of Kvp1 DNA fragments confirmed the relationship to the coliphage. Taking this into account, the partial sequence of the phage RNA polymerase was used to construct phylogenetic relationships between Kvp1 and other related phages. To our knowledge, Kvp1 is the first bacteriophage described which uses as host a member of the Kluyvera bacterial genus.
