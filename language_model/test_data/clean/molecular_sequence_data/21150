Among the commercially cultivated Brassicaceae (Cruciferae) plants, Brassica juncea, Brassica napus, Brassica rapa, and Sinapis alba store significant amounts of oil and protein in the seed. At present, Brassica seed proteins are primarily used for livestock feeding based on the nutritional value. The point of curiosity is whether the present knowledge on the protein structure, biochemical characteristics, nutritive value, and the recovery processes are inadequate to develop Brassica proteins into a usable plant protein source or these proteins are of substandard for uses beyond animal nutrition applications. Cruciferin (11S) and napin (2S) are the predominant storage proteins of Brassicaceae seeds that contribute to different properties and functions. A gamut of information is available on the chemistry, nutritional value, as well as the functionality in foods, and associated non-protein components of canola/rapeseed storage proteins. The intention of this article is to critically review what is known about the predominant storage proteins of commercially produced Brassicaceae seeds relative to the above aspects and identify the knowledge gaps.
