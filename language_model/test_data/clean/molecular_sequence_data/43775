Work in our laboratory has shown that in addition to previously characterized changes in the level of neuropeptides in SDAT brain, the activity of degradative enzymes responsible for peptide metabolism is also affected. In addition to other reported alterations in peptide metabolism, we have observed that SS-28 degradation is increased in Brodmann area 22 whereas substance P degradation is increased in temporal cortex. Changes in the degradation of these neuropeptides known to be affected in SDAT correlate well with alterations in the activity of specific neuropeptidases. Trypsin-like serine protease activity is increased in SDAT Brodmann area 22 which parallels the increased degradation of SS-28. The activity of MEP 24.15 is decreased in temporal cortex which corresponds to the decreased degradation of substance P. Changes in the activity of these degradative enzymes in SDAT brain can potentially affect the action of other neuropeptide substrates because the neuropeptidases discussed here terminate the action of several neuropeptides. As more neuropeptide and degradative peptidase alterations are discovered in SDAT, greater emphasis may be placed on the role that peptides and neuropeptidases play in the progression of SDAT.
