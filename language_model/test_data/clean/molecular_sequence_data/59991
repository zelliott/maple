The human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein is an ATP-dependent drug pump that extrudes a broad range of cytotoxic agents from the cell. Its physiological role may be to protect the body from endogenous and exogenous cytotoxic agents. The protein has clinical importance because it contributes to the phenomenon of multidrug resistance during chemotherapy. In this review, we discuss some of the results obtained by using molecular biology and protein chemistry techniques for studying this important and intriguing protein.
