The cell-surface proteins of the infective bacteria Streptococcus and Staphylococcus are probably involved in the process of infection. These proteins share many features including secretion signal peptides, cell-wall spanning regions, membrane anchor domains and repeated domains of various functions. These common features may have evolved by gene duplication and swapping of gene fragments.
