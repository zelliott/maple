Perkinsus species are destructive parasites of commercial Manila clams, Venerupis philippinarum, in Japan, Korea, and Spain. However, in vitro parasite cultures from this important host clam are not available. Tissues of Manila clams collected during April 2002 in Gokasho Bay, Japan harbored Perkinsus sp. parasites at a 97% prevalence (28/29) of moderate- and high-intensity infections. Perkinsus sp. cells in tissue samples were enlarged in alternative Ray's fluid thioglycollate medium, before propagation in DME:Ham's F-12 Perkinsus sp. culture medium. Enlarged parasite hypnospores zoosporulated at high frequencies to release motile zoospores, which gave rise to continuous schizogonic cell lines that also zoosporulated continuously at low frequencies. Four Perkinsus sp. in vitro isolates comprising two distinct morphotypes were cryopreserved, cloned, and archived for public distribution. For three isolates of one morphotype, nucleotide sequences of the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region, of the large subunit rRNA gene, and of actin genes, were consistent with those reported for P. olseni. Similar sequences from one morphologically unique isolate differed from those of all described Perkinsus species. These results show that at least two Perkinsus spp. infect Japanese Manila clams, and that one represents a new species, Perkinsus honshuensis n. sp.
