A novel bacterial strain, designated P4(T), was isolated from Permian groundwater and identified on the basis of its phylogenetic, genotypic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic characteristics. Cells were aerobic, Gram-stain-negative rods. 16S rRNA gene sequence-based phylogenetic analysis revealed that P4(T) is affiliated with the family Flammeovirgaceae in the phylum Bacteroidetes, but forms a distinct cluster within this family. The DNA G+C content of strain P4(T) was 45.2 mol%. The predominant cellular fatty acids were C16 : 1ω6c/C16 : 1ω7c and iso-C15 : 0. MK-7 was the main respiratory quinone. The polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, unidentified phospholipids, an unidentified aminolipid, unidentified glycolipids and unidentified polar lipids. Based on our extensive polyphasic analysis, a novel species in a new genus, Imperialibacter roseus gen. nov., sp. nov., is proposed. The type strain of Imperialibacter roseus is P4(T) ( = CICC 10659(T) = KCTC 32399(T)).
