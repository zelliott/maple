To study the role of the signal sequences in the biogenesis of outer membrane proteins, we have constructed two hybrid genes: a phoE-ompF hybrid gene, which encodes the signal sequence of outer membrane PhoE protein and the structural sequence of outer membrane OmpF protein, and a bla-phoE hybrid gene which encodes the signal sequence as well as 158 amino acids of the structural sequence of the periplasmic enzyme beta-lactamase and the complete structural sequence of PhoE protein. The products of these genes are normally transported to and assembled into the outer membrane These results show: (i) that signal sequences of exported proteins are export signals which function independently of the structural sequence, and (ii) that the information which determines the ultimate location of an outer membrane protein is located in the structural sequence of this protein, and not in the signal sequence.
