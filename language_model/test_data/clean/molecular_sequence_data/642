The oceanic islands of Macaronesia provide an ideal temporal and spatial context to test hypotheses of plant evolution using a novel set of phylogenetic markers, Delta(6)-desaturase sequences. In contrast to the limited resolution of standard molecular markers (nrDNA and plastid sequences), the Delta(6)-desaturase sequence phylogeny of Echium unequivocally reconstructs its active colonization across islands and archipelagos (Madeira, the Canary Islands, and Cape Verde), as well as its subsequent geographical and ecological speciation. Molecular-clock estimates using penalized likelihood and Bayesian inference reveal two radiation processes coincident with two dramatic climatic changes recorded in the region: the advent of the cold Canarian sea current (ca. 4 Ma) and the establishment of a strong seasonality in the Pleistocene (1.8 Ma). Though Echium had available all the diversity of present-day Macaronesian environments (xeric and mesic scrub, laurisilva, pine forest, and subalpine habitats) in the Miocene, evolutionary divergence appears to have been triggered by an extension of fluctuating xeric and mesic habitats with the advent of Pliocene conditions. These Echium radiations not only fulfill traditional predictions of adaptive radiation (i.e., common ancestry, rapid speciation, and phenotype-environment correlation), but also, uniquely among Macaronesian species, trait utility of woodiness. A Pliocene transition from annuality to a bush or tree-like condition occurred in early Echium lineages. Maintenance of woodiness in major lineages, and reversal to an herbaceous condition by three independent events, is reported for the first time in plants of oceanic islands.
