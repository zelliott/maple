We have examined neutral glycosphingolipid (Ngsl) expression in embryonic (E), post-natal (P) and adult rodent brain employing digoxigenin immunostaining (DIG-IS) and anti-Ngsl antisera (both monospecific polyclonal and monoclonal) directed toward specific carbohydrates. Several previously unknown long-chain (-CHO = or > 4) Ngsls have been identified. Four Ngsls have been purified and characterized as GgOse4Cer or GA1, Galactosyl beta 1-3globoside, Fuc alpha 1-3nLcOse4Cer or Lewis X (Le(x)) and a novel GalNAc beta 1-4GA1. A few transient bands appear at different developmental ages. Several fast migrating cerebrosides have also been identified during the early phase of active myelination and tentatively characterized as derivatives of galactosylceramide. Immunohistochemical localization of GA1, Le(x) and GalNAc-GA1 in adult rodent brain shows unique and specific cellular topographies of these carbohydrate antigens.
