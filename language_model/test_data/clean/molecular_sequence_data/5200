Using functional complementation with a Schizosaccharomyces pombe genomic library, we have isolated a clone complementing a G1/S phase progression defective mutant. The newly isolated temperature-sensitive mutant, cyj150, showed elongated morphology at a restrictive temperature of 36 degrees C and DNA content analysis of the mutant indicated a defect in cell cycle progression at the G1/S phase. Sequence analysis of the genomic and cDNA clones complementing this elongated phenotype at 36 degrees C show that it encodes a protein that has 50% amino acid identity with dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and garden pea. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of S. pombe dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (dld1+) with glutathione reductase and mercuric reductase revealed extensive homologies throughout the primary sequence and protein structure, and contained amino acid sequences of the active site region conserved from prokaryote to higher eukaryote. Gene disruption and tetrad analysis showed that dld1+ is an essential gene for cell viability. Northern analysis indicates that transcriptional expression of this gene is not fluctuated according to the cell cycle. However, it is certain that malfunction of this Dld1 protein blocks the progression of cell cycle from G1 to S phase. The sequence of the dld1+ gene is available in EMBL/GenBank under Accession Number L40360.
