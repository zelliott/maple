In this study, a method for oligonucleotide directed in vitro mutagenesis was described. It includes the following steps: clone of the gene to be mutated into the phagemid pGCI; preparation of single strand template; design and synthesis of mutated oligonucleotides; synthesis of double strand DNA. Using this method, a new BamHI site was originated at the N terminal of Stx-B and BglII site at the C terminal of Stx-B. It is ready to fuse the Stx-B gene to LamB. This method is a very useful tool for genetic engineering.
