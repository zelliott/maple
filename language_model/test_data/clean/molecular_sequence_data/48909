We present the first case of phaeohyphomycosis caused by Rhinocladiella basitona (R. basitona) in China and describe the mycological characteristics of this pathogen. A 11-year-old girl was presented with plaque on her face for 3 years. Diagnosis was based on histopathology, mycology, and molecular identification. The patient was treated with terbinafine and itraconazole. This case is the second of phaeohyphomycosis caused by R. basitona in the world (previously belonging to Geniculosporium).
