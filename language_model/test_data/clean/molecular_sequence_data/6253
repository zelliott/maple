Automatic solid phase peptide synthesis using the SynChrom system is described. Problems of swellographic monitoring are discussed. Combined monitoring (swellographic, spectrophotometric, and manometric) of all steps of the synthetic cycle are suggested. Potential applications of the system to liquid column chromatography were demonstrated.
