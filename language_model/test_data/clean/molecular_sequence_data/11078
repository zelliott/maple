PGs are important regulators of reproductive processes. At the time ofluteolysis in vivo, PGF2alpha is produced by endometrial cells, in response to oxytocin (OT). The mechanism by which OT induces the release of PGF2alpha remains to be defined. We have used 13 different cultures of bovine epithelial endometrial cells to study the effect of OT on the regulation of PGF2alpha and to identify the possible involvement of cyclooxygenases (COXs). OT induced a dose-dependent increase of both inositol phosphates (IPs) and [Ca2+]i concentration in epithelial cells labeled with [3H]-myoinositol or loaded with fura-2 (using a fluorescent microscope imaging system), respectively. OT induced a dose-dependent increase of both PGF2alpha production and COX-2 gene expression (as demonstrated by RT-PCR and Northern blots). PGF2alpha production was increased from 13.3 +/- 2.0 to 166.8 +/- 22.5 ng/ml (P < 0.0001). On the other hand, COX-2/beta-actin mRNA gene expression (as determined by densitometric analysis) was increased 5.1 +/- 0.7-fold (P < 0.001) with OT (10[-7] M) treatment, compared with control. Addition of indomethacin (1 microM) and a specific COX-2 inhibitor (NS-398, 1 microM) blocked the OT-induced PGF2alpha production. COX-1 and phospholipase A2 mRNA were expressed at steady-state levels, but no effect of OT was detected on their regulation. Combined to OT, 10 microq/ml of recombinant ovine interferon-tau (roIFN-tau) was able to decrease significantly (P < 0.0001) the dose-dependent increase of PGF2alpha production. Furthermore, partial bovine COX-1 (777 pb) and COX-2 (449 bp) cDNAs were cloned and sequenced. An homology of 83% and 97% was found in relation with rat and sheep, for COX-1, respectively. COX-2 was found to bear 84%, 86%, and 87% of homology in relation to rat, guinea pig, and human, respectively. Collectively, these results demonstrate, for the first time, that COX-2 is involved in the mechanism by which OT regulates PGF2alpha production in the endometrium.
