We describe a gene, NM23, that is associated with the tumor metastatic process. NM23 RNA levels were highest in cells and tumors of relatively low metastatic potential in two experimental systems: (1) murine K-1735 melanoma cell lines, in which the gene was identified, and (2) N-nitroso-N-methylurea-induced rat mammary carcinomas. NM23 RNA levels did not correlate with cell sensitivity to host immunological responses and may, therefore, be associated with intrinsic aggressiveness. The predicted carboxy-terminal protein sequence encoded by the pNM23 cDNA clone is novel compared with Genebank animal, bacterial, and viral sequences.
