A detailed analysis of substrate selectivity within the cytochrome P450 2 (CYP2) family is reported. From a consideration of specific interactions between drug substrates for human CYP2 family enzymes and the putative active sites of CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1, it is likely that the number and disposition of hydrogen bond donor/acceptors and aromatic rings within the various P450 substrate molecules determines their enzyme selectivity and binding affinity, together with directing their preferred routes of metabolism by the CYP2 enzymes concerned. Although many aliphatic residues are present in most P450 active sites, it would appear that their main contribution centers around hydrophobic interactions and desolvation processes accompanying substrate binding. Molecular modeling studies based on the recent CYP2C5 crystal structure appear to show close agreement with site-directed mutagenesis experiments and with information on substrate metabolism and selectivity within the CYP2 family.
