Farber disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the acid ceramidase enzyme, leading to the accumulation of ceramide in various tissues. It usually manifests within a few months after birth with a unique triad of symptoms, including painful and progressive deformed joints, progressive hoarseness and subcutaneous nodules. The disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, and mutations in the N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase (ASAH1) gene, which codes for the acid ceramidase enzyme, have been shown to cause the disease. In the current study, we report the identification of a novel disease-causing mutation in the ASAH1 gene that results in Farber disease in an Indian family. The mutation was identified in the eighth exon and is a missense mutation resulting in replacement of Valine by Leucine at codon 182. Two affected siblings harboured the identical mutation. The possible mechanism(s) of disease caused by this mutation are discussed.
