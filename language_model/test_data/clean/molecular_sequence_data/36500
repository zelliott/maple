Examination of the regulation of prodynorphin (pro-DYN) promoter activity is limited by the absence of a good cell model. The discovery of pro-DYN mRNA and derived peptides in the reproductive tract led us to examine the cellular localization and hormonal regulation of ovarian pro-DYN expression and to evaluate normal granulosa cells as a model for studying pro-DYN gene regulation. Ovarian pro-DYN mRNA levels were significantly elevated in PMSG-primed immature rats 12-24 h after receiving an ovulatory dose of hCG. Levels peaked 2 days after hCG, remained elevated throughout the ensuing pseudopregnancy, and rose again at the end of pseudopregnancy. In situ hybridization localized pro-DYN expression predominantly to granulosa and luteal cells. Transfection of primary cultures of granulosa cells revealed that the activity of the rat pro-DYN promoter [-1858 to 133 base pairs (bp)] was increased 18- to 19-fold by hCG and human FSH treatments and 7-fold by cAMP analog treatment. Deletion analysis identified a 358 bp fragment as the primary hormone-responsive sequence (-1858 to -1500 bp; containing three potential cAMP-responsive elements); its deletion resulted in severely reduced FSH responsiveness, and its ligation to hormone-unresponsive basal promoter sequences completely restored FSH responsiveness. This is an unusually distal position for cAMP-responsive elements compared to other cAMP-regulated genes. These data demonstrate specific expression of pro-DYN in granulosa and luteal cells, which is under sensitive gonadotropin regulation, and identify a distal hormone-responsive sequence within the promoter.
