Perchlike fish are a vast group of advanced teleosts. The species examined to date have three forms of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) within a single species, but the origin of the third GnRH peptide is unknown. In this study, the primary structure of three GnRH peptides is determined from the brain of the pacu, Piaractus mesopotamicus, an example of a teleost that is less advanced than the perchlike fish. The GnRH was purified from pacu brain extracts using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and radioimmunoassay (RIA). The three forms identified by chemical sequencing and mass spectrometry are sea bream GnRH (pGlu-His-Trip-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Ser -Pro-Gly-NH2, 1113.4 Da); chicken GnRH-II (pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-His-Gly-Trp-Tyr-Pro-Gly-NH2, 1236.6 Da); and salmon GnRH (pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Trp-Leu-Pro-Gly-NH2, 1212.3 Da). In addition the number of forms of GnRH in the brains of male and female fish was determined separately. The same three forms of GnRH were present in the brains of both sexes as determined by antisera cross-reactivity and elution position from the HPLC column. The results indicate that the pacu brain has the identical forms of GnRH identified in perchlike fish and hence, the origin of three forms occurred earlier in evolution than previously thought.
