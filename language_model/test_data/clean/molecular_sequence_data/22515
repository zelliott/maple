We determined the optimal conditions for high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAE-PAD) of oligosaccharides (OS) released from neisserial lipooligosaccharides (LOS) by mild acid hydrolysis. We efficiently obtained detailed composition, sequence, and linkage information about high Mr LOS. We found that HPAE-PAD can discriminate isobaric (same Mr) molecules of different structure, for example, nLc4 and Gb4, distinguish alpha from beta chain extensions, and determine the number of phosphoethanolamine (PEA) substituents. HPAE-PAD provided quantitative information that could be used to compare the relative abundances of OS. We used HPAE-PAD to identify all of the known LOS alpha chain antennae. When used with antibody-binding profiles and exoglycosidase digestion results, HPAE-PAD can provide nearly complete structures rapidly.
