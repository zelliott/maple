To assess the feasibility of high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis for screening patients with neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD).

Based on previous studies on SLC25A13 gene in Chinese patients with NICCD, four hotspot mutations (851del4, 1638ins23, IVS6+5G>A and IVS16ins3kb) were selected. Results of the HRM analysis was validated using 50 negative controls and 20 patients with NICCD whose genotypes were confirmed previously by direct sequencing. With the established protocol, 171 suspected patients were enrolled. Samples with abnormal melting curves were further validated by DNA sequencing.

HRM analysis can accurately determine the genotypes of all negative controls and patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the technique reached 100% (70/70). The melting curves of samples with the same genotype were highly reproducible. In 171 suspected patients, seven NICCD patients were detected by HRM. Identified mutations have included one case of 851del4 homozygote, one case of IVS6+5G>A heterozygote, 3 cases of 851del4 heterozygotes, one case of [IVS6+5G>A]+[ 851del4] and one case of [1638ins23+IVS16ins3kb]+[1638ins23]. All mutations were subsequently confirmed by DNA sequencing.

HRM analysis is a convenient, high-throughput and rapid technique for the screening of NICCD patients.
