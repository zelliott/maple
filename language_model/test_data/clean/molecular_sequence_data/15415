Melanocortin system consists of native melanocortin peptides (ACTH, MSH and their fragments), melanocortin receptors (MC1R-MC5R) and their endogenous antagonists. Melanocortins have a wide spectrum of physiological activity. These peptides improve memory and attention, facilitate neuromuscular regeneration, exert neuroprotective action, affect the development of nervous system, modulate sexual behavior, have anti-inflammatory and antipyretic effects, interact with opioid system, affect the pain sensitivity and cardiovascular system, decrease food intake and body weight, influence on exocrine secretions.
