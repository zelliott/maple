The aim of this paper is to gather and complete data about four members of a new gene family. Mutation in SUR4 gene was originally selected as a suppressor of defects caused by mutations in RVS161 or RVS167 genes. Cloning and sequencing of the SUR4 gene were performed. The deduced protein contains six putative transmembrane domains. Sequence comparison revealed that two yeast genes, FEN1 and JO343, shared significant similarities with SUR4. Mutants for SUR4 and FEN1 have the same pleiotropic phenotype, including bud localization defects, resistance to an immunosuppressor and resistance to ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors. The double inactivation of SUR4 and FEN1 genes is lethal. These data and other aspects implicating SUR4 in glucose metabolism, suggest an involvement of these genes in the dynamics of cortical actin cytoskeleton in response to nutrient availability. Moreover, the existence of a fourth homologous gene in C. elegans extends the family to pluricellular organisms.
