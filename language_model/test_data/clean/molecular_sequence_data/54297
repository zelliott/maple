Compounds inhibiting LpxC in the lipid A biosynthetic pathway are promising leads for novel antibiotics against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. We report the syntheses and structural and biochemical characterizations of LpxC inhibitors based on a diphenyl-diacetylene (1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadiyne) threonyl-hydroxamate scaffold. These studies provide a molecular interpretation for the differential antibiotic activities of compounds with a substituted distal phenyl ring as well as the absolute stereochemical requirement at the C2, but not C3, position of the threonyl group.
