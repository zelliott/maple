Chemical synthesis of A, B, and H (type 3) human blood group determinant oligosaccharides (as R-glycosides, R = OCH2CH2CH2NHCOCF3) and their polymeric derivatives are reported. 4,6; 4',6'-Di-O-benzylidene derivative of Gal beta 1----3GalNAc alpha 1----R was chloroacetylated selectively at 3'-OH, the chloroacetate was alpha-fucosylated and dechloroacetylated to give protected H (type 3) trisaccharide bearing free 3'-OH. alpha-Glycosylation of the trisaccharide with 2-azido-3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-beta-D-galactopyranosyl chloride and 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzyl-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl bromide gave rise to protected A and B tetrasaccharides, respectively. Deprotected R-glycosides were converted to OCH2CH2CH2NH2 derivatives. Their reaction with poly(4-nitrophenylacrylate) affords polyacrylamide-coupled conjugates with A, B, and H (type 3) specificity.
