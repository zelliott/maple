The interaction of erythropoietin (Epo) with the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) supports erythropoiesis. The EpoR is a member of the well-recognized cytokine receptor superfamily characterized by four conserved cysteines and a WSXWS domain in the extracellular portion of the molecule. To localize ligand-binding determinants of the EpoR near the WSXWS domain, we tested the ligand-binding ability of the wild-type human EpoR extracellular domain (EREx), two truncated and three chimeric constructs with the interleukin-2 receptor beta subunit (IL2R beta). Constructs were expressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins linked to a solid-phase support and assayed for binding to 125I Epo. As previously shown, Epo bound specifically to the expressed extracellular domain, EREx. Epo did not bind to truncated receptors lacking either the entire fifth exon or the WSXWS domain. Epo also did not bind to chimeric receptors that had the amino acids encoded by the fifth exon replaced by IL2R beta or that had the amino acids subsequent to asparagine residue 209 replaced by IL2R beta. Specific binding was demonstrated for a construct in which the WSXWS was replaced by that of IL2R beta. We conclude that the amino acids encoded by this 5' portion of exon 5 of the EpoR are necessary for ligand binding and that the WSXWS domain is necessary for Epo binding but is not involved in ligand-binding specificity. We also speculate that if the putative soluble form of the EpoR is expressed (predicted to lack exon 5), it does not bind Epo and therefore may serve a physiologic purpose other than ligand binding.
