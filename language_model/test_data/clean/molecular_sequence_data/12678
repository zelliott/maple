We report the identification of an open reading frame in a serogroup B isolate of Neisseria meningitidis that exhibits high nucleotide and predicted amino acid identity with the fpg gene of Escherichia coli, and its product, formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fapy-DNA glycosylase), a DNA repair enzyme. We further show that the meningococcal fpg is co-transcribed with nlaA, encoding a lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, and suggest that the DNA repair enzyme may be involved in the regulation of nlaA or its gene product.
