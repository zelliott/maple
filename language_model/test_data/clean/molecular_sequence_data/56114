Substrains of Mycobacterium bovis BCG have been divided in two major groups, high producers and low producers of the secreted proteins MPB64 and MPB70. Of these, Mycobacterium tuberculosis secretes only the analog MPT64 during growth on Sauton medium. It has been confirmed that high-producer and low-producer substrains of BCG as well as M. tuberculosis contain the gene for the MPB/MPT70 protein. By contrast, polymerase chain reaction and hybridization experiments are reported here which indicate that the MPB64 gene is absent in the BCG substrains Copenhagen, Pasteur, Glaxo, and Tice, in which previous methods did not permit distinction between secretion of small amounts or absence of the protein in culture fluids.
