The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) protease and its substrate, ICP35, are involved in the assembly of viral capsids and required for efficient viral growth. The full-length protease (Pra) consists of 635 amino acid (aa) residues and is autoproteolytically processed at the release (R) site and the maturation (M) site, releasing the catalytic domain No (VP24), Nb (VP21), and a 25-aa peptide. To understand the biological importance of cleavage at these sites, we constructed several mutations in the cloned protease gene. Transfection assays were performed to determine the functional properties of these mutant proteins by their abilities to complement the growth of the protease deletion mutant m100. Our results indicate that (i) expression of full-length protease is not required for viral replication, since a 514-aa protease molecule lacking the M site could support viral growth; and that (ii) elimination of the R site by changing the residue Ala-247 to Ser abolished viral replication. To better understand the functions that are mediated by proteolytic processing at the R site of the protease, we engineered an HSV-1 recombinant virus containing a mutation at this site. Analysis of the mutant A247S virus demonstrated that (i) the mutant protease retained the ability to cleave at the M site and to trans process ICP35 but failed to support viral growth on Vero cells, demonstrating that release of the catalytic domain No from Pra is required for viral replication; and that (ii) only empty capsid structures were observed by electron microscopy in thin sections of A247S-infected Vero cells, indicating that viral DNA was not encapsidated. Our results demonstrate that processing of ICP35 is not sufficient to support viral replication and provide genetic evidence that the HSV-1 protease has nuclear functions other than enzymatic activity.
