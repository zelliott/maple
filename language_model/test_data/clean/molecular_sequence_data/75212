Four solid-colour revertants were isolated from the highly variegated niv-53::Tam1 mutant, in which the transposable element Tam1 is integrated in the promoter region of the chalcone synthase (chs) gene. DNA sequence analysis revealed that in all four lines the Tam1 element was deleted together with flanking nucleotides of the chs promoter. In one case the TATA box of the chs gene was removed resulting in extremely low expression of the gene, and initiation of transcription occurring at a new position. The other three deletions defined a sequence motif (TAC-CAT) which is apparently required for maximal gene expression. Thus transposable elements seem to be useful for probing gene structure, in this case the signal structure in the promoter region, by virtue of imprecise excision.
