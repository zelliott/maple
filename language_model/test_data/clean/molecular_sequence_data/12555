The mucin gene, Muc-1, encodes a high molecular weight integral membrane glycoprotein that is present on the apical surface of most simple secretory epithelial cells. Muc-1 is highly expressed and aberrantly glycosylated by most carcinomas and metastatic lesions. Numerous functions have been proposed for this molecule, including protection of the epithelial cell surface, an involvement in epithelial organogenesis, and a role in tumor progression. Mice deficient in Muc-1 were generated using homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. These mice appeared to develop normally and were healthy and fertile. However, the growth rate of primary breast tumors induced by polyoma middle T antigen was found to be significantly slower in Muc-1 deficient mice. This suggests that Muc-1 plays an important role in the progression of mammary carcinoma.
