ADR1 is a transcription factor required for activation of the glucose-repressible alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (ADH2) gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. ADR1 has two zinc finger domains between amino acids 102 and 159, and it binds to an upstream activation sequence (UAS1) in the ADH2 promoter. A functional dissection of ADR1 was performed by using a series of amino- and carboxy-terminal deletion mutants of ADR1, most of which were fused to the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase. These deletion mutants were assayed for binding to UAS1 in vitro, for the ability to activate ADH2 transcription in vivo, and for level of expression. Deletion of ADR1 amino acids 150 to 172 and 76 to 98 eliminated DNA binding in vitro, which accounted for the loss of transcriptional activation in vivo. Results with the former deletion mutant indicated that both of the ADR1 zinc fingers are necessary for sequence-specific DNA binding. Results with the latter deletion mutant suggested that at least part of the sequence between amino acids 76 to 98, in addition to the two finger domains, is required for high-affinity DNA binding. The smallest fusion protein able to activate ADH2 transcription, containing ADR1 amino acids 76 to 172, was much less active in vivo than was the longest fusion protein containing amino acids 1 to 642 of ADR1. In addition, multiple regions of the ADR1 polypeptide (including amino acids 40 to 76, 260 to 302, and 302 to 505), which are required for full activation of ADH2, were identified. An ADR1-beta-galactosidase fusion protein containing only the amino-terminal 16 amino acids of ADR1 was present at a much higher level than were larger fusion proteins, which suggested that the sequences within ADR1 influence the expression of the gene fusion.
