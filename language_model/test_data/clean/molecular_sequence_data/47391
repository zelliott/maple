We report here the characterization of the catalytic component (ISP(NAR)) of a new naphthalene dioxygenase from Rhodococcus sp. strain NCIMB12038. The genes encoding the two subunits of ISP(NAR) are not homologous to their previously characterized counterparts in Pseudomonas. The deduced amino acid sequences have only 33 and 29% identity with the corresponding subunits in Pseudomonas putida NCIB 9816-4, for which the tertiary structure has been reported.
