Variola and vaccinia viruses, the two most important members of the family Poxviridae, are known to encode homologs of the human complement regulators named smallpox inhibitor of complement enzymes (SPICE) and vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP), respectively, to subvert the host complement system. Intriguingly, consistent with the host tropism of these viruses, SPICE has been shown to be more human complement-specific than VCP, and in this study we show that VCP is more bovine complement-specific than SPICE. Based on mutagenesis and mechanistic studies, we suggest that the major determinant for the switch in species selectivity of SPICE and VCP is the presence of oppositely charged residues in the central complement control modules, which help enhance their interaction with factor I and C3b, the proteolytically cleaved form of C3. Thus, our results provide a molecular basis for the species selectivity in poxviral complement regulators.
