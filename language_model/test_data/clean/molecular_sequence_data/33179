A yellow-pigmented bacterium was isolated from blood of a 3-year-old boy in GÃ¶teborg, Sweden. Comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that this bacterium is most closely related to Luteibacter rhizovicinus LJ96(T) and Dyella yeojuensis R2A16-10(T), with sequence similarity of 98.3 % to both. Strain CCUG 25036(T) is clearly different from L. rhizovicinus CCUG 50033(T) and also from D. yeojuensis DSM 17673(T) in that DNA-DNA hybridization revealed relatedness of 33.7 and 29.8 %, respectively. Strain CCUG 25036(T) is further distinguished from L. rhizovicinus CCUG 50033(T) and D. yeojuensis DSM 17673(T) by being able to use d-mannose, d-mannitol and gluconate as sole carbon sources and by lacking the ability to use maltose or sucrose as sole carbon sources. The name Luteibacter anthropi sp. nov. is proposed for this novel species, with the type strain CCUG 25036(T) (=CCM 7598(T)). The proposal is also made to reclassify Dyella yeojuensis as Luteibacter yeojuensis comb. nov., with the type strain R2A16-10(T) (=DSM 17673(T) =KACC 11405(T)).
