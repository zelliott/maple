The growth regulatory functions of a family of structurally related polypeptides are mediated through the membrane-bound epidermal growth factor receptor molecule. This ligand family includes epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha, amphiregulin, and polypeptides encoded by several poxviruses. The structural and functional properties that are characteristic of the ligand family provide a basis for possible evolutionary relationships among the various ligands.
