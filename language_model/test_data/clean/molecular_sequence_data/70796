Pasteurella pneumotropica is an opportunistic bacterium frequently isolated from colonies of various laboratory rodents. Identification of this species, including its differentiation into two distinct biotypes (Jawetz and Heyl), is usually based on the use of conventional bacteriologic methods. In this study, a 16S rDNA fragment amplification procedure was developed for use as an alternative method for identification and differentiation of P. pneumotropica. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were two distinctive fragments of 937 and 564 bp specific for biotypes Jawetz and Heyl, respectively. Specificity of PCR products could be achieved by EcoRI cleavage, leading to 596 plus 341-bp and 346 plus 218-bp fragments for each of the amplification products. Use of this procedure confirmed identification of 34 field isolates and allowed definitive identification of some strains that could not have been done by use of bacteriologic examinations. Field isolates subjected to random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis had high genetic diversity among biotype Jawetz strains in contrast to biotype Heyl strains. In conclusion, RAPD could represent an additional means for identification of ambiguous strains of biotype Heyl and a valuable epidemiologic tool for identification of biotype Jawetz strains of P. pneumotropica.
