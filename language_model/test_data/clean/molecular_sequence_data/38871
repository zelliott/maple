Synapsins are a family of neuron-specific, synaptic vesicle-associated phosphoproteins that have been implicated in the modulation of neurotransmitter release. Synapsins are coded by three distinct genes for synapsin I. II, and III. The synapsin III gene is located on human chromosome 22q12-q13, where a possible schizophrenia susceptibility locus is located. Using the single strand conformation polymorphism method, we searched for variants in 13 exons and the 5'-flanking region of the synapsin III gene in schizophrenia. Three polymorphisms, -631C/G, -271T/C, and E525Q, and one rare variant, -669C >A, were identified. Case-control comparisons of these polymorphisms revealed no significant differences in the allelic and genotypic distributions between schizophrenic and control subjects. The present study did not provide evidence for an association between the synapsin III gene and schizophrenia.
