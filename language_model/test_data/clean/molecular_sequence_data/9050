The increasing emergence of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a problem of global importance. Here, we report the genome of S. aureus VC40, which is resistant to the last-resort antibiotics vancomycin and daptomycin. Its genome sequence will allow insights into the mechanisms that convey full resistance to these compounds.
