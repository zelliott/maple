Bone morphogenetic protein-15 (BMP-15) is an oocyte-secreted factor critical for the regulation of ovarian physiology. When recombinant human BMP-15 (rhBMP-15) produced in human embryonic kidney 293 cells was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, two mature protein forms corresponding to 16 kDa (P16) and 17 kDa (P17) were observed. Despite the physiological relevance and critical function of BMP-15 in female reproduction, little is known about the structure of rhBMP-15. Here, we have analyzed the structure of the rhBMP-15 mature proteins (P16 and P17) using state-of-the-art proteomics technology. Our findings are as follows: (1) the N-terminal amino acid of P16 and P17 is pyroglutamic acid; (2) the Ser residue at the sixth position of P16 is phosphorylated; (3) P17 is O-glycosylated at Thr10; and (4) the C-terminal amino acid of P16 and P17 is truncated. These findings are the first knowledge of the structure of rhBMP-15 mature protein toward understanding the molecular basis of BMP-15 function and could provide an important contribution to the rapidly progressing research area involving oocyte-specific growth factors in modulation of female fertility.
