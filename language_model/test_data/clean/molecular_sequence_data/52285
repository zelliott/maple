Opening of the three tandem repeats of a 13-mer in the replication origin (oriC) of Escherichia coli is a prime event in the replication in vitro of minichromosomes (Bramhill, D., and Kornberg, A. (1988) Cell 54, 915-918). DnaA, the initiator protein, requires protein HU or IHF, along with a millimolar level of ATP and negative superhelical density in the plasmid to open this region. The extent of opening, as judged by cleavage by a single-strand-specific endonuclease (i.e. P1 nuclease), correlated closely with replication of the oriC plasmid. In an initial complex, preceding opening of the 13-mers, the footprint of DnaA protein bound by ATP covered its four 9-mer recognition sequences. The footprint of the nucleotide-free form of the protein, by contrast, was more extensive and thus, less specific.
