A complementary DNA clone encoding a transporter for glutamate has been isolated from mouse brain, and its functional properties have been examined in Xenopus oocytes. The transporter displays high affinity for glutamate (Km = 72 microM) and is dependent on external Na+. The cDNA sequence predicts a protein of 543 amino acids with 6 potential transmembrane domains. Northern blot analysis indicates the mRNA encoding the glutamate transporter is expressed both in the brain and in peripheral tissues.
