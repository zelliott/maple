Electron microscopy of purified protein preparations indicated that Helicobacter pylori urease consisted of circular particles that are 13 nm in diameter, some of which showed indications of threefold rotational symmetry. A GroEL analog of H. pylori (Hp60K) appeared as a disc-shaped molecule with a diameter similar to that of urease but possessed sevenfold rotational symmetry. In a side-view projection, Hp60K appeared as two or four discs stacked side by side.
