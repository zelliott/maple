Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is an enzyme of one of the two pathways of putrescine biosynthesis in plants. The genes encoding ODC have previously been cloned from Datura stramonium and human. Using differential screening, we isolated ODC cDNA clone from a cDNA library of ripening Capsicum annuum fruit. The cDNA clone designated CUKM10 contains an insert of 1523 bp. The longest open reading frame potentially encodes a peptide of 345 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 47 kDa and exhibit striking similarity to other ODCs. Expression analysis showed that the capODC hybridised to a single transcript with a size of 1.7 kb. The capODC transcript was first observed in early ripening and increased steadily until it reached fully ripening stage. From the observation it is suggested that capODC is developmentally regulated especially during later stage of ripening.
