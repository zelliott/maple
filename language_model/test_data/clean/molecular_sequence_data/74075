Pre-mRNA splicing proceeds through assembly of the spliceosome complex, catalysis, and recycling. During each cycle the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP is disrupted and U4/U6 snRNA base-pairing unwound, releasing separate post-spliceosomal U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs, which have to be recycled to the splicing-competent tri-snRNP. Previous work implicated p110--the human ortholog of the yeast Prp24 protein--and the LSm2-8 proteins of the U6 snRNP in U4/U6 recycling. Here we show in vitro that these proteins bind synergistically to U6 snRNA: Both purified and recombinant LSm2-8 proteins are able to recruit p110 protein to U6 snRNA via interaction with the highly conserved C-terminal region of p110. Furthermore, the presence of a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate enhances the affinity of U6 snRNA for the LSm2-8 proteins and inversely reduces La protein binding, suggesting a direct role of the 3'-terminal phosphorylation in RNP remodeling during U6 biogenesis.
