A total of 533 clones from a human 8q24.1 microdissection library was analyzed by automatic DNA sequencing. Three hundred and thirty-seven different insert sequences were found. The insert size ranged from 45 to 376 bp (mean, 170 bp). Eighty-six percent (291/337) of these sequences were free of repetitive DNA. Each of 19 clones tested was successfully translated into a sequence-tagged site. We conclude that the microdissection library is a rich source of DNA markers for 8q24.1.
