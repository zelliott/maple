The abundant, cytoplasmic molecular chaperones of eukaryotic cells, of which mammalian Hsc70 is a member, have central roles in protein folding pathways in cells. Although substantial information is now available on substrate interactions and ATPase activity, neither the crystal structure of the intact Hsc70 molecule nor its isolated peptide-binding domain is known. Recently, the crystal structure of the isolated peptide-binding domain of an evolutionary relative of mammalian Hsc70, the DnaK protein of Escherichia coli, was solved. We have generated several rat Hsc70 mutants using site-directed and cassette mutagenesis guided by secondary structure predictions to test the hypothesis that the peptide-binding domains of mammalian Hsc70 and DnaK have similar molecular structures. Biochemical properties along with the ATPase and peptide binding activities of the resulting recombinant proteins were determined. Biochemical analyses included one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, electrospray mass spectrometry, and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The results of our study suggest that the DnaK molecular structure is a useful working model for the mammalian Hsc70 peptide-binding domain. Evidence is provided that (i) small additions to the N terminus of Hsc70 alter the function of the peptide-binding domain, (ii) alterations in the C-terminal tetrapeptide EEVD result in dramatic increases in basal ATPase activity, (iii) polyalanine substitution of a helical connector segment compensates for changes at the C terminus to restore near-normal function, (iv) specific side chain interactions involving this connector segment are not required for peptide-stimulated ATPase activity, and (v) disruption of the cap homologue region inhibits peptide binding by Hsc70.
