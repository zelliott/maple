The amino-terminal oxygen-binding unit Rta of the Rapana thomasiana hemocyanin is a glycoprotein with a carbohydrate content of 4.8% (w/w). Sugar analysis revealed as monosaccharide constituents xylose, fucose, 3-O-methylgalactose, mannose, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine and N-acetylglucosamine residues. On subtracting the carbohydrate contribution from the molecular mass of 49,698 Da, determined by laser desorption mass spectrometry for Rta, an M(r) value of 47,318 Da was determined for the polypeptide part of the functional unit. The Rapana hemocyanin oxygen-binding unit Rta contains 400 residues in a single polypeptide chain. The nearly complete amino acid sequence (about 90%) is determined. This is the first report on a sequence of a marine gastropod oxygen-binding unit and also on a molluscan hemocyanin amino-terminal unit. Comparison of the Rta sequence with those of other molluscan hemocyanin units, localized in the C-terminus or in the middle of the respective multidomain polypeptide chains, revealed 42-46% homology (52-55%, including isofunctional residues). Probably, all molluscan oxygen-binding units evolved from a common ancestral gene.
