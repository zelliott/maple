To investigate the transcriptional mechanisms of rice tungro bacilliform virus, we have systematically analyzed an activator element located immediately upstream of the TATA box in the rice tungro bacilliform virus promoter and its cognate trans-acting factors. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we showed that rice nuclear proteins bind to the activator element, forming multiple specific DNA-protein complexes via protein-protein interactions. Copper-phenanthroline footprinting and DNA methylation interference analysis indicated that multiple DNA-protein complexes share a common binding site located between positions -60 to -39, and the proteins contact the activator element in the major groove. DNA UV cross-linking assays further showed that two nuclear proteins (36 and 33 kDa), found in rice cell suspension and shoot nuclear extracts, and one (27 kDa), present in root nuclear extracts, bind to this activator element. In protoplasts derived from a rice (Oryza sativa) suspension culture, the activator element is a prerequisite for promoter activity and its function is critically dependent on its position relative to the TATA box. Thus, transcriptional activation may function via interactions with the basal transcriptional machinery, and we propose that this activation is mediated by protein-protein interactions in a position-dependent mechanism.
