To investigate the relation of HLA-DR alleles to the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the correlations between HLA-DR alleles and clinical manifestations of patients with RA in Taiwan.

The HLA-DRB1 alleles were studied in 144 patients with RA and 154 healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction/sequence specific oligonucleotide probe methods. The subtypes of HLA-DR4 were detected by cloning sequencing.

The prevalence of HLA-DR4 was significantly higher in patients with RA (46.53%) than in healthy controls (25.97%). HLA-DRB1*0405 was more common in patients than in controls (83.58 vs 50%), while the prevalence of DRB1*0403 in patients (4.48%) was significantly lower than in controls (27.5%). There was no significant difference in frequencies of HLA-DR alleles between DRB1*0405 negative patients and DRB1*0.05 negative controls. We also noted a positive correlation in patients between HLA-DR4 and bone erosion, but not HLA-DR4 and age of onset, seropositivity, or extraarticular involvement. There was no significant difference in seropositivity, extraarticular involvement, and bone erosion between homozygous and heterozygous DR4 patients.

HLA-DRB1*0405 is related to the development of RA in Taiwan, while DRB1*0403 was a negative risk factor. HLA-DR4 was associated with bone erosion in patients.
