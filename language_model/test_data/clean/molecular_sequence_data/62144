The type II restriction-modification (R-M) system LlaDII isolated from Lactococcus lactis contains two tandemly arranged genes, llaDIIR and llaDIIM, encoding a restriction endonuclease (REase) and a methyltransferase (MTase), respectively. Interestingly, two LlaDII recognition sites are present in the llaDIIM promoter region, suggesting that they may influence the activity of the promoter through methylation status. In this study, separate promoters for llaDIIR and llaDIIM were identified, and the regulation of the two genes at the transcriptional level was investigated. DNA fragments containing the putative promoters were cloned in a promoter probe vector and tested for activity in the presence and absence of the active MTase. The level of expression of the MTase was 5- to 10-fold higher than the level of expression of the REase. The results also showed that the presence of M.LlaDII reduced the in vivo expression of the llaDIIM promoter (P(llaDIIM)) up to 1,000-fold, whereas the activity of the llaDIIR promoter (P(llaDIIR)) was not affected. Based on site-specific mutations it was shown that both of the LlaDII recognition sites within P(llaDIIM) are required to obtain complete repression of transcriptional activity. No regulation was found for llaDIIR, which appears to be constitutively expressed.
