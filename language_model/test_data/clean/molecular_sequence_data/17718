The most common Gaucher disease-producing mutation among Ashkenazi Jews is an A----G substitution at cDNA nt 1226 (genomic nt 5841). We describe a simple method for detecting this mutation both in genomic DNA and in cDNA by performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a 5'-primer mismatched at one nucleotide so as to create an Xho I restriction site. When the mutation is present. the 105 bp fragment formed is cleaved to 89 and 16 nt fragments. The 89 bp fragment is easily visualized on a gel making it possible to distinguish individuals who do not have the mutation from heterozygotes and homozygotes.
