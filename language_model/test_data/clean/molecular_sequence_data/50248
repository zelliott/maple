Alphoid and satellite III sequences are arranged as large tandem arrays in the centromeric regions of human chromosomes. Several recent studies using in situ hybridisation to investigate the relative positions of these sequences have shown that they occupy adjacent but non-overlapping domains in metaphase chromosomes. We have analysed the DNA sequence at the junction between alphoid and satellite III sequences in a cosmid previously mapped to chromosome 10. The alphoid sequence consists of tandemly arranged dimers which are distinct from the known chromosome 10-specific alphoid family. Polymerase chain reaction experiments confirm the integrity of the sequence data. These results, together with pulsed field gel electrophoresis data place the boundary between alphoid and satellite III sequences in the mapping interval 10 centromere-10q11.2. The sequence data shows that these repetitive sequences are separated by a partial L1 interspersed repeat sequence less than 500bp in length. The arrangement of the junction suggests that a recombination event has brought these sequences into close proximity.
