MHCBN is a comprehensive database of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) binding and non-binding peptides compiled from published literature and existing databases. The latest version of the database has 19 777 entries including 17 129 MHC binders and 2648 MHC non-binders for more than 400 MHC molecules. The database has sequence and structure data of (a) source proteins of peptides and (b) MHC molecules. MHCBN has a number of web tools that include: (i) mapping of peptide on query sequence; (ii) search on any field; (iii) creation of data sets; and (iv) online data submission. The database also provides hypertext links to major databases like SWISS-PROT, PDB, IMGT/HLA-DB, GenBank and PUBMED.
