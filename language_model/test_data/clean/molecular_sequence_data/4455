The presence in farm sheep of a paramyxovirus closely related to parainfluenza virus type 3 (Pi3) from humans or cattle was confirmed using RT-PCR on RNA samples from lung cells from slaughtered animals. Sequencing and restriction enzyme patterns of the amplified fragment of the F gene confirms the distinctness of the isolate, and suitable PCR primers allow specific detection of the ovine virus. A study of the incidence of ovine Pi3 in samples from sheep with or without distinctive histopathological signs of maedi shows that it is uncommon in aged sheep with overt lentiviral disease, but it occurs at moderate frequency in lambs and may, in the presence of visna-maedi virus, contribute to early lesion formation.
