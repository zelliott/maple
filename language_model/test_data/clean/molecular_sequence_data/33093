Fas-associated factor (FAF)-1 is a multidomain protein that was first identified as a member of the Fas death-inducing signaling complex, but later found to be involved in various biological processes. Although the exact mechanisms are not clear, FAF1 seems to play an important role in cancer, asbestos-induced mesotheliomas, and Parkinson's disease. It interacts with polyubiquitinated proteins, Hsp70, and p97/VCP (valosin-containing protein), in addition to the proteins of the Fas-signaling pathway. We have determined the crystal structure of the ubiquitin-associated domain of human FAF1 (hFAF1-UBA) and examined its interaction with ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins using nuclear magnetic resonance. hFAF1-UBA revealed a canonical three-helical bundle that selectively binds to mono- and di-ubiquitin (Lys48-linked), but not to SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-related modifier 1) or NEDD8 (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 8). The interaction between hFAF1-UBA and di-ubiquitin involves hydrophobic interaction accompanied by a transition in the di-ubiquitin conformation. These results provide structural insight into the mechanism of polyubiquitin recognition by hFAF1-UBA.
