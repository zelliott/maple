The increase of Acinetobacter baumannii resistance to carbapenems is of great concern. OXA23 is one of the most prevalent carbapenemases of A. baumannii that causes outbreaks. Here, we announce the genome sequence of an OXA23-producing A. baumannii strain assigned ST75, a newly emerged sequence type harboring carbapenemase.
