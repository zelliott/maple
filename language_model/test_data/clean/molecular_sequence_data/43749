Clostridium perfringens is the causative agent of clostridial myonecrosis or gas gangrene and mediates infection and disease by producing numerous extracellular toxins, including alpha-toxin, theta-toxin and kappa-toxin. Tn916-mutagenesis was used to isolate mutants defective in their ability to produce either alpha-toxin or theta-toxin. Nine independently derived mutants were isolated. In four of these mutants Tn916 had inserted at sites located 193 bp or 198 bp upstream of the theta-toxin structural gene, pfoA. Four mutants contained large deletions, three in regions which encompassed the theta-toxin structural and regulatory genes pfoA and pfoR, respectively, and the kappa-toxin structural gene, colA, and one in a region encompassing the alpha-toxin structural gene, plc. These mutants should prove to be invaluable for further genetic studies aimed at determining the role of these toxins in virulence.
