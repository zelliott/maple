Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) was evaluated for its ability to differentiate Salmonella strains from various sources. Under defined conditions RAPD using a 10-mer primer (1254) produced a series of amplification products able to reproducibly distinguish strains representing 20 different serotypes of Salmonella. Primer 1254 also proved capable of discrimination between some but not all isolates of Salm. ser. Enteritidis and Salm. ser. Typhimurium, phage typing proving to be most discriminatory for the latter serotype. Cloning of fragments into a vector allowed sequencing and database searching for identification of fragments and an indication of criteria for primer template interaction in RAPD. Southern blotting using a digoxigenin-labelled probe allowed identification of related bands between RAPD profiles. These observations demonstrate the potential of rapid molecular typing by RAPD for the genomic typing of Salmonella strains.
