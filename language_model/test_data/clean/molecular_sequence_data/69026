Two major polysaccharides, rhamnogalacturonans with mean M(r)s of 13,500 and 13,000, were isolated from dried leaves of Sedum telephium by column chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B and gel filtration on Fractogel TSK HW-50 (S) and Sephacryl 200 HR. The structures were determined mainly by NMR spectroscopy, methylation analysis and GC-MS of the partially methylated alditol acetates, carboxyl reduction and by analysis of acidic and enzymatic degradation products. Both polysaccharides exert an anticomplementary effect in vitro, induce TNF-alpha-production, enhance phagocytosis in vitro and in vivo, and exhibit anti-inflammatory activity.
