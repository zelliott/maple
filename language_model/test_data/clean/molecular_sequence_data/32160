The aim of this study was to characterize the mechanism of resistance to macrolides and streptogramins of a Streptococcus pneumoniae strain isolated from blood cultures in an 80-year-old patient suffering from severe pneumonia unsuccessfully treated with pristinamycin.

Resistance genes erm(B) and mef(A) were searched for by PCR. Portions of genes for domains V and II of the 23S rRNA (rrl) and genes for ribosomal proteins L4 (rplD) and L22 (rplV) were amplified by PCR from total genomic DNA and sequenced.

Resistance genes erm(B) and mef(A) were not detected. Only mutation in the rplV gene encoding ribosomal protein L22 was detected. The strain contained a six amino acid insertion ((107)KRTAHI(108)) in the C-terminus of the ribosomal protein L22.

This is the first report of emergence of a pneumococcus resistant to streptogramins by mutation in ribosomal protein L22 during treatment with pristinamycin.
