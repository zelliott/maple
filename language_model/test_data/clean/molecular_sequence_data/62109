A cDNA clone encoding a rac-like small GTP binding protein was isolated from a cDNA library of Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris L. ssp. pekinensis) flower buds and named Brac1. The Brac1 cDNA contains an open reading frame encoding 198 amino acid residues with an estimated molecular mass of 21,690 Da and this coding region has conserved residues and motifs unique to the Rho subfamily of proteins. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Brac1 protein is closely related to that of Arabidopsis thaliana Arac3 (91%), but it shares relatively little homology with other members of the Ras superfamily (about 30% identity). To further characterize Brac1, a pGBrac1 expression vector consisting of PCR-amplified Brac1 cDNA plus glutathione S-transferase (GST) and pBKS(+)II was used to purify the protein. Using a PEI-cellulose/TLC plate, GTPase activity of this protein was confirmed and competition binding studies, using the guanine nucleotides, ATP, UTP and CTP, revealed that the di- and triphosphate forms of guanine nucleotides strongly bind Brac1. Membrane-bound PLD activity was synergistically enhanced by Brac1 in the presence of protein kinase C, but not in the presence of ARF (ADP-ribosylation factor). Genomic analysis indicated that Brac1 belongs to a multigene family. Brac1 transcripts were expressed in all the organs of Brassica, but were especially prevalent in flower buds.
