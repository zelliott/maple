In recent years, significant progress has been made toward understanding smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMHC) structure. Molecular cloning analysis has identified four different MHC isoforms. They are products of a single gene and result from alternative mRNA splicing. In addition, two non-muscle MHC isoforms are also expressed in smooth muscle cells. Studies show that SMHC expression is highly tissue specific and does not appear in cardiac or skeletal muscle cells. Each smooth muscle tissue is characterized by a specific pattern of MHC isoform expression that changes during development and disease. This review essentially focuses on SMHC isoforms and their expression in mammals.
