Granulomatous inflammation in schistosomiasis is strictly dependent on CD4+ Th lymphocytes sensitized to egg Ags, but its intensity is genetically regulated. C3H and CBA (H-2k) are strains of mice that develop large granulomas; they also strongly respond to the major egg Ag Sm-p40. We now show that the immunodominant epitope recognized by CD4+ Th cells from infected H-2k mice is confined to 13-mer peptide 234-246 (PKSDNQIKAVPAS), which elicits an I-Ak-restricted Th1-type response. Using a panel of alanine-monosubstituted peptides, we identified Asp237 as the main contact residue with I-Ak. On the other hand, three TCR contact residues were essential to stimulate epitope-specific T cell hybridomas: for two hybridomas these were Asn238, Gln239, and Lys241; and for one, Asn238, Lys241, and Pro244. In one instance, alanine substitution for Gln239 generated an antagonist that blocked subsequent stimulation with wild-type peptide. Most importantly, replacement of Asn238, Gln239, or Lys241 caused a profound loss of polyclonal CD4+ T cell reactivity from schistosome-infected mice. This study identifies the critical residues of immunodominant peptide 234-246 involved in the T cell response against the Sm-p40 egg Ag and suggests that suitable altered peptides may be capable of precipitating its down-regulation.
