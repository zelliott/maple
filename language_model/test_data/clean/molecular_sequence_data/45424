A Hanks-type protein kinase AfsK autophosphorylates on threonine residue(s) and phosphorylates AfsR, a global regulator for secondary metabolism in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Mass spectrometry of a tryptic digest of the autophosphorylated form of AfsK deltaC corresponding to the kinase catalytic domain (Met-1 to Arg-311) of AfsK, together with subsequent site-directed mutagenesis of the candidate amino acids, identified threonine-168 as a single autophosphorylation site. Threonine-168 is located in the activation loop that is known for some Ser/Thr kinases to modulate kinase activity on phosphorylation of one or more threonine residues within the loop. Consistent with this, mutant T168D, in which Thr-168 was replaced by Asp, became a constitutively active kinase; it phosphorylated AfsR to the same extent as AfsK deltaC produced in and purified from Escherichia coli cells during which a considerable population of it had been already phosphorylated intermolecularly. All these findings show that autophosphorylation or intermolecular phosphorylation of threonine-168 in AfsK accounts for the self-activation of its kinase activity.
