Eight oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing a site-specific N-(2'-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-(acetyl-amino)fluorene (dG-C8-AAF) adduct were prepared successfully by solid-phase DNA synthesis using the 2-cyanoethyl N,N-diisopropylphosphoramidites of dA, dC, dG, dT, and dG-C8-AAF, with 9-fluorenyl-methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) as the base-protecting group. The oligonucleotides were deprotected and released from the support by 1:9 piperidine/MeOH at room temperature for 22-36 h or by 1:1 diisopropylamine in MeOH at 55 degrees C for 15 h, purified by HPLC, and fully characterized. About 6 mg of HPLC-purified d[GTGGCG(C8-AAF)CCAAGT] and 7 mg of d[GTGATG(C8-AAF)ATAAGT] were obtained from the 10-mumol-scale synthesis, and their 1D 1H NMR spectra were consistent with the presence of a dG-C8-AAF adduct. The dG-C8-AAF oligonucleotides were also deacetylated to afford the corresponding dG-C8-AF oligonucleotides. d[GTGGCG(C8-AAF)CCAAGT] formed stable 1:1 duplexes with both the fully complementary 12-mer and a GC-deleted (across the adduct) 10-mer complement, and identical melting temperatures were observed for both duplexes. The multidimensional NMR study of these duplexes is presently under investigation.
