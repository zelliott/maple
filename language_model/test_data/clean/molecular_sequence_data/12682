In this paper we report the cloning, sequencing and expression of the superoxide dismutase (sod) gene from Mycobacterium fortuitum. A single gene was found to code for superoxide dismutase activity with its identity being confirmed by expression in M. aurum. The amino acid sequence was found to be similar to that of superoxide dismutases of several other origins. A region downstream of the sod gene also showed similarities to the corresponding sequences of the two main mycobacterial pathogens: M. leprae and M. tuberculosis. Analysis of enzymatic activity showed this enzyme in M. fortuitum required manganese as cofactor.
