A novel allele, C*0406, has been identified and is characterised by a single nucleotide substitution at position 196 of exon 3 when compared with its closest related allele, C*0403. The latter is found in 4/69 Chinese and 7/80 Malays while Cw*0406 was found in only one Malay individual within the study populations. The data suggest that Cw*0406 may have arisen as a relatively recent genetic event either by gene conversion or as a simple point mutation variant of Cw*0403.
