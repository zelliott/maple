Using bioinformatics analyses of the unfinished malaria genome sequence, we have identified a novel protein of Plasmodium falciparum that contains two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains near the C-terminus of the protein. The sequence contains a single open reading frame of 1572bp with the potential to encode a protein of 524 residues containing hydrophobic regions at the extreme N- and C-termini which appear to represent signal peptide and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-attachment sites, respectively. RT-PCR analysis has confirmed that the novel gene is transcribed in asexual stages of P. falciparum. Antibodies to the EGF-like domains of the novel protein are highly specific and do not cross-react with the EGF-like domains of MSP1, MSP4, MSP5 or MSP8 expressed as GST fusion proteins. Antisera to the C-terminal fragments react with two bands of 80 and 36kDa in P. falciparum parasite lysates whereas antisera to the most N-terminal fusion protein only recognises the 80kDa band, suggesting that the novel protein may undergo processing in a similar way to MSP1 and MSP8, but with fewer cleavage events. Immunoblot analysis of stage-specific parasite samples reveals that the protein is present in trophozoites, schizonts and in isolated merozoites. The protein partitions in the detergent-enriched phase after Triton X-114 fractionation and is localised to the surfaces of trophozoites, schizonts and free merozoites in an apical distribution. Based on the accepted nomenclature in the field we now designate this protein MSP10. We have shown that the MSP10 fusion proteins are in a conformation that can be recognised by human immune sera and that there is very limited sequence diversity in an approximately lkb region of MSP10, encompassing the two EGF-like domains. A sequence similar to MSP10 can be identified in the available P. yoelii genomic sequence, offering the possibility of ascertaining whether this novel protein can induce host protective responses in an in vivo model.
