VDR regulates gene expression in a ligand-dependent way by binding to cognate enhancer elements of target gene promoters. The ligand-dependent activation function, AF-2, of VDR is thought to require transcriptional co-activators/co-repressors together with basal transcriptional machinery. Using a yeast two hybrid system with VDR, we have isolated a mouse Ca(2+)-binding protein (designated as VAF1) specifically interacting in vivo and in vitro with VDR among nuclear receptors like RAR, RXR, ER and GR. VAF1 is a mouse homologue to human ERC-55, which has recently been shown to interact with human papillomavirus oncogenic protein, E6[1]. Unlike those of many previously identified co-activators, the VDR-VAF1 interaction was ligand-independent. Thus, VAF1 seems a putative VDR-specific cofactor modulating its function.
