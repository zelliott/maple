Axial skeletons such as vertebrae, ribs, and scapulae develop from the embryonic somitic mesoderm through interactions with neural tube/notochord and skin ectoderm. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) seem to play important roles in these tissue interactions; however, the relationship between BMP signaling and the early development of axial skeletons is poorly understood. In this report, we investigated possible roles of BMP signaling in axial skeletal formation. First, we describe the expression patterns of BMP4 and type I receptors for BMP during somitogenesis in chick embryos based on whole mount in situ hybridization. Next, the effects of BMP on axial skeletal morphogenesis were investigated by implantation of BMP proteins into the dorsal mesoderm at the time of somitogenesis. Transcripts for both BMP4 ligand and its receptors are expressed in the dorsal ectoderm and mesoderm. Implantation of BMP4 and BMP2 into the dorsal regions of embryos result in subsequent anomalies of vertebrae, ribs, and scapulae. The effects of BMP implantation on the skeleton are shown to be dependent upon the somitic stage. Vertebral anomalies are restricted to the dorsolateral elements of the vertebrae and specifically observed after BMP implantation into embryonic day 2 (E2) embryos, but not E3 embryos. These results indicate that implantation of BMP into the dorsal part of embryos where endogenous BMP ligand and BMP receptors are expressed perturbs BMP signaling and causes axial skeletal malformations. The findings presented here suggest that BMP signaling may be involved in the early developmental process of the axial skeleton.
