RecA protein-coated single-stranded DNA probes, known as RecA nucleoprotein filaments, bind specifically to homologous DNA sequences within double-stranded DNA targets, forming multistranded probe-target DNA hybrids. This DNA hybridization reaction can be used for sequence-specific gene capture, gene modification, and gene regulation. Thus, factors that enhance the efficiency of the hybridization reaction are of significant practical importance. We show here that the hybridization of a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) within or adjacent to the probe-target homology region significantly enhances the yield of hybrid DNA formed in the reaction between linear double-stranded DNA targets and RecA protein-coated complementary single-stranded (css)DNA probes. The possible mechanisms and the advantages of using RecA nucleoprotein filaments in combination with PNA for genomic DNA cloning and mutagenesis are presented.
