Fragments of hepatitis B virus envelope proteins corresponding to the parts of the pre-S domain were synthesised and immobilized on the carriers with low own immunogenicity. The highest stimulation of the antibody production was observed for the antigens immobilized on microspherical carriers or gelatin modified by H-Gly-Tyr-OH. Among peptides used for immunization, pre-S fragment 134-144, conjugated with microspherical carrier, proved to be the most active.
