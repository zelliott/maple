A key question relating to procollagen biosynthesis is the way in which closely related procollagen chains discriminate between each other to assemble in a type-specific manner. Intracellular assembly of procollagen occurs via an initial interaction between the C-propeptides followed by vectorial propagation of the triple-helical domain in the C to N direction. Recognition signals within the C-propeptides must, therefore, determine the selective association of individual procollagen chains. We have used the pro alpha1 chain of type III procollagen [pro alpha1(III)] and the pro alpha2 chain of type I procollagen [pro alpha2(I)] as examples of procollagen chains that are either capable or incapable of self-assembly. When we exchanged the C-propeptides of the pro alpha1(III) chain and the pro alpha(I) chain we demonstrated that this domain is both necessary and sufficient to direct the assembly of homotrimers with correctly aligned triple-helices. To identify the sequences within this domain that determine selective association we constructed a series of chimeric procollagen chains in which we exchanged specific sequences from the pro alpha1(III) C-propeptide with the corresponding region within the pro alpha2(I) C-propeptide (and vice versa) and assayed for the ability of these molecules to form homotrimers. Using this approach we have identified a discontinuous sequence of 15 amino acids which directs procollagen self-association. By exchanging this sequence between different procollagen chains we can direct chain association and, potentially, assemble molecules with defined chain compositions.
