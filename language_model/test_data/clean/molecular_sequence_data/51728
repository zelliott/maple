Ribosomal protein S13 of the nematode Brugia pahangi is recognized by B and T cells from parasite-infected animals. To identify helper T cell sites on the protein, 15 overlapping synthetic peptides spanning the entire molecule (Bp17.4) were tested for their ability to stimulate lymph node and spleen cells of peptide-immunized and recombinant antigen-immunized jirds. Lymph node cells from animals immunized with peptides 6, 8, 9, 13, and 14, corresponding to Bp17.4 amino acids (AA) 50-70, 70-90, 80-100, 120-140, and 130-150, respectively, showed strong and specific responses to the homologous peptide, while only those lymph node cells from jirds immunized with peptides 8, 9, 13, and 14 proliferated in response to Bp17.4. These results suggest the existence of at least two T cell epitopes. Lymph node cells from infected jirds also responded to these peptides and to Bp17.4 (80,000 cpm). In contrast to the lymph node cells, spleen cells from microfilaria-positive animals failed to mount significant responses to any of the peptides or to Bp17.4. Splenic T cell responsiveness was restored upon removal of nylon wool adherent cells, suggesting active regulation of Bp17.4 reactivity. In liquid-phase competitive inhibition immunoassays, peptides 1 (AA 1-30) and 6 (50-70) blocked antibody binding and, therefore, these regions contain conformational antibody-binding sites. This model system should prove useful for analyzing regulation of epitope-specific responses in experimental filariasis.
