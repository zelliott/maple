The subunits of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV from Staphylococcus haemolyticus were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and used to reconstitute active enzymes that were sensitive to known topoisomerase inhibitors. This represents the first description of a method for isolating type II topoisomerases of a coagulase-negative staphylococcal species.
