We cloned the putative polyketide synthase genes (pms genes) for pradimicin A biosynthesis from Actinomadura hibisca using an oligonucleotide probe designed on the basis of conserved amino acid sequences of other polyketide synthases (PKSs). By DNA sequencing of an 8.2-kb SacI fragment that hybridized with the oligonucleotide probe, 11 open reading frames (ORFs) were found. All of the ORFs except for ORF10 were predicted to be translated in the same direction. Each of the deduced ORFs has significant sequence similarity to the protein responsible for polyketide biosynthesis or spore pigmentation. In particular, ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3 were 50-70% identical with genes coding for PKSs for actinorhodin biosynthesis. Specific DNA regions similar in sequence to pms genes were found with genomic Southern hybridization in all of the pradimicin producers examined, but were not found in pradimicin nonproducers, suggesting that the genes cloned in this study encode polyketide synthase for pradimicin biosynthesis.
