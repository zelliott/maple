An important Calvin cycle enzyme, chloroplast triosephosphate isomerase (cpTPI) from spinach, has been cloned and expressed in up to 15% of the total cell protein using the P(L) expression vector in Escherichia coli. An even higher level expression, up to 36% of the total protein, was achieved by replacing the nucleotide sequence between the ribosomal binding site and the initial codon, ATG, with an AT-rich sequence. Computer modeling revealed that the moderate change in the standard free energy (5'-DeltaG degrees ) of mRNA secondary structure in the translation initial region might be the major factor which led to the later high-level expression. The overexpressed spinach cpTPI was soluble and fully active and was able to be purified beyond 95% purity by DEAE-Sepharose and Sephadex G-75, and around 55 mg of purified enzymes was obtained from 1 liter of cultured bacteria. With d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrate, K(m (D-3-P)) is 0. 68 mM, V(max (G-3-P)) is 3.16 x 10(4) micromol/min. mg, and K(cat (G-3-P)) is 4.51 x 10(3)/s; with dihydroxyacetone phosphate as substrate, the corresponding values are 7.27 mM, 1.04 x 10(3) micromol/min. mg, and 1.16 x 10(2)/s, respectively.
