We constructed replication-competent avian retrovirus vectors that contain two of the three known types of chicken c-ski cDNAs and a third vector that contains a truncated c-ski cDNA. We developed antisera that recognize the c-ski proteins made by the three transforming c-ski viruses. All three proteins (apparent molecular masses, 50, 60, and 90 kilodaltons) are localized primarily in the nucleus. The proteins are differentially phosphorylated; immunofluorescence also suggests that there are differences in subnuclear localization of the c-ski proteins and that c-ski protein is associated with condensed chromatin in dividing cells.
