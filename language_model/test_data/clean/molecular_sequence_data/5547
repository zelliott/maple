Transposon-generated mutant C3 of Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 is unable to form heterocysts upon deprivation of combined nitrogen but forms a pattern of spaced, weakly fluorescent cells after 2 days of deprivation. Sequence analysis of chromosomal DNA adjacent to the ends of transposon Tn5-1058 in mutant C3 showed a 1,044-amino-acid open reading frame, designated hetC, whose predicted protein product throughout its C-terminal two-thirds has extensive similarity to the HlyB family of bacterial protein exporters. Its N-terminal third is unique and does not resemble any known protein. hetC lies 1,165 bp 5' from the previously described gene hetP. Reconstruction of the C3 mutation and its complementation in trans with a wild-type copy of hetC confirmed that hetC has an essential regulatory role early in heterocyst development. hetC is induced ca. 4 h after nitrogen stepdown, hours after induction of hetR. Expression of hetC depends on HetR and may depend on HetC. Highly similar sequences are present 5' from the initiation codons and in the 3' untranslated regions of hetC and of two heterocyst-specific genes, devA and hetP.
