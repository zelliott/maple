The growth-promoting activity of GH, the principal hormonal determinant of body size, is mediated by insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). Most of the IGF-I in plasma circulates in a 150-kDa complex that contains IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and an acid-labile subunit (ALS). The 150-kDa complex serves as a reservoir of IGF-I and determines its bioavailability to the tissues. Formation of the 150-kDa complex depends upon the synthesis of ALS, which is synthesized primarily in liver and is regulated by GH. The present study demonstrates that GH stimulates ALS gene transcription in rat liver and ALS promoter activity in a rat hepatoma cell line. ALS messenger RNA (mRNA) and ALS nuclear transcripts were decreased to similar extents in the livers of GH-deficient hypophysectomized rats. GH increased hepatic ALS mRNA within 3-4 h to about 65% of the levels seen in sham-operated control rats. To confirm that GH stimulated ALS gene transcription, we transiently transfected an ALS promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct into H4-II-E rat hepatoma cells and primary rat hepatocytes. Recombinant human GH (hGH) stimulated promoter activity about 3-fold. In contrast, basal promoter activity was lower, and GH stimulation was absent when the ALS reporter construct was transfected into GH-responsive 3T3-F442A mouse preadipocyte fibroblasts. GH stimulation of ALS promoter activity in H4-II-E cells was mediated by functional GH receptors; nonprimate (rat and bovine) GH gave identical stimulation to hGH, and stimulation by hGH occurred at physiological concentrations. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis indicated that GH receptor mRNA was present in H4-II-E cells at approximately 40% of the level seen in rat liver. GH also induced the expression of the endogenous c-fos gene, indicating that the signaling pathway necessary for the activation of gene expression by GH was intact in H4-II-E cells. Thus, H4-II-E cells are a GH-responsive liver cell line that should provide a useful system in which to study the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation by GH of ALS and other hepatic genes.
