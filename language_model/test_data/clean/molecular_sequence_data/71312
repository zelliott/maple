The sequence at the amino terminus region of the hemolysin ofAeromonas sobria is homologous with that of aerolysin of A. hydrophila. However, there is no homology between the two toxins in the sequence at the carboxy terminal region. It has been shown that aerolysin is secreted into culture supernatant as a protoxin. This proaerolysin is activated by the proteolytic removal of a carboxy terminal peptide. However, the role of the carboxy terminal region, which is removed in the activation process, has not been elucidated. In this study, we showed that hemolysin is also secreted as a protoxin into culture supernatant and that prohemolysin is cleaved by the protease of A. sobria between Ser-446 and Ala-447, resulting in the removal of a 42 amino acid peptide. The removal of the peptide converts the prohemolysin into active hemolysin. Subsequently, we mutated the hemolysin gene to delete the last several amino acid residues and expressed the genes in Escherichia coli, in order to examine the role of the carboxy terminal region of prohemolysin. The amounts of these mutant hemolysins accumulated in the periplasmic space of E. coli were very low compared with that of the wild-type. This observation indicated that the carboxy terminal region of prohemolysin contributes to the proteolytic stability of the toxin.
