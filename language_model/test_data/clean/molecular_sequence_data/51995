Sequence tagged sites (STSs) have been proposed as a "common language" for comparing physical and genetic maps of the human genome produced by a variety of techniques. We have produced 44 STSs from 38 mapped loci on human chromosome 21. The STSs represent most of the loci designated as genetic reference or ordered physical framework markers, along with a number of others chosen to span all regions of 21q. Of the STSs, 12 are from gene segments, including 4 from exons of the APP gene encoding the amyloid beta protein precursor, and 32 mark anonymous DNA loci. These STSs make each of the corresponding loci readily accessible to the research community without the need for exchange of clones. These sites also represent multiple start points for the isolation of YAC clones that should permit overlapping the entire chromosome 21 long arm as cloned DNA.
