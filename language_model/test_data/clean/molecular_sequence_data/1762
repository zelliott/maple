Double-stranded RNA preparations produced from potato plants graft-inoculated with a Peruvian isolate of Potato yellow vein virus (PYVV; genus Crinivirus, family Closteroviridae) contain five RNA species denoted RNA 1, RNA 2, RNA 3, x and y of approximately 8, 5.3, 3.8, 2.0 and 1.8 kbp, respectively. The complete nucleotide sequences of PYVV RNAs 1, 2 and 3 and Northern hybridization analysis showed that PYVV RNA 1 contained the replication module and an additional open reading frame (p7), while two distinct species, RNAs 2 and 3, contain the Closteroviridae hallmark gene array. Pairwise comparisons and phylogeny of genome-encoded proteins showed that PYVV shares significant homology with other criniviruses but is most closely related to the Trialeurodes vaporariorum-vectored Cucumber yellows virus. Secondary structure prediction of the 3'-untranslated regions of all three PYVV RNAs revealed four conserved stem-loop structures and a 3'-terminal pseudoknot structure, also predicted for all fully characterized members of the genus Crinivirus and some members of the genera Closterovirus and Ampelovirus.
