Ribonucleotide reductase activity is markedly elevated in cell lines selected for resistance to hydroxyurea, a cytotoxic drug known specifically to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. From a cDNA library constructed from a highly hydroxyurea-resistant hamster lung cell line, 600H in which the activity is elevated more than 80-fold, we have isolated a full length cDNA for the small subunit of the reductase. The cDNA is 3.48 kb long with an open reading frame of 1158 nucleotides and a long 3' flanking region of 2169 nucleotides from the termination codon. The derived polypeptide sequence is closely similar to the small subunit of the mouse, differing from it in 20 amino acid positions. Most of these replacements occur in the N-terminal segment of the protein. The hamster subunit does not contain 4 amino acid residues found in the mouse small subunit near the C-terminal end. RNA blots probed with the cDNA show two poly(A)+ RNA species which are elevated in hydroxyurea-resistant cells.
