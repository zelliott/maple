It is known from DNA hybridization and other studies that Neurospora plasmids are widely distributed across species of this genus. However few comparisons have been performed of the structure of apparently identical plasmids in widely differing geographical and biological locations. We compare pairs of circular and linear mitochondrial plasmids from distant geographical locations. The circular plasmids (LaBelle and Harbin-1) were from different ecotypes of N. intermedia and the linear plasmids (maranhar and Harbin-3) were from different species (N. crassa and N. intermedia). The structures are highly similar at the sequence level showing that they are closely related. Most of the differences are outside the presumptive genes (coding for polymerases). Furthermore, most of the proposed functional motifs have been retained. Sequence divergence is compatible with a distribution model by vertical descent from a common ancestor, but horizontal transmission cannot be ruled out.
