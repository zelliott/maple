Parathyroid cells express Ca(2+)-conducting cation currents, which are activated by raising the extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o) and blocked by dihydropyridines. We found that acetylcholine (ACh) inhibited these currents in a reversible, dose-dependent manner (50% inhibitory concentration approximately equal to 10(-8) M). The inhibitory effects could be mimicked by the agonist (+)-muscarine. The effects of ACh were blunted by the antagonist atropine and reversed by removing ATP from the pipette solution (+)-Muscarine enhanced the adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) production by 30% but had no effect on inositol phosphate accumulation in parathyroid cells. Oligonucleotide primers, based on sequences of known muscarinic receptors (M1-M5), were used in reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to amplify receptor cDNA from parathyroid poly (A)+ RNA. RT-PCR products displayed > 90% nucleotide sequence identity to human M2- and M4-receptor cDNAs. Expression of M2-receptor protein was further confirmed by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Thus parathyroid cells express muscarinic receptors of M2 and possibly M4 subtypes. These receptors may couple to dihydropyridine-sensitive, cation-selective currents through the activation of adenylate cyclase and ATP-dependent pathways in these cells.
