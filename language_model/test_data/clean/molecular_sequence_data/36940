Sequences from the 5' end terminal part of 28S ribosomal RNA were obtained and compared for 22 animals belonging to all diploblastic phyla and for a large number of representatives of triploblastic Metazoa and protists. Phylogenetic analyses undertaken using different methods showed deep radiations of phyla such as Ctenophora, Cnidaria and Placozoa but also for groups of Porifera of low taxonomic rank. Short internodes between these radiations suggested an early rapid diversification of diploblasts. A long internal branch preceding the diversification of all triploblasts analyzed could be explained either by a long period with a single ancestor or by the extinction of the earliest triploblastic radiations. Finally some unexpected relationships were revealed among Porifera.
