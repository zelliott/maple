Neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily and mediate several physiological responses, such as blood pressure, food intake, sedation and memory retention. To understand the interactions between the NPY Y1 receptor subtype and its ligands, computer modeling was applied to the natural peptide agonist, NPY and a small molecule antagonist, BIBP3226. An agonist and antagonist binding domain was elucidated using mutagenesis data for the Y1 receptor as well as for other GPCR families. The agonist and antagonist ligands which were investigated appear to share common residues for their interaction within the transmembrane regions of the Y1 receptor structure, including Gln120, Asn283 and His306. This is in contrast to findings with tachykinin receptors where the binding domains of the non-peptide antagonists have very little in common with the binding domains of the agonist, substance-P. In addition, a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of Tyr36 of NPY and the side chain of Gln219, an interaction that is absent in the model complex between Y1 and the antagonist BIBP3226, is proposed as one of the potential interactions necessary for receptor activation.
