The molecular mechanisms of the immune system against virus in shrimp are not well known, despite its economic importance as an aquaculture species. In this investigation, a Rab gene (named as PjRab gene) was obtained from Peneaus japonicus shrimp, which exhibited high homology with Rab 6 of other species. The PjRab protein, having GTP-binding activity, contained characteristic signatures of Rab proteins with 6 GTP binding domains and 5 Rab specific domains. However, the PjRab protein exhibited a very different prenylation site (CLLNL) at its C-terminus from most of other Rabs. The PjRab gene was ubiquitously expressed in shrimp tissues. Real-time PCR revealed that the PjRab gene was up-regulated in WSSV-resistant shrimp, suggesting that the PjRab protein might play an important role in shrimp immune response against virus infection. This discovery might contribute better understanding to the molecular events involved in shrimp as well as invertebrate immune responses.
