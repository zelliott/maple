Early NMR structural studies of serum lipoproteins were based on (1)H, (13)C, (31)P, and (2)H studies of lipid components. From the early studies information on composition, lipid chain dynamics and order parameters, and monolayer organization resulted. More recently, selective or complete isotopic labeling techniques, combined with multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, have resulted in structural information of apoprotein fragments. Finally, use of heteronuclear three- and four-dimensional experiments have yielded solution structures and protein-lipid interactions of intact apolipoproteins C-I, C-II, and A-I.
