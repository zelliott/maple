Differentiation of endothelial cells, i.e., formation of a vessel lumen, is a prerequisite for angiogenesis. The underlying molecular mechanisms are ill defined. We have studied a brain capillary endothelial cell line (IBEC) established from H-2Kb-tsA58 transgenic mice. These cells form hollow tubes in three-dimensional type I collagen gels in response to fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). Culture of IBEC on collagen gels in the presence of FGF-2 protected cells from apoptosis and allowed tube formation (i.e., differentiation) but not growth of the cells. FGF-induced differentiation, but not cell survival, was inhibited by treatment of the cells with an anti-beta1-integrin IgG. Changes in integrin expression in the collagen-gel cultures could not be detected. Rather, cell-matrix interactions critical for endothelial cell differentiation were created during the culture, as indicated by the gradual increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase in the collagen-gel cultures. Inclusion of laminin in the collagen gels led to FGF-2-independent formation of tube structures, but cells were not protected from apoptosis. These data indicate that FGF receptor-1 signal transduction in this cell model results in cell survival. Through mechanisms dependent on cell-matrix interactions, possibly involving the alpha3beta1-integrin and laminin produced by the collagen-cultured IBE cells, FGF stimulation also leads to differentiation of the cells.
