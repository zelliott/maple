During a surveillance program associated with the Italian clinical trial for the evaluation of new acellular pertussis vaccines, two bacterial isolates were obtained in cultures of samples from immunocompetent infants who had episodes of cough. Both clinical isolates were identified as Bordetella bronchiseptica by biochemical criteria, although both strains agglutinated with antisera specific for Bordetella parapertussis, suggesting that the strains exhibited some characteristics of both B. bronchiseptica and B. parapertussis. Both children from whom these strains were isolated exhibited an increase in serum antibody titer to pertussis toxin (PT), a protein that is produced by Bordetella pertussis but that is not thought to be produced by B. bronchiseptica. We therefore examined whether the clinical isolates were capable of producing PT. Neither strain produced PT under laboratory conditions, although both strains appeared to contain a portion of the ptx region that encodes the structural subunits of PT. In order to determine whether the ptx genes may encode functional proteins, we inserted an active promoter directly upstream of the ptx region of one of these strains. Biologically active PT was produced, suggesting that this strain contains the genetic information necessary to encode an active PT molecule. Sequence analysis of the ptx promoter region of both strains indicated that, while they shared homology with the B. bronchiseptica ATCC 4617 sequence, they contained certain sequence motifs that are characteristic of B. parapertussis and certain motifs that are characteristic of B. pertussis. Taken together, these findings suggest that variant strains of B. bronchiseptica exist and might be capable of causing significant illness in humans.
