Using the yeast two hybrid system, we isolated a rat cDNA (E3-3) coding for a new protein with no homology to any other protein in the database. E3-3 is ubiquitously expressed. Variants that most likely arise through alternative splicing encode truncated forms of the protein. Testis is the only tissue that predominantly expresses the longest protein variant. When this variant is tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein, the protein is located in the nucleus.
