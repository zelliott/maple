Centrins are well-conserved calcium binding proteins from the EF-hand superfamily implicated in various cellular functions, such as centrosome duplication, DNA repair, and nuclear mRNA export. The intrinsic molecular flexibility and the self-association tendency make difficult the structural characterization of the integral protein. In this paper we report the solution structure, the Ca2+ binding properties, and the intermolecular interactions of the N-terminal domain of two human centrin isoforms, HsCen1 and HsCen2. In the absence of Ca2+, the N-terminal construct of HsCen2 revealed a compact core conformation including four almost antiparallel alpha-helices and a short antiparallel beta-sheet, very similar to the apo state structure of other calcium regulatory EF-hand domains. The first 25 residues show a highly irregular and dynamic structure. The three-dimensional model for the N-terminal domain of HsCen1, based on the high sequence conservation and NMR spectroscopic data, shows very close structural properties. Ca2+ titration of the apo-N-terminal domain of HsCen1 and HsCen2, monitored by NMR spectroscopy, revealed a very weak affinity (10(2)-10(3) M(-1)), suggesting that the cellular role of this domain is not calcium dependent. Isothermal calorimetric titrations showed that an 18-residue peptide, derived from the N-terminal unstructured fragment, has a significant affinity (approximately 10(5) M(-1)) for the isolated C-terminal domain, suggesting an active role in the self-assembly of centrin molecules.
