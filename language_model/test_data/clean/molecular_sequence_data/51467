Apple cell walls or alkali-extracted xyloglucans were digested with an endo-glucanase from Trichoderma viride and the resulting oligosaccharides were isolated by chromatography on Bio-Gel P-4. Three main oligosaccharides were present in similar proportions, and their structures were shown to be [Xyl(Glc)]3-Glc, [Xyl(Glc)]2-(FucGalXyl)Glc-Glc, and XylGlc-(GalXyP)Glc-(FucGalXyl)Glc-Glc. Each non-reducing-end Glc was 6-linked, each reducing-end Glc was 4-substituted, and each other Glc was 4,6-disubstituted. The Xyl was either terminal or 2-substituted, the Fuc was terminal, and the Gal was either terminal or 2-substituted. The 1H-NMR spectra of the oligosaccharides extracted directly from the cell wall showed that they are not acetylated. Other oligosaccharides, notably GalXyl3Glc4, Xyl2Glc4, and Xyl2Glc3, were present in smaller proportions in the digest of the cell walls.
