The pigment-dispersing hormone (PDH) is produced in the eyestalks of Crustacea where it induces light-adapting movements of pigment in the compound eye and regulates the pigment dispersion in the chromatophores. To study this hormone at the mRNA level, we cloned and sequenced cDNA encoding PDH in the crayfish Orconectes limosus. The structure of the PDH preprohormone consists of a signal peptide, a PDH precursor-related peptide (PPRP) and the highly conserved PDH peptide at the carboxy-terminal end. In situ hybridization in combination with immunocytochemistry revealed four cell clusters expressing PDH in the optic ganglia of the eyestalk. Three clusters stained both with the PDH cRNA probe and the PDH antiserum, however, the perikarya in the lamina ganglionaris (LG) only stained with the PDH antiserum, suggesting the presence of a PDH-like peptide in the LG.
