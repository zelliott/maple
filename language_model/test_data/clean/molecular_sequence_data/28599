Vertically transmitted endogenous retroviruses pose an infectious risk in the course of pig-to-human transplantation of cells, tissues, and organs. Two classes of polytropic type C porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) productively infect human cells in vitro. The cloning and characterization of replication-competent PERV-B sequences from infected human cells (F. Czauderna, N. Fischer, K. Boller, R. Kurth, and R. R. Tönjes, J. Virol. 74:4028-4038, 2000) as well as the cloning of functional PERV-A and -B sequences from porcine cell line PK15 (U. Krach, N. Fischer, F. Czauderna, and R. R. Tönjes, J. Virol. 75:5465-5472, 2001) have been previously described. Here we report the isolation of four full-length proviral sequences from a porcine bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library that comprises chromosomally assigned PERV. Clones Bac-PERV-A(130A12) and Bac-PERV-A(151B10) map to pig chromosome 1 and demonstrate close homology to PK15-PERV-A(58) in env and to PERV-MSL in long terminal repeat (LTR), gag, and pro/pol sequences. Clone Bac-PERV-A(463H12) is located on pig chromosome 3 and demonstrates close homology to PK15-PERV-A(58) in env and to 293-PERV-B(43) in LTR, gag, and pro/pol (Czauderna et al.; R. R. Tönjes, F. Czauderna, N. Fischer, U. Krach, K. Boller, P. Chardon, C. Rogel-Gailard, M. Niebert, G. Scheef, A. Werner, and R. Kurth, Transplant Proc. 32:1158-1161, 2000). Clone Bac-PERV-B(192B9) is located on pig chromosome 7 in the swine leukocyte antigen region and is highly homologous with but distinct from the previously described functional clone 293-PERV-B(43) and bears the number of repeats initially observed in the LTRs of clone 293-PERV-A(42) (Czauderna et al.; Krach et al.). Clones Bac-PERV-A(130A12), Bac-PERV-A(151B10), and Bac-PERV-A(463H12) were replication competent upon transfection into susceptible 293 and HeLa cells. Bac-PERV-B(192B9), however, bears two stop codons in pro/pol preventing this clone from being replication competent in some individual pigs, but initial screenings indicate that this provirus might be intact in others. The data suggest that the porcine genome harbors a limited number of infectious PERV sequences, allowing for specific screening in different pig breeds.
