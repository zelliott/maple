The evolutionary dynamics of 22 variants of cucumber mosaic virus satellite RNA (CMV satRNA) isolated in Italy during virus epidemics from 1988 to 1993 were investigated on the basis of their primary structure and biological properties. Most of the variants were amplified from total nucleic acid preparations extracted from field-infected plants, thus representing wild isolates of CMV satRNA. Eleven variants were associated with subgroup II CMV strains, 10 with subgroup I and 1 with a mixed infection by both strains. When inoculated onto tomato seedlings, the variants induced the phenotype (necrogenic or ameliorative) predicted by their nucleotide sequence. Phylogenetic relationships between the satRNA variants were determined using the stationary Markov model, a stochastic model for evolution. For each satRNA, the Markov analysis gave a good correlation between position in the phylogenetic tree and biological properties. The variants with ameliorative and necrogenic phenotypes in tomato followed two different evolutionary dynamics in nature. Tfn-satRNA, a 390-nt-long molecule, followed a third type of evolutionary dynamic far apart from that of the shorter satRNA molecules (i.e., those in the 334- to 340-nt-length class). Average values of the mean constant rate of nucleotide substitutions/site (Ksubs/site) indicated that in nature the variants tend to keep their heterogeneity unchanged from one epidemic episode to the other, even if the outbreaks occur in places very far from each other. This seems to be in agreement with the proposed maintenance of a functional molecular structure as a constraint to CMV satRNA evolution.
