Radixin is a member of the ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) family of cytoskeletal linkers. We have cloned chicken radixin as a 4.3 kb cDNA, which encodes an 80 kDa protein that is more than 98% identical to radixin from evolutionarily diverse species. High sequence homology (70-80%) also extends into the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the radixin gene. The 3'-UTR of moesin, but not ezrin, was also conserved, suggesting an essential, and possibly specific, regulatory function. A distinct pattern of radixin expression is seen in chicken tissues, suggesting a cell-type-specific function.
