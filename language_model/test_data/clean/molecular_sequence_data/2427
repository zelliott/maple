Accumulation of unusually high amounts of larger-than-normal c-myc mRNAs occurs in two mouse plasmacytomas, TEPC 1165 and TEPC 2027. Southern blot and DNA sequence analyses showed that both tumors have undergone translocations of immunoglobulin heavy chain loci to positions 5' of the c-myc gene promotors resulting in removal of DNA sequences encoding a negative transcriptional regulatory element. In contrast to other mouse plasmacytomas, TEPC 1165 and TEPC 2027 rearranged myc genes show increased transcription, partially explaining their abundance of myc RNA. Similar to other mouse plasmacytomas, the abundance of myc RNA in TEPC 1165 and TEPC 2027 is also influenced by increased stability of structurally atypical myc RNAs. Two myc mRNAs are found in TEPC 2027, a 2.4 kb species including all 3 myc exons and a 4.0 kb species with the 3 exons plus the first intron. The two major myc mRNAs in TEPC 1165, 3.0 and 3.9 kb species, also include all three myc exons plus portions of the first intron. S1 nuclease protection analyses show that the 5' initiation and 3' untranslated (UT) regions of the unusual TEPC 1165 RNAs are normal showing that the size differences arise solely from inclusion of first intron sequences in the large myc RNAs. DNA sequence analysis showed that the presence of first intron sequences in the large myc RNAs is due to mutations affecting the splice donor region at the 3' end of exon 1 in both tumors. SDS-PAGE analysis of immunoprecipitated TEPC 1165 and TEPC 2027 myc proteins showed them to be of normal electrophoretic mobility but no more abundant than in a pre-B cell line 18-81 that contains at least 10 fold less myc RNA. The 4.0 kb myc mRNA of TEPC 2027 is atypically stable while the 2.4 kb myc mRNA undergoes normal rapid turnover within the same cell, demonstrating that the presence of first intron sequences in the large myc RNA stabilizes it despite the presence of 3' UT and putative exon 1 destabilizing sequences. These results show that myc intron 1 sequences can counteract the effect of 3' UT region destabilizing sequences in myc RNA and suggest that the increased myc RNA stability noted in TEPC 1165 and TEPC 2027 is largely due to the presence of the intron 1 sequences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
