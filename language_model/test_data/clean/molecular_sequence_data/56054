Five tridecapeptides have been identified from the central nervous system of the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. The sequences are Pro-Xaa-Asp-Arg-Ile-Ser-Yaa-Ser-Ala-Phe-Ser-Asp-Phe. NH2, where Xaa is either Tyr or Phe and Yaa either Asn, Ser or Gly. The peptides are named lymnaDFamides to acknowledge identity with the C-terminal dipeptide of the mammalian neuropeptides, cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin. They were detected by an antiserum that recognizes the biologically active C-termini of cholecystokinin and gastrin. LymnaDFamide-1 (Xaa = Tyr and Yaa = Asn) had no effect on trout gallbladder, which responds equally to CCK and gastrin. We propose that the lymnaDFamides belong to an Asp-Phe-amide superfamily, which includes CCK and gastrin, and suggest that the widespread CCK/gastrin immunoreactivity in invertebrates is due to peptides belonging to such a superfamily.
