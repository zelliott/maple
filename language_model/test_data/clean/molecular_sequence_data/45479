Two full-length cDNAs, encoding delta (delta) and mu (mu) opioid receptors, were cloned from the brain of the rough-skinned newt Taricha granulosa, complementing previous work from our laboratory describing the cloning of newt brain kappa (kappa) and ORL1 opioid receptors. The newt delta receptor shares 82% amino acid sequence identity with a frog delta receptor and lower (68-70%) identity with orthologous receptors cloned from mammals and zebrafish. The newt mu receptor shares 79% sequence identity with a frog mu receptor, 72% identity with mammalian mu receptors, and 66-69% identity with mu receptors cloned from teleost fishes. Membranes isolated from COS-7 cells transiently expressing the newt delta receptor possessed a single, high-affinity (Kd = 2.4 nM) binding site for the nonselective opioid antagonist [3H]naloxone. In competition binding assays, the newt delta receptor displayed highest affinity for Met-enkephalin, relatively low affinity for Leu-enkephalin, beta-endorphin, and [D-penicillamine, D-penicillamine] enkephalin (DPDPE) (a delta-selective agonist in mammals), and very low affinity for mu-, kappa-, or ORL1-selective agonists. COS-7 cells expressing the newt mu receptor also possessed a high-affinity (Kd = 0.44 nM) naloxone-binding site that showed highest affinity for beta-endorphin, moderate-to-low affinity for Met-enkephalin and Leu-enkephalin and DAMGO (a mu-selective agonist in mammals), and very low affinity for DPDPE and kappa- or ORL1-selective agonists. COS-7 cells expressing either receptor type (delta or mu) showed very high affinity (Kd = 0.1-0.3 nM) for the nonselective opioid antagonist diprenorphine. Taricha granulosa expresses the same four subtypes (delta, mu, kappa, and ORL1) of opioid receptors found in other vertebrate classes, but ligand selectivity appears less stringent in the newt than has been documented in mammals.
