The complete sequence of adeno-associated virus type 1 (AAV-1) was defined. Its genome of 4,718 nucleotides demonstrates high homology with those of other AAV serotypes, including AAV-6, which appears to have arisen from homologous recombination between AAV-1 and AAV-2. Analysis of sera from nonhuman and human primates for neutralizing antibodies (NAB) against AAV-1 and AAV-2 revealed the following. (i) NAB to AAV-1 are more common than NAB to AAV-2 in nonhuman primates, while the reverse is true in humans; and (ii) sera from 36% of nonhuman primates neutralized AAV-1 but not AAV-2, while sera from 8% of humans neutralized AAV-2 but not AAV-1. An infectious clone of AAV-1 was isolated from a replicated monomer form, and vectors were created with AAV-2 inverted terminal repeats and AAV-1 Rep and Cap functions. Both AAV-1- and AAV-2-based vectors transduced murine liver and muscle in vivo; AAV-1 was more efficient for muscle, while AAV-2 transduced liver more efficiently. Strong NAB responses were detected for each vector administered to murine skeletal muscle; these responses prevented readministration of the same serotype but did not substantially cross-neutralize the other serotype. Similar results were observed in the context of liver-directed gene transfer, except for a significant, but incomplete, neutralization of AAV-1 from a previous treatment with AAV-2. Vectors based on AAV-1 may be preferred in some applications of human gene therapy.
