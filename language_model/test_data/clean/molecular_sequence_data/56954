Olfactory receptors are believed to be encoded by an extremely large subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. A human gene (OLFR1) encoding a member of this family was cloned from a genomic library by cross-hybridization with a gene fragment obtained by the polymerase chain reaction. The nucleotide sequence of a 3.4-kb EcoRI fragment was determined, and the protein sequence was deduced from the single open reading frame. The gene was assigned by in situ hybridization of metaphase chromosomes to the 17p13-->p12 region of the human genome, in proximity to the tumor-suppressor gene encoding p53. When used as a probe on Southern blots under moderately stringent conditions, it hybridizes to at least three closely related genes. A restriction fragment length polymorphism was detected after MspI digestion. Mendelian segregation of the gene was assessed in three CEPH families, and linkage analysis confirmed the localization of the locus.
