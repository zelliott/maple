Three rat BV13S1 alleles (T-cell receptor beta-chain variable gene 13) were characterized by new BV13S1-allele specific monoclonal antibodies (18B1 and 17D5) and sequence analysis of expressed and genomic BV13S1. Two alleles were functional and designated BV13S1A1 present in strains LEW, BUF, PVG, and BV13S1A2 present in BN and WF. Their products differed by six amino acids, two of them in complementarity-determing region (CDR)1 and one in CDR2. A third nonfunctional allele, BV13S1A3P, was found in strains F344 and DA. Apart from a single nucleotide insertion, it was identical to BV13S1A2. All 12 rat strains tested showed association of TCRBC1 with BV8S2/4 alleles but not with the BV13S1 alleles, which may reflect a different gene order of the rat BV compared to mouse. BV13S1A1-encoded T-cell receptors (TCRs) which bind both monoclonal antibody (mAb) 18B1 and mAb 17D5 are over-represented in the CD4 lymphocyte subset. BV13S1A2-encoded TCRs which are stained by mAb 18B1 but not by mAb 17D5 show a slight CD8-biased expression. Preferential usage of BV13S1A1-positive TCRs by CD4 but not by CD8 cells in (LEW x WF)F1 hybrids and cosegregation of BV13SA1 and increased frequency of BV13S1 TCR-positive CD4 cells in a (LEW x BN)x BN backcross suggest structural differences of the two allelic products as the reason for their contrasting CD4/CD8 subset bias.
