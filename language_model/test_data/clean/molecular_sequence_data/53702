A pituitary hormone, prolactin (PRL) shows various effects on cellular metabolism in amphibians, such as stimulation of larval tissue growth and inhibition of metamorphic changes. All these effects are mediated by its cell surface receptor. However, lack of information on PRL receptor (PRL-R) gene expression has made the physiological importance of the PRL/PRL-R system obscure in amphibian metamorphosis. Hence, a Xenopus PRL-R cDNA was cloned, its structure was characterized, and specific binding of PRL to Xenopus PRL-R expressed in COS-7 cells was confirmed. In adult tissues, high level expression was found in the lung, heart, brain, thymus and skin, and low level in the oviduct, kidney and spinal cord. The developmental expression pattern showed that PRL-R messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was expressed in the brain and tail from premetamorphosis and the level increased toward late metamorphosis, suggesting that PRL may inhibit the metamorphic changes in those organs. The level of brain PRL-R mRNA reached a peak just at the start of the metamorphic climax stages and then decreased, whereas in the tail, mRNA expression peaked at late metamorphosis. In the kidney, mRNA expression increased and reached a maximum level at the end of metamorphosis. The results obtained were discussed in relation to metamorphosis.
