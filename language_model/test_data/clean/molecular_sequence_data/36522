Pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP) is a ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) that inactivates ribosomes by the removal of a single adenine from ribosomal RNA. The studies summarized in our review concern the nature and application of this novel therapeutic agent. We describe how researchers continue to elucidate the structure and biologic activity of RIPs. Pokeweed antiviral protein is among the RIPs that have been conjugated to selective monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of several human cancers and viral diseases. Clinical trials using PAP immunotoxins for the treatment of leukemia have been particularly encouraging.
