Species status of the already described methylotrophic bacteria has been specified, and new isolates have been identified. The bacteria under study are classified as those from Methylobacterium genus on the basis of a set of diagnostic characteristics (they are capable to assimilate, besides methanol, other organic substances; to realize serine cycle of one-carbon compounds assimilation, to form rast-coloured colonies; they can form rosy-coloured colonies). As a result of the study of phenotypical characteristics in 14 strains of Methylobacterium and sequence-analysis of the gene 16S pRNA two strains: T-2 (=UKM B-3357) and strain ch-8 (=UKM B-3352) are identified as M. mesophilicum, strain A-5 (=UKM B-3381)--as M. extorquens; several strains were reclassified. The strain 9-17 (=UKM B-3339) is related to the species M. zatmanii (described before as M. organophilum), strain 13-17 (=UKM B-3342)--to the species M. fujisawaense (formerly--M. organophilum), K-2 (=UKM B-3351)--to the species M. fujisawaense (formerly--M. extorquens). Phenotypical characteristics differentiating the studied species of Methylobacterium are suggested. Identification of the strains of Methylobacterium genus based on sequence analysis of genes 16S pRNA is in agreement with the results obtained when studying phenotypical properties.
