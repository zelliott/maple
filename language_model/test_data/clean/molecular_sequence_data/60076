Novel Eubacterium-like isolates, strains 12-3T and KV43-B, which were isolated from the periodontal pocket of an adult patient with periodontal disease and necrotic dental pulp, respectively, were studied taxonomically and phylogenetically. The morphological and differential biochemical characteristics of these organisms are also described in this paper. These organisms were Gram-positive, anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria that were inert in most of the conventional biochemical tests and closely resembled members of asaccharolytic oral Eubacterium species. On the other hand, protein profiles of whole cells in SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting reaction analysis distinguished these isolates from strains of the previously described genus Eubacterium. The G+C content of the DNAs from the novel isolates was 50 and 51 mol%, respectively. The levels of DNA-DNA relatedness to other asaccharolytic oral Eubacterium species, including Eubacterium brachy, Eubacterium lentum, Eubacterium nodatum, Eubacterium timidum, Eubacterium saphenum, Eubacterium minutum and Eubacterium exiguum, was less than 11%. These organisms also exhibited a very low level of reassociation with the DNA of Eubacterium limosum, the type species of the genus Eubacterium. The results of 16S rDNA sequence comparisons revealed that these organisms represent a novel lineage distinct from all previously described genera of Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria. On the basis of our results, it is suggested that strains 12-3T and KV43-B should be classified in a new genus and species, for which the name Cryptobacterium curtum gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Cryptobacterium curtum is 12-3T (= ATCC 700683T).
