In a subset of B-cell malignancies, the genes encoding members of the cyclin D familiy are juxtaposed to immunoglobulin loci through recurrent chromosomal translocations. Here, we identified the gene encoding cyclin E1 as novel translocation partner of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus involved in a t(14;19)(q32;q12) in a case of t(8;14)(q24;q32) IGH-MYC-positive leukemic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The translocation breakpoints were cloned and mapped to the switch region Salpha1 of IGH in 14q32 and approximately 60kb centromeric to CCNE1 in 19q12. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed overexpression of the cyclin E1 protein in this case, which to a comparable extent was observed in 3/41 independent DLBCL. These data indicate that cyclin E1 may act as a novel oncogene in B-cell lymphomagenesis.
