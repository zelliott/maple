This report discusses the identification of a Zn(2+)- and Cd(2+)-binding protein of Xenopus laevis that is abundant in vitellogenic oocytes and in embryos from fertilization to stage 46. Oocyte or embryo homogenates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with 65Zn2+ or 109Cd2+. The resulting autoradiograms showed binding of both radionuclides to a protein, designated pCdZn. Freon extraction of oocyte and embryo homogenates showed pCdZn to be a yolk protein. When pCdZn was isolated from oocyte homogenates by ammonium sulfate precipitation, delipidation, and chromatography, it co-purified with lipovitellin 1. The amino acid composition of pCdZn closely resembled the reported composition of lipovitellin 1 and the molecular weight of purified pCdZn (approximately 115 kD) corresponded to reported values for lipovitellin 1 (111-121 kD). Amino acid sequence analyses of five peptides derived from pCdZn yielded 94% identity to the reported sequence of lipovitellin 1, deduced from the DNA sequence of the Xenopus vitellogenin A2 precursor gene. Based on these findings, pCdZn was identified as lipovitellin 1. This study suggests that lipovitellin 1 is the major storage protein for zinc in mature oocytes and developing embryos of Xenopus laevis.
