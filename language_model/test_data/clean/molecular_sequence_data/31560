A novel fusion cytokine was constructed by replacing signal peptide (SP) of chicken IL-15 (ChIL-15) with SP of chicken IL-2 (ChIL-2). The fusion cytokine (NChIL-15) was cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) to generate pcDNA-NChIL-15. An animal experiment was carried out to evaluate the adjuvant effects of NChIL-15 on DNA vaccine pcDNA-3-1E against Eimeria acervulina challenge. The mRNA profiles of ChIL-2 and ChIFN-γ in spleen were characterized by means of real-time PCR. The recombinant positive eukaryotic expression plasmid pcDNA-NChIL-15 were constructed successfully. The protective effects provided by co-immunization with 100 μg pcDNA-3-1E and 50 μg pcDNA-NChIL-15, measured by relative body weight gain (BWG), average lesion score in duodenum and oocyst decrease ratio, showed no significant difference with 50 μg pcDNA-ChIL-15 as an adjuvant on day 6 post infection (PI). However, chickens co-immunized with pcDNA-3-1E and pcDNA-NChIL-15 exhibited significant upregulated level of ChIL-2 and ChIFN-γ transcripts in spleen. Our original data suggests the constructed novel cytokine NChIL-15 could be a potential adjuvant used to enhance the immune protective effects, although the optimized dosage need to be explored further.
