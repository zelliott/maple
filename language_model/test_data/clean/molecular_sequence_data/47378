The HemA enzyme (glutamyl-tRNA reductase) catalyzes the first committed step in heme biosynthesis in the enteric bacteria. HemA is mainly regulated by conditional protein stability; it is stable and, consequently, more abundant in heme-limited cells but unstable and less abundant in normally growing cells. Both the Lon and ClpAP energy-dependent proteases contribute to HemA turnover in vivo. Here we report that the addition of two positively charged lysine residues to the third and fourth positions at the HemA N terminus resulted in complete stabilization of the protein. By contrast, the addition of an N-terminal myc epitope tag did not affect turnover. This result confirms the importance of the N-terminal sequence for proteolysis of HemA. This region of the protein also contains a proline flanked by hydrophobic residues, a motif that has been suggested to be important for Lon-mediated proteolysis of UmuD. However, mutation of this motif did not affect the turnover of HemA protein. Cells expressing the stabilized HemA[KK] mutant protein display substantial defects in heme regulation.
