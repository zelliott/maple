Inositol monophosphatases (IMPases) are lithium-sensitive enzymes that participate in the inositol cycle of calcium signalling and in inositol biosynthesis. Two open reading frames (YHR046c and YDR287w) with homology to animal and plant IMPases are present in the yeast genome. The two recombinant purified proteins were shown to catalyse inositol-1-phosphate hydrolysis sensitive to lithium and sodium. A double gene disruption had no apparent growth defect and was not auxotroph for inositol. Therefore, lithium effects in yeast cannot be explained by inhibition of IMPases and inositol depletion, as suggested for animal systems. Overexpression of yeast IMPases increased lithium and sodium tolerance and reduced the intracellular accumulation of lithium. This phenotype was blocked by a null mutation in the cation-extrusion ATPase encoded by the ENA1/PMR2A gene, but it was not affected by inositol supplementation. As overexpression of IMPases increased intracellular free Ca2+, it is suggested that yeast IMPases are limiting for the optimal operation of the inositol cycle of calcium signalling, which modulates the Ena1 cation-extrusion ATPase.
