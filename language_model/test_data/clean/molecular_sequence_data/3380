A physical map of the Enterococcus faecium ATCC19434 chromosome was constructed by NotI, I-CeuI and Sse8387I. The chromosome was a circular DNA of 2600 kb in size, and contained six rRNA operons (rrn). The locations and orientations of the six rrn operons and 24 different determinants were mapped. Genomes of three additional E. faecium strains were also analyzed by I-CeuI digestion, and the genome sizes were found to vary from 2550 to 2995 kb. We further investigated the genome sizes and number of rrn operons in four E. faecalis, one E. avium, and one E. durans strains. The genome sizes were larger than E. faecium: 3000-3250 kb in E. faecalis, 3445 kb in E. avium, and 3070 kb in E. durans. E. avium and E. durans contained six rrn operons as in E. faecium, but all the E. faecalis strains possessed four rrn operons.
