Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is a lentivirus that replicates predominantly in mature tissue macrophages. Viral expression is strongly influenced by the state of differentiation of the host cell. While blood monocytes can be infected, viral transcription is limited until the cell differentiates into a mature macrophage. Activation of mature macrophages infected with EIAV might also alter viral expression, presumably through binding of cellular transcription factors to viral nucleic acid sequences within the long terminal repeat (LTR). Using DNA amplification techniques, we compared LTR sequences of U.S. field strains of EIAV to sequences of a laboratory adapted strain of the virus. All field strain sequences were more closely related to Wyoming strain than to the Malmquist laboratory adapted strain or a previously sequenced infectious molecular clone of EIAV. Primary equine monocyte-derived macrophage cultures were infected with virulent and avirulent strains of EIAV and the effects of macrophage stimulation on EIAV expression were determined. Stimulation of macrophages with phorbol ester activated the cells to secrete tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). This activation signal also resulted in a significant downregulation of viral expression as determined by supernatant reverse transcriptase activity. This effect occurred independent of the virulence of the virus strain used or the nucleic acid sequence of the viral LTR. This may represent an adaptive response of EIAV to evade the host immune response and establish a persistent infection.
