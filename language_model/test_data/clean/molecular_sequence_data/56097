We have screened the 27 exons of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene in 87 non-delta F508 chromosomes of Breton origin using the combined techniques of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing. By this process, we have detected a new missense mutation, G91R, which results in an arginine for glycine at codon 91. Three affected patients with a delta F508/G91R genotype are pancreatic sufficient. Such observations could facilitate a better understanding of the functional importance of different regions of the encoded product and of the pathogenesis of the disease.
