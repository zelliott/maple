A differential screen of a tomato root hair cDNA library resulted in the cloning of two cDNAs, Dif10 and Dif54, whose corresponding genes are preferentially expressed in root hair cells as determined by analysis of mRNA levels in various tomato organs. Transcript levels showed no increase in leaves subjected to hormonal and environmental stress treatments. Sequence analysis of the cDNAs revealed high similarity to members of the extension family. Extensions are hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) located in the cell wall. In order to study the functional significance of HRGPs in root hairs, tomato seedling roots were treated with micromolar concentrations of 3,4-dehydro-L-proline (Dhp), a selective inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylase. Dhp treatment resulted in changes in root growth and the development of root hairs with reduced hair length, suggesting an important role of HRGPs in hair morphogenesis.
