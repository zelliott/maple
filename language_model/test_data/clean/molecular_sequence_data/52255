The rat liver mitochondrial epsilon-subunit, coupling factor 6, subunit d, and subunit e of H(+)-ATP synthase, which are all extra subunits with no counterparts in Escherichia coli, were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The complete amino acid sequence of the rat epsilon-subunit was determined by automated Edman degradation of the whole protein and derived peptides. The protein contains 50 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 5635 kDa. It is a basic hydrophilic protein with an isoelectric point of 10.5. The sequence of the rat epsilon-subunit is highly homologous with that of the epsilon-subunit of bovine heart and slightly similar to those of the epsilon-subunit of the yeast and sweet potato mitochondria. However, it has no homology with any subunit of bacterial or chloroplast H(+)-ATP synthase.
