To identify the Entamoeba histolytica antigens capable of inducing secretory IgA (sIgA) responses in humans, a cDNA library from the strain HM1:IMSS was immuno-screened with saliva from patients with intestinal amebiasis or amebic liver abscess. Clones isolated with sIgA antibodies from patients with intestinal amebiasis corresponded to the known serine-rich protein isoform, a 29 kDa cysteine-rich protein and 1-alpha elongation factor. Clones corresponding to enolase, cyclophilin, ribosomal protein L23a, and an Hsp70 family protein were isolated with sIgA from a patient with amebic liver abscess. A glutamic acid-rich peptide (EhGARP) positive with sIgA from a patient with amebic liver abscess was also isolated; for EhGARP, no homologs were found in the protein databases. The antigens isolated are potentially useful in the development of an oral vaccine or new diagnostic tools for amebiasis.
