We cloned and characterized the canine A3 adenosine receptor (AR) and examined AR-induced degranulation of the BR line of canine mastocytoma cells. Canine A3AR transcript is found predominantly in spleen, lung, liver, and testes and encodes a 314-amino acid heptahelical receptor. 125I-N6-Aminobenzyladenosine binds to two affinity states of canine A3AR with KD values of 0.7 +/- 0.1 and 16 +/- 0.8 nM, reflecting G protein-coupled and -uncoupled receptors, respectively. Xanthine antagonists bind with similar affinities to human, canine, and rabbit receptors but with 80-400-fold lower affinities to rat A3AR. Although canine BR mastocytoma cells contain A1AR, A2BAR, and A3AR, degranulation seems to be mediated primarily by A2BARs stimulated by the nonselective agonist 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) but not by the A3-selective agonist N6-(3-iodobenzyl)adenosine-5'-N-methylcarboxamide. NECA-stimulated degranulation is not prevented by pertussis toxin and is blocked by enprofylline (Ki = 7 microM), an antiasthmatic xanthine with low affinity (Ki > 100 microM) for A1AR, A2AAR, and A3AR. NECA increases canine mastocytoma cell cAMP, Ca2+, and inositol trisphosphate levels; these responses are antagonized half-maximally by 7-15 microM enprofylline. The results suggest that (i) the cloned canine A3AR is structurally and pharmacologically more similar to human than to rat A3AR; (ii) the A2BAR, and not the A1AR or A3AR, is principally responsible for adenosine-mediated degranulation of canine BR mastocytoma cells; and (iii) the BR cell A2BAR couples to both Ca2+ mobilization and cAMP accumulation. Although A2B receptors play a major role in the regulation of BR mast cell degranulation, multiple AR subtypes and G proteins may influence mast cell functions.
