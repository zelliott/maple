The three-dimensional structure of the homeodomain, as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, reveals the presence of a helix-turn-helix motif, similar to the one found in prokaryotic gene regulatory proteins. Isolated homeodomains bind with high affinity to specific DNA sequences. Thus, the structure-function relationship is highly conserved in evolution.
