A previously unreported DNA unwinding enzyme, referred to as the 75-kDa helicase, was recently purified from Escherichia coli cell extracts and biochemically characterized (Wood, E. R., and Matson, S. W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 15269-15276). In order to initiate the genetic analysis of the 75-kDa helicase, the gene encoding this enzyme was cloned. DNA sequencing confirmed the identity of the gene since the predicted amino acid sequence of the encoded polypeptide precisely matched the sequence of the first 27 NH2-terminal amino acid residues of the 75-kDa helicase as determined by peptide sequencing. The predicted amino acid sequence of the 75-kDa helicase is similar in several regions to the amino acid sequences of two other E. coli helicases, Rep protein and helicase II. The gene encoding the 75-kDa helicase was mapped to 22 min on the E. coli chromosome. We propose that this newly defined locus be referred to as helD, and, to avoid confusion with other E. coli helicases with a similar molecular size, we propose that the 75-kDa helicase be referred to as helicase IV.
