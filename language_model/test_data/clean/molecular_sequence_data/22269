Extensive trypsinization of Na,K-ATPase from the salt gland of Squalus acanthias removes about half of the extramembranous protein mass of the alpha-subunit, while leaving the beta-subunit intact. Sequence analysis and epitope recognition of the remaining alpha-peptides show that transmembrane segments M1/M2 and M3/M4 are present when trypsinization is performed in either NaCl or RbCl. The M5/M6 segment and the intact 19-kDa peptide (M7-M10) are detected in Rb-trypsinized membranes but not in Na-trypsinized membranes. The L7/L8 loop is associated with Na-trypsinized membranes, indicating the presence of an M7/M8 or M8/M9 fragment. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy of both Rb- and Na-trypsinized membranes reveals intramembranous particles that indicate a retained cluster of peptides, even in the absence of an intact 19-kDa fragment. The rotational diffusion of covalently spin-labeled trypsinized complexes is studied in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol) or glycerol by using saturation transfer electron spin resonance. Rotational correlation times in aqueous poly(ethylene glycol) are longer than in glycerol solutions of the same viscosity and increase nonlinearly with the viscosity of the suspending medium, indicating that poly(ethylene glycol) induces aggregation of the tryptic peptides (and beta-subunit) within the membrane. The aggregates of enzyme trypsinized in the presence of NaCl are larger than those for enzyme trypsinized in RbCl, at both low and high aqueous viscosities. Similarities in mobility for native and Rb-trypsinized enzymes suggest either a change in average orientation of the spin-label upon trypsinization or that trypsinization leads to a reorganized protein structure that is more prone to aggregation.
