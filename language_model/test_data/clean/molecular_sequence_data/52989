Prolonged exposure to asbestos, a potent carcinogen, has been the generally accepted factor responsible for the development of human mesotheliomas. Recent reports documenting the detection of SV40 DNA in human mesotheliomas suggest the possibility that this known tumor virus may be an additional factor involved in the development of some tumors.

A detailed analysis was performed by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing of the genetic characteristics of SV40 viral DNA detected in samples taken from multiple sites of a human mesothelioma.

A single virus variant was detected within the tumor that encoded a novel variable region at the C-terminus of the large T-antigen oncoprotein. The viral regulatory region was predominantly archetypal in sequence (lacking duplications of the enhancer), typical of natural isolates.

These data confirm previous reports from several laboratories showing an association of SV40 DNA with human mesotheliomas and provide the first evidence of a novel virus variant present in separated regions of a mesothelioma.
