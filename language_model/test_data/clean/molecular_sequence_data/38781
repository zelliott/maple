To assess the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in Republic of Congo (Congo), we investigated 29 HIV-1s obtained from 82 Congolese AIDS and ARC patients in 1996 and 1997. Part of the env region including the V3 loop was phylogenetically analyzed. The genotypes observed were varied: of 29 specimens, 12 (41 %) were subtype A, 1 (3%) was subtype D, 6 (21%) were subtype G, 6 (21%) were subtype H, 2 (7%) were subtype J, and 2 (7%) could not be classified as any known subtypes (U, unclassified). The heterogeneous profile of HIV-1 infection was different from the profiles of neighboring Central African countries. These data show that subtypes G and H as well as subtype A were circulating with high prevalence. The fact that new genetic subtypes (J and U) are circulating indicates a need for a greater surveillance for these subtypes both in Congo as well as in other parts of the world.
