We have characterized a panel of 6 monoclonal antibodies raised against human platelet talin by Western blotting, immune precipitation, and immunofluorescence, and shown that antibodies TA205 and TD77 disrupt actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, and inhibit cell motility when microinjected into human fibroblasts. Using a series of chick talin fusion proteins spanning the entire length of the molecule, we have mapped the epitopes recognized by these antibodies to the conserved N- and C-terminal regions of the protein. TA205 bound to an epitope contained within residues 139-433, a region which overlaps an F-actin binding site, and which shows homology with the ezrin/radixin/moesin family of cytoskeletal proteins. The epitope recognized by TD77 was located within the C-terminal region of the protein (residues 2269-2541) which also contains an F-actin binding site homologous to that in the yeast actin-binding protein SIa2p. To investigate the possibility that TD77 disrupts actin stress fibers by binding directly to the C-terminal actin binding site, additional talin fusion proteins were generated and analyzed for TD77 and actin binding. Fusion proteins containing residues 2269-2541, 2304-2541, and 2304-2463 all cosedimented with F-actin, whereas TD77 did not recognize the latter fusion protein. These results show that the C-terminal actin-binding site is distinct from the region recognized by the anti-functional antibody TD77, raising the possibility that it binds to a novel functionally important ligand-binding site in the talin molecule.
