Stimuli-responsive hydrogel matrices have attracted great attention in biomedical and biotechnological fields for controlled delivery of bioactive compounds, as well as a vehicle for therapeutic cell spreading. Elastin-derived biomimetic polypeptides are recombinant macromolecules suitable for the realization of smart biomaterials. In this study, we explored the potential of an elastin biomimetic matrix to realize proteolytic stimuli-responsive systems to control the release of substances. Our approach showed that this matrix was susceptible to elastolytic degradation, and it has been successfully employed to obtain an efficient delivery of a model protein. This setup will constitute a therapeutic agent delivery platform to realize devices capable of responding and interacting with biological systems at the molecular level.
