cDNAs coding for three types of alpha-subunits of GTP-binding proteins Gs and G0 (a short form of alpha s with Asp-Ser in positions 71 and 72, a long form of alpha s with the insertion of 16 amino acid residues instead of Asp-Ser (71-72)--both from bovine brain, and alpha 0 from bovine cerebellum as well as some chimeric alpha s/alpha 0 genes were cloned into a modified pGEM-2 plasmid vector under the control of the SP6 promoter. All the genes were in vitro transcribed and translated, and some functional properties of the resulting proteins were determined, such as adenylyl cyclase activation, ADP-ribosylation with pertussis toxin, limited nucleotide-dependent trypsin proteolysis. Parts of the alpha s polypeptide chain necessary for the activation of adenylyl cyclase were mapped. The alpha s domain interacting with adenylyl cyclase is formed by the alpha s polypeptide chain fragments 235-294 and 337-356 (numbering as of the alpha s long form).
