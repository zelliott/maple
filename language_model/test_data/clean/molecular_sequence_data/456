Bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST-2, also known as tetherin) restricts the production of a number of enveloped viruses by blocking virus release from the cell surface. This antiviral activity is counteracted by such viral factors as Vpu of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Here, we report that Vpu antagonizes human BST-2 but not BST-2 derived from African green monkeys. The determinants of susceptibility to Vpu map to the transmembrane domain of BST-2. In accordance with this, expression of human BST-2 containing a modified transmembrane domain effectively blocks the replication of wild-type Vpu-expressing HIV-1 in CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, these BST-2 variants, as opposed to wild-type human BST-2, are refractory to Vpu-mediated down-regulation as a result of an attenuated interaction with Vpu. In view of the work by others pointing to a key role of the transmembrane domain of Vpu in promoting virus release, our data suggest that a direct interaction through the transmembrane domain of each of these two proteins is a prerequisite for Vpu to down-modulate BST-2.
