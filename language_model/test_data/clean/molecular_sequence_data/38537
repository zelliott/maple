A dominant mutation of the elongationless2 (eln2) gene of the mushroom Coprinus cinereus (eln2-1) affects pattern formation in the development of fruit body primordia, causing dumpy primordia which culminate in mature fruit bodies with short stipes. Phenotypic analyses revealed disturbance of tissue organization and cell morphogenesis in the primordial shaft and suggested that the defects in the primordial shaft interfere with differentiation of the stipe tissue in the mutant primordia. The eln2 locus was assigned to chromosome XII and the eln2-1 mutant gene was cloned from a chromosome XII-specific cosmid library as a genomic fragment that brings about the dominant mutant phenotype. The eln2 gene encodes a novel type of microsomal cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP502) and is constitutively expressed. The eln2-1 mutation is a 4-bp deletion in the 3'-terminal region of the gene, leading to truncation of C-terminal 18 amino acids. We suggest that the truncation affects the activity of the CYP502 enzyme.
