Botryosphaeria sarmentorum sp. nov. and B. iberica sp. nov. are described and illustrated. These two species are unusual in this genus because of their brown, 1-septate ascospores. Phylogenetic analysis based on ITS and EF1-alpha sequences place them within the clade containing species with Fusicoccum anamorphs. The brown, 1-septate conidia, however, do not conform to Fusicoccum. Therefore phylogenetically and morphologically the anamorphs of these two species belong in a genus distinct from any of the currently accepted anamorph genera assigned to Botryosphaeria. Through a study of the type species of Dothiorella this genus is resurrected to accommodate anamorphs of Botryosphaeria with brown, 1-septate conidia. Botryosphaeria sarmentorum is shown to be the teleomorph of Diplodia sarmentorum, which in turn is transferred to Dothiorella. Otthia quercus is transferred to Botryosphaeria as B. quercicola nom. nov.
