Infection models for both fresh and seawater salmon were established using a Scottish isolate of infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV). Modes of infection were intra-peritoneal injection, cohabitation and immersion exposure, and a range of doses was tested. Development of these models using a Scottish isolate of ISAV provided an approximation of the minimum infective dose leading to mortality under different infection regimens. The models also allow prediction of the time to first mortality and an estimation of expected total mortality following the various routes of infection. Such knowledge is important to the development of anti-ISAV vaccines and to future studies aimed at understanding the biology of ISAV in general.
