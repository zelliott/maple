Antibodies to DNA are important markers of various autoimmune diseases and can be pathogenic; however, their generation is not understood. We previously reported that anti-DNA antibodies could be induced in mice by idiotypic immunization to PAb-421, an antibody to a DNA-binding domain of p53. We now report that two monoclonal antibodies of moderate affinity (K(D) asymptotically equal to 10(-7)), raised from PAb-421-immunized mice, specifically recognized both PAb-421 and DNA. These antibodies feature multiple arginine residues in the antigen-binding site, a unique characteristic of disease-associated anti-DNA antibodies; nevertheless, these anti-DNA antibodies show specific complementarity to PAb-421 by competing with p53 for PAb-421 binding and recognize defined oligonucleotides with a specificity similar to that of p53. To study the structural basis for the cross-recognition of PAb-421 and DNA by the anti-DNA antibodies, we constructed computer models (fine-tuned by protein-protein docking) of PAb-421 and one of the monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies. The modeled structures manifested structural complementarity. Most notably, the modeled structure of PAb-421 resembled the structure of DNA by the positions of negatively charged groups and aromatic side chains. Thus, a protein molecule may mimic the structure of DNA and the elusive generation of anti-DNA antibodies could be explained by idiotypic immunity to a DNA-binding protein, like p53.
