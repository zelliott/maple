Nvj1p resides in the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) and binds the vacuole membrane protein Vac8p to form nucleus-vacuole (NV) junctions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The induction of NVJ1 expression during starvation results in the sequestration of two additional binding partners, Tsc13p and Osh1p. Here, we map the domains of Nvj1p responsible for ONM targeting and partner binding. ONM targeting requires both the N-terminal signal anchor-like sequence and the topogenic membrane-spanning domain of Nvj1p. The N-terminal signal anchor-like sequence may anchor Nvj1p in the ONM by bridging to the inner nuclear membrane. A region encompassing the membrane-spanning domain is sufficient to bind Tsc13p. Osh1p and Vac8p bind to distinct regions in the cytoplasmic tail of Nvj1p. Overexpression of Nvj1p in trp1 cells causes a growth defect in low tryptophan that is rescued by additional copies of TAT1 or TAT2 tryptophan permeases. Conversely, nvj1-Delta trp1 cells grow faster than NVJ1+ trp1 cells in limiting tryptophan. Importantly, deleting the Osh1p-binding domain of Nvj1p abrogates the tryptophan transport-related growth defect of Nvj1p-overexpressing cells. Therefore, the Nvj1p-dependent sequestration of Osh1p negatively regulates tryptophan uptake from the medium, possible by affecting the trafficking of tryptophan permeases to the plasma membrane.
