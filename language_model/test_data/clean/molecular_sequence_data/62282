Cellular and physiological evidence suggests the presence of a novel class of systemically mobile plant molecules that are recognized by antibodies against vertebrate atrial natriuretic peptides (ANPs). In order to characterize the function of these immunoanalogues we have expressed the full-length recombinant (AtPNP-A[1-126]) and demonstrate that this molecule induces osmoticum-dependent H(2)O uptake into protoplasts at nanomolar concentrations and thus affects cell volume. A similar response is also seen with a recombinant that does not contain the signal peptide (AtPNP-A[26-126]) as well as a short domain (AtPNP-A[33-66]) that shows homology to the vertebrate peptide. Taken together, these findings suggest that AtPNP-A has an important and systemic role in plant growth and homeostasis.
