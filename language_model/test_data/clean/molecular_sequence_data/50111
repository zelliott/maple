Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by many types of cells. It has been shown that two distinct TNF receptors (TNFRs), TNFR type I (TNFR I) and TNFR type II (TNFR II), have different functions in signal transduction, which is possibly associated with the development of a variety of diseases. In this study, we isolated a feline TNFR I cDNA clone and analysed the expression of TNFR I and TNFR II mRNA in feline lymphoid cells. The deduced amino acid sequence of feline TNFRI cDNA showed 75.8, 62.5 60.9 and 72.1% similarity with those of its human, mouse, rat, and pig counterparts, respectively. The feline TNFR I cDNA was shown to encode extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains fundamentally conserved in the homologues of other species. Expression of TNFR I and TNFR II mRNAs was shown to be up-regulated in feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by stimulation with concanavalin A. Five of six feline lymphoma cell lines were shown to express both TNFR I and TNFR II mRNAs. The expression of TNFR I in PBMC was up-regulated in cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), whereas the expression of TNFR II in PBMC was not different between FIV-infected cats and uninfected cats. The present study indicate that expression of TNFR I and TNFR II may be associated with disease progression, especially in retrovirus infections in cats.
