Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) play important roles in nitrogen and carbon cycling in marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we present the draft genome sequence for the ammonia-oxidizing archaeon "Candidatus Nitrosopumilus salaria" BD31, which was enriched in culture from sediments of the San Francisco Bay estuary. The genome sequences revealed many similarities to the genome of Nitrosopumilus maritimus.
