The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify six mitochondrial t-RNAs for Ala, Arg, Asn, Ser, Glu and Phe between genes for mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenases 3 and 5. With respect to Drosophila yakuba the gene order and direction of transcription is completely conserved. Analysis of secondary structure shows complete conservation of the anticodon loops but a number of differences in the dihydrouridine and T psi C loops with respect to Drosophila. However, differences are such that tertiary interactions that stabilize stacking are preserved. The use of the reported sequence in combination with PCR to explore population variability is discussed.
