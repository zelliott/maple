To identify novel regulators of Galpha(o), the most abundant G-protein in brain, we used yeast two-hybrid screening with constitutively active Galpha(o) as bait and identified a new regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) protein, RGS17 (RGSZ2), as a novel human member of the RZ (or A) subfamily of RGS proteins. RGS17 contains an amino-terminal cysteine-rich motif and a carboxyl-terminal RGS domain with highest homology to hRGSZ1- and hRGS-Galpha-interacting protein. RGS17 RNA was strongly expressed as multiple species in cerebellum and other brain regions. The interactions between hRGS17 and active forms of Galpha(i1-3), Galpha(o), Galpha(z), or Galpha(q) but not Galpha(s) were detected by yeast two-hybrid assay, in vitro pull-down assay, and co-immunoprecipitation studies. Recombinant RGS17 acted as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) on free Galpha(i2) and Galpha(o) under pre-steady-state conditions, and on M2-muscarinic receptor-activated Galpha(i1), Galpha(i2), Galpha(i3), Galpha(z), and Galpha(o) in steady-state GTPase assays in vitro. Unlike RGSZ1, which is highly selective for G(z), RGS17 exhibited limited selectivity for G(o) among G(i)/G(o) proteins. All RZ family members reduced dopamine-D2/Galpha(i)-mediated inhibition of cAMP formation and abolished thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor/Galpha(q)-mediated calcium mobilization. RGS17 is a new RZ member that preferentially inhibits receptor signaling via G(i/o), G(z), and G(q) over G(s) to enhance cAMP-dependent signaling and inhibit calcium signaling. Differences observed between in vitro GAP assays and whole-cell signaling suggest additional determinants of the G-protein specificity of RGS GAP effects that could include receptors and effectors.
