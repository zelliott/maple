Adenoviruses are efficient gene transfer vectors for a variety of cell types. To date, the most widely used methods to construct recombinant adenoviruses involve either in vitro ligation or recombination between one-half of the virus genome, previously cloned in a plasmid vector and engineered to contain the desired expression cassette, and the other half of the virus genome prepared from virions. Although quite effective, these approaches produce viral progeny containing a mixture of recombinant and parental background virus. Thus the recovery of the recombinant virus can be difficult, especially when it grows more slowly than the parental virus. To improve selection and recovery of recombinant adenoviruses, we have constructed an adenovirus vector, AdTG6553, in which the E1 region has been replaced by the thymidine kinase (tk) gene of herpes simplex virus type 1. We show that infection of cells with AdTG6553 in the presence of the nucleoside analog ganciclovir (GCV) prevents viral replication. The conditional lethal phenotype introduced in AdTG6553 makes it a valuable tool to counter-select parental background virus in the presence of GCV and isolate replication-deficient recombinant adenoviruses in which the tk expression cassette has been replaced by a new gene.
