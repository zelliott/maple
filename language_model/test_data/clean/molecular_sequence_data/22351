The internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of porcine teschovirus 1 (PTV-1), a member of the Picornaviridae family, is quite distinct from other well-characterized picornavirus IRES elements, but it displays functional similarities to the IRES from hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of the Flaviviridae family. In particular, a dominant negative mutant form of eIF4A does not inhibit the activity of the PTV-1 IRES. Furthermore, there is a high level (ca. 50%) of identity between the PTV-1 and HCV IRES sequences. A secondary-structure model of the whole PTV-1 IRES has been derived which includes a pseudoknot. Validation of specific features within the model has been achieved by mutagenesis and functional assays. The differences and similarities between the PTV-1 and HCV IRES elements should assist in defining the critical features of this type of IRES.
