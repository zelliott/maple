Plasmids have been constructed which contain genes coding for fused proteins including beta-galactosidase or human leukocyte interferon alpha 2 and monomeric or pentameric form of the main antigenic determinant of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype 01K. Expression of the hybrid genes has been studied. It is shown that fused proteins, containing beta-galactosidase and the antigenic determinant (monomer or pentamer), interact specifically with anti-FMDV anti-sera and with antibodies against peptide 141-160 of FMDV VP1 coat protein.
