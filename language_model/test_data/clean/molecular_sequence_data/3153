Attachment and ingestion of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis by two epithelial cell lines were enhanced by soluble fibronectin (FN). Peptide blocking of the FN attachment protein (FAP-P) inhibited the internalization of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. Disruption of FAP-P expression significantly reduced attachment and ingestion of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis by T-24 and Caco-2 cells. The results indicate that the interaction between FN and FAP-P facilitates attachment and internalization of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis by epithelial cells.
