Human livers produce apoB-100, a major protein of VLDL, while intestines produce apoB-48, the major protein of chylomicrons. ApoB-48 is translated from apoB-100 mRNAs that are post-transcriptionally edited at codon 2153, converting CAA (glutamine) to TAA, a stop codon. In contrast to humans, mouse and rat livers contain the apoB-100 mRNA editing mechanism. Because hormones and nutrients affect the metabolism of apoB containing lipoproteins, we studied the effects of sex hormones and diets on apoB mRNA editing. Groups of male and female C3H/HeJ mice were castrated and treated with 17 beta-estradiol at 0.16 (E2L) or at 5 micrograms (E2H), or with testosterone propionate at 1 microgram/g body weight/day for 14 days. Plasma apoB levels and ratios of apoB-100/apoB-48 both increased 2-fold, but only in the E2H group. To determine if the increased apoB-100/apoB-48 ratios were associated with altered levels of apoB-100 and apoB-48 mRNA, both forms of apoB mRNA were quantified. We found that indeed ApoB-100 mRNA increased 1.8-fold (p < 0.025) compared to apoB-48 mRNA only in the E2H group. Next, we studied the individual effects of dietary fatty acids and dietary cholesterol on the relative abundance of apoB-100 and apoB-48 mRNA. Contrary to the estrogen effect, the high fat-combination diet increased apoB-48 mRNA relative to apoB-100 mRNA. Total plasma apoB as well as apoB-48 synthesis in liver also increased. Our studies demonstrate that estrogens and high fat diet both modulate apoB editing in mouse liver, but that estrogens and fat diet affected apoB mRNA editing in opposite directions.
