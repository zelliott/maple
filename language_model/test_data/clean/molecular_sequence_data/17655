Using solid phase methodology, we have synthesized five peptides (16-18 residues long) corresponding to repeat sequences of four antigens of a human malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Three of these antigens (RESA, FIRA, and ABRA) are found in the asexual blood-stages of the parasite, while the remaining one (CSP) is found in the sporozoites. The synthetic peptides, conjugated to bovine serum albumin, elicited high levels of antibodies in rabbits, and these antibodies were found to cross-react with the heterologous peptides. The degree of cross-reactivity, as estimated in an ELISA, was quite remarkable among all the peptides. The peptide corresponding to the RESA tetrapeptide repeat was found to be the most immunogenic and highly cross-reactive. For this reason this tetrapeptide repeat unit, peptide 1, may be a suitable candidate for inclusion in a multiple epitope polypeptide vaccine design. Conformational studies using circular dichroism spectroscopy show that these peptides have similar conformational characteristics with a common feature of approximately 30% and approximately 50% helical content water and TFE respectively. Theoretical predictions regarding conformation using the Chou-Fasman method have also been presented.
