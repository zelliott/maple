The complete nucleotide sequence of the ompH gene encoding the 16-kDa basic outer membrane protein of Salmonella typhimurium was determined. The OmpH protein is synthesized in a precursor form with additional 20 amino acid residues in the N terminus of the protein. This peptide has common characteristics of signal sequences. The promoter region has strong homology to consensus sequences of Escherichia coli. The expression of ompH was detected in minicells.
