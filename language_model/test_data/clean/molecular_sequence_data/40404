A procoagulant metalloproteinase called CCSV-MPase was purified from C. cerastes venom by successive chromatographic methods starting with gel-filtration through Sephadex G-75; ion-exchange DEAE-Cellulose A-50; affinity chromatography on Benzamidine Sepharose 6B and RP-HPLC on a C8 column. CCSV-MPase has been isolated to an extent of about tenfolds and its molecular mass was evaluated at 70 kDa by SDS-PAGE. CCSV-MPase hydrolyzes casein and fibrinogene as natural substrates. Its proteolytic activity was inhibited by EDTA and 1.10-phenanthroline, a chelators of bivalent cation metals and Zn(2+) respectively. CCSV-MPase is therefore a Zn(2+)-metalloproteinase with fibrinogenolytic but not hemorrhagic activity. It greatly decreased levels of plasmatic fibrinogen when administered to rats for 24 h. This fibrinogenase hydrolyzes the BÎ² chain of human fibrinogen in vitro releasing fibrinopeptide B only. LC MS/MS analysis of tryptic fragments of CCSV-MPase demonstrated that it showed some sequence similarities with four other venom metalloproteinases. CCSV-MPase could be considered as a potential therapeutic agent as it is a non-hemorrhagic enzyme and could be useful in thrombotic diseases because of its defibrinogenation of blood.
