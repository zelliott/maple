The chemically stable but stereochemically flexible, non-toxic nature of zinc combined with its amphoteric properties has permitted it to orchestrate a number of zinc-binding motifs critical to life processes. For zinc enzymes, catalytic, cocatalytic, and structural zinc sites exist. DNA-binding proteins have zinc fingers, twists, and clusters exist.
