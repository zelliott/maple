We isolated an rpoD2 gene encoding the potential sigma factor of RNA polymerase from the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa K-81, which can perform photosynthesis. The deduced amino acid sequence of RpoD2 (sigmaA2) exhibits extensive homology to other eubacterial RpoD proteins. This gene possessed multiple 5'-end transcripts, expressed specifically under light (P(L)), dark (P(D)), or constitutively light/dark (P(C)) conditions during exponential cell growth.
