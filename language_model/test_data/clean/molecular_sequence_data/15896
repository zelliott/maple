We have previously characterized the U2 small nuclear (sn) RNA gene family of Arabidopsis thaliana. To find out the structural features of upstream and downstream non-coding regions that are shared by different U-RNA genes in higher plants we have isolated the gene encoding a 125 nt-long U5 snRNA of Arabidopsis. Activity of the cloned gene was demonstrated in stably transformed tobacco calli and by transient expression in transfected protoplasts of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia. Southern analysis indicated that the Arabidopsis genome contains 8-9 copies of the U5 gene. Alignment of upstream non-coding regions revealed two elements conserved between all plant U-RNA genes characterized so far: the sequence RTCCCACATCG (-70/-80 region, 100% conservation) and the TATA homology around position -30. The coding regions in all genes are followed by the sequence CAN4-9AGTN (A/T)AA which may correspond to a termination and/or processing signal.
