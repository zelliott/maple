Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of the Streptomyces globisporus 1912 gene lndYR, which encodes a GntR-like regulator of the YtrA subfamily. Disruption of lndYR arrested sporulation and antibiotic production in S. globisporus. The results of in vivo and in vitro studies revealed that the ABC transporter genes lndW-lndW2 are targets of LndYR repressive action. In Streptomyces coelicolor M145, lndYR overexpression caused a significant increase in the amount of extracellular actinorhodin. We suggest that lndYR controls the transcription of transport system genes in response to an as-yet-unidentified signal. Features that distinguish lndYR-based regulation from other known regulators are discussed.
