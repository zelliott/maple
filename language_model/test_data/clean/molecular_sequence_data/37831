The repair pathways involved in the removal of thymine glycol (TG) from DNA by human cell extracts have been examined. Closed circular DNA constructs containing a single TG at a defined site were used as substrates to determine the patch size generated after in vitro repair by cell extracts. Restriction analysis of the repair incorporation in the vicinity of the lesion indicated that the majority of TG was repaired through the base excision repair (BER) pathways. Repair incorporation 5' to the lesion, characteristic for the nucleotide excision repair pathway, was not found. More than 80% of the TG repair was accomplished by the single-nucleotide repair mechanism, and the remaining TGs were removed by the long patch BER pathway. We also analyzed the role of the xeroderma pigmentosum, complementation group G (XPG) protein in the excision step of BER. Cell extracts deficient in XPG protein had an average 25% reduction in TG incision. These data show that BER is the primary pathway for repair of TG in DNA and that XPG protein may be involved in repair of TG as an accessory factor.
