The glyoxysomal malate dehydrogenase (gMDH) catalyses the formation of oxaloacetate from malate during beta-oxidation of fatty acids in the glyoxysome. A partial Pisum sativum L. (cv. Greenfeast) cDNA was first isolated from a suppression subtractive hybridisation cDNA library obtained from heavy metal stressed plants. The full length cDNA was then isolated by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The translated sequence showed strong similarity to Cucumis sativus and Citrullus lanatus gMDH including a typical glyoxysome-targeting presequence comprising the PTS2 motif and a cleavage site for a cystein-directed protease. Exposure of pea plants to Cd2+ induced expression of the gMDH gene in mature pea leaves indicating that the enzyme is under environmental control in addition to the normal developmental regulation pattern.
