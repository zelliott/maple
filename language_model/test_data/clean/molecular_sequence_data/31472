A novel anaerobic, thermophilic, carbon monoxide-utilizing bacterium, strain E3-O(T), was isolated from anaerobic sludge from a municipal solid waste digester. Cells were straight rods, 0.6-1 µm in diameter and 2-3 µm in length and grew as single cells or in pairs. Cells formed round terminal endospores. The temperature range for growth was 50-70 °C, with an optimum at 65 °C. The pH range for growth was 5.7-8.0, with an optimum at 7.5. Strain E3-O(T) had the ability to ferment various sugars, such as fructose, galactose, glucose, mannose, raffinose, ribose, sucrose and xylose, producing mainly H2 and acetate. In addition, the isolate was able to grow with CO as the sole carbon and energy source. CO oxidation was coupled to H2 and CO2 formation. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 54.6 mol%. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, this bacterium is most closely related to Moorella glycerini (97 % sequence identity). Based on the physiological features and phylogenetic analysis, it is proposed that strain E3-O(T) should be classified in the genus Moorella as a representative of a novel species, Moorella stamsii. The type strain of Moorella stamsii is E3-O(T) ( = DSM 26271(T) = CGMCC 1.5181(T)).
