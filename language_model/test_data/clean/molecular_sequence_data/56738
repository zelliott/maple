The question of whether protein-induced DNA bending can act as a switch factor when placed upstream of an array of promoters located in tandem was investigated in vivo. The catabolite activating protein binding site of the fur operon was replaced by the binding site of the RepA repressor protein, which is able to bend DNA immediately after binding. Appropriately phased induced bending could act as a transcriptional switch factor in vivo.
