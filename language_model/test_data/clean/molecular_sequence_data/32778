A novel 120 kDa actin-binding protein (ApABP-F1) was found in Amoeba proteus. It was distributed throughout the cytoplasm, mainly in the subplasma membrane and perinuclear-nuclear areas, enriched in actin. The full-length cDNA of ApABP consisted of 2672 nucleotides with an open reading frame of 878 amino acids, giving a ~95 kDa protein with a theoretical pI value of 5.11. It had a novel domain organization pattern: the N terminus (residues 1-104) contained 1 calponin-homology (CH) domain, followed by only 1 region that was homologous to the filamin repeat (FR, residues 209-324), and a central region (residues 344-577) exhibiting a very high probability of coiled-coil formation, probably engaged in the observed protein dimerization. A phylogenetic tree constructed for CH domains from 25 various proteins revealed that the CH domain of ApABP was most related to that of the hypothetical mouse KIAA0903-like protein, whereas not much relationship to either filamins or the gelation factor (ABP-120) of Dictyostelium discoideum and Entamoeba histolytica was found.
