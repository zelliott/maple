Starting from D-mannose, D-glucose and L-fucose, the pentasaccharide derivative methyl 2,3,4-tri-O-benzyl-alpha-L-fucopyranosyl-(1-->3)-2-O-acetyl-4,6-O-benzylidene-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-(1-->3)-2-O-acetyl-6-O-benzyl-4-O-(2,3,4-tri-O-benzyl-alpha-L-fucopyranosyl)-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-(1-->4)-[2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl 2,3-di-O-benzyl-beta-D-glucopyranosid]uronate was synthesized. This compound with two alpha-mannopyranosyl units was transformed, via Walden inversion and subsequent deprotection, into the alpha-D-glucosamine-type target compound, namely methyl alpha-L-fucopyranosyl-(1-->3)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->3)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-4-O-(alpha-L-fucopyranosyl)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->4)-[2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl beta-D-glucopyranosid]uronate which is related to the repeating unit of the O-antigen from Shigella dysenteriae type 4.
