Pseudoknots are an essential feature of RNA tertiary structures. Simple H-type pseudoknots have been studied extensively in terms of biological functions, computational prediction, and energy models. Intramolecular kissing hairpins are a more complex and biologically important type of pseudoknot in which two hairpin loops form base pairs. They are hard to predict using free energy minimization due to high computational requirements. Heuristic methods that allow arbitrary pseudoknots strongly depend on the quality of energy parameters, which are not yet available for complex pseudoknots. We present an extension of the heuristic pseudoknot prediction algorithm DotKnot, which covers H-type pseudoknots and intramolecular kissing hairpins. Our framework allows for easy integration of advanced H-type pseudoknot energy models. For a test set of RNA sequences containing kissing hairpins and other types of pseudoknot structures, DotKnot outperforms competing methods from the literature. DotKnot is available as a web server under http://dotknot.csse.uwa.edu.au.
