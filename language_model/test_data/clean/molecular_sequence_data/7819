The bacterio-opsin gene (bop) of Halobacterium halobium is located within a cluster with three other genes. Growth conditions of high light intensity and low oxygen tension induce bop gene cluster expression. To identify putative regulatory factor binding sites upstream of the bop gene, we have compared sequences upstream of the bop gene with the corresponding sequences from two other genes in the bop gene cluster. Conserved sequence motifs were observed which may mediate the effect of high light intensity and/or low oxygen tension on bop gene expression. Based on these motifs, a set of mutants was constructed which contained deletions upstream of the bop gene. These constructs were tested in a host strain where bop gene expression is independent of oxygen regulation and in another strain where it is regulated by oxygen and light. The minimal upstream sequence required for both light- and oxygen-regulated bop gene expression was determined to be 54 bp.
