Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX) have been identified in eukaryotic cells: COX-1 encoded by a 2.8-kb mRNA, and a mitogen-inducible COX-2 encoded by a 4-kb mRNA. We have cloned the COX-1 and COX-2 cDNAs from the cDNA library constructed from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated rat peritoneal macrophages. The deduced amino acid sequence showed that COX-1 contained 602 amino acids, whereas COX-2 contained 604 amino acids. There is 95% conservation of the nucleotide sequence in the open reading frame of COX-1 between the rat and the mouse, while the homology of the 3' untranslated region is 68% except for a 150 bp segment adjacent to the stop codon which is nonhomologous with the mouse. Transfection of both COX cDNAs into Cos-7 cells resulted in increased COX activity. In rat vascular smooth muscle cells, interleukin-1 beta selectively increased the expression of COX-2, but not that of COX-1, as assessed by enzyme activity, immunoprecipitation of COX proteins, and mRNA analysis. Only the brain among tissues tested exhibits basal expression of COX-2 as the major form of the enzyme. However, COX-2 mRNA was expressed in vivo in the lung and kidney, but not in the heart, after systemic administration of LPS, suggesting that COX-2 but not COX-1 plays a major role in producing COX-derived products of arachidonic acid during endotoxic shock. Thus, the two COX isoforms were differentially expressed, and COX-2 was selectively induced in response to inflammatory stimuli in rats.
