A 2-year-old spayed female mongrel dog showed claudication with abnormal ossification containing fungal cells detected by biopsy. The dog was treated with ketoconazole and itraconazole perorally for 5 months; however, the osteomyelitis became aggravated, and an amputation from the scapula was performed. The right superficial cervical lymph node became swollen 5 months after the operation. The lymph node contained PAS positive fungal elements and a portion of tissue produced mycelial fungal growth on potato dextrose agar supplemented with chloramphenicol. The culture was identified as Lecythophora hoffmannii based on morphology, physiology and 100% identity in the sequence of the D1/D2 domain of the large subunit ribosomal RNA gene of the fungal species in the GenBank database (accession number AB100627). In addition, the sequence from the present isolate was submitted as AB189164. The isolate showed resistance to antifungal agents, i.e., amphotericin B, 5-FC, fluconazole, itraconazole, miconazole and micafungin. The dog developed cachexia 2 months after the onset of lymphadenopathy, and was euthanized on the 459th day after onset of clinical symptoms. This was the first disseminated case of L. hoffmannii infection in Japan.
