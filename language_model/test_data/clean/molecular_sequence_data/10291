The carcinoembryonic antigen family comprises a large number of complex molecules, several of which possess cell adhesion activities. The primordial adhesion molecules of this family are the cell-cell adhesion molecules (C-CAMs), which have been found to be multifunctional, signal-regulatory proteins. C-CAMs inhibit tumor growth, interact with calmodulin, protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases, and are subject to specific dimerization reactions. These new insights indicate that C-CAMs are important regulators of cellular functions.
