The reported structures of O-specific polysaccharides from three standard strains of Shigella bacteria were corrected by modern NMR techniques. The revisions concerned the configuration of the O-glycoside linkage (S. dysenteriae type 3, structure 1), the positions of monosaccharide residue glycosylation and acetylation by pyruvic acid (S. dysenteriae type 9, structure 2), and the attachment position of the side monosaccharide chain (S. boydii type 4, structure 3) [struxture in text].
