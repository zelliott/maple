The ascomycete, Leptosphaeria maculans, causes blackleg disease of oilseed Brassica spp. such as canola (Brassica napus). We have cloned a gene encoding endopolygalacturonase, pg1, and two genes encoding cellulases, cel1 and cel2, in L. maculans. These genes are not clustered in the genome, as they are located on different chromosomes. The deduced amino acid sequences of all three genes predict an N-terminal signal sequence, as is common for secreted fungal enzymes that degrade plant cell walls. The endopolygalacturonase encoded by pg1 shows the highest similarity (54% amino acid identity) to endopolygalacturonase 4 from Botrytis cinerea. Both cel1 and cel2 appear to encode cellobiohydrolase, and neither gene encodes a recognizable cellulose-binding domain or linker region. Transcription of pg1 is induced in cultures containing 1% polygalacturonic acid or pectin, and cel1 is induced in 1% cellulose or carboxymethylcellulose, as shown by Northern analysis. Glucose represses the induction of cel1 caused by cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose, but does affect transcription of pg1. Transcription of cel2 (but not cel1 or pg1) is detectable during infection of B. napus and B. juncea cotyledons and leaves using reverse transcription-PCR.
