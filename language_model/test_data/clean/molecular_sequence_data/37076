The hemolymph juvenile hormone binding protein (hJHBP) gene of Manduca sexta is a key target of its specific ligand, juvenile hormone (JH). While the cDNA for hJHBP has been partially characterized, little is known about the hJHBP gene structure or its promoter(s) and enhancers(s). Previous studies have demonstrated that JH stimulates a rapid accumulation of hJHBP mRNA in the fat body. To better understand the underlying molecular events affecting regulation, we sequenced the M. sexta hJHBP gene and its mRNA transcript, characterized its genomic organization, and determined the spatial and temporal expression patterns of the hJHBP gene. The gene is composed of 5 exons spanning 6.7 kb. Southern blot analysis indicates that the gene is present as a single copy. The earliest expression of hJHBP occurs 24 to 48 h after fertilization. Distribution studies indicate that fat body is the only site for hJHBP expression. Elements displaying similarity with sequences of other lepidopteran genes were discovered outside the open reading frame and may represent mobile insertion elements.
