An epitope scan analysis of the whole sequence of avidin and core streptavidin using polyclonal antibodies to these two antigens reveal the presence of multiple common epitopes in both the proteins. These antigenic determinants consist mostly of either identical or similar residues. The antibody recognition sites in both antigens are shown to be localized to homologous regions.
