The translationally controlled tumour protein (TCTP) of turbot Scophthalmus maximus (SmTCTP) contains only one cysteine (Cys¹⁷⁰) at the C-terminal end. The biological role of this C-terminal Cys¹⁷⁰ in the antioxidation and growth-promoting functions of SmTCTP was examined by site-directed mutation of C170A (Cys¹⁷⁰ →Ala¹⁷⁰). It was found that C170A mutation not only obviously decreased the antioxidation capacity of the mutant-smtctp-transformed bacteria exposed to 0·22 mM hydrogen peroxide, but also significantly interrupted the normal growth and survival of the mutant-smtctp-transformed bacteria and flounder Paralichthys olivaceus gill (FG) cells, indicating a key role played by Cys¹⁷⁰ in the antioxidation and growth-promoting functions of SmTCTP. This study also suggested that the self-dimerization or dimerization with other interacting proteins is critical to the growth-promoting function of SmTCTP.
