The first cDNA from the Photurinae subfamily of the Lampyridae encoding a firefly luciferase from lantern mRNA of Photuris pennsylvanica has been cloned, sequenced, the amino-acid sequence predicted and the sequence reported to GenBank. The cDNA was about 1.8 kb in length with the largest open reading frame coding for a 545-residue protein. The 5' noncoding region is 61 bp long and the 3' noncoding region is 135 bp in length. There is a 24-nucleotide poly(A) tail. When the amino-acid residues are aligned, P. pennsylvanica contains 154 (about 28% of the total residues) that are conserved in all 16 of the deduced luciferase sequences that are presently available. In this P. pennsylvanica luciferase, the amino acids at 276 of the positions are the same at corresponding positions of at least one of the other enzymes. There are two amino-acid differences between this luciferase and the unpublished sequence obtained by Dr. Keith Wood for a putative larval Photuris firefly luciferase cloned from a Maryland firefly. Signature amino-acid sequences and domains found in the deduced sequence are for adenylate kinase, the putative AMP-binding domain, luciferin 4-monooxygenase, 4-coumarate CoA ligase, long-chain fatty acid CoA ligase, 2-acylglycerophosphoethanolamine acyltransferase, the microbody-directing sequence, peptide-synthesizing complexes, and acyladenylate-synthesizing enzymes.
