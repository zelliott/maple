An amplification of a 2.0-kb fragment was found on the plasmid pMEA100 isolated from a subculture of the wild-type strain LBG A3136 of Amycolatopsis (Nocardia) mediterranei. Plasmid preparations contained a mixture of molecules with copy numbers of the amplified unit in the range of 2 to 10. The amplification on pMEA100 was stable; propagation of cells for many generations did not change the pattern of the amplified DNA. Fragments of the plasmids containing the amplifiable unit of DNA (AUD) and the amplified DNA sequence (ADS) were subcloned and characterized. Sequencing of the AUD terminal regions and the junction between ADS units showed that the amplifiable unit of DNA was flanked by 12-bp direct repeats. The DNA segments adjacent to the 12-bp sequence common to the left and right AUD terminal regions also showed significant similarities. In addition, the left AUD terminal region flanking the 12-bp repeat exhibited considerable sequence similarity to actinomycete plasmid attachment sites, particularly to the pMEA 100 att site.
