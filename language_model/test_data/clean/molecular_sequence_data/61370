In Drosophila, the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is preferentially expressed in the brain and the male reproductive organs. Although the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) is a major target of PKA in the brain, the target of PKA in the male reproductive organs has been unknown. In the present study, three cAMP-dependent phosphoproteins (referred to as pp45, pp20, and pp10) were detected in the lumen fluid of male accessory glands. They were tissue-specific secretory proteins that accumulated only after eclosion, and were transferred to females during mating as other secretory proteins of the accessory glands. Among them, the 45-kDa phosphoprotein was partially purified and characterized. The purified protein was phosphorylated in vitro by the catalytic subunit of PKA. The partial amino acid sequence of this 45-kDa phosphoprotein was identical to the predicted amino acid sequence of the Mst57Dc cDNA, which is a male accessory gland transcript.
