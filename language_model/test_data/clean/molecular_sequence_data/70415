Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been isolated from sheep suffering from respiratory tract disease. Since the greatest differences between bovine RSV and human RSV are found on the attachment G protein, we have determined the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the G gene of ovine RSV. The latter contained 838 nucleotides and had a major open reading frame encoding a protein of 263 residues, and shared 73% nucleotide sequence identity with that of bovine RSV. The deduced amino acid sequence of the ovine RSV G protein showed only 60% amino acid identity with the G protein of bovine RSV. Despite the low level of identity, there were similarities in the predicted hydropathy profiles of the G proteins of ovine and bovine RSV. The intergenic sequences for the SH-G and G-F gene junctions of ovine RSV showed 64 and 57% identity respectively with the corresponding regions of the bovine RSV. Our results indicate that ovine and bovine RSV might be classified as two subgroups of an ungulate RSV.
