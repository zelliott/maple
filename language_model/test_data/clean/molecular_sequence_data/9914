Alpha 2-HS glycoprotein (AHSG) is a human plasma glycoprotein and fetuin is the homologue in the calf. In this report, we present the structure and organization of the AHSG gene. Introns and the 5' and 3'-flanking regions were obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the inverted PCR, respectively, from genomic DNA using AHSG cDNA-specific oligonucleotide primers. The sequence of the PCR products shows that the coding region spans approximately 8.2 kb and is composed of seven exons interrupted by six introns. The exon-intron splice junctions agree with the consensus sequence, and the positions interrupted by introns are precisely identical to those of the rat insulin receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (fetuin) gene. The 5'-promoter region contains several characteristic sequences such as an A + T-rich sequence of TAAATAA, C/EBP-binding site, and hepatocyte nuclear factor-5 (HNF-5) and serum response factor (SRF) sites.
