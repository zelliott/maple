The structure of the coding region of mouse myosin X cDNA was determined. The predicted protein sequence indicated an approximately 240 kDa molecular mass with 2062 amino acids. When aligned with the structure predicted for calf myosin X (GenBank Accession No. U55042), extremely highly conserved pleckstrin homology domains and a myosin tail homology 4 domain were apparent in the tail region, suggesting their importance for myosin X's function. Northern blot analysis revealed the existence of a myosin X mRNA, 8.7 kb in size, in various mouse tissues, while a similar size of human type myosin X mRNA was recognized mainly in the testis. In addition to the adult-type transcripts in mice, a smaller embryo-specific mRNA, 4.8 kb in size, was identified in early to late embryonic stages, suggesting the presence of a shorter myosin X isoform in mouse embryos. In situ hybridization experiments with mouse testis revealed that myosin X mRNA was restricted to Sertoli cells at stages VIII-X of the spermatogenesis cycle, suggesting that myosin X is implicated in the supporting cells during the spermatid morphogenesis.
