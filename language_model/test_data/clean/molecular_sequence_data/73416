Cloning and characterization of a cDNA of the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, that showed high amino acid similarity with the deduced amino acid sequences of E75 cDNAs cloned from Manduca sexta, Galleria melonella, and Drosophila melanogaster are described. Initially, a cDNA fragment and then a full length cDNA were cloned from C. fumiferana. The longest open reading frame of this cDNA had 690 codons and its deduced amino acid sequence had all five domains typical of a steroid hormone nuclear receptor. The deduced amino acid sequence of this cDNA showed the highest identity with the deduced amino acid sequence of E75A cDNAs cloned from M. sexta, G. melonella, and D. melanogaster, and is therefore named Choristoneura hormone receptor 75A (CHR75A). The CHR75A cDNA probe detected a 2.6 kb mRNA that was abundant at the time of the ecdysteroid peaks during molting in the embryonic, larval and pupal stages. In the sixth instar larvae, CHR75 mRNA was detected in the epidermis, fat body and midgut, and maximum expression was observed during the prepupal peak of ecdysteroids in the hemolymph. CHR75 mRNA was induced in ecdysone treated CF-203 cells and in the midgut, fat body and epidermis of larvae that were fed the non-steroidal ecdysteroid agonist, RH-5992. In vitro transcription and translation of the CHR75A cDNA yielded a 79 kDa protein that bound to the retinoic acid receptor related orphan receptor response element (RORE).
