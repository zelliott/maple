Properdin is a serum glycoprotein that up-regulates the alternative pathway of complement by stabilizing the C3b-Bb complex. It also binds sulfated glycoconjugates, such as sulfatide, in vitro. Properdin is composed of cyclic dimers, trimers, and tetramers of a 53-kDa monomeric subunit. The monomer contains an N-terminal region of no known homology and six thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) of approximately 60 amino acids. To identify the regions of properdin important for function, we have expressed human properdin, and mutant forms each lacking a single TSR, in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In addition, limited tryptic digestion yielded "nicked" properdin by the cleavage of one peptide bond in TSR5. The structural and functional properties of these altered forms of properdin were investigated. Properdin "nicked" in TSR5 is unable to bind C3b but retains its overall structure and its ability to bind sulfatide. The removal of TSR5 prevents C3b and sulfatide binding. Properdin lacking TSR4 is unable to stabilize the C3b-Bb complex but is able to bind C3b and sulfatide, and shows the presence of monomers and dimers in an electron microscope. Properdin without TSR3 is able to stabilize the C3b-Bb complex, to bind C3b and sulfatide, and forms dimers, trimers, and tetramers. Properdin lacking TSR6 is unable to form oligomers. The N-linked carbohydrate of properdin is not required for oligomerization or stabilization of the C3b-Bb complex. The results implicate TSR5 in both C3b and sulfatide binding, and suggest that TSR4 may also be involved in stabilization of the C3b-Bb complex.
