We have previously shown that cadmium, a metal that alters cellular redox status, induces CYP2A5 expression in nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 wild-type (Nrf2+/+) mice but not in the knockout (Nrf2-/-) mice. In the present studies, the potential role of Nrf2 in cadmium-mediated regulation of Cyp2a5 gene was investigated in mouse primary hepatocytes. Cadmium chloride (CdCl2) caused a time-dependent induction of the CYP2A5 at mRNA, protein, and activity levels, with a substantial increase observed within 3 h of exposure. Immunoblotting showed cadmium-dependent nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 within 1 h of exposure. Cotransfection of mouse primary hepatocytes with Cyp2a5 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids and Nrf2 expression plasmid resulted in a 3-fold activation of Cyp2a5 promoter-mediated transcription relative to the control. Deletion analysis of the promoter localized the Nrf2 responsive region to an area from -2656 to -2339 base pair. Computer-based sequence analysis identified two putative stress response elements (StRE) within the region at positions -2514 to -2505 and -2386 to -2377. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that interaction of the more proximal StRE with Nrf2 was stimulated by CdCl2. Finally, site-directed mutagenesis of the proximal StRE in Cyp2a5 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids abolished Nrf2-mediated induction. Collectively, the results indicate that Nrf2 activates Cyp2a5 transcription by directly binding to the StRE in the 5'-flanking region of the gene. This acknowledges Cyp2a5 as the first phase I xenobiotic-metabolizing gene identified under the control of the StRE-Nrf2 pathway with a potential role in adaptive response to cellular stress.
