New systems are proposed for the PCR analysis of HindIII polymorphic sites in the gamma A and gamma G globin genes and of TaqI polymorphic site in the human factor IX gene of blood population. DNA fragments amplified according to the systems described contain constant restriction site of the appropriate endonuclease, in addition to the polymorphic one, which significantly improves the reliability of the RELP analysis. The systems proposed are highly specific and may be used for DNA diagnosis of beta-thalassemia and haemophilia B.
