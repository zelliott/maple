Lambda gt11 cDNA clones for the nuclear-encoded subunit delta of the chloroplast ATP-synthase from Zea mays and Sorghum bicolor were sequenced. The processing site for S. bicolor delta was established, and the sequence of the mature subunit delta from Z. mays was completed by N-terminal sequencing of the proteins isolated from chloroplasts. Only five amino acids are identical and not more than 16% conservatively exchanged in all sequences of delta subunits from higher plants and the corresponding proteins from alga, bacteria and mitochondria (OSCP) available. In binary comparison the comparatively high conservation of hydrophilic residues indicates the importance of the surface of delta. The degree in identities of surface residues correlates with the capacity in hybrid reconstitution of photophosphorylation. A hypothetical secondary structure model for a typical delta subunit can be deduced from prediction algorithms. Three putative amphipathic alpha helices and an antiparallel amphipathic beta sheet seem to be conserved. These common secondary structure features should be significant for the function of the delta subunit of F0F1 ATPases.
