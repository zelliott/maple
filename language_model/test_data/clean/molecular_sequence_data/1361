The freshwater tropical snail Biomphalaria glabrata is an intermediate host for Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent of human intestinal schistosomiasis, and strains differ in their susceptibility to parasite infection. Changes in gene expression in response to parasite infection have been simultaneously examined in a susceptible strain (NHM1742) and a resistant strain (NHM1981) using a newly developed fluorescent-based differential display method. Such RNA profiling techniques allow the examination of changes in gene expression in response to parasite infection, without requiring previous sequence knowledge, or selecting candidate genes that may be involved in the complex neuroendocrine or defence systems of the snail. Thus, novel genes may be identified. Ten transcripts were initially identified, present only in the profiles derived from snails of the resistant strain when exposed to infection. The differential expression of five of these genes, including HSP70 and several novel transcripts with one containing at least two globin-like domains, has been confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR.
