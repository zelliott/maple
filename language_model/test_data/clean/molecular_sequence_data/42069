Two convenient methods for determining the ALDH2 genotype using PCR were devised. The first method for distinguishing ALDH2(1) and ALDH2(2) alleles was conducted by introducing a single base change into an oligonucleotide primer for PCR, which produced the MboII recognition site for ALDH2(1) but not for ALDH2(2). The second method was conducted with a secondary PCR using allele-specific primers. Both methods have enabled us to easily determine the genotype of the ALDH2 locus without using isotopes. By applying these methods, the genotype of 112 Japanese individuals was determined. The frequency of ALDH2(1) was estimated to be 0.75 and that of ALDH2(2) was to be 0.25.
