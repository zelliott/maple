With this fast and simple MULTIPRINS protocol we show simultaneous mapping of multiple repetitive sequences by sequential cycles of primed in situ (PRINS) labelling with various primers and reporter molecules. Differentially labelled DNA sequences synthesized in situ were visualized by directly incorporated rhodamine-4-dUTP, by fluorescein isothiocyanate and Cy5 using digital imaging microscopy. This further development of the PRINS method enhances its potential as an alternative to traditional in situ hybridization.
