In order to cleave RNA at specific positions in Escherichia coli formylmethionine tRNA, RNase H and complementary chimeric oligonucleotides consisting of DNA and 2'-O-methyl-RNA (Inoue et al. (1987) FEBS Lett. 215, 327] were used. Specific cleavages in the D loop, anticodon loop, T psi C loop, anticodon stem, and acceptor stem were investigated. Virtually unique hydrolyses with RNase H were observed at the T psi C loop, anticodon stem, and acceptor stem when relatively longer chimeric oligonucleotides (20-mer) were used. An efficient cleavage at the anticodon was obtained with a chimeric 13-mer when the higher structure of the tRNA was broken by hybridization with a 20-mer at the acceptor as well as the T psi C stem region. It was found that stabilities of hybrids with chimeric oligonucleotides and the presence of minor nucleosides affect the cleavage of tRNA by this approach.
