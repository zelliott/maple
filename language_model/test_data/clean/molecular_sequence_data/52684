Merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) of Plasmodium falciparum is a promising candidate for vaccine development against malaria. Identification of protective epitopes within MSP-1 is an important step towards the elucidation of mechanisms of parasitic invasion and for the creation of a multi-subunit vaccine. In this study, we show that a 115 amino acid region (p115MSP-1) within the p38 domain of MSP-1 can: (i) specifically bind to human erythrocytes, independent of glycophorin A; (ii) inhibit parasite invasion at significant levels, in vitro; and (iii) be recognized by human sera of individuals from malaria-endemic regions of Africa. More importantly, we also show that polyclonal antibodies specific to this region prevent parasite invasion at levels approaching 90%, in vitro. Our data illustrate that not only is p115MSP-1 involved in parasite recognition/invasion of human erythrocytes, but that this region is highly antigenic, producing high titer antibodies. The delineation of the role of MSP-1 in parasite invasion is an important component of the development of a multi-subunit malaria vaccine, and this study identifies a candidate antigen in this context.
