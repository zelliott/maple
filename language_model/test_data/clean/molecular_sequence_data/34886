Culture independent method was used to study the diversity of rumen bacteria. Molecular diversity of rumen bacteria was analyzed by PCR amplification and sequencing of 16S rDNA clone libraries prepared from the rumen content of Holstein cows. The total DNA directly extracted from rumen fluid was used as PCR template. Bacteria universal primer 27F and 1492R was used as primer. Random clones, containing almost full size 16S rDNA sequences (about 1.5 kb long), were sequenced and subjected to an on line similarity search. The 16S rDNA sequence analysis indicated that more than half of the sequences belonged to the not-yet-cultured groups. The 16S rDNA similarity levels with cultured species was less than 90%. The bacterial community structure was also revealed by phylogenetic tree of known sequences and selected sequence. In the library from the rumen fluid, the sequences were mainly affiliated with the following major phyla: low G + C Gram-positive bacteria, Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides, and the remaining sequences were placed within not-yet-uncultured groups that had an uncertain affiliation. These several sequences are likely to represent novel taxonomic groupings. The nucleotide sequences have been submitted to the GenBank/EMBL /DDBJ databases under accession numbers AY986777-AY986791.
