Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute phase protein and the precursor of amyloid protein A (AA) in deposits of secondary amyloidosis. Several isotypes exist in mink, but previous studies suggest that mink AA is derived from only one. To assess the effect of repeated episodes of inflammation and induction of amyloidosis, qualitative and quantitative changes in hepatic and extrahepatic SAA mRNA were studied. Young female mink received subcutaneous lipopolysaccharide injections for amyloid induction. Studies were performed using RNA probes and oligonucleotide probes specific for each of two SAA mRNA species. Northern blot hybridization showed that hepatic SAA1 and SAA2 mRNA levels increased dramatically after inflammatory stimulation, and were subsequently maintained at elevated levels, showing considerable interindividual variation, but only a slight decrease during repeated inflammatory stimuli and the early stages of amyloid deposition. No preferential accumulation of mRNA specifying a particular isotype was found during the experiment. Differential expression of mink SAA mRNA during repeated inflammatory stimulation does not seem to explain why only SAA2-derived AA is found in amyloid deposits. Extrahepatic SAA mRNA seemed to be independently regulated and may thus represent another, yet not characterized, SAA isotype.
