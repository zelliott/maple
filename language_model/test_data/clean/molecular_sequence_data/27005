A Gram-positive bacterium strain, designated TT02-04T, was isolated from a forest soil sample in Iriomote Island, Japan, and its taxonomic position was investigated by using a polyphasic approach. The peptidoglycan type of this organism was found to be A4alpha and lysine was the diagnostic cell-wall diamino acid of the peptidoglycan. The only menaquinone was MK-8(H4), and the major fatty acid was anteiso-C15:0. Galactose was detected as the cell-wall sugar. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol mannosides. The DNA G+C content was 73.0 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies indicated that strain TT02-04T was closely related to the type strains of Georgenia ruanii (99.0%) and Georgenia muralis (97.7%). However, DNA-DNA hybridization results and phenotypic characteristics revealed that the strain differed from the currently recognized species of the genus Georgenia. Therefore, strain TT02-04T represents a novel species of the genus Georgenia, for which the name Georgenia thermotolerans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is TT02-04T (=NBRC 104148T=DSM 21501T).
