Apramycin is unique in the aminoglycoside family due to its octodiose moiety. However, either the biosynthesis process or the precursors involved are largely unknown. Addition of glycine, as well as serine or threonine, to the Streptomyces tenebrabrius UD2 fermentation medium substantially increases the production of apramycin with little effect on the growth of mycelia, indicating that glycine and/or serine might be involved in the biosynthesis of apramycin. The 13C-NMR analysis of [2-13C] glycine-fed (25% enrichment) apramycin showed that glycine specifically and efficiently incorporated into the only N-CH3 substituent of apramycin on the C7' of the octodiose moiety. We noticed that the in vivo concentration of S-adenosyl methionine increased in parallel with the addition of glycine, while the addition of methione in the fermentation medium significantly decreased the productivity of apramycin. Therefore, the methyl donor function of glycine is proposed to be involved in the methionine cycle but methionine itself was proposed to inhibit the methylation and methyl transfer processes a previously reported for the case of rapamycin. The 15N NMR spectra of [2-13C,15N]serine labeled apramycin indicated that serine may also act as a limiting precursor contributing to the -NH2 substituents of apramycin.
