Within the framework of the international programme to sequence the genome of Bacillus subtilis strain 168, we were allocated the region between dnaB (256 degrees) and pheA (240 degrees). The sequencing of this region is now complete and we report our primary analysis of the 114 kb region containing 114 ORFs. In addition to previously characterized genes, we have identified genes involved in the utilization of plant cell wall polysaccharides, stress responses and the metabolism of amino acids, cell walls, DNA and fatty acids. We also discuss various structural and physical features, including the orientation of genes with respect to replication, putative start and stop codons, ribosome binding sites and rho-independent transcription terminators.
