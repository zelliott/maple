Approaches to the synthesis of model compounds based on the tylosin-related macrolides desmycosin and O-mycaminosyltylonolide were developed using specially designed peptide derivatives of macrolide antibiotics to study the conformation and topography of the nascent peptide chain in the ribosome tunnel. A method for selective bromoacetylation of desmycosin at the hydroxyl group of mycinose was developed, which involves preliminary acetylation of mycaminose. The reaction of the 4"-bromoacetyl derivative of the antibiotic with cesium salts of the dipeptide Boc-Ala-Ala-OH and the hexapeptide MeOTr-Gly-Pro-Gly-Pro-Gly-Pro-OH led to the corresponding peptide derivatives of desmycosin. The protected peptides Boc-Ala-Ala-OH, Boc-Ala-Ala-Phe-OH, and Boc-Gly-Pro-Gly-Pro-Gly-Pro-OH were condensed with the C23-hydroxyl group of O-mycaminosyltylonolide.
