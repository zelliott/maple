The nucleotide sequences of the genes for 6-aminohexanoate-cyclic-dimer hydrolases of Flavobacterium sp. strain K172 (F-nylA) and Pseudomonas sp. NK87 (P-nylA), enzymes essential for the degradation of a by-product of the nylon-6 industry, were obtained by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method. A 1,479-base-pair open reading frame starting at a GTG and terminating at a TGA was found for the both of the genes. The P-nylA and F-nylA genes encoded polypeptides of 493 amino acids and had only 10 base substitutions in the coding region, which caused seven amino acid substitutions.
