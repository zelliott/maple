A cDNA fragment which encodes salmon peroxisome proliferator activated receptor y (sPPARgamma) was amplified by PCR from the liver of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). The fragment was 627 bp long. The sequence of the amplified PCR product was similar to the PPARgamma of mouse and hamster. 59% of the bases were identical. Northern blot analysis of salmon liver mRNA showed that the amplified sPPARgamma fragment hybridised to three specific transcripts of lengths 1.6, 2.4 and 3.3 kb. Clofibric acid and bezafibrate, administered to salmon hepatocytes in culture, resulted in a 1.7-fold increase of the 1.6 kb sPPARgamma transcript. The activity of acyl-CoA oxidase also increased approx. 1.7-fold after administration of fibrates. These results indicate that PPAR is an important factor in mediating enzymatic response to fibrates in fish.
