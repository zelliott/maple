Several genes encoding putative myogenic regulatory factors have been isolated on the basis of their ability to convert nonmuscle cells into myoblasts. Four of these genes code for nuclear proteins that belong to a larger family characterized by a conserved helix-loop-helix motif required for DNA-binding and dimerization. At least one protein, MyoD1, can function as a transcription factor and activate muscle-specific genes during differentiation. But the promoter of the delta-subunit gene of the mouse acetylcholine receptor (AChR) was recently reported to be functional in the absence of MyoD1 binding sites and it has been suggested that the genes coding for the AChR could be regulated independently of MyoD1 protein. Here, we identify two functional MyoD1-binding sites in the muscle-specific enhancer of the chicken AChR alpha-subunit gene that are essential for full activity in transfected myotubes.
