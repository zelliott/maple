The gene coding for rat group II phospholipase A2 was isolated from a rat genomic library by using the cDNA for rat platelet phospholipase A2 as a hybridization probe. The rat group II phospholipase A2 gene spanned about 3.5 kilobase pairs and consisted of five exons. Southern blot analysis revealed that a single copy of this gene exists in the rat haploid genome. A TATA-like sequence and two AP-2 binding site-like loci were found upstream from the tentatively identified transcription initiation site.
