We describe two cases in which unknown bodies were positively identified from dental information and biochemical examination using tooth materials. In one case, a charred body was positively identified with little effort by comparison of antemortem dental records (dental chart and dental X-ray film) with postmortem data. In the other case, although the unknown individual had dental treatment, the police were unable to obtain the antemortem dental records of the victim. We then conducted biochemical analysis of teeth, facilitating personal identification using DNA analysis and age estimation based on aspartic acid racemization. The mutation obtained from the sequence of mtDNA and the genotypes of HLADQ alpha, HPRTB and ABO blood groups including the data for estimated age supported the kinship between the unknown individual and his mother. The data for maternally inherited mtDNA were of great importance in this case, since it was possible to obtain DNA from the mother. Dental identification in one of the most accurate methods of personal identification if suitable antemortem records are available. In the absence of such records, biochemical analysis of teeth also makes it possible to increase the probability of correct personal identification.
