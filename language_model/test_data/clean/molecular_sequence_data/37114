Four clones encoding the insect depressant toxin LqqIT2 have been isolated from the Egyptian scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus quinquestriatus using RT-PCR. The four clones have been sequenced and their deduced amino acid sequences have been compared with the original amino acid sequence determined from the purified LqqIT2 protein and polymorphisms have been shown. This study succeeded in isolating more than one copy of the LqqIT2 gene, although only one amino acid sequence has been identified from the purified LqqIT2 toxin.
