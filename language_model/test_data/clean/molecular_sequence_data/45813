House flies were collected from four dairies in Maine, New York, North Carolina, and Florida, where high levels of resistance to permethrin have been documented. Regions of two genes, CYP6D1 and Vssc1, having alleles that confer resistance to permethrin (and other pyrethroids) were analysed from individuals at each collection site. The combinations of resistance alleles for Vssc1 and CYP6D1 were highly variable between each state. The resistance allele CYP6D1v1 was found at a high frequency (0.63-0.91) at all sites. Individuals homozygous susceptible for CYP6D1 were very rare and detected only at the dairy in Maine. In addition to the typical Vssc1 mutation responsible for resistance, kdr (L1014F), we also identified individuals with a L1014H mutation. Although house flies homozygous for the L1014H mutation had a lower level of resistance to permethrin, compared to L1014F, the H1014 resistance allele was frequently detected. No individuals with the super-kdr allele (M918T + L1014F) were detected from the field collections. The intron 3 bp downstream of the kdr mutation was found to be extremely variable, providing an opportunity to reconstruct a phylogeny of Vssc1 alleles. Based on this analysis it appears the kdr-his mutation had multiple evolutionary origins, but that the kdr mutation may have had a single origin. The impacts of these findings on resistance management are discussed.
