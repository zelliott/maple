Isolates of Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV) obtained from three greenhouses of Ukraine were identified. The rabbit antisera have been obtained for these isolates. These antisera can be used for diagnostics of CGMMV in plant material by indirect ELISA. An analysis of cDNA sequences of capsid protein of these viruses confirmed that they might be grouped into the novel strain of CGMMV.
