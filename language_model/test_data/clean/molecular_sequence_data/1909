The mutation frequency of Turnip crinkle virus can increase 12-fold without inducing error catastrophe. Lesions in a hairpin repressor frequently reverted and led to second-site alterations biased for specific mutations. These results suggest that the hairpin may also function as an RNA chaperone to properly fold the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
