To understand how plant cell changes gene expression during cell division and after termination of cell division, we analyzed the change of gene expression during the growth of tobacco BY-2 cell lines using a cDNA microarray, which contained about 9,200 expression sequence tag fragments and corresponded to about 7,000 genes. We found that log phase cells predominantly expressed DNA/chromosome duplication gene homologs. In addition, many genes for basic transcription and translation machineries, as well as proteasomal genes, were up-regulated at the log phase. About half of the kinesin homolog genes, but not myosin homolog genes, were predominantly expressed at the dividing phase as well. In contrast, stationary phase cells expressed genes for many receptor kinases, signal transduction machineries and transcription factors. Several hundreds of genes showed differential expression after incubation of stationary phase cells with medium containing either salicylic acid or abscisic acid. These findings suggested that BY-2 cells at the stationary phase express genes for perceiving extracellular signals.
