Protein kinase C (PKC) is a critical cell signaling pathway involved in many disorders such as cancer and Alzheimer-type dementia. To date, evaluation of PKC ligand binding affinity has been performed by competitive studies against radiolabeled probes that are problematic for high-throughput screening. In the present study, we have developed a fluorescent-based binding assay system for identifying ligands that target the PKC ligand binding domain (C1 domain). An environmentally sensitive fluorescent dye (solvatochromic fluorophore), which has been used in multiple applications to assess protein-binding interactions, was inserted in proximity to the binding pocket of a novel PKCδ C1b domain. These resultant fluorescent-labeled δC1b domain analogues underwent a significant change in fluorescent intensity upon ligand binding, and we further demonstrate that the fluorescent δC1b domain analogues can be used to evaluate ligand binding affinity.
