We have cloned the gene that encodes a novel glucosyl transferase (AraGT) involved in rhamnosylation of the polyketide antibiotic Aranciamycin in Streptomyces echinatus. AraGT comprises two domains characteristic of bacterial glycosyltranferases. AraGT was synthesized in E. coli as a decahistidinyl-tagged polypeptide. Purified AraGT is dimeric, displays a T(mapp) of 30 degrees C and can glycosylate the aglycone of an Aranciamycin derivative as shown by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The availability of functional AraGT will allow the generation Aranciamycin-based combinatorial libraries.
