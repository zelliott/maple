The allyl glycosides of a tri-, penta- and hexasaccharide corresponding to the Streptococcus Group A cell-wall polysaccharide were coupled to solid or soluble supports to give immunoaffinity columns and neoglycoproteins, respectively. Cysteamine hydrochloride was added to the allyl glycosides and the resulting cysteamine adducts were used for subsequent coupling to linkers via the amine functionality. The tri- and penta-saccharide cysteamine adducts were coupled directly to the azalactone-derivatized 3M Emphase Biosupport Medium AB 1 to yield two affinity columns. The penta- and hexa- saccharides were coupled to bovine serum albumin or ovalbumin via the conjugate addition of the epsilon-amino groups of lysines on the proteins with the N-acryloylated sugars or the oligosaccharide-squarate adducts, derived in turn from the cysteamine adducts. The efficiency of the above methods is compared.
