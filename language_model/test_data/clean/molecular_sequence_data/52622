In this chapter we review the various methods available to the experimenter to analyse phosphorylated peptides. The initial steps in such an analysis involve the isolation of the phosphopeptides for analysis, and we outline the various current methods such as immobilised metal affinity chromatography, anti-phosphoamino acid antibodies as well as HPLC (High Pressure Liquid Chromatography) and TLC (Thin Layer Chromatography). The isolated peptides can be analysed by chemical modification followed by Edman degradation or by mass spectrometry (MS). We focus on MS methods and give examples illustrating the selective detection and sequencing of phosphopeptides.
