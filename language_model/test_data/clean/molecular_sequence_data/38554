The O-specific polysaccharide of Proteus mirabilis O11 was studied by sugar analysis, Smith degradation, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, including two-dimensional COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, and 1H-detected 1H, 13C HMQC experiments. The following structure of a pentasaccharide repeating unit of the polysaccharide was established: [formual: see text] where D-GalA6LThr is N-(D-galacturonoyl)-L-threonine. ELISA with anti-P. mirabilis O11 serum showed that D-GalA6LThr is of minor importance for manifesting the O11 immunospecificity.
