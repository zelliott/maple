We have shown leaf-specific inhibition GUS gene expression in transgenic Nicotiana plants using an antisense RNA with a 41-base homology spanning the translation start codon of the gene. GUS was expressed from the nominally constitutive 35S promoter and the antisense RNA was expressed from the light-regulated ca/b promoter of Arabidopsis thaliana. A range of GUS inhibition from 0 to 100% was obtained by screening a small population of transgenic plants and the specific levels of inhibition observed were stably inherited in two generations. An antiGUS 'gene' dosage effect was observed in plants which were homozygous for antiGUS. RNA detection results suggest that duplex formation with the 41 base pair antiGUS RNA destabilized the GUS mRNA and that an excess of antisense RNA was not required. Our results demonstrate the potential of antisense RNA as a strategy for obtaining plant mutants, especially 'down mutations' in essential genes where only a short 5' sequence of the mRNA is required. They also suggest that the 'position effect' on gene expression could be used in conjunction with an antisense RNA strategy to provide a versatile approach for crop improvement.
