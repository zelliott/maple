This study presents the first complete sequence of an IncU plasmid, pFBAOT6. This plasmid was originally isolated from a strain of Aeromonas caviae from hospital effluent (Westmorland General Hospital, Kendal, United Kingdom) in September 1997 (G. Rhodes, G. Huys, J. Swings, P. McGann, M. Hiney, P. Smith, and R. W. Pickup, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 66:3883-3890, 2000) and belongs to a group of related plasmids with global ubiquity. pFBAOT6 is 84,748 bp long and has 94 predicted coding sequences, only 12 of which do not have a possible function that has been attributed. Putative replication, maintenance, and transfer functions have been identified and are located in a region in the first 31 kb of the plasmid. The replication region is poorly understood but exhibits some identity at the protein level with replication proteins from the gram-positive bacteria Bacillus and Clostridium. The mating pair formation system is a virB homologue, type IV secretory pathway that is similar in its structural organization to the mating pair formation systems of the related broad-host-range (BHR) environmental plasmids pIPO2, pXF51, and pSB102 from plant-associated bacteria. Partitioning and maintenance genes are homologues of genes in IncP plasmids. The DNA transfer genes and the putative oriT site also exhibit high levels of similarity with those of plasmids pIPO2, pXF51, and pSB102. The genetic load region encompasses 54 kb, comprises the resistance genes, and includes a class I integron, an IS630 relative, and other transposable elements in a 43-kb region that may be a novel Tn1721-flanked composite transposon. This region also contains 24 genes that exhibit the highest levels of identity to chromosomal genes of several plant-associated bacteria. The features of the backbone of pFBAOT6 that are shared with this newly defined group of environmental BHR plasmids suggest that pFBAOT6 may be a relative of this group, but a relative that was isolated from a clinical bacterial environment rather than a plant-associated bacterial environment.
