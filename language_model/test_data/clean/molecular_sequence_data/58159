Eighty-eight patients with acute thermal injury were evaluated. Forty-eight hours after injury, TNF, IL-6, and IL-8 were significantly present in the systemic circulation, lung, normal skin, and thermally injured skin. The presence of TNF, IL-6, and IL-8 proteins in the lung, normal skin, and thermally injured skin were associated with TNF, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA upregulation. Logistic regression analysis controlling for the Abbreviated Burn Severity Index demonstrated that the presence of IL-8 in the lung was associated with early pulmonary physiologic dysfunction (p = 0.006) and nosocomial pulmonary infection (p = 0.040). We conclude that acute thermal injury initiates an early systemic, lung, and skin response involving TNF, IL-6, and IL-8. The TNF, IL-6, and IL-8 protein present in the lung and skin in response to acute thermal injury are generated locally and do not originate from the systemic cytokine pool. The lung cytokine response to acute thermal injury may initiate local organ failure.
