A cDNA clone, OsGAmyb, which encodes a homologue to the barley Myb-like transcription factor, HvGAMyb, was isolated from a rice endosperm cDNA library. The clone was used to show that expression of the OsGAmyb gene in aleurone cells was stimulated by gibberellic acid and the gene product was shown to transactivate an alpha-amylase gene promoter in transient expression analyses.
