The taxonomic status of two bacterial strains isolated from human blood was characterized using a polyphasic approach. Chemotaxonomic investigations revealed the presence of cell-wall chemotype IV, short-chain mycolic acids that co-migrated with those extracted from members of the genus Williamsia and that produce C(16 : 0) and C(18 : 0) fatty acids on pyrolysis GC, and dihydrogenated menaquinone with nine isoprene units as the predominant isoprenologue. The generic assignment was confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that these isolates constitute a distinct phyletic line within the genus Williamsia, displaying 96.2 and 97.2 % sequence similarities to Williamsia muralis and Williamsia maris, respectively. The two isolates could be distinguished from the type strains of the latter species on the basis of several phenotypic traits. The genotypic and phenotypic data show that the strains merit classification as a novel species of Williamsia, for which the name Williamsia deligens sp. nov. is proposed, with type strain IMMIB RIV-956T (= DSM 44902T = CCUG 50873T).
