Integrins are prominent receptors known from vertebrates and the higher phyla of invertebrates. Until now, no evidence has been provided for the existence of integrins in the lowest Metazoa, the sponges (Porifera). We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone encoding the alpha subunit of integrin from the marine sponge Geodia cydonium (GCINTEG). The open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 1,086 residues (118 kDa). The intracellular domain features the sequence Tyr-Phe-x-Gly-Phe-Phe-x-Arg, which is different in one residue from the characteristic consensus pattern for integrin alpha subunits. We conclude that sponges, the oldest multicellular animal phylum, already utilize the structural elements which are required for a tuned and controlled interaction among cells, and between cells and the extracellular matrix.
