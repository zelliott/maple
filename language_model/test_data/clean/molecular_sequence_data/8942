Bacteriophage (phage) KPP10 has been used in experimental phage therapies directed against P. aeruginosa infections. To examine the eligibility of phage KPP10 as a therapeutic phage, its genome was analyzed. The genomic DNA was shown to be 88,322Â bp long, with 158 open reading frames (ORFs), and three tRNA genes were predicted. No ORF-encoded pathogenicity or lysogenization factor was predicted. A comparative genomic analysis revealed that phage KPP10, together with phage PAK_P3, can be grouped as a new type of lytic phage infecting P. aeruginosa. Phage KPP10 is considered to be suitable for therapeutic purposes because it is a lytic phage without ORF-encoded pathogenicity or a lysogenization factors.
