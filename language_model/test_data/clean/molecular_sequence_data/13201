Kinetochores are DNA-protein structures that assemble on centromeric DNA and attach chromosomes to spindle microtubules. Because of their simplicity, the 125-bp centromeres of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are particularly amenable to molecular analysis. Budding yeast centromeres contain three sequence elements of which centromere DNA sequence element III (CDEIII) appears to be particularly important. cis-acting mutations in CDEIII and trans-acting mutations in genes encoding subunits of the CDEIII-binding complex (CBF3) prevent correct chromosome transmission. Using temperature-sensitive mutations in CBF3 subunits, we show a strong correlation between DNA-binding activity measured in vitro and kinetochore activity in vivo. We extend previous findings by Goh and Kilmartin [Goh, P.-Y. & Kilmartin, J.V. (1993) J. Cell Biol. 121, 503-512] to argue that DNA-bound CBF3 may be involved in the operation of a mitotic checkpoint but that functional CBF3 is not required for the assembly of a bipolar spindle.
