In this report we describe the identification of a novel DPB1 allele, DPB1*02014, found in an Italian Caucasian individual. The new allele was detected during routine HLA sequence-based typing (SBT) for an individual undergoing bone marrow transplantation. DPB1*02014 was identical to DPB1*02012 except for a single nucleotide substitution in codon 72 (GTG-->GTT). This nucleotide change represents a synonimous mutation, as both triplets code for a valine. This new allele has been submitted to GenBank and assigned the accession number AF326565. The WHO Nomenclature Committee has officially assigned the name DPB1*02014.
