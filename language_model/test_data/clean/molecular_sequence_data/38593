During Xenopus early development, the length of the poly(A) tail of maternal mRNAs is a key element of translational control. Several sequence elements (cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements) localized in 3' untranslated regions have been shown to be responsible for the cytoplasmic polyadenylation of certain maternal mRNAs. Here, we demonstrate that the mRNA encoding the catalytic subunit of phosphatase 2A is polyadenylated after fertilization of Xenopus eggs. This polyadenylation is mediated by the additive effects of two cis elements, one being similar to already described cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements and the other consisting of a polycytosine motif. Finally, a candidate specificity factor for polycytosine-mediated cytoplasmic polyadenylation has been purified and identified as the Xenopus homologue of human alpha-CP2.
