The indirect intracellular polymerase chain reaction (in situ PCR) combines the potential sensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the high specificity and morphological preservation of in situ hybridization (ISH). This study describes a method for the amplification of small, specific cytomegalovirus (CMV) genomic sequences [100 base pairs (bp)] within large formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. A heat-resistant glue surrounds the section, creating a well which contains a relatively large volume of isotonic reaction solution without a covering mineral oil layer; this optimizes morphological preservation, permits the evaluation of large sections, and allows both denaturation steps and up to 40 cycles of in situ PCR to be performed, whilst progressively concentrating the reaction solution by evaporation during thermal cycling. ISH was performed using a non-isotopic DNA probe with specificity for CMV, with or without prior in situ PCR amplification, both for samples on slides (fibroblasts and lung) and in suspension (fibroblasts). Samples on slides were evaluated by both blinded studies and image analysis, comparing the intensity of signal (P < 0.003) and the numbers of positive cells detected (P < 0.007), with or without intracellular amplification. Cells in suspension were analysed by blinded studies on cytospins and by gel electrophoresis of cell lysates. Successful intracellular amplification was achieved in this high copy model.
