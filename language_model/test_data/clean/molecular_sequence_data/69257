A 1.4-kb full-length cDNA was isolated from a library constructed from activated human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-transformed human T-lymphocytes. Sequence analysis identified this cDNA as a new member of the human nerve-growth-factor receptor/tumor-necrosis-factor receptor family and as the potential human homologue of the murine sequence, 4-1BB. The gene encodes three cysteine-rich motifs in the extracellular domain which are characteristic of this receptor family, a transmembrane region and a short N-terminal cytoplasmic portion which contains potential phosphorylation sites.
