SC-3 cells derived from mouse mammary carcinoma (Shionogi carcinoma 115) exhibit remarkable growth enhancement and cell morphology change in response to androgen stimuli. These events are mediated through an androgen-induced growth factor (AIGF). Amino acid sequence deduced from cDNA reveals that AIGF has 215 amino acids with a signal peptide and scattered regions homologous to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family proteins. The biological ability of AIGF to stimulate SC-3 cell growth is inhibited by heparin or suramin. More importantly, antisense oligodeoxynucleotide of AIGF can block androgen-induced growth of SC-3 cells. Upon synthesis under the control of androgen, AIGF is immediately secreted into the extracellular space without intracellular accumulation. At the early phase (18-24 h) of androgen stimulation, however, AIGF is mainly associated with the glycosaminoglycan on the cell surface or extracellular matrix. In addition, treatment of SC-3 cells with sulfation blocker (chlorate) or heparitinase results in the abolishment of their ability to respond to androgen or AIGF, indicating that heparan sulfate has important roles for condensing AIGF on or near the cell surface as well as potentiating the biological activity of AIGF. Then, AIGF can bind to the FGF receptor. Northern blot analysis and cDNA cloning indicate that SC-3 cells predominantly express the FGF receptor 1 with some altered amino acid sequences. Transfection of expression vectors of AIGF and this variant form of FGF receptor 1 into FGF receptor-negative myoblast cells (L 6 cells) confirms that a variant form of FGF receptor 1 is a receptor of AIGF. These results clearly demonstrate that an autocrine mechanism is operating in androgen-induced growth of SC-3 cells.
