A synthetic human interferon gamma (hIFN-gamma) gene was fused to SP1 and SP3, two Sec-dependent artificial signal peptides to transport the hIFN-gamma to the periplasm of Escherichia coli BL21-SI. The processing efficiency of both SP1-hIFN-gamma and SP3-hIFN-gamma was dependent on the culture medium as well as the post-induction temperature. Both precursors were processed completely when cells were cultured using minimal medium and a post-induction temperature of 32.5 degrees C, and only the processed hIFN-gamma was detected. The SP3 signal peptide was more efficient than SP1 for the secretion of hIFN-gamma. Sixty percent of the total hIFN-gamma was secreted to the periplasm using the SP3 signal peptide and a post-induction temperature of 20 degrees C. Using Tris-sucrose-dithiothreitol (TSD) hypertonic buffer, the periplasmic soluble hINF-gamma was recovered with a purity of 85%.
