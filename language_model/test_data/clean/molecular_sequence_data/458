Four new oligosaccharides (1-4), one new pregnane glycoside (5), and one new cardiac glycoside (6) were isolated from the roots of Periploca forrestii Schltr. (Asclepiadaceae), a traditional Chinese medicine used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and wounds. Their structures were characterized on the basis of extensive analysis of NMR (1H, 13C NMR, 1H-1H COSY, HSQC, HMBC, TOCSY and ROESY) spectra.
