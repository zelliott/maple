Studies of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype and subtype structure in patients with chronic hepatitis C in 3 regions of the Central federal district of Russia.

Hepatitis C virus genotype and subtype structure was determined in patients with chronic HCV infection in Moscow (1993 - 1995 and 2005), Moscow region (2008) and Vladimir region (1993 -1995, 2005-2007). HCV genotype was determined by using A. Widell et al. (1994) technique, PCR (AmpliSens diagnostic kits), Genotype C test system.

In all studied regions and during all the time periods the first position in rating belonged to HCV 1b subtype. In 1993 - 1995 and 2005 - 2007 period changes in HCV genotype and subtype structure were registered that consisted of relative weight of 1b subtype decrease and 3a subtype increase. Subtype 1b in females with chronic hepatitis C was registered more often than in males. In Vladimir region 3a subtype in males was detected more often than in females. In males older than 30 years the first rating position belongs to 1b subtype and in males younger than 30 years--subtype 3a. In females older than 30 years in Moscow region and Vladimir region, as well as in females younger than 30 years in Vladimir region subtype 1b was detected more often, while in Moscow region HCV subtypes 1b and 3a were detected with the same rate of 47.6%.

Currently there is an urgent need to include mandatory monitoring of hepatitis C virus genetic variants into the system of hepatitis C epidemiologic control in Russia. This approach will allow for a significant increase in quality of hepatitis C serological diagnostics, and can be used in the prognosis of evolution of the epidemic process of this disease.
