The Shaker K+ channel belongs to a family of structurally related voltage-activated cation channels that play a central role in cellular electrical signaling. By studying multiple site-directed mutants of the Shaker K+ channel, a region that forms the binding site for a pore-blocking scorpion toxin has been identified. The region contains a sequence that is highly conserved among cloned K+ channels and may contribute to the formation of the ion conduction pore.
