Artificial nucleases have developed into powerful tools for introducing precise genome modifications in a wide variety of species. In this chapter the authors provide detailed protocols for rapidly constructing zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and TALE nucleases (TALENs) and evaluating their activity for the targeted generation of InDels within the zebrafish genome.
