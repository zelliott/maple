In the guinea pig, cold acclimation induced a conversion of unilocular to multilocular adipocytes in interscapular (IS) and retroperitoneal (RP) fat depots but not in the epididymal (EP) fat pad. The conversion was associated with an increase in mitochondriogenesis and the appearance of the uncoupling protein. The maximal lipolytic responses to norepinephrine and dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate were decreased in IS cells, unchanged in RP cells, and increased in EP cells, suggesting a site-specific regulation of lipolysis at the postreceptor level. beta 3-Adrenergic agonists were not lipolytic regardless of the depot and the thermal environment of the animal. These agents did not inhibit glucose transport and lipogenesis, as was previously reported for rodents. Cloning and sequencing of the guinea pig beta 3-adrenoceptor gene revealed a slightly higher amino acid sequence similarity with the human than with the rodent beta 3-adrenoceptors. beta 3-Adrenoceptor transcripts were present at a very low level in guinea pig adipocytes, and mRNA levels did not increase to a significant extent after cold acclimation. The guinea pig thus differs from rodents by an absence of beta 3-adrenergic effects and by low beta 3-adrenoceptor expression in brown and white adipose tissues.
