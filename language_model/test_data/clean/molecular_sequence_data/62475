We describe here the characterization of five isolates of Mycobacterium simiae-like organisms representing a novel group based on whole-cell fatty acid analysis and genotypic evaluation. Two of the five isolates in this study, W55 and W58, were previously considered to belong to M. simiae serotype 2. Analysis of cellular fatty acids by gas-liquid chromatography indicated a close clustering of this group, which was well differentiated from the other M. simiae-like species. Molecular characterization was performed by nucleic acid sequencing of the small subunit rRNA gene and the gene encoding the 65-kDa heat shock protein and genomic DNA hybridization. Sequence analysis of the entire 16S rRNA gene showed a unique sequence most closely related to those of M. triplex and M. simiae. The hsp65 partial gene sequence was identical for the five isolates, with 97% identity to the M. simiae type strain. However, qualitative whole genomic DNA hybridization analysis confirmed that this group is genetically distinct from M. simiae and M. triplex. Antimicrobial susceptibilities for this group resemble those of M. simiae and M. lentiflavum. We conclude that this group represents a unique Mycobacterium species for which we propose the name Mycobacterium sherrisii sp. nov.
