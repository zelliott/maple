Peroxisome division is regulated by the conserved peroxin Pex11p. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc), induction of the phosphoprotein ScPex11p coincides with peroxisome biogenesis. We show that the ScPex11p homologue in Pichia pastoris (PpPex11p) is phosphorylated at serine 173. PpPex11p expression and phosphorylation are induced in oleate and coordinated with peroxisome biogenesis. PpPex11p transits to peroxisomes via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). PpPex11p is unstable and ER restricted gin pex3Δ and pex19Δ cells, which are impaired in peroxisomal membrane protein biogenesis. In oleate medium, the P. pastoris mutants pex11A (constitutively unphosphorylated; S173A) and pex11D (constitutively phosphorylated; S173D) exhibit juxtaposed elongated peroxisomes (JEPs) and hyperdivided forms, respectively, although protein levels remain unchanged. In contrast with ScPex11p, the ER-to-peroxisome translocation in P. pastoris is phosphorylation independent, and the phosphorylation occurs at the peroxisome. We show that PpPex11p interacts with the peroxisome fission machinery via PpFis1p and is regulated by phosphorylation because PpPex11p and PpPex11Dp interact more strongly with PpFis1p than PpPex11Ap. Neither PpPex11p nor PpFis1p is necessary for peroxisome division in methanol medium. We propose a model for the role of PpPex11p in the regulation of peroxisome division through a phosphorylation-dependent interaction with the fission machinery, providing novel insights into peroxisome morphogenesis.
