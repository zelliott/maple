Plasma lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), also known as platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), is a member of the serine-dependent class of A2 phospholipases that hydrolyze sn2-ester bonds of fragmented or oxidized phospholipids at sites where atherosclerotic plaques are forming. Most circulating Lp-PLA2 is bound to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles in plasma and the rest to high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Deficiency of Lp-PLA2 is a predisposing factor for cardiovascular diseases in the Japanese population. We describe here two novel mutations of the gene encoding Lp-PLA2, InsA191 and I317N in Japanese subjects. The first patient, with partial Lp-PLA2 deficiency, was heterozygous for the InsA191 mutation; macrophages from this patient secreted only half the normal amount of Lp-PLA2 in vitro. The other patient, who showed complete Lp-PLA2 deficiency, was a compound heterozygote for the novel I317N mutation and a common V279F mutation; macrophages from that patient failed to secrete any Lp-PLA2. Measurement of Lp-PLA2 mass, activity and Western blotting verified impaired production and secretion of the enzyme after transfection of mutant construct into COS-7 cells. These results indicated that both novel mutants, InsA191 and I317N, impair function of the Lp-PLA2 gene.
