The mammalian mitochondrial genome is a double-stranded circular DNA molecule, which is transcribed from both strands as polycistronic RNAs, which are further processed to yield the mature polyadenylated mRNAs, rRNAs and tRNAs. We compared the gene expression patterns of foetal and adult porcine brains and identified a sequence tag from the ATPase 6 region of the mitochondrial genome which, in adult brain, was more abundant in the sense (H-strand) form, but, in foetal brain, more abundant in the antisense form (L-strand). By means of solution hybridisation/S1 nuclease protection assay, Northern blotting, and PCR based techniques, we demonstrated that the ATPase 6 region of the porcine mitochondrial genome is transcribed as co-existing, stable sense and antisense RNAs. Furthermore, we identified sense and antisense transcripts from this region consisting of inversely assembled fragments joined together at a direct repeat of 7 nucleotides. Our results suggest that transcription and post-transcriptional processing of mitochondrial RNAs are much more complex than presently thought.
