Type III protein-arginine methyltransferase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (RMT2) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. The cytosolic, ribosomal, and ribosome salt wash fractions from yeast cells lacking RMT2 were used as substrates for the recombinant RMT2. Using S-adenosyl-l-methionine as co-substrate, RMT2 methylated a protein in the ribosome salt wash fraction. The same protein in the ribosomal fraction was also methylated by RMT2 after pretreating the sample with endonuclease. Amino acid analysis affirmed that the labeling products were delta-N-monomethylarginines. The methylated protein from the ribosomal or the ribosome salt wash fraction was isolated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified as ribosomal protein L12 by mass spectrometry. Using synthetic peptides, recombinant L12, and its mutant as substrates, we pinpointed Arg(67) on ribosomal protein L12 as the methyl acceptor. L12 was isolated from wild type yeast cells that have been grown in the presence of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-(3)H]methionine and subjected to amino acid analysis. The results indicate that L12 contains delta-N-monomethylarginines.
