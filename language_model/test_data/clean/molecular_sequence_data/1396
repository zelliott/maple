Voltage-dependent calcium channels are classified into low voltage-activated and high voltage-activated channels. We have investigated the molecular basis for this difference in voltage dependence of activation by constructing chimeras between a low voltage-activated channel (Ca(V)3.1) and a high voltage-activated channel (Ca(V)1.2), focusing on steady-state activation properties. Wild type and chimeras were expressed in oocytes, and two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were made of calcium channel currents. Replacement of domains I, III, or IV of the Ca 3.1 channel with the corresponding domain of Ca(V)1.2 led (V)to high voltage-activated channels; for these constructs the current/voltage (I/V) curves were similar to those for Ca(V)1.2 wild type. However, replacement of domain II gave only a small shift to the right of the I/V curve and modulation of the activation kinetics but did not lead to a high voltage-activating channel with an I/V curve like Ca 1.2. We also investigated the role of the voltage sensor (V)S4 by replacing the S4 segment of Ca(V)3.1 with that of Ca 1.2. For domain I, there was no shift in the I/V curve (V)as compared with Ca(V)3.1, and there were relatively small shifts to the right for domains III and IV. Taken together, these results suggest that domains I, III, and IV (rather than domain II) are apparently critical for channel opening and, therefore, contribute strongly to the difference in voltage dependence of activation between Ca 3.1 and Ca(V)1.2. However, the S4 segments in domains I, (V)III, and IV did not account for this difference in voltage dependence.
