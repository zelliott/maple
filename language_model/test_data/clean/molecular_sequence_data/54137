Mungbean Yellow Mosaic India Virus (MYMIV) belonging to the genus begomovirus causes the yellow mosaic disease in a number of economically important edible grain legumes including mungbean (Vigna radiata), urdbean (Vigna mungo) and soybean (Glycine max). The disease is severe, critical, open spread and inflicts heavy yield losses annually. The objective of this study is to develop molecular markers linked to MYMIV-resistance to facilitate genotyping of urdbean and mungbean germplasms for MYMIV-reaction. Resistance-linked molecular markers were successfully developed from consensus motifs of other resistance (R) gene or R gene homologue sequences. Applying linked marker-assisted genotyping, plant breeders can carry out repeated genotyping throughout the growing season in absence of any disease incidence. Two MYMIV-resistance marker loci, YR4 and CYR1, were identified and of these two CYR1 is completely linked with MYMIV-resistant germplasms and co-segregating with MYMIV-resistant F₂, F₃ progenies of urdbean. The present study demonstrated that these two markers could be efficiently employed together in a multiplex-PCR-reaction for genotyping both V. mungo and V. radiata germplasms from field grown plants and also directly from the seed stock. This method of genotyping would save time and labour during the introgression of MYMIV-resistance through molecular breeding, as methods of phenotyping against begomoviruses are tedious, labour and time intensive.
