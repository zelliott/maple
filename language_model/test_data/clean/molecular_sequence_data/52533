A sequential oligopeptide carrier of antigenic peptides is presented, incorporating two Aib residues in each repetitive moiety: Ac-(Aib-Lys-Aib-Gly)(n) (SOC(n) -II; n = 2-4). The conformational study, by (1)H-nmr, CD, and Fourier transform ir spectroscopy, indicated that the SOC(n) -II carrier displays a pronounced 3(10)-helix, compared to the Ac-(Lys-Aib-Gly)(n) (SOC(n) -I) carrier of the same approximately backbone length, previously reported. One of the dominant autoimmune epitopes of the Sm and U1RNP cellular components, the PPGMRPP sequence, was coupled to the Lys-N(epsilon)H(2) groups of the SOC(n) -II carrier and used as antigenic substrate for detecting anti-Sm/U1RNP autoantibodies in ELISA assays. Anti-Sm antibodies are highly specific for systemic lupus erythematosus, while anti-U1RNP are specific for mixed connective tissue disease. The anti-(PPGMRPP)(5)-SOC(n) -II ELISA was compared with the anti-(PPGMRPP)(n) -SOC(n) -I ELISA, provided that both antigenic substrates possess the same amount of the epitope replicates. The significance of the lysine positions along the oligopeptide backbone of the carrier for a favorable antibody recognition of the anchored antigens is also examined.
