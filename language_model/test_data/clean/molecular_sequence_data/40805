Diplomitoporus rimosus is a white rot polypore widely distributed in western N America, collected once in Africa, and is reported here from Iran. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of partial nuclear ribosomal LSU and ITS revealed that, unlike the generic type D. flavescens nested within the polyporoid clade, D. rimosus is positioned in the hymenochaetoid clade. A new genus is introduced to accommodate the species. Cyanotrama gen. nov. is recognized by its resupinate habit, narrow and strongly cyanophilous skeletal hyphae, barrel-shaped to short clavate basidia, variable presence of hyphal pegs and growth on conifers, especially Juniperus. Comparisons are made with representatives of polypores having similar morphological characteristics especially with cyanophilous skeletals. The biogeography of Cyanotrama rimosa with regard to its association with Juniperus woodlands is discussed briefly.
