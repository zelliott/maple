RecQ family helicases play a key role in chromosome maintenance. Despite extensive biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies, the mechanism by which helicase unwinds double-stranded DNA remains to be elucidated. Using a wide array of biochemical and biophysical approaches, we have previously shown that the Escherichia coli RecQ helicase functions as a monomer. In this study, we have further characterized the kinetic mechanism of the RecQ-catalyzed unwinding of duplex DNA using the fluorometric stopped-flow method based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Our results show that RecQ helicase binds preferentially to 3'-flanking duplex DNA. Under the pre-steady-state conditions, the burst amplitude reveals a 1:1 ratio between RecQ and DNA substrate, suggesting that an active monomeric form of RecQ helicase is involved in the catalysis. Under the single-turnover conditions, the RecQ-catalyzed unwinding is independent of the 3'-tail length, indicating that functional interactions between RecQ molecules are not implicated in the DNA unwinding. It was further determined that RecQ unwinds DNA rapidly with a step size of 4 bp and a rate of approximately 21 steps/s. These kinetic results not only further support our previous conclusion that E. coli RecQ functions as a monomer but also suggest that some of the Superfamily 2 helicases may function through an "inchworm" mechanism.
