DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a nuclear protein serine/threonine kinase in a wide variety of vertebrate species and it has a role in the DNA repair and recombination process of lymphoid development. DNA-PK is composed of a large catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and DNA-binding protein, Ku. Recently, the mouse and human DNA-PKcs interacting proteins (Kip/KIP) have been reported. In this report, we have determined the complete genomic structure of mouse and human Kip/KIP genes. The total length of mouse Kip gene and human KIP gene are approximately 5.7 kb and 3.6 kb in genomic DNAs, respectively. Both of genes consist of 7 exons.
