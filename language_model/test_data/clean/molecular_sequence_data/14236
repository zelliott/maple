The hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus litoralis strain NS-C, first isolated in 1985, has been a foundational organism for archaeal research in biocatalysis, DNA replication, metabolism, and the discovery of inteins. Here, we present the genome sequence of T. litoralis with a focus on the replication machinery and inteins.
