The mammalian placenta is a unique organ for the study of developmental changes. Placentas of laboratory animals such as the mouse allow for the determination of the exact stage of pregnancy, which cannot be achieved with human placenta. In this study, neutral glycosphingolipids were isolated from mouse (inbred strain C57BL/6) placentas, from day 10 to day 18 of gestation, and were separated by high performance thin layer chromatography. Densitometric measurements after orcinol staining showed, at day 10 of gestation, the presence of mono-, tetra-, tri- and dihexosylceramide in decreasing quantities, as well as four unidentified spots. On day 12, the glycosphingolipid composition changed with the disappearance of the unidentified spots and the appearance of an orcinol positive migrating similarly to the Forssman antigen; no further changes occurred between days 12 and 18 of gestation. The identity of the Forssman-like glycosphingolipid with the Forssman antigen was established by binding of 125I labelled Helix pomatia agglutinin (alpha-GalNAc specific) to glycosphingolipids separated on high performance thin layer chromatography plates, and by the reaction of the isolated glycosphingolipid with a monoclonal anti-Forssman antibody. The appearance of the Forssman antigen at day 12 of gestation coincided with the day of final maturation of the mouse placenta and subsequent cessation of growth, suggesting a possible role of the glycosphingolipid during embryonic development.
