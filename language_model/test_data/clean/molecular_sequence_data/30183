The rat liver soluble catechol-O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.6.) has been purified utilizing a combination of conventional chromatography and HPLC. The purified enzyme has a molecular mass of 25 kDa, a pI of 5.1, and exists in two forms which differ in the nature of their intramolecular disulfide bonds. This difference causes these two protein forms to behave differently in reversed phase chromatography.
