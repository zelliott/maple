Nitrogenase Fe-protein modification was analyzed in the endophytic beta-proteobacterium Azoarcus sp. BH72. Application of modern MS techniques localized the modification in the peptide sequence and revealed it to be an ADP-ribosylation on Arg102 of one subunit of nitrogenase Fe-protein. A double digest with trypsin and endoproteinase Asp-N was necessary to obtain an analyzable peptide because the modification blocked the trypsin cleavage site at this residue. Furthermore, a peptide extraction protocol without trifluoroacetic acid was crucial to acquire the modified peptide, indicating an acid lability of the ADP-ribosylation. This finding was supported by the presence of a truncated version of the original peptide with Arg102 exchanged by ornithine. Site-directed mutagenesis verified that the ADP-ribosylation occurred on Arg102. With our approach, we were able to localize a labile modification within a large peptide of 31 amino acid residues. The present study provides a method suitable for the identification of so far unknown protein modifications on nitrogenases or other proteins. It represents a new tool for the MS analysis of protein mono-ADP-ribosylations.
