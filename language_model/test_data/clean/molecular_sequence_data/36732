We have employed synthetic peptides with sequences corresponding to the integrin receptor-recognition regions of fibrinogen as inhibitors of platelet aggregation and adhesion to fibrinogen- and fibrin-coated surfaces in flowing whole blood, using a rectangular perfusion chamber at wall shear rates of 300 s-1 and 1,300 s-1. D-RGDW caused substantial inhibition of platelet aggregation and adhesion to fibrinogen and fibrin at both shear rates, although it was least effective at blocking platelet adhesion to fibrin at 300 s-1. RGDS was a weaker inhibitor, and produced a biphasic dose-response curve; SDRG was inactive. HHLGGAKQAGDV partially inhibited platelet aggregation and adhesion to fibrin(ogen) at both shear rates. These results support the identification of an RGD-specific receptor, most likely the platelet integrin glycoprotein IIb:IIIa, as the primary receptor responsible for platelet:fibrin(ogen) adhesive interactions under flow conditions, and indicate that platelet adhesion to surface bound fibrin(ogen) is stabilized by multivalent receptor-ligand contacts.
