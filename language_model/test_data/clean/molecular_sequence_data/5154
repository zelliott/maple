Polyclonal or monoclonal human IgM rheumatoid factors (RF) react with eight antigenic sites on the CH3 IgG domain, four sites on CH2 and two on human beta 2-microglobulin. All 14 of these RF-reactive epitopes are linear 7-11 amino acid peptides with different primary sequence. We questioned whether RF reactivity with such a variety of epitopes showing no obvious sequence homology might result from conformational similarities shared by various RF-reactive regions. Strong support for this concept was obtained using rabbit antisera as well as mouse mAbs to individual CH3, CH2 or beta 2m RF-reactive peptides. Major cross-reactivity was demonstrated between most of the 14 different CH3, CH2, or beta 2m RF-reactive peptides using individual anti-epitope antibodies. Molecular modelling studies of these peptides showed striking similarities in three-dimensional shape among many RF-reactive peptides. Main-chain atoms rather than side chains seemed to contribute most directly to conformational similarity. Molecular simulation studies on control peptides showed no conformational similarities with RF-reactive peptides. Our studies indicate that autoantibodies such as RF recognize main-chain conformations of reactive epitopes and react with a number of antigenic determinants of quite different primary sequence but similar main chain conformations.
