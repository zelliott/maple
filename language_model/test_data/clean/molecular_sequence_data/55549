Aerococcus viridans is a catalase-negative Gram-positive bacterium and has been described as an airborne organism widely distributed in the hospital environment or in clinical specimens. We isolated A. viridans strain LL1 from indoor dust samples collected by a patient. Here, we prepared a genome sequence for this strain consisting of 31 contigs totaling 1,994,039 bases and a GC content of 39.42%.
