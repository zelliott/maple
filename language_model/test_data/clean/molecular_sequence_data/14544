Testis-specific tandemly repeated Stellate genes are part of the Ste-Su(Ste) genetic system required for male fertility in Drosophila melanogaster. Stellate genes encode a functional homolog of the β-subunit of protein kinase CK2. Derepression of Stellate results in their over-expression, meiotic disturbances and male sterility. Stellate genes are represented by clustered copies in the X chromosome and carry promoters shared with another X-chromosome cluster, βNACtes genes, encoding putative β-subunits of the nascent polypeptide-associated complex. Using Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay, we revealed in the Stellate promoter three cis-acting elements, E-boxes, the loss of which greatly diminished the reporter gene expression in Drosophila testes. We identified that these E-boxes were recognized by helix-loop-helix protein, dUSF (Drosophila ortholog of mammalian USF) in testis nuclear extract. All three E-boxes were preserved in the promoters of both euchromatic and heterochromatic Stellate clusters. Two analogous E-boxes were detected in the promoters of 5'-copies of the duplicated βNACtes gene pairs, whereas the 3'-copies lacked these sites but possessed a new binding site for a testis protein distinct from dUSF. Here we characterized a new type of testis-specific core promoter and identified dUSF as its interacting transcription factor.
