The β-1,4-endoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.4) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii (EGPh) has strong hydrolyzing activity toward crystalline cellulose. When EGPh is used in combination with β-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21), cellulose is completely hydrolyzed to glucose at high temperature, suggesting great potential for EGPh in bioethanol industrial applications. The crystal structure of EGPh shows a triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) (β/α)(8)-barrel fold with an N-terminal antiparallel β-sheet at the opposite side of the active site and a very short C-terminal sequence outside of the barrel structure. We describe here the function of the peripheral sequences outside of the TIM barrel core structure. Sequential deletions were performed from both N and C termini. The activity, thermostability, and pH stability of the expressed mutants were assessed and compared to the wild-type EGPh enzyme. Our results demonstrate that the TIM barrel core is essential for enzyme activity and that the N-terminal β-sheet is critical for enzyme thermostability. Bioinformatics analyses identified potential key residues which may contribute to enzyme hyperthermostability.
