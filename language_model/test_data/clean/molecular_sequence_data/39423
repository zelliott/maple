The anti-Müllerian hormone gene (Amh) is responsible for regression in males of the Müllerian ducts. The molecular mechanism of regulation of chicken Amh expression is poorly understood. To investigate the regulation of chicken Amh expression, we have cloned Amh cDNAs from quail and duck as well as the promoter regions of the gene from chicken, quail, and duck. The expression patterns of Amh during embryonic development in these three species were found to be similar, suggesting that the regulatory mechanisms of Amh expression are conserved. The sequence of the proximal promoter of Amh contains a putative binding site for steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1), the protein product of which can up-regulate Amh in mammals. We showed here that SF1 is able to activate the chicken Amh promoter and binds to its putative SF1 binding site. These results suggest that SF1 plays a role in regulation of Amh expression in avian species.
