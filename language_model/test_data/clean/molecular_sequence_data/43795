Domain exchange constructs that traded regions surrounding the homeodomain were constructed for two kn1-like genes, KNAT1 and KNAT3, and introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana under the control of the 35S CaMV promoter. The kn1-like homeodomain proteins all have the homeodomain located near the C-terminus of the protein, and also share a second conserved domain (the ELK domain) immediately N-terminal to the homeodomain. Progeny were scored for the appearance of the KNAT1 overexpression phenotype. A construct containing the KNAT3 N-terminus and the KNAT1 ELK- and homeodomain resulted in a KNAT1 overexpression phenotype, indicating that specificity mainly resides within the ELK- and homeodomain region. Further exchanges demonstrated that specificity probably does not arise from a single region within the ELK and/or homeodomain but rather requires sequences both N-terminal and C-terminal to residue 23 of the homeodomain. Further, in contrast to some animal homeodomains, KNAT1 does not utilize the residues of the N-terminal arm of the homeodomain for specificity.
