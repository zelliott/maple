Three cDNA clones of rat renal dipeptidase (rrDP) were isolated from rat renal and pulmonary cDNA libraries using a DNA fragment of human renal DP cDNA clone, MDP4, as a probe. The complete amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA contains 410 amino acid residues, beginning with a signal peptide of 16 amino acid residues. RNA blot hybridization analysis showed that 1.6 and 2.2 kb mRNAs were expressed in lung and kidney, however, only 1.6 kb mRNA was detected in small intestine. COS-1 cells transfected with the cDNA expressed enzymatically active rrDP.
