A bacterial strain, designated DNG6(T), was isolated from forest soil of the Changbai mountains, Heilongjiang province, China. Cells of strain DNG6(T) were Gram-negative, 0.3-0.5 mum in diameter and 1.0-2.0 mum in length, strictly aerobic and produced large amounts of extracellular fibrillar material. Growth occurred at 16-33 degrees C (optimum, 28 degrees C), at pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum, pH 7.0-7.5) and in the presence of 0-1 % NaCl (optimum, 0 %). Strain DNG6(T) contained MK-7 as the major respiratory quinone and iso-C(15 : 0) (40.6 %) and summed feature 4 comprising iso-C(17 : 1) I and/or anteiso-C(17 : 1) B (26.5 %) as the major cellular fatty acids. The DNA G+C content was 48.1 mol% (T(m)). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the closest relative of strain DNG6(T) was Adhaeribacter aquaticus MBRG1.5(T) with 93.9 % sequence similarity. Based on these results, it is concluded that strain DNG6(T) represents a novel species of the genus Adhaeribacter, for which the name Adhaeribacter terreus is proposed, with strain DNG6(T) (=CGMCC 1.6961(T)=NBRC 104235(T)) as the type strain.
