When a human fetal muscle cDNA library was screened with the human thyroid hormone receptor alpha 2 cDNA at low stringency, we found a weakly hybridizing cDNA. The sequence of the insert was 2498 basepairs, with an open reading frame of 1794 basepairs encoding a protein of 598 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 64 kDa. The DNA-binding domain and the ligand-binding domain are similar to those of steroid and thyroid hormone receptors. Moreover, this cDNA is highly homologous to mouse nur77 and rat NGFI-B, which are early response genes induced by nerve growth factor and other serum growth factors. We designated this gene NAK1. The modulation of expression of NAK1 during stimulation of cell growth was studied. The mRNA of NAK1 was induced rapidly and transiently by growth-stimulating agents, such as adenosine diphosphate, in monkey kidney cells (BSC-1), by phytohemagglutinin in human lymphocytes, and by serum stimulation of arrested fibroblasts. It is expressed in human fetal muscle and adult liver, brain, and thyroid. NAK1 could be a nuclear receptor. It will be of great interest to determine the ligand for NAK1 and the genes that are regulated by it.
