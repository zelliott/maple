cDNA clones of the fish Cyprinus carpio growth hormone (GH) mRNA have been isolated from a cDNA library prepared from carp pituitary gland poly(A)+RNA. The nucleotide sequence of one of the carp GH cDNA clones containing an insert of 1164 nucleotides (nt) was determined. The cDNA sequence was found to encode a polypeptide of 210 amino acids (aa) including a signal peptide of 22 aa and to contain 5' and 3' untranslated regions of the mRNA of 36 and 498 nt, respectively. The carp GH presents a 63% amino acid sequence homology with the salmon GH, has structural features common with other GH polypeptides of mammalian or avian origin and contains domains of conserved sequence near the N- and C-terminal regions. Southern blot hybridization of carp genomic DNA with GH cDNA probes shows the presence of at least two GH-coding sequences in the fish genome.
