The design of synthetic agents to disrupt protein-protein interactions has received relatively little attention in recent years. In this review we describe strategies for targeting different types of protein surfaces using mimetics of protein secondary or tertiary structure. In this way strong and selective binding to a protein surface has be achieved and disruption of clinically important protein-protein interactions has been demonstrated in models of human disease.
