The major cellular receptor for the primate immunodeficiency viruses is the CD4 molecule. As well as mediating virion attachment to the cell surface, CD4 is thought to activate the viral fusion pathway. CD4 is not, however, sufficient for viral entry; other molecules are probably involved, and in certain circumstances these may substitute for CD4. Viral tropism and cytopathogenicity are also influenced by receptor interactions.
