A new eGH molecular species was isolated and purified by reverse phase HPLC. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, amino acid composition, and C- and N-terminal determinations support a primary structure identical to that described by Zakin et al. (1976), except for the lack of the 76-92 peptidic fragment and the maintaining of 30% of its biological activity.
