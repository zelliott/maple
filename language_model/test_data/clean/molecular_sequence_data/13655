This paper describes the expression profile of the CD44 glycoprotein during differentiation of embryonal carcinoma (EC) and embryonic stem (ES) cells. We have recently shown that CD44 is expressed in discrete embryonic structures and, in view of this, we sought an in vitro differentiation model of development in which we could study more readily the structure and function of the CD44 molecule. The P19 EC and CGR8 ES cells were chosen as they have the capacity to develop down the cardiac muscle pathway and we have previously demonstrated that CD44 is expressed abundantly in the embryonic myocardium. The differentiation process in both cell types is accompanied by an induction of CD44 mRNA and protein. However, in differentiated cultures CD44 is not expressed in contractile cells, indicating that these P19 cells do not represent CD44-positive embryonic cardiomyocytes. Expression of CD44 is observed on fibroblast-like cells which appear to migrate over and out from the plated aggregates. Hyaluronan, the major ligand for CD44, is also associated with these CD44-positive fibroblast-like cells. It is suggested that expression of both receptor and ligand by the fibroblast cells is required for cell:matrix adhesion and cell motility. As CD44 is up-regulated in these cultures, P19 cells are now established as a useful model system to study the factors regulating expression of the CD44 gene.
