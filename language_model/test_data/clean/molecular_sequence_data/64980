The phenotype variety caused by glycine substitutions in alpha5(IV) chain in X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS) prompted the complexity of structure changes of alpha5(IV) chain that was little to know now. In this study, we expressed a domain of alpha5(IV) chain containing different glycine substitutions (G1015V and G1030S, respectively) which were revealed in two XLAS pedigrees with different phenotype severities and the corresponding domain of a control in Escherichia coli. The recombinant proteins were characterized by immunoblot and mass spectrometry and analyzed the secondary structure by using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. CD analysis showed that the recombinant protein containing G1015V mutation identified in the pedigree of juvenile-onset XLAS exhibited 12.9% alpha-helix that was not found in the control recombinant protein. The spectrum of the recombinant protein containing G1030S mutation identified in the pedigree of adult-onset XLAS was slightly different from that of the control, that is, mostly with the random coil and the beta-sheet, while without alpha-helix. These results demonstrated that two kinds of glycine substitutions, although in the same domain of alpha5(IV) chain, displayed the distinctly different secondary structures. The changes of the secondary structure could explain the phenotypic diversities of XLAS, which would be hardly understood solely by analyzing genomic DNA or mRNA of alpha5(IV) chain.
