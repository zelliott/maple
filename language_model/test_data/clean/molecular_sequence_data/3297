Staphylococcal infections that result from an alteration in a patient's immune response at the surgical site are a major problem in procedures that incorporate biomaterials in trauma surgery and joint replacement. Diagnosis of infection based on pathogen detection is difficult and exacerbated by increasing numbers of partially or totally resistant strains of nosocomial pathogens, particularly Staphylococcus aureus. Expression profiling of a host's cellular immune response could facilitate the identification of the pathways involved in pathogen recognition and eradication and could lead to more rational design of drugs and therapies. To this end, we constructed and characterized ten individually tagged and directionally cloned cDNA libraries from peripheral blood cells (PBC), spleen (Sp), thymus (Th), lymph node (LN), and bone marrow (BM) from immunologically naive and challenged pigs as part of an implant-associated orthopedic model of deep infection. Three of these libraries were normalized at C(0)(t) values 5, 10, 20, and 30. The libraries comprise more than 20 million primary transformants with an average insert length >1.4 kb. Cluster analysis of 7620 ESTs revealed 1029 clusters containing an average of 3.6 sequences and 3846 singletons. Gene discovery is estimated to be approximately 64%. Searches of public databases resulted in 49.3% annotated porcine sequences, of which 22.2% had significant homologies to ESTs from a variety of species, and 28.5% were without a significant match in any public database. We also identified 9.1% ESTs as involved in host cell and organism defense and 11.5% related to cell signaling and communication. These sequences, together with the 28.5% appearing as novel, are of specific interest to the infectious disease process.
