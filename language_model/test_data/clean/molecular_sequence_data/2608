Suitable assay conditions for the detection of cytosolic protein-tyrosine kinase activities in crude extracts of various rat tissues have been determined. Cytosolic protein-tyrosine kinases showed common characteristics including substrate specificity and divalent cation requirement. Using (Val5) angiotensin II and Mn2+ rather than a src-related synthetic peptide, E11G1, and Mg2+, we obtained higher activities of cytosolic protein-tyrosine kinases. Among various rat tissues tested, spleen, bone marrow, thymus, small intestine, appendix and lung, in decreasing order of total activity, contained high activities of cytosolic protein-tyrosine kinases. These results suggest that the enzyme activities in lymphatic organs and in organs closely related to cell proliferation are high. The assay system described allows the precise measurement of cytosolic protein-tyrosine kinase activity in various rat tissues, both normal and malignant.
