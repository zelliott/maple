Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs) are key enzymes that are involved in the homeostasis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). Different isoforms exist, which are found in diverse cell compartments, for example the cytosol, mitochondria, and plant chloroplasts. NDPK2 of Pisum sativum has been shown to be localised in chloroplasts. Two forms of different size have been reported in plastids and it has been speculated that they function in distinct suborganellar compartments. We investigated the import behaviour and localisation of these two isoforms. Our results indicate that they do not differ in their route of entry into the organelle and both forms end up in the chloroplast stroma.
