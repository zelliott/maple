The transmembrane (TM) domains of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are believed to be important players in RTK signal transduction. However, the degree of specificity and promiscuity of RTK TM domain lateral interactions in mammalian membranes has not been assessed in detail in the literature. A technique to probe the occurrence of interactions between TM domains and their biological significance is to evaluate the propensity for formation of heterodimers of a full-length RTK and its TM domain. Here we examine if the inhibition of two RTK pathogenic mutants, Neu/V664E and FGFR3/A391E, can be achieved by the TM domains of Neu, Neu/V664E, FGFR3 and FGFR3/A391E. We show that the TM domain of Neu/V664E specifically inhibits the phosphorylation of full-length Neu/V664E, while the wild-type Neu TM domain does not. In addition, Neu/V664E TM domain does not affect the phosphorylation levels of full-length FGFR3/A391E. The results suggest that TM domain peptides could be exploited in the future for the development of specific inhibitors of mutant RTKs.
