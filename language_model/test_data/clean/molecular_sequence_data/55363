Expression of isotopically labeled peptide standards as artificial concatamers (QconCATs) allows for the multiplex quantification of proteins in unlabeled samples by mass spectrometry. We have developed a generalizable QconCAT design strategy, which we term IQcat, wherein concatenated peptides are binned by pI to facilitate MS-sample enrichment by isoelectric focusing. Our method utilizes a rapid (âˆ¼2 weeks), inexpensive and scalable purification of arg/lys labeled IQcat standards in the Escherichia coli auxotroph AT713. With this pipeline, we assess the fidelity of IQcat-based absolute quantification for ten yeast proteins over a broad concentration range in a single information-rich isoelectric fraction. The technique is further employed for a quantitative study of androgen-dependent protein expression in cultured prostate cancer cells.
