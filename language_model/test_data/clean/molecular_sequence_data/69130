We show that the reverse transcriptase (RT) encoded by the Mauriceville mitochondrial plasmid of Neurospora closely resembles viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases in initiating cDNA synthesis opposite the penultimate C residue of a 3' tRNA-like structure and has the unprecedented ability for a DNA polymerase to initiate DNA synthesis at a specific site in a natural template without a primer. The Mauriceville plasmid enzyme can also use DNA or RNA primers in a manner suggesting how a primitive RT could have evolved from an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase into retroviral and other types of RTs. The characteristics of the Mauriceville plasmid RT suggest that it may be related to the progenitor of present-day RTs and DNA polymerases.
