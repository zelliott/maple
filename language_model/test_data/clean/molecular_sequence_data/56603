The bacteriophage T4 nrdB gene, encoding the ribonucleotide reductase small subunit, contains a self-splicing group IA2 intron with an ochre codon in frame with the preceding exon sequence. The stop codon was changed to an amino acid codon and splicing efficiency was compared with that of the wild type in the presence and absence of translation. In vivo the mutant has a much lower efficiency for producing a mature transcript than the wild type. Also, the relative production of the full-length translation product is correspondingly lower in the mutant than in the wild type. These results confirm the importance of the stop codon, which spans the splice site of the nrdB intron. The occurrence of stop codons in 56 group I introns in protein-encoding genes was investigated. In 33 of those translation is terminated upstream of the first common elements of the catalytic core, of group I introns. In the rest translation is terminated in intron regions outside the heart of the catalytic core, with one exception. Our observations suggest that in situations where transcription and translation are coupled events there has been an evolutionary pressure to preserve stop codons in the 5'-region of these introns or to prevent translational termination from occurring in vital parts of the introns.
