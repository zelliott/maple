Human hepatitis B virus (HBV) variants containing in-frame core internal deletion (CID) have been demonstrated to contain all the functional features of defective interfering (DI) particles (Yuan, T. T.-T., M.-H. Lin, D. S. Chen, and C. Shih, 1998, J. Virol. 72, 578-584). Here, we report that out-of-frame HBV CID variants exhibit defective interfering property similar to in-frame CID variants characterized previously. This result raises the possibility that it may be the deleted pregenomic RNA product, rather than the deleted core protein product, that is responsible for interference. Furthermore, a genomic deletion elsewhere does not cause interference since preS2 deletion variants exhibit no influence on wild-type HBV replication. Consistent with the natural occurrence of HBV CID variants, we recently identified CID variants of woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) in natural infection. However, unlike HBV CID variants, functional characterization of WHV CID variants using a human hepatoma cell line has not revealed any interference in tissue culture. In summary, defective interference is a general phenomenon for both in-frame and out-of-frame HBV CID variants.
