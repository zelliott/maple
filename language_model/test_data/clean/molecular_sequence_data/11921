A short 5' splice site RNA oligonucleotide (5'SS RNA oligo) undergoes both steps of splicing when a second RNA containing the 3' splice site region (3'SS RNA) is added in trans. This trans-splicing reaction displays the same 5' and 3' splice site sequence requirements as cis-splicing of full-length pre-mRNA. The analysis of RNA-snRNP complexes formed on each of the two splice site RNAs is consistent with the formation of partial complexes, which then associate to form the complete spliceosome. Specifically, U2 snRNP bound to the 3'SS RNA associates with U4/U5/U6 snRNP bound to the 5'SS RNA oligo. Thus, as expected, trans-splicing depends on the integrity of U2, U4, and U6 snRNAs. However, unlike cis-splicing, trans-splicing is enhanced when the 5' end of U1 snRNA is blocked or removed or when the U1 snRNP is depleted. Thus, the early regulatory requirement for U1 snRNP, which is essential in cis-splicing, is bypassed in this trans-splicing system. This simplified trans-splicing reaction offers a unique model system in which to study the mechanistic details of pre-mRNA splicing.
