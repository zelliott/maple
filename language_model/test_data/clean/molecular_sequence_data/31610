Calreticulin (CRT) is a highly conserved chaperone-like lectin that regulates Ca(2+) homeostasis and participates in protein quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Most of our CRT knowledge came from mammalian studies, but our understanding of plant CRTs is limited. Many plants contain more than two CRTs that form two distinct groups: CRT1/CRT2 and CRT3. Previous studies on plant CRTs were focused on their Ca(2+)-binding function, but recent studies revealed a crucial role for the Arabidopsis CRT3 in ER retention of a mutant brassinosteroid receptor, brassinosteroid-insensitive 1-9 (bri1-9) and in complete folding of a plant immunity receptor EF-Tu Receptor (EFR). However, little is known about the molecular basis of the functional specification of the CRTs. We have recently shown that the C-terminal domain of CRT3, which is rich in basic residues, is essential for retaining bri1-9 in the ER; however, its role in assisting EFR folding has not been studied. Here, we used an insertional mutant of CRT3, ebs2-8 (EMS mutagenized bri1 suppressor 2-8), in the bri1-9 background as a genetic system to investigate the functional importance of two basic residue clusters in the CRT3's C-terminal domain. Complementation experiments of ebs2-8 bri1-9 with mutant CRT3(M) transgenes showed that a highly conserved basic tetrapeptide Arg(392)Arg (393)Arg(394)Lys(395) is essential but a less conserved basic tetrapeptide Arg(401)Arg(402)Arg(403)Arg(404) is dispensable for the quality control function of CRT3 that retains bri1-9 in the ER and facilitates the complete folding of EFR.
