Tail-anchored proteins have an NH(2)-terminal cytosolic domain anchored to intracellular membranes by a single, COOH-terminal, transmembrane segment. Sequence analysis identified 55 tail-anchored proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with several novel proteins, including Prm3, which we find is required for karyogamy and is tail-anchored in the nuclear envelope. A total of six tail-anchored proteins are present in the mitochondrial outer membrane and have relatively hydrophilic transmembrane segments that serve as targeting signals. The rest, by far the majority, localize via a bipartite system of signals: uniformly hydrophobic tail anchors are first inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum, and additional segments within the cytosolic domain of each protein can dictate subsequent sorting to a precise destination within the cell.
