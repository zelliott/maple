The capsular polysaccharide of Escherichia coli K31 has been found by methylation analysis and n.m.r. spectroscopy to be based on the hexasaccharide shown. The sequence of the repeating unit was deduced from the combined results of beta-elimination, lithium-ethylenediamine degradation, and hydrogen-fluoride and selective hydrolyses. The nature of the anomeric linkages, established by chromic acid oxidation, was confirmed by 1H-coupled 13C-n.m.r. spectroscopy. Two dimensional n.m.r. studies on a low molecular weight polymer obtained by bacteriophage depolymerization are also reported. (formula; see text)
