The S1 species of reovirus mRNA contains two overlapping open reading frames. Both are utilized in either virus-infected or S1 DNA transfected mammalian cells, resulting in two different polypeptides from a single mRNA. Consistent with ribosome scanning, expression of the downstream reading frame was increased by sequence changes that diminished the consensus around the upstream initiator site. However, the upstream product was not decreased by the same changes, suggesting that its synthesis is rate-limited at elongation. The results suggest a model for regulating bicistronic mRNA translation in which the ribosomes in one reading frame interfere with the movement of ribosomes in the other frame due to different rates of elongation.
