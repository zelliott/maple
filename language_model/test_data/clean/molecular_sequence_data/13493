The specific interaction between biotin and avidin was exploited in the affinity purification of solid-phase synthesized peptide libraries. During peptide library synthesis, by means of the single-resin method in which coupling on variable positions is carried out using an equimolar mixture of amino acids, biotin was used to cap the unreacted amino groups remaining after coupling of the equimolar amino acid mixture. The following synthesis and deprotection procedures were performed as usual in tert,-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry. The purification of the peptide mixture containing N-biotinylated sequences was performed by affinity chromatography on an avidin-agarose column. The unwanted terminated sequences were retained in the avidin column while the purified peptide mixture was eluted as indicated by reverse-phase HPLC and MS analysis monitoring. The avidin column was regenerated and the biotinylated sequences were released under reversible denaturing conditions. The usefulness of biotinylation for peptide library purification is demonstrated here for the first time for a peptide mixture containing by-products that cannot be separated from the mixture by classical HPLC purification. This purification technique could be applied to all syntheses, presenting difficult reacting steps.
