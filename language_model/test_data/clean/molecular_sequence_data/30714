The distribution of the proopiomelanocortin-derivated amidated joining peptide (JP-N) was examined in the human pituitary gland, adrenal gland, gut and in three bronchial carcinoids. Double immunostaining showed coexistence of immunoreactive JP-N and other proopiomelanocortin derivatives, e.g., ACTH, beta-endorphin, Pro-tau-MSH, in the pituitary gland and adrenal medulla. The JP-N immunoreactive cells in the adrenal medulla were identified as a subpopulation of adrenaline-producing cells by means of an antiserum against phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase. In the gut immunoreactive JP-N was costored with somatostatin in endocrine cells. Using radioimmunoassay, JP-N was found in higher concentrations than ACTH and alpha-MSH in the gut but not in the adrenal gland. Gel chromatography of gastric antrum and adrenal gland extracts showed three and two dominating components of immunoreactive JP-N, respectively, but under reduced conditions most of the immunoreactive material appeared as of low molecular weight in both extracts. In conclusion, immunoreactive JP-N is a major product from the processing of proopiomelanocortin in human extrapituitary tissues. The molecular forms of immunoreactive JP-N correspond to previous findings in the human pituitary gland.
