The OXA-7 gene, which encodes an oxacillinase, was cloned from plasmid pMG202 of Escherichia coli isolate 7181 (A. A. Medeiros, M. Cohenford, and G. A. Jacoby, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 27:715-719, 1985) and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the OXA-7 gene was closely related to that of the OXA-10 (PSE-2) gene, with a derived amino acid sequence of the OXA-7 enzyme showing greater than 95% homology with those of OXA-10 and OXA-11.
