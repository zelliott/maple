This chapter describes a current perception of the molecular interactions regulating myofilament activity in heart cells. The focus is on the interaction between troponin-C (TnC), the Ca(2+)-receptor and troponin I (TnI), an inhibitory protein. It is this interaction that appears to form a molecular switch that turns on the thin filament. It will be seen that control of the actin-myosin reaction is not only through Ca(2+)-binding to TnC, but also through steric, cooperative and allosteric processes involving all of the main myofilament proteins-actin, myosin, tropomyosin (Tm), troponin T (TnT), TnC, and TnI. The process is modulated by covalent and non-covalent mechanisms. The process is altered in diverse myopathies and pathologies of the heart and is a target for pharmacological manipulation by a new class of inotropic agents, the "Ca(2+)-sensitizers".
