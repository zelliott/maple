CLN6 is a polytopic membrane protein of unknown function resident in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mutant CLN6 causes the lysosomal storage disorder neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Defining the topology of CLN6, and the structural domains and motifs required for interaction with cytosolic and luminal proteins may allow insights into its function. In this study we analysed the topology, ER retention and oligomerization of CLN6. We demonstrated, by differential membrane permeabilization of transfected BHK cells using specific detergents and two distinct antibodies, that CLN6 contains an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, seven transmembrane domains, and a luminal C terminus. Mutational analyses and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that changes of potential ER localization signals in the N- or C-terminal domain (a triple arginine cluster, and a dileucine motif) did not alter the subcellular localization of CLN6. The deletion of a dilysine motif impaired partially the ER localization of CLN6. Furthermore, expression analyses of fusion and deletion constructs in non-neuronal and neuronal cells suggested that two portions of CLN6 contributed to its retention within the ER. We showed that the N-terminal domain was necessary but not sufficient for ER retention of CLN6 and that deletion of transmembrane domains 6 and 7 was accompanied with the loss of ER localization and, in some instances, trafficking to the cisGolgi. From these data we concluded that CLN6 maintains its ER localization by expressing retention signals present in both the N-terminal cytosolic domain and in the carboxy-proximal transmembrane domains 6 and 7. Additionally, the ability of CLN6 to homodimerize may also prevent exit from the ER via an interaction with membrane-associated factors.
