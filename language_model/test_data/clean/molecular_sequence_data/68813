Processing of HCV viral precursor protein requires at least two viral proteinases, Cpro-1 and Cpro-2, in addition to cellular proteinases. The HCV polypeptide that covers the region for the two viral proteinase domains was expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. The two proteinase activities were demonstrated in the infected cells. The Cpro-1-dependent cleavage site was estimated from the amino acid sequence of the N-terminus of the processed product. Analyses of the susceptibilities of various mutants altered at position P1 and P1' of the putative cleavage site suggested that amino acid residues at these positions is not essential for recognition and cleavage by Cpro-1-dependent activity.
