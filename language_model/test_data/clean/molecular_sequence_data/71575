A rapid and highly sensitive method for detecting hog cholera virus (HCV) based on a reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is developed. Primers complementary to the most homologous sites of virus genome in an area coding the precursor for glycoproteins gp44/gp48 are selected. Detection of the virus in pathological material by the RT-PCR showed that use of these primers in amplification allows detection of different HCV strains.
