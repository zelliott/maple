In the prophage P4, expression of the early genes is prevented by premature termination of transcription from the constitutive promoter PLE. In order to identify the region coding for the immunity determinant, we cloned several fragments of P4 DNA and tested their ability to confer immunity to P4 superinfection. A 357 bp long fragment (P4 8418-8774) is sufficient to confer immunity to an infecting P4 phage and to complement the immunity-defective P4 cl405 mutant, both in the presence and in the absence of the helper phage P2. The immunity region covers PLE and the cl locus. We were unable to obtain evidence of translation of the region, thus we suggest that P4 immunity is not elicited by a protein but by a transcript (or transcripts) encoded by the region downstream of the promoter PLE. The promoter PLE appears to be necessary for the expression of P4 immunity: fragments in which the PLE region is deleted did not complement P4 cl405 for lysogenization, although they still interfered with P4 growth. Two complementary sequences downstream of PLE (seqA and seqB) at the 5' and 3' ends of the immunity region play an essential role in the control of P4 immunity.
