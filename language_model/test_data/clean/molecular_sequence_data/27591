AO region (884 b.p.) of ORAgp5 locus has been sequenced and proved to contain mos-related regions, as well as fragments structurally similar to proretroviral elements and Alu repeats. The data obtained are in accordance with earlier hypotheses on retroviral involvement in mos gene family generation and the role of Alu repeat insertion in the inactivation of mos-related genes. Molecular hybridisation studies showed the structural conservation of the segment in ORAgp5 locus comprising the AO region among higher primates. These data indicate that AO region of ORAgp5 was formed not later than 65-70 MYR ago and that the present structure of this region was kept during last 50 MYR.
