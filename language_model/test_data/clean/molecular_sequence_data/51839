Neoplastic progression in patients with chronic ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by the development of epithelial dysplasia, which is accompanied by genetic abnormalities that can be detected by flow cytometric and molecular biologic methods. Distribution of and correlation between histologic abnormalities, DNA content, and loss of heterozygosity for a p53 allele (p53 LOH) in the colons of nine UC patients were analyzed. Loss of a p53 allele was found in 85% (22/26) of biopsy specimens classified histologically as carcinoma, 63% (25/40) of biopsy specimens with high grade dysplasia, and 33% (7/21) of biopsy specimens with low grade dysplasia. Loss of heterozygosity for p53 was also found in 9% (5/57) of biopsy specimens indefinite for dysplasia and in 1/18 biopsy specimens negative for dysplasia, showing that this genetic change may occur early in the histological progression towards carcinoma. Aneuploid DNA contents were more common than p53 LOH in regions with negative, indefinite or low grade dysplastic histology; moreover, p53 LOH was detected only in aneuploid cells and not in diploid epithelium. Aneuploidy alone was not as specific a marker for the concomitant presence of dysplasia or carcinoma in a biopsy sample as aneuploidy combined with p53 LOH. These findings show that aneuploidy may precede both p53 LOH and epithelial dysplasia. Two UC patients' colons contained geographically separated clones of cells with different aneuploidies that also showed loss of different p53 alleles, suggesting that neoplasia may arise within different populations of cells in separate areas of the same colon.
