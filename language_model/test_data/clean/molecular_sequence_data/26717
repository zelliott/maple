In most species of Megaloptera, adult males and females have similar coloration. In this paper, we associate the adult female of a Chinese endemic dobsonfly species, Protohermes niger Yang & Yang, using molecular evidence from two mitochondrial genes (16S rRNA and COI). The body and wing coloration between the male and the female of P. niger exhibits distinct sexual dimorphism. Â
