Genes encoding 3-hydroxybutyrate oligomer hydrolase (PhaZc) and 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (Hbd) were isolated from Paracoccus denitrificans. PhaZc and Hbd were overproduced as His-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity and gel filtration chromatography. Purified His-tagged proteins had molecular masses of 31 kDa and 120 kDa (a tetramer of 29-kDa subunits). The His-tagged PhaZc hydrolyzed not only 3-hydroxybutyrate oligomers but also 3-hydroxyvalerate oligomers. The His-tagged Hbd catalyzed the dehydrogenation of 3-hydroxyvalerate as well as 3-hydroxybutyrate. When both enzymes were included in the same enzymatic reaction system with 3-hydroxyvalerate dimer, sequential reactions occurred, suggesting that PhaZc and Hbd play an important role in the intracellular degradation of poly(3-hydroxyvalerate). When the phaZc gene was disrupted in P. denitrificans by insertional inactivation, the mutant strain lost PhaZc activity. When the phaZc-disrupted P. denitrificans was complemented with phaZc, PhaZc activity was restored. These results suggest that P. denitrificans carries a single phaZc gene. Disruption of the phaZc gene in P. denitrificans affected the degradation rate of PHA.
