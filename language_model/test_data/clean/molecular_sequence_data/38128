It has been shown that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) modulates not only macrophage functions, but also T cell functions. However, detailed analysis of the MIF function on responses of various T cell subpopulations remained to be elucidated. In this report, using a neutralizing anti-MIF monoclonal antibody (mAb) we examined MIF functions on various T cell lineages. It was shown that anti-MIF mAb inhibited antigen-specific responses of both IFN-gamma producing and IL-4 producing T cells. The inhibition appeared to be related to blockade of the signal pathway via T cell receptor (TCR) but not that via IL-2 receptor (IL-2R). However, the anti-MIF mAb showed no inhibitory effect on NK-T cell responses stimulated through TCR. These results suggest that MIF is involved in the signal pathway via TCR in mainstream T cells but not in NK-T cells.
