The human polymorphic epithelial mucin (PEM) is expressed apically by glandular epithelium and by the carcinomas that develop from these tissues. Previously isolated cDNA clones revealed that the core protein contained a large domain consisting of variable numbers of 60 bp tandem repeats (TR), making it an expressed minisatellite. We now report the full genomic sequence of the PEM gene, including 803 bp of 5' flanking sequence. The gene is composed of 7 exons and varies in size from approximately 4 to approximately 7 kb, depending on the number of tandem repeats in exon 2. Expression of PEM was obtained from a genomic clone in an Epstein-Barr virus based vector, after transfection into a human epithelial cell line, indicating the presence of effective regulatory sequences in this clone.
