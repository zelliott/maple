Nearly two decades ago, it was observed that cells infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV) acquired an IgG Fc binding activity. The properties of the viral Fc receptor (FcR) have now been characterized by several laboratories. The Fc binding activity appears on the surface of the infected cell prior to formation of progeny virions. The FcR induced by HSV has been identified as the HSV glycoprotein, gE. When HSV gE forms a complex with a second HSV glycoprotein, gI, the receptor binds IgG with higher affinity. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which is closely related to HSV, has also been shown to induce an FcR. Like the HSV FcR, the FcR specified by VZV possesses characteristics common to viral glycoproteins. VZV encodes two glycoproteins, gpI and gpIV, which are the homologs of HSV gE and gI. The VZV glycoproteins have many properties common to cell surface receptors, including O-linked glycans and phosphorylation sites. However, extensive computer-assisted analyses of the amino acid sequences of VZV gpI and gpIV did not uncover regions of homology to the human cellular Fc receptors for IgG.
