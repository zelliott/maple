Since phosphatidylserine (PS) is known to translocate to the external face of the plasma membrane when the cell membrane becomes disordered, we decided to focus our attention on PS as a target molecule for gene delivery. In this paper, the novel peptide Td3701 was designed, synthesized, and characterized for its physico-chemico-biological properties. Td3701 simultaneously exhibited both characters as a DNA carrier and a sensor probe for active targeting, which seemed to be triggered by structural changes in the presence of PS. This is a very unique character among nonviral vectors, and it is believed that Td3701 could be used for selective gene delivery.
