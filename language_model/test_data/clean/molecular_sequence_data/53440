The emergence of syncytium-inducing (SI) variants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in infected individuals is an indicator of poor prognosis and is often correlated with faster CD4(+) cell depletion and rapid disease progression. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a pleiotropic cytokine with various immune-modulating functions including induction of immunoglobulin E (IgE) production in B cells, down-regulation of CCR5 (a coreceptor for HIV-1 non-SI [NSI] strains), and up-regulation of CXCR4 (a coreceptor for HIV-1 SI variants). Here we show that homozygosity of a polymorphism in the IL-4 promoter region, IL-4 -589T, is correlated with increased rates of SI variant acquisition in HIV-1-infected individuals in Japan. This mutation was also shown to be associated with elevated serum IgE levels in HIV-1-infected individuals, especially in those at advanced stages of disease. In contrast, neither a triallele polymorphism in IL-10, another Th2 cytokine, nor a biallele polymorphism in the RANTES promoter affected acquisition of the SI phenotype. This finding suggested that IL-4-589T increases IL-4 production in the human body and thus accelerates the phenotypic switch of HIV-1 from NSI to SI and possibly disease progression of AIDS.
