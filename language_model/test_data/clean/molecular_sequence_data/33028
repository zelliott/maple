8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) is one of the most important oxidative DNA lesions, and G-rich telomeric DNA is especially susceptible to oxidative DNA damage. RecQ helicases WRN and BLM and telomere-binding protein POT1 are thought to play roles in telomere maintenance. This study examines the ability of WRN, BLM, and RecQ5 to unwind and POT1 to bind telomeric D-loops containing 8-oxodG. The results demonstrate that WRN and BLM preferentially unwind telomeric D-loops containing 8-oxodG and that POT1 binds with higher affinity to telomeric D-loops with 8-oxodG but shows no preference for telomeric single-stranded DNA with 8-oxodG. We speculate that telomeric D-loops with 8-oxodG may have a greater tendency to form G-quadruplex DNA structures than telomeric DNA lacking 8-oxodG.
