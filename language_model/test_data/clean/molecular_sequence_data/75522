Homeobox-containing sequences were isolated from a genomic library of zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio). A lambda clone containing two homeobox cross-hybridizing regions was characterized. DNA sequencing of one of these regions (ZF-21) revealed that it contains a homeobox closely related to the Antennapedia class of Drosophila homeobox sequences. Moreover, the deduced amino acid sequence of the C-terminal end (81 residues including the homeobox) is identical to the corresponding part of the murine Hox-2.1 protein. Similar to Hox-2.1, a ZF-21 derived transcript of 2.3 kb is present in embryos at the somite forming stages.
