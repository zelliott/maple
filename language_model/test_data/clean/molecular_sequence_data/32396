We have recently reported novel short nucleotide (six and eighteen) polymorphic insertions, in the MCL-1 promoter and their association with higher mRNA and protein levels. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that these insertions directly affect MCL-1 gene expression. Haematopoietic and epithelial human cell lines were transfected with +0, +6, or +18 MCL-1 promoter fragments positioned upstream of the Firefly luciferase reporter gene. The cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Compared to +0, both polymorphic insertions (+6 and +18) were associated with increased promoter activity. Although chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that there are Sp1/Sp3 binding sites in the MCL-1 promoter, electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that it is unlikely that these sites are in the region harboring these insertions. These results provide further evidence for the biological effect of MCL-1 promoter polymorphisms on gene expression.
