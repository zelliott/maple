The nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) present in tobacco smoke is a major carcinogen involved in tobacco-induced lung cancer. Its complex bioactivation along two pathways, which leads to methylation and pyridyloxobutylation of DNA, makes the study of NNK-induced DNA damage difficult. We selected two nitroso compounds, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) and N-nitroso(acetoxymethyl)methylamine (NDMAOAc), with which to map NNK-induced DNA methylation frequency at every nucleotide position. We address the issue of how sequence context and complex chromatin structures, present in living cells, regulate the formation of modified purines through methylation generated by MNU and NDMAOAc. For comparison purposes, purified DNA was treated with dimethyl sulfate (DMS). We used ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction to map and conduct a high-resolution footprinting analysis of the DNA damage along the p53 gene (exons 5-8), the ras gene family (exons 1 and 2 of H-, K-, and N-ras genes), and the c-jun promoter in living cells. The distribution of piperidine-sensitive DNA damage induced in cellular DNA and purified DNA by MNU or NDMAOAc was identical. MNU and NDMAOAc methylate more frequently the central guanines in a run of guanines, suggesting a regioselective mechanism for DNA methylation. In contrast, DMS methylates more frequently guanines at the 5'-end of a guanine run; this frequency decreased from the 5'- to the 3'-end. While the presence of adenines in a guanine run does not affect the distribution pattern, the presence of pyrimidines does change said pattern. Our data lead us to suggest that NNK would also methylate DNA sequences in a way similar to that of MNU or NDMAOAc. Footprinted areas of DNA methylated with MNU or NDMAOAc correspond to a consensus sequence for transcription factors AP-1, NF-Jun, CCAAT box, SP-1, and RSRF, as observed in c-jun promoters. Our results are in line with the fact that NNK metabolites, generated through the alpha-hydroxylation pathways, could potentially be mutagenic, since these activated metabolites can methylate guanines. In p53 and ras genes, the frequency of methylation of guanines parallels the frequency of mutations of those same guanines in lung cancer.
