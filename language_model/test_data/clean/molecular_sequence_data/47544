The Xenopus Brachyury-like Xbra3 gene is a novel T-box gene that is closely associated with Xenopus Brachyury. The expression pattern of Xbra3 during development is similar to that of Xbra. During gastrulation Xbra3 is expressed in the marginal zone, with a gradient of increasing expression from ventral to dorsal. In the early neurula stage Xbra3 is expressed in the notochord and posterior mesoderm, but by the tailbud stage its expression is restricted to the forming tailbud and the posterior portion of the notochord.
