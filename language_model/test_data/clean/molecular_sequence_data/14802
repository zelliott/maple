Two groups of previously undescribed anaerobic, gram-positive cocci recovered from human clinical infections were characterized using phenotypic and molecular genotypic methods. Comparative genotypic analysis showed that the strains within each of these two groups were homogeneous within the group and that each group was unique within the genus Peptoniphilus. The first group is most closely related to Peptoniphilus ivorii and the second group to Peptoniphilus harei. Based on these findings we propose two novel species, Peptoniphilus coxii sp. nov. and Peptoniphilus tyrrelliae sp. nov. The type strains are P. coxii sp. nov., RMA 16757(T) (= JCM 16892(T) = CCUG 59622(T) = ATCC BAA-2106(T)) and P. tyrrelliae sp. nov., RMA 19911(T) (= JCM 16893(T) = CCUG 59621(T) = ATCC BAA-2105(T)).
