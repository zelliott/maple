Two members of the family Flavobacteriaceae were isolated from subseafloor sediments using artificial seawater with cellulose, xylan, and chitin as the sole carbon and energy sources. Here, we present the complete genome sequences of Krokinobacter sp. strain 4H-3-7-5 and Lacinutrix sp. strain 5H-3-7-4, which both encode putatively novel enzymes involved in cellulose, hemicellulose, and chitin metabolism.
