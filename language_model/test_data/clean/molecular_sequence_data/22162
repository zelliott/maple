Understanding the specificity of cell-surface carbohydrates interaction with antibodies and receptors is important for the development of new therapeutics and high-sensitivity diagnostics. This approach is, however, limited to the availability of natural and truncated sequences of the oligosaccharides and the sensitivity of the assay system. Reported here is the synthesis of the cancer antigen Globo H hexasaccharide, an epitope found on the cell surface of breast, prostate, and ovarian cancers, and its truncated sequences by using the programmable one-pot synthesis strategy. The saccharides were then arrayed covalently on glass slides with different density and used for the fluorencense-based binding analysis of two monoclonal antibodies against Globo H and the serum from breast cancer patients, to define the specificity of these antibodies. It was shown that the terminal tetrasaccharide binds the monoclonal antibodies equally well as does the hexasaccharide and the fucose residue is required for effective binding. The serum binds both the defucosylated pentasaccharide and the fucosylated hexasaccharide without a significant difference, perhaps because of the polyclonal nature of the serum or the presence of diverse immune responses to different sugar epitopes at various stages. This method requires very small amounts of materials and is more effective and sensitive than the traditional ELISA method, and thus provides another platform to monitor the immune response to carbohydrate epitopes at different stages during differentiation, metastasis, or treatment.
