The sequence of 9 DNA clones obtained from DNA-anti-DNA antibody immune complexes (IC) in 11 SLE patients was analyzed and the possible pathogenic role of the circulating DNA in SLE patients was discussed. Nucleic acid length of 9 cloned DNAs ranged from 87 to 312 base pairs(bp), with a mean length of 177 +/- 62bp, which were rich in guanine (G) + cytosine(C), CpG dinucleotide and palindromic sequences. Oligonucleotide TTTTCAATTCGAAGATGATT which contain the CpG motif in hexamer palindromic sequence segments in cloned DNA augmented the expression of ICAM-1 on the endothelial cells detected by FACS analysis and also augmented the gene expression of several cytokines such as interleukin-2, interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. These data suggest that DNA in IC of SLE patients will augment expression of ICAM-1 on endothelial cells, resulting in exacerbation of vasculitis.
