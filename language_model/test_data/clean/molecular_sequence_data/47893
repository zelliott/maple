Glycosyltransferases are the enzymes that synthesize oligosaccharides, polysaccharides and glycoconjugates. The analysis of the wealth of sequences that are now available in databases allowed the determination of conserved peptide motifs for each class of enzyme. Recent experimental data demonstrated their importance in donor and acceptor substrate binding and in catalysis. Fold-recognition studies provided the first models of the catalytic domains of some of these enzymes, while the first successes in glycosyltransferase crystallography are opening new routes in structural glycobiology.
