The receptor for parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) is a G-protein-coupled receptor with four potential sites for N-linked glycosylation. The contribution of the oligosaccharide moieties to cell surface expression, ligand binding, and signal transduction was investigated. Site-directed mutagenesis of the rat PTH/PTHrP receptor cDNA was performed at single or combination of the four potential glycosylation sites to determine the effect of the putative carbohydrate chains on the activities of the receptor. The results revealed that all four potential N-glycosylation sites in the PTH/PTHrP receptor are glycosylated. Receptors missing a single or multiple glycosylation consensus but with at least one intact glycosylation site expressed sufficiently and functioned normally. In contrast, the nonglycosylated receptor, in which all four glycosylation sites were mutated, is deficient in these functions. These data indicate important roles for N-linked glycosylation in PTH/PTHrP receptor functions.
