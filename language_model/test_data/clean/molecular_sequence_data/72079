Posttranslational processing of preprosecretin generates several COOH-terminally extended forms of secretin and alpha-carboxyl amidated secretin. We used synthetic canine secretin analogs with COOH-terminal -amide, -Gly, or -Gly-Lys-Arg to examine the effects of COOH-terminal extensions of secretin on bioactivity and detection in RIA. Synthetic products were purified by reverse-phase and ion-exchange HPLC and characterized by reverse-phase isocratic HPLC and amino acid, sequence, and mass spectral analyses. Secretin and secretin-Gly were noted to coelute during reverse-phase HPLC. In RIA using eight different antisera raised against amidated secretin, COOH-terminally extended secretins had little or no cross-reactivity. Bioactivity was assessed by measuring pancreatic responses in anesthetized rats. Amidated canine and porcine secretins were equipotent. Secretin-Gly and secretin-Gly-Lys-Arg had potencies of 81 +/- 9% (P > 0.05) and 176 +/- 13% (P < 0.01), respectively, compared with amidated secretin, and the response to secretin-Gly-Lys-Arg lasted significantly longer. These data demonstrate that 1) amidated secretin and secretin-Gly are not separable under some chromatographic conditions, 2) current RIA may not detect bioactive COOH-terminally extended forms of secretin in tissue extracts or blood, and 3) the secretin receptor mediating stimulation of pancreatic secretion recognizes both amidated and COOH-terminally extended secretins.
