Eukaryotic initiation factor-3 (eIF3) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae plays a central role in initiation of translation. The eIF3 complex contains at least eight different proteins, but, as yet, little is known about the function of the individual proteins. In this study we have characterized the role of TIF34 (eIF3-p39), a recently identified WD-40 domain-containing protein of 39 kDa, in the eIF3 complex. Using temperature-sensitive mutants of TIF34 we show that this protein is required for cell cycle progression and for mating and plays an essential role in initiation of protein synthesis. By two-hybrid screening we have identified two partners that directly associate with TIF34: PRT1, a previously characterized eIF3 subunit, and a novel protein of 33 kDa (eIF3-p33) which is part of the eIF3 complex and has an RNA binding domain. TIF34 and p33 interact with each other and overexpression of p33 complements the growth defect of a tif34-ts mutant. Our results provide support for both physical and functional interactions between three subunits, TIF34, PRT1 and p33, in the eIF3 complex.
