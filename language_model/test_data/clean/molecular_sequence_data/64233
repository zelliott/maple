Plant cell walls are composed of a large number of complex polysaccharides, which contain at least 13 different monosaccharides in a multitude of linkages. This structural complexity of cell wall components is paralleled by a large number of predicted glycosyltransferases in plant genomes, which can be grouped into several distinct families based on conserved sequence motifs (B. Henrissat, G.J. Davies [2000] Plant Physiol 124: 1515-1519). Despite the wealth of genomic information in Arabidopsis and several crop plants, the biochemical functions of these coding regions have only been established in a few cases. To lay the foundation for the genetic and biochemical characterization of putative glycosyltransferase genes, we conducted a phylogenetic and expression analysis on 10 predicted coding regions (AtGT11-20) that are closely related to the MUR3 xyloglucan galactosyltransferase of Arabidopsis. All of these proteins contain the conserved sequence motif pfam 03016 that is the hallmark of the beta-d-glucuronosyltransferase domain of exostosins, a class of animal enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the extracellular polysaccharide heparan sulfate. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and promoter:beta-glucuronidase studies indicate that all AtGT genes are transcribed. Although six of the 10 AtGT genes were expressed in all major plant organs, the remaining four genes showed more restricted expression patterns that were either confined to specific organs or to highly specialized cell types such as hydathodes or pollen grains. T-DNA insertion mutants in AtGT13 and AtGT18 displayed reductions in the Gal content of total cell wall material, suggesting that the disrupted genes encode galactosyltransferases in plant cell wall synthesis.
