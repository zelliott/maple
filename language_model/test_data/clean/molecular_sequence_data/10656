Strains of Meiothermus cerbereus sp. nov. were isolated from the hot springs within the Geysir geothermal area of Iceland. The strains of Meiothermus cerbereus produce red-orange-pigmented colonies, have an optimum growth temperature of about 55 degrees C, and have higher levels of 3-OH fatty acids than the strains of the other species of the genus Meiothermus. These strains, unlike all other strains of the species of the genus Meiothermus examined previously, required cysteine, thiosulfate, or thioglycolate for growth in liquid Thermus medium, but not in the corresponding medium solidified with agar. Several strains belonging to Meiothermus silvanus, isolated from Geysir, also required reduced sulfur compounds for growth in liquid medium, leading to the hypothesis that this requirement is not a taxonomic characteristic of the new species. The new species represented by strains GY-1T and GY-5 can be distinguished from the other species of the genus Meiothermus by biochemical characteristics, fatty acid composition, DNA-DNA reassociation values, and 16S ribosomal DNA sequence. The type strain for Meiothermus cerbereus is GY-1 (= DSM 11376).
