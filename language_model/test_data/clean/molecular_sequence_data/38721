The most variable human minisatellites show extreme germline instability dominated by complex intra-allelic rearrangements plus a lower frequency of inter-allelic transfers of repeat units. In contrast, little is known about somatic instability at such loci. We have therefore used single-molecule PCR to analyze mutation at minisatellite CEB1 (D2S90) in human blood DNA. Somatic mutants were rare and involved only relatively simple intra-allelic events, with no bias toward expansions, in sharp contrast to the complex gain-biased rearrangements seen in sperm. Somatic and germline mutation processes were further analyzed in mice transgenic for a cosmid insert containing CEB1. Mutant molecules in transgenic sperm and blood were detected but only at the low frequencies seen in human blood and arose mainly by simple duplications and deletions as seen for somatic mutations in human. These data suggest distinct pathways for germline and somatic CEB1 mutations with germline instability involving recombination-based repair of meiotic double-strand breaks and somatic mutation arising by replication slippage or mitotic recombination. The problem of transferring germline-specific features of minisatellite instability from human to mouse suggests, with other recent observations, that long-range chromatin conformation may be required for the recombination-based mode of germline instability at human minisatellites.
