The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) following on from the two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) technique was applied for the analysis of proteins in a renal stone found in a hyperuricemic patient. This technique was sensitive enough to detect small quantities of proteins even in a renal stone.
