Beta-lactamases have been reported to be largely responsible for beta-lactam resistance in Mycobacteria. We report the characterization of a cell-associated beta-lactamase from Mycobacterium smegmatis. The enzyme hydrolyzed the "beta-lactamase-stable" oximinocephalosporins. Nitrocefin was the best substrate. 6-Beta-iodopenicillanate, clavulanate and sulbactam were effective inhibitors, whereas the Ki value for aztreonam was high. From its substrate and inhibitor profile, the enzyme appeared to be a cephalosporinase of group 2e.
