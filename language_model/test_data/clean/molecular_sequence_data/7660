A Taq1 polymorphism, located in intron 4 of the faciogenital dysplasia (FGD1) gene, the gene responsible for Aarskog syndrome, is described. FGD1 encodes a putative Rho/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor involved in mammalian morphogenesis. The identification of an intragenic polymorphism will facilitate the accurate carrier detection of individuals at risk for Aarskog syndrome.
