Aromatase cytochrome P450 catalyses the reaction to convert androgens to estrogens by coupling with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase in the endoplasmic reticulum. The human aromatase cytochrome P450 gene (CYP19) is expressed in a variety of tissues under regulation of tissue-specific promoters. Previously, we localized a cell-type specific transcriptional enhancer element between -242 and -166 relative to the major cap site of the gene, by transient expression analysis in human BeWo choriocarcinoma cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that the enhancer element consists of two subelements, element I (located between -238 and -200), and element II (located between -196 and -176) as analysed by DNase I footprinting using the nuclear extracts of BeWo cells. The gel mobility shift assay shows that each of these subelements binds specific nuclear factor(s). The transient expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene constructs involving the subelements in BeWo cells reveals that the elements activate reporter gene expression synergistically when present together, nevertheless each of the elements by itself also has an enhancer activity. The transient expression analysis further shows that element I is responsible for the transcriptional synergism with the binding site of a nuclear factor-interleukin-6 (NF-IL-6) (also known as CCAAT enhancer/binding protein beta), which is located between -2141 and -2115 relative to the major cap site of the gene. These results suggest that the enhancer element plays important roles in sustaining the high levels of CYP19 expression in placental cells in cooperation with other cis-acting transcritional regulatory elements.
