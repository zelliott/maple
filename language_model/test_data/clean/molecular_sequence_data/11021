A chicken glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) processed pseudogene was identified by inverse PCR using oligonucleotide primers specific for the 5' region of the GAPDH mRNA. Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of this genomic sequence shows that the processed pseudogene is incomplete and arranged in a permuted tail-to-head order. We propose that the tail-to-head organization is the result of circularization and breakage of a GAPDH retrogene prior to chromosomal integration. PCR analysis of DNAs from quail, pheasant, and various jungle fowl, shows that the processed pseudogene was formed after the three genera diverged but prior to Gallus speciation. This is the first report of a chicken GAPDH processed pseudogene sequence. This is also the first published report of a processed pseudogene with a tail-to-head organization.
