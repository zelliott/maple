Identity elements determine the accurate recognition between tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The arginine system from yeast and Escherichia coli has been studied extensively in the past. However, information about the enzymes from higher eukaryotes is limited and plant aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been largely ignored in this respect. We have designed in vitro tRNA transcripts, based on the soybean tRNA(Arg) primary structure, aiming to investigate its specific aminoacylation by two recombinant plant arginyl-tRNA synthetases and to compare this with the enzyme from E. coli. Identity elements at positions 20 and 35 in plants parallel those previously established for bacteria. Cryptic identity elements in the plant system that are not revealed within a tRNA(Arg) consensus sequence compiled from isodecoders corresponding to nine distinct cytoplasmic, mitochondrial and plastid isoaccepting sequences are located in the acceptor stem. Additionally, it has been shown that U20a and A38 are essential for a fully efficient cognate E. coli arginylation, whereas, for the plant arginyl-tRNA synthetases, these bases can be replaced by G20a and C38 with full retention of activity. G10, a constituent of the 10:25:45 tertiary interaction, is essential for both plant and E. coli activity. Amino acid recognition in terms of discriminating between arginine and canavanine by the arginyl-tRNA synthetase from both kingdoms may be manipulated by changes at different sites within the tRNA structure.
