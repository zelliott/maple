In order to characterize the gene encoding the ligand binding (1(st); alpha) chain of the human IFN-gamma receptor, two overlapping cosmid clones were analyzed. The gene spans over 25 kilobases (kb) of the genomic DNA and has seven exons. The extracellular domain is encoded by exons 1 to 5 and by part of exon 6. The transmembrane region is also encoded by exon 6. Exon 7 encodes the intracellular domain and the 3' untranslated portion. The gene was located on chromosome 6q23.1, as determined by in situ hybridization. The 4 kb region upstream (5') of the gene was sequenced and analyzed for promoter activity. No consensus-matching TATA or CAAT boxes in the 5' region were found. Potential binding sites for Sp1, AP-1, AP-2, and CREB nuclear factors were identified. Compatible with the presence of the Sp1/AP-2 sites and the lack of TATA box, S1-nuclease mapping experiments showed multiple transcription initiation sites. Promoter activity of the 5' flanking region was analyzed with two different reporter genes: the Escherichia coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and human growth hormone. The smallest 5' region of the gene that still had full promoter activity was 692 base pairs in length. In addition, we found sequences belonging to the oldest family of Alu repeats, 2 - 3 kb upstream of the gene, which could be useful for genetic studies.
