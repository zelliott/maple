The mechanism of adhesion of purified mouse polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN) to extracellular matrix proteins characteristic of basement membranes and the interstitium has been investigated and compared with the adhesion of a mouse progranulocytic cell line, 32DC13, and a mouse monocytic cell line, WEHI 78/24. All three cell types bound specifically to fibronectin and vitronectin to different degrees under different cellular activation states. 32DC13 bound to fibronectin and vitronectin strongly, and this binding increased upon cellular activation with phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) but not with formyl-Met-Leu-Phe. Only 32DC13 showed significant binding to laminin-1. By contrast, WEHI 78/24 and PMN bound only fibronectin and vitronectin; this binding was weak and was altered only marginally upon activation with PMA. In the case of WEHI 78/24, a slight increase in adhesion both to fibronectin and to vitronectin was observed after cellular activation with PMA, while PMN adhesion to both substrates was slightly reduced. The mechanism of binding to fibronectin and vitronectin was similar in the three cell types. The integrin alpha5 beta1 mediated fibronectin adhesion, demonstrating for the first time the existence of a functionally active beta1 integrin on mouse PMN. Vitronectin binding was mediated by alpha(v) beta3, as demonstrated by the ability of alpha(v)-specific cyclic L-Arg-L-Gly-L-Asp-D-Phe-L-Val (RGDfV) peptide (EMD66203), and anti-beta3 antibody to inhibit cell adhesion. 32DC13 adhesion to laminin-1 was via the alpha6 beta1 integrin. None of the three cell types tested bound to the basement membrane proteins collagen type IV and perlecan, or to the interstitial stromal constituents tenascin, collagen types I, V and VI. Interestingly, perlecan and collagen type IV were found to repel all three cell types. The relative inability of PMN, WEHI 78/24, and 32DC13 to bind to extracellular matrix proteins characteristic of basement membranes and their ability to bind inflammatory markers of the interstitium is discussed with respect to leukocyte extravasation processes.
