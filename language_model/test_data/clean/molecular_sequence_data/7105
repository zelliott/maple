Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) has been used for rapid typing of Lactobacillus plantarum strains. RAPD was used with either purified chromosomal DNA serving as template in the polymerase chain reaction, or with crude cell extracts, and using a 9-mer primer with 80% G+C content. Amplified DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining after separation on agarose gels. Patterns from 20 Lact. plantarum strains and two Lact. pentosus strains were analysed using the Pearson products moment correlation coefficient (r) and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages (UPGMA). With some exceptions, the two sources of template DNA gave the same clusters and subclusters of strains at the similarity level of 50%. About 50% of the strains could be individually separated from all the other tested strains. The buffer brand, the amount of primer and crude cell extract used in the PCR-step were crucial for the final pattern.
