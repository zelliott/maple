In the biosynthetic gene cluster of the aminocoumarin antibiotic clorobiocin, the small ORF cloY encodes a 71 aa protein which shows significant sequence similarity to mbtH from the mycobactin biosynthetic gene cluster of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. mbtH-like genes are frequently found in the biosynthetic gene clusters of peptide antibiotics and siderophores, but their function has remained enigmatic. In a recent publication it has been suggested that these genes may have no function for secondary metabolite biosynthesis. An in-frame deletion of cloY in the clorobiocin cluster has now been carried out. When the modified cluster was expressed in the heterologous host Streptomyces coelicolor M512, clorobiocin was still formed. However, when the two further mbtH-like genes from elsewhere in the host genome were inactivated as well, clorobiocin formation was reduced dramatically. Complementation with cloY or with any of three other mbtH-like genes restored clorobiocin formation. This is the first report proving the requirement of an mbtH-like gene for secondary metabolite formation, and the first proof that different mbtH-like genes can functionally replace each other. Feeding of an mbtH-defective triple mutant strain with an intact 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxy-coumarin moiety restored antibiotic production, showing that cloY is specifically required for the formation of this moiety of the clorobiocin molecule.
