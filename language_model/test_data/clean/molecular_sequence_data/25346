Electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel of the reference influenza A/Victoria/35/72 (H3N2) virus and its persisting variants (PV) showed that the PV isolated on the 158th day from the moment of persistence modelling (PV158) had mutation in the gene of hemagglutinin (HA). This mutation is manifested by incomplete HA synthesis at 40 degrees C and increase of mobility of the light HA subunit (HA2). Analysis of nucleotide sequence of the greater part of HA gene of PV158 virus revealed 5 nucleotide substitutions four of which were significant. Three substitutions were found in Hal: 219 (Ser----Phe), 220 (Arg----Gly), 226 (Leu----Gln) and one in HA2: 156 (Thr----Asn). The importance of these mutations in the determination of the PV phenotype is discussed.
