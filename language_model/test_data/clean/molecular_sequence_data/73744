The ponA gene encoding penicillin-binding protein 1 (PBP 1) from Neisseria gonorrhoeae was cloned by a reverse genetic approach. PBP 1 was purified from solubilized membranes of penicillin-susceptible strain FA19 by covalent ampicillin affinity chromatography and used to obtain an NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. A degenerate oligonucleotide based on this protein sequence and a highly degenerate oligonucleotide based on a conserved amino acid motif found in all class A high-molecular-mass PBPs were used to isolate the PBP 1 gene (ponA). The ponA gene encodes a protein containing all of the conserved sequence motifs found in class A PBPs, and expression of the gene in Escherichia coli resulted in the appearance of a new PBP that comigrated with PBP 1 purified from N. gonorrhoeae. A comparison of the gonococcal ponA gene to its homolog isolated from Neisseria meningitidis revealed a high degree of identity between the two gene products, with the greatest variability found at the carboxy terminus of the two deduced PBP 1 protein sequences.
