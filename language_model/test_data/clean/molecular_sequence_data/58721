We have isolated two novel cDNAs encoding the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) type II receptor (TGF-beta IIR), termed TGF-beta IIR alpha and TGF-beta IIR beta 1 from a human fetal liver library. They have unique nucleotide (nt) sequences, compared with the reported TGF-beta IIR sequence, at the 5' end. Southern blot analysis using probes from each clone detected the specific genomic DNA fragments. RT-PCR analysis revealed a distinct pattern of expression for each isoform. These results indicated that TGF-beta IIR has heterogeneity in the structure, and the expression of TGF-beta IIR isoforms is differentially regulated. The heterogeneity of TGF-beta IIR molecules could be derived from alternative splicing and might elicit specific TGF-beta receptor functions.
