The location of 130kd mosquitocidal protein gene of Bti 4Q5 strain on its 75Md plasmid was confirmed by southern hybridization using a 18-base oligonucleotide probe. The crystal protein containing the component of 130kd toxic protein was purified. The crystal protein exhibiting the mosquitocidal activity against larvae of Aedes aegypti was shown by bioassay. The purified 75Md plasmid DNA of Bti 4Q5 strain was completely digested with HindIII restriction enzyme, ligated with the vector pUC18 and transformed into the recipient cells of E. coli TG1. From Apr transformants, four clones with HindIII restriction fragment inserts highly homologous to the 18-base oligonucleotide probe were obtained by in situ hybridization and southern hybridization. The 5.2kb HindIII restriction fragment insert was obtained in clone pFH2 and clone pFH4, and 2.3kb HindIII restriction fragment insert in clone pFH1 and pFH3. For pFH2 and pFH4, the 5.2kb fragment was inserted in pUC18 in opposite orientation. It contained 130kd mosquitocidal protein gene (type I) identified by restriction enzyme map analysis. The 2.3kb HindIII fragment insert in other two clones (pFH1 and pFH3) harbored a part of the type II mosquitocidal protein gene which can be used as a probe for cloning of the type II mosquitocidal protein gene.
