The fluorescent labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotides which contain deoxyethenoadenosione (d epsilon A) at their 5' end were prepared by treating CPG bound oligonucleotides with 5'-DMTr-deoxyethenoadenosine-3'-H-phosphonate. The hybrid formation of d epsilon A-oligonucleotide with its complementary DNA was studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. The fluorescence of d epsilon A in a single strand was largely quenched by stacking interaction with the base at 3' position. When d epsilon A-oligonucleotides hybridized with their complementary strands, relative fluorescence quantum yields (Qrel) against d epsilon A changed in specific manners. These results suggest that d epsilon A-oligonucleotides are applicable to study the local structure of DNA in solution.
