DNA from ticks recovered from 1137 dogs and 133 cats from all over Japan were examined for Rickettsia infection by citrate synthase gene (gltA)-based PCR and partial nucleotide sequencing. A total of 91 dog tick samples and 18 cat tick samples showed a single band of the appropriate size in the nested PCR. Sequence analysis was successfully performed on 102 samples. DNA of Rickettsia japonica or closely related Rickettsia spp. strains were detected from 38 ticks in 16 prefectures mainly in western Japan. The other 33, detected from 13 prefectures including Hokkaido and Okinawa, were found to be Rickettsia helvetica or closely related strains. A total of 29 DNA that showed highest homology with Rickettsia akari or closely related strains were detected in 19 prefectures, widespread throughout Japan. Rickettsia canada-like DNA was detected from Haemaphysalis sp. removed from a dog in Fukuoka, and ;Candidatus Rickettsia tarasevichiae'-like DNA was from Ixodes sp. removed from a dog in Hokkaido.
