A novel family of cyclosporin A (CsA) binding proteins was identified by using the biologically active, radioiodinated photoaffinity probe [D-Lys-N epsilon-(4-azido-3-[125I]iodophenyl)propionyl)]8-CsA. In addition to cyclophilin, proteins with molecular masses of 43 kDa and approximately 50-55 kDa were labeled in Jurkat extracts and bovine calf thymus. Sequence analysis of the 43-kDa protein purified from calf thymus and subsequent Western analysis of CsA affinity-purified material from Jurkat extracts identified the 43-kDa component as actin. [D-Lys-N epsilon-(5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonyl)]8-CsA, a fluorescent analogue of CsA, was prepared and used to measure the binding constants of cyclosporin derivatives to actin by means of a new fluorescence displacement assay. [D-Lys-N epsilon-(5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonyl)]8-CsA and [N delta-t-butoxycarbonyl diaminobutyryl)]8-CsA bind to bovine actin at physiologically relevant concentrations, with dissociation constants of 60 +/- 33 and 570 +/- 380 nM, respectively. Because the ATPase fragment of heat shock cognate 70 (HSC 70) is structurally related to actin, the yeast homologue SSA1 was tested and found to be radiolabeled by the cyclosporin A photoaffinity reagent. The binding constant for [D-Lys-N epsilon-(5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonyl)]8-CsA to SSA1 was determined and is 53 +/- 48 nM. These results indicate that actin and the 70-kDa heat shock protein family contain a structurally related domain for binding of cyclosporin A-related peptides.
