CTL combat intracellular pathogens by killing infected cells. The molecular targets of their attack are foreign peptides bound to self MHC encoded class I molecules. Immunization of mice with peptides containing CTL determinants was shown to elicit CD4-dependent CTL. Here, we have achieved in vivo CTL priming with naturally processed 8-10 amino acid long class I-restricted peptides emulsified in an adjuvant. A potent, reproducible and physiologically relevant response was obtained using peptides from an intracellular bacterium and five viruses (including HIV) in two murine MHC haplotypes. This method is suitable for multiple vaccination, since a 'cocktail' of peptides derived from three pathogens elicited effector CTL against each pathogen. Most importantly, peptide-induced CD8+CD4- CTL were CD4(+)-independent. These results have implications for CTL induction in situations where CD4 T cells are depleted or compromised, as is the case in HIV infection.
