We describe new primers for the detection of the STR polymorphism at the CSF1PO locus. These primers have been designed to produce shorter amplicons (150-182 bp) than the primers in standard use (295-327 bp). The reliability of the new primers for CSF1PO typing has been demonstrated by testing on known samples and by sequence analysis. These primers are superior to the original primers with regard to electrophoretic resolution and utility for typing of severely degraded DNA.
