Each Ig variable region gene segment is transcribed from its own unique promoter. While all of these promoters share common consensus elements that contribute to the B cell-specific expression of these genes, the DNA sequence of each promoter is distinct. In this study, we have directly compared the transcription efficiencies of two murine heavy chain (VH) promoters in a murine B cell in vitro transcription system. We found that the promoters differed in both transcription efficiency and the ability to bind specific protein complexes. While some of the transcription differences may be attributed to differences in basal promoter elements, the spacing between the octamer and the heptamer consensus elements was found to be important. Others have reported a direct correlation between transcription efficiency and the probability that individual variable region gene segments will rearrange. Our studies may be of direct importance to those interested in identifying B cell-specific transcription factors and may ultimately help to explain differences in the expression of some VH gene segments.
