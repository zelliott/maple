A novel actinomycete strain, designated YIM 30243T, was isolated from a soil sample in Yunnan Province, China. Based on the results of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, strain YIM 30243T should be assigned to a new species of the genus Nocardia, for which the name Nocardia alba sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 30243T (= CCTCC AA001030T = DSM 44684T).
