Acute lymphoblastic leukemia was diagnosed in a 7-year-old girl. Two months after insertion of a central venous catheter, she developed fever and complained of headache and abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed no focus of infection. A gram-negative nonfermenting bacillus was recurrently cultured from blood. Extensive biochemical testing and 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing led to the identification of Ralstonia gilardii.
