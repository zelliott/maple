The amino acid sequence of the 20-kDa regulatory light chain (LC20) of myosin from porcine aorta media smooth muscle was determined. The LC20 consisted of 171 amino acid residues and its N-terminal Ser residue was blocked by an acetyl group. The amino acid sequence was identical with that of chicken gizzard myosin LC20 except that the 60th residue, Met in chicken gizzard LC20, was substituted for Leu in porcine aorta LC20.
