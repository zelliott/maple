Bovine and ovine microsatellite sequences were extracted from the EMBL and GENBANK databases. When analysed for number of alleles and degree of heterozygosity in the CSIRO cattle reference families, allele numbers range from 1 to 14 with heterozygosities, in the polymorphic systems ranging from 15.8% to 100%. Six (46%) of the 13 bovine systems tested gave specific and polymorphic products in sheep. Similarly 2 of the 4 ovine systems gave specific and polymorphic products in cattle. These data define 11 bovine and 8 ovine microsatellite systems which are associated with known genes and are thus useful for comparative mapping studies.
