The expression of the human beta interferon (IFN-beta) gene was activated by the adenovirus E1B-19K protein. The sequence within the IFN-beta promoter which is related to the activation was analyzed by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay. The repeated hexamer units, present within the region between -109 and -65 relative to the cap site, were required for the activation of the IFN-beta gene by the E1B-19K protein. The (AAGTGA)8 region, as a typical hexamer of the consensus sequences, was tested for function in the activation by the E1B-19K protein. When the hexamer (AAGTGA)4-8 was inserted upstream of several reporter genes (such as p55cat, pdlE1A-CAT, and pE1B-CAT) which were inefficiently stimulated, the CAT activities of these fusion genes were efficiently stimulated by the E1B-19K protein. These results show that the tandemly repeated hexamer sequences within the IFN-beta promoter can function as an inducible regulatory element in the activation by the adenovirus E1B 19K protein.
