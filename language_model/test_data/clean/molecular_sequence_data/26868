We have developed PCR and Multiplex PCR assays for the detection of medically important Candida spp. using different species and genus-specific PCR primers selected within the MP65 gene, a recently cloned gene encoding a mannoprotein adhesin. The genus-specific PCR primers were able to amplify Candida species DNA (100% positivity) whereas DNA from all other isolates tested, belonging to other fungal genera, was not amplified. The species-specific PCR primers allowed differentiation of each of five Candida species by the amplicon length produced. No amplicons were detected using species- or genus-specific primers in several bacterial or human DNA templates. The methods described in this study are reproducible, simple and specific. The total time required for each PCR method was less than 4 h from the extraction to the visualized amplicons after PCR. In conclusion, we developed PCR methods to differentiate the five most medically important Candida species using primers directed to the MP65 gene.
