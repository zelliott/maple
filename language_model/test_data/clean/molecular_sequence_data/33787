In Japan and Korea, outbreaks of scuticociliatosis have frequently occurred in Japanese flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus. Morphological observations and small subunit rRNA gene sequences have shown that the causative agent of scuticociliatosis in the flounder is Miamiensis avidus (syn. Philasterides dicentrarchi). In this study, we elucidated the antigenic differences between six Japanese M. avidus isolates as an initial step toward developing an effective vaccine against the disease. Four Japanese flounder isolates (IyoI, Nakajima, JF05To and Mie0301 isolates), one spotted knifejaw, Oplegnathus punctatus, isolate (SK05Kyo), and one ridged-eye flounder, Pleuronichthys cornutus, isolate (RF05To) were subjected to serological analysis. Antisera against IyoI, SK05Kyo, Nakajima and Mie0301 isolates were raised in rabbits and used for immobilization assays and Western blotting. Immobilization assays showed that the six isolates could be divided into three groups, tentatively designated serotype I for IyoI, JF05To, RF05To, SK05Kyo, serotype II for Nakajima and serotype III for Mie0301. Western blotting results supported these three serotypes, with marked similarities in the banding profiles of IyoI, JF05To, RF05To and SK05Kyo isolates, which were distinct from the Nakajima and Mie0301 isolates. Three isolates, IyoI, Nakajima and Mie0301 that were selected as representatives of each serotype, were highly pathogenic to Japanese flounder by experimental infection. Based on these findings, we propose that there are at least three M. avidus serotypes in Japan.
