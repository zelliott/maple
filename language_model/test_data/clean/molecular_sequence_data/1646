Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) harbors a multidrug resistance (MDR) gene cluster which is a complex class 1 integron. Variant SGI1 MDR gene clusters conferring different MDR profiles have also been identified in several Salmonella enterica serovars and classified as SGI1-A to -F. A retrospective study was undertaken to characterize MDR regions from serovar Agona strains harboring SGI1 isolated from poultry in Belgium between 1992 and 2002. A total of 171 serovar Agona strains, displaying resistance to at least one antibiotic, were studied for the presence of SGI1. SGI1 was detected in 94 serovar Agona strains. The most prevalent variant was SGI1-A (85%), which harbors within the SGI1 complex class 1 integron a common region (CR1) containing orf513, a putative transposase gene, adjacent to the dfrA10 trimethoprim resistance gene. A new variant SGI1 named SGI1-G was identified in two strains. It consisted of the pse-1 gene cassette, as in SGI1-B, but with additional insertion of the orf513/dfrA10 region structure. Seven strains displaying the typical SGI1 MDR profile (Ap Cm Ff Sm Sp Su Tc) showed genetic variation at the 3' end of SGI1. These strains harbored the insertion of the CR1 containing orf513 as in SGI1-A, -D, and -G. However, downstream the right end of CR1, they presented different 7.4- to 8.5-kb deletions of the SGI1 3' end that extended to the chromosomal genes yieE and yieF. These results suggest a possible role of CR1 in deletion formation, as has been reported for some insertion sequences. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis showed that all the serovar Agona SGI1-carrying strains belonged to a single clone. Thus, SGI1 is largely encountered in serovar Agona strains isolated from poultry in Belgium, the most prevalent variant being SGI1-A. SGI1 MDR region undergoes recombinational events resulting in a diversity of MDR gene clusters.
