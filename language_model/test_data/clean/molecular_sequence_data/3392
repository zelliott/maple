Plasmid DNA of six Escherichia fergusonii colicinogenic strains (three producers of colicin E1, two of Ib and one of Ia) was isolated and the colicin-encoding regions of the corresponding Col plasmids were sequenced. Two new variants of colicin E1, one of colicin Ib, and one of colicin Ia were identified as well as new variants of the colicin E1 and colicin Ib immunity proteins and the colicin E1 lysis polypeptide. The recombinant Escherichia coli producer harboring pColE1 from E. fergusonii strain EF36 (pColE1-EF36) was found to be only partially immune to E1 colicins produced by two other E. fergusonii strains suggesting that pColE1-EF36 may represent an ancestor ColE1 plasmid.
