T-cell-mediated immune responses to defined antigens of Trypanosoma congolense were measured in cattle undergoing primary infection. The antigens used were the variable surface glycoprotein and two invariant antigens, a 33-kDa cysteine protease (congopain) and a recombinant form of a 69-kDa heat-shock protein. Proliferative responses were highest during the second week postinfection and were detected in cells obtained from the lymph node draining the site of infection but not in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma was measured in supernatants from antigen-stimulated lymph node cell cultures. Expression of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma mRNA was detected in antigen-stimulated lymph node cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain amplification.
