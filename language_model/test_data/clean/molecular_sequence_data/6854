DNA from dried or fresh roots of three medicinal Panax species and their adulterants were amplified by AP-PCR or RAPD. Fingerprints for P. ginseng or P. quinquefolius were found to be consistent irrespective of plant source or age. On the other hand, very different fingerprints were obtained from adulterants. Hence the PCR approach may be used as a means to authenticate the concerned Panax species. Analysis of the degree of similarity of the fingerprints confirmed that P. ginseng is more closely related to P. quinquefolius than to P. notoginseng.
