1. Guinea-pig ventricle was used in the RNase protection assays to determine which alpha-isoforms of the Na+-K+ pumps are present, and ventricular myocytes were used in whole cell patch clamp studies to investigate the actions of alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists on Na+-K+ pump current. 2. RNase protection assays showed that two isoforms of the alpha-subunit of the Na+-K+-ATPase are present in guinea-pig ventricle. The mRNA for the alpha1-isoform comprises 82 % of the total pump message, the rest being the alpha2-isoform. 3. We have previously shown that beta-adrenergic agonists affect Na+-K+ pump current (Ip) through a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent pathway. We now show that these beta-effects are targeted to the alpha1-isoform of the Na+-K+ pumps. 4. We have also previously shown that alpha-adrenergic agonists increase Ip through a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathway. We now show that these alpha-isoform effects are targeted to the alpha2-isoform of the Na+-K+ pumps. 5. These results suggest the effects of adrenergic activation on Na+-K+ pump activity in the heart can be regionally specific, depending on which alpha-isoform of the Na+-K+ pump is expressed.
