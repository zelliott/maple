To elucidate the function of pI(Cln), its localization in subcellular organellae was investigated. A specific polyclonal anti-pI(Cln) antibody detected the soluble 38-kDa pI(Cln) exclusively in the cytosols of rat heart, lung, liver, spleen, skeletal muscle, testis, and brain, but not rat kidney. pI(Cln)-associated proteins in skeletal muscle were also analyzed. Native-gradient PAGE showed a single 340-kDa protein band reactive to anti-pI(Cln) antibody. This band also stained with anti-actin antibody. Two-dimensional PAGE and immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that all of the pI(Cln) was present in association with actin of a constant length: the molecular ratio of pI(Cln) to actin was roughly 1:7. In addition, all actin in the cytosol fractions was found in association with pI(Cln). These results suggest the possibility that skeletal muscle pI(Cln) controls the length of cytosolic F-actin.
