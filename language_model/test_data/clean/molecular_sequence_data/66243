An acetyl-histone peptide library was used to determine the thermodynamic parameters that define acetylation-dependent bromodomain-histone interactions. Bromodomains interact with histones by binding acetylated lysines. The bromodomain used in this study, BrD3, is derived from the polybromo-1 protein, which is a subunit of the PBAF chromatin remodeling complex. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy was used to examine the variations in specificity and affinity that drive molecular recognition. Temperature and salt concentration dependence studies demonstrate that the hydrophobic effect is the primary driving force, consistent with lysine acetylation being required for binding. An electrostatic effect was observed in only two complexes where the acetyl-lysine was adjacent to an arginine. The large change in heat capacity determined for the specific complex suggests that the dehydrated BrD3-histone interface forms a tightly bound, high-affinity complex with the target site. These explorations into the thermodynamic driving forces that confer acetylation site-dependent BrD3-histone interactions improve our understanding of how individual bromodomains work in isolation. Furthermore, this work will permit the development of hypotheses regarding how the native Pb1, and the broader class of bromodomain proteins, directs multisubunit chromatin remodeling complexes to specific acetyl-nucleosome sites in vivo.
