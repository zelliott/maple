A recombinant hybrid protein comprising the bacteriophage fr coat protein, a short linker, and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) as well as native and recombinant phage coat proteins, ANF, and variants of the hybrid recombinant protein were used in the development of various immunological reactions including immunization, preparation of affinity columns, purification of antibodies, synthesis of conjugates, and immunoenzyme assay of ANF and the recombinant protein. The hybrid protein is effective in competitive assay of ANF and other constructs that include the phage protein.
