We have previously reported the purification and characterization of the transcription factor EBP-80 (Falzon, M., and Kuff, E. L. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 21915-21922). EBP-80 mediates the DNA methylation effect on transcription from an endogenous proviral long terminal repeat. Here we show that EBP-80 is very similar if not identical to the Ku autoantigen, a heterodimeric nuclear protein first detected by antibodies from autoimmune patients (Mimori, T., Akizuki, M., Yamagata, H., Inada, S., Yoshida, S., and Homma, M. (1981) J. Clin. Invest. 68, 611-620). A number of laboratories have shown that the Ku protein complex binds to free double-stranded DNA ends. In this study, we have examined the binding properties of EBP-80. EBP-80 binds single-stranded DNA with low affinity. Binding to random sequence double-stranded DNA depends on the length of the duplex and is optimal with oligomers of 30 and 32 base pairs; the protein complexes formed with these oligomers have Kd values of 15-20 pM. It binds with comparable high affinities to blunt-ended duplex DNA, to duplex DNA ending in hairpin loops, and to constructs in which an internal segment of duplex DNA is flanked by single-strand extensions. EBP-80 also interacts effectively with circular duplex molecules containing a 30-nucleotide single-stranded region (gap) or a double-stranded segment of nonhomology (bubble), but only weakly with the corresponding closed circular construct made up entirely of duplex DNA. EBP-80 prefers A/T to G/C ends. The binding properties of EBP-80 are consistent with the hypothesis that is recognizes single- to double-strand transitions in DNA. A model is presented for the interaction of EBP-80 with its target sequence in the proviral long terminal repeat.
