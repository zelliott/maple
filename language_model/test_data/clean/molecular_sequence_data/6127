The nucleotide sequences of the region of inverted terminal repetition from representative strains of all five porcine adenovirus (PAV) serotypes were determined and analyzed. The first 17 nucleotides of this region were identical in PAV-1 to 3 and PAV-5, and 10 bp of identical sequence was found in all the PAVs. The closest relationships were among PAV-1 to 3, which shared more common sequences than the other serotypes. PAV-4 had the longest inverted terminal repeat reported for any adenovirus. The proximal 54-bp AT-rich region was partially conserved and the distal GC-rich region was less well conserved among all five serotypes.
