The hybrid origin of a Verticillium dahliae isolate belonging to the vegetative compatibility group (VCG) 3 is reported in this work. Moreover, new data supporting the hybrid origin of two V. dahliae var. longisporum (VDLSP) isolates are provided as well as information about putative parentals. Thus, isolates of VDLSP and V. dahliae VCG3 were found harboring multiple sequences of actin (Act), β-tubulin (β-tub), calmodulin (Cal) and histone 3 (H3) genes. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences, the internal transcribed sequences (ITS-1 and ITS-2) of the rRNA genes and of a V. dahliae-specific sequence provided molecular evidences for the interspecific hybrid origin of those isolates. Sequence analysis suggests that some of VDLSP isolates may have resulted from hybridization events between a V. dahliae isolate of VCG1 and/or VCG4A and, probably, a closely related taxon to Verticillium alboatrum but not this one. Similarly, phylogenetic analysis and PCR markers indicated that a V. dahliae VCG3 isolate might have arisen from a hybridization event between a V. dahliae VCG1B isolate and as yet unidentified parent. This second parental probably does not belong to the Verticillium genus according to the gene sequences dissimilarities found between the VCG3 isolate and Verticillium spp. These results suggest an important role of parasexuality in diversity and evolution in the genus Verticillium and show that interspecific hybrids within this genus may not be rare in nature.
