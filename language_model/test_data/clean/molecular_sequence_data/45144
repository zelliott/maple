We are interested in learning more about the proteome of Uromyces appendiculatus, the fungus that causes common bean rust. Knowledge of the proteins that differentiate life-cycle stages and distinguish infectious bodies such as uredospores, germlings, appressoria, and haustoria may be used to define host-pathogen interactions or serve as targets for chemical inhibition of the fungus. We have used 2-D nanoflowLC-MS/MS to identify more than 400 proteins from asexual uredospores. A majority of the proteins appear to have roles in protein folding or protein catabolism. We present a model by which an abundance of heat shock proteins and translation elongation factors may enhance a spore's ability to survive environmental stresses and rapidly initiate protein production upon germination.
