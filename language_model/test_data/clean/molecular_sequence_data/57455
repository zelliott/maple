We have found a linear, 16 kb, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in symptomless Japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.) that is not found in Indica rice (Oryza sativa L.). The dsRNA was detected in every tissue and at every developmental stage, and its copy number was approximately constant (about 20 copies/cell). Double-stranded RNA was also detected in two strains of Oryza rufipogon (an ancestor of O. sativa). Hybridization experiments indicated that the dsRNA of O. rufipogon was homologous but not identical to that of O. sativa. The sequence of about 13.2 kb of the dsRNA was determined and two open reading frames (ORFs) were found. The larger ORF (ORF B) was more than 12,351 nucleotides long and encoded more than 4,117 amino acid residues.
