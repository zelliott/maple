We describe a case of Negativicoccus succinicivorans bacteremia in an adult man with hemochromatosis and acute pancreatitis. Conventional phenotypic tests and commercial identification systems failed to definitively identify the tiny anaerobic Gram-negative coccus isolated from two sets of blood cultures. The bacterium was identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and analysis using the SmartGene Integrated Database Network System software. This is the first published report of the recovery of this organism from a patient with invasive infection.
