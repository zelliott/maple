Cyclin D2 is normally expressed in G1 and promotes progression through G1 of the cell cycle. From a murine genomic library constructed with spleen DNA, two overlapping genomic clones of cyclin D2 were isolated. These clones contain most of the exon of cyclin D2 except exon 5. Characterization of these clones revealed that murine cyclin D2 mRNA spans over 18 kb and 5 exons ranging from 149 to approximately 462 bp in length, and suggested that exon 5 may be at least >5 kb downstream from exon 4. Primer extension analysis of cyclin D2 mRNA isolated from murine activated T cells detected 5 putative sites of transcription initiation. These are located at - 499, - 417, - 391, - 373, and - 349 relative to the translation start site, which is given as + 1. No consensus sequence for TATA box existed at an appropriate position within the promotor region. Instead, several putative transcriptional factor binding sites for C/EBP, PEA3, AP2, NF-Y, Sp1, c-Myc, GATA-1, AP1, v-Myb, and CREB were detected. The 5'-flanking region of the cyclin D2 gene up to nucleotide - 945 shared about 61% sequence homology between mouse and human. Functional analysis of promoter activity of the 5'-flanking region of cyclin D2 suggested that the region - 1,100 to - 805 including C/EBP, PEA3, AP2, NF-Y, c-Myc, and Sp1 may have a major positive regulatory activity for expression of cyclin D2.
