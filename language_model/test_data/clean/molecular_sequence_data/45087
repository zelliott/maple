Deregulated expression of E2F1 not only promotes S-phase entry but also induces apoptosis. Although it has been well documented that E2F1 is able to induce p53-dependent apoptosis via raising ARF activity, the mechanism by which E2F induces p53-independent apoptosis remains unclear. Here we report that E2F1 can directly bind to and activate the promoter of Smac/DIABLO, a mitochondrial proapoptotic gene, through the E2F1-binding sites BS2 (-542 approximately -535 bp) and BS3 (-200 approximately -193 bp). BS2 and BS3 appear to be utilized in combination rather than singly by E2F1 in activation of Smac/DIABLO. Activation of BS2 and BS3 are E2F1-specific, since neither E2F2 nor E2F3 is able to activate BS2 or BS3. Using the H1299 ER-E2F1 cell line where E2F1 activity can be conditionally induced, E2F1 has been shown to upregulate the Smac/DIABLO expression at both mRNA and protein levels upon 4-hydroxytamoxifen treatment, resulting in an enhanced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Reversely, reducing the Smac/DIABLO expression by RNA interference significantly diminishes apoptosis induced by E2F1. These results may suggest a novel mechanism by which E2F1 promotes p53-independent apoptosis through directly regulating its downstream mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factors, such as Smac/DIABLO.
