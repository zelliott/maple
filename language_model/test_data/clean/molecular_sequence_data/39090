Cultured cells of tobacco BY2 secrete more than 100 proteins into culture medium. Six major proteins were purified, and partial protein sequences were determined. Five of them were found to be similar to an ascorbic acid oxidase, three peroxidase isozymes and a beta-1,3-exoglucanase, respectively. A cDNA clone encoding the remaining polypeptide, whose amino acid sequence showed no similarity with earlier reported proteins, was isolated. It encoded a putative 27 kDa protein of 242 amino acids with resemblance to WCI-5, a wheat protein induced by benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH) which activates genes involved in systemic acquired resistance. Transcripts of this clone accumulated upon tobacco mosaic virus infection, mechanical wounding and drought treatment, an induction profile that satisfies the definition of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins by van Loon et al. (Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 12 (1994) 245). No similar PR proteins have so far been reported, and therefore our newly designated NtPRp27 points to the existence of a novel PR protein family in tobacco plants.
