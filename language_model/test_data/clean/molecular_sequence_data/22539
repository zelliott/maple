Type II fatty acid synthesis (FAS II) is an essential process for bacteria survival, and malonyl-CoA:acyl carrier protein transacylase (MCAT) is a key enzyme in FAS II pathway, which is responsible for transferring the malonyl group from malonyl-CoA to the holo-ACP by forming malonyl-ACP. In this work, we described the cloning, characterization and enzymatic inhibition of a new MCAT from Helicobacter pylori strain SS1 (HpMCAT), and the gene sequence of HpfabD was deposited in the GenBank database (Accession No. AY738332 ). Enzymatic characterization of HpMCAT showed that the K(m) value for malonyl-CoA was 21.01+/-2.3 microM, and the thermal- and guanidinium hydrochloride-induced unfolding processes for HpMCAT were quantitatively investigated by circular dichroism spectral analyses. Moreover, a natural product, corytuberine, was discovered to demonstrate inhibitory activity against HpMCAT with IC(50) value at 33.1+/-3.29 microM. Further enzymatic assay results indicated that corytuberine inhibits HpMCAT in an uncompetitive manner. To our knowledge, this is the firstly reported MCAT inhibitor to date. This current work is hoped to supply useful information for better understanding the MCAT features of H. pylori strain, and corytuberine might be used as a potential lead compound in the discovery of the antibacterial agents using HpMCAT as target.
