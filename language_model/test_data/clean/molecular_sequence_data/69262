Genomic DNA from a patient with acute intermittent porphyria were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-direct sequencing method. The patient was heterozygote for a point mutation G to C at the last position of exon 12 of the porphobilinogen deaminase (PBG-D) gene. Analysis of the cDNA fragments amplified by PCR revealed that the patient has the abnormal PBG-D mRNA, which does not have exon 12 and exists in an approximately equal amount to the normal mRNA.
