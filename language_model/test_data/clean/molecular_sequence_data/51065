Complete sequential 1H and 15N resonance assignments for the reduced Cu(I) form of the blue copper protein azurin (M(r) 14,000, 128 residues) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been obtained at pH 5.5 and 40 degrees C by using homo- and heteronuclear two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic experiments. Combined analysis of a 3D homonuclear 1H Hartmann-Hahn nuclear Overhauser (3D 1H HOHAHA-NOESY) spectrum and a 3D heteronuclear 1H nuclear Overhauser 1H[15N] single-quantum coherence (3D 1H[15N] NOESY-HSQC) spectrum proved especially useful. The latter spectrum was recorded without irradiation of the water signal and provided for differential main chain amide (NH) exchange rates. NMR data were used to determine the secondary structure of azurin in solution. Comparison with the secondary structure of azurin obtained from X-ray analysis shows a virtually complete resemblance; the two beta-sheets and a 3(10)-alpha-3(10) helix are preserved at 40 degrees C, and most loops contain well-defined turns. Special findings are the unexpectedly slow exchange of the Asn-47 and Phe-114 NH's and the observation of His-46 and His-117 N epsilon 2H resonances. The implications of these observations for the assignment of azurin resonance Raman spectra, the rigidity of the blue copper site, and the electron transfer mechanism of azurin are discussed.
