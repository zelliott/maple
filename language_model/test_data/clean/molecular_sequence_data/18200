Spinach chloroplast RNA polymerase has been shown to efficiently terminate transcription at the threonine attenuator (thra) from Escherichia coli. In this study, efficient transcription termination by the chloroplast RNA polymerase was observed at a second prokaryotic terminator, the histidine attenuator (hisa) from Salmonella typhimurium. Termination occurred regardless of the orientation of either attenuator. In higher-plant chloroplast DNA, the genes for the beta subunit of the ATPase (atpB) and the large subunit of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcL) are adjacent and divergently transcribed. Bidirectional transcription vectors, containing the histidine and threonine terminators, were constructed to analyze the divergently oriented atpB and rbcL promotors. One plasmid construction, pRTT7, contained two tandem copies of the threonine attenuator (pRTT7). Two additional constructs, pRHT1 and pRHT2, each contained oppositely oriented copies of thra and hisa. A DNA fragment containing the rbcL and atpB promoters was inserted between the two terminators present in the pRTT7, pRHT1, and pRHT2 plasmids. Transcription of these recombinant DNAs by spinach chloroplast RNA polymerase resulted in discretely sized rbcL and atpB transcripts. In addition, these bidirectional transcription vectors were used to identify previously uncharacterized chloroplast promoters.
