The ER (endoplasmic reticulum) in higher plants forms a pleomorphic web of membrane tubules and small cisternae that pervade the cytoplasm, but in particular form a polygonal network at the cortex of the cell which may be anchored to the plasma membrane. The network is associated with the actin cytoskeleton and demonstrates extensive mobility, which is most likely to be dependent on myosin motors. The ER is characterized by a number of domains which may be associated with specific functions such as protein storage, or with direct interaction with other organelles such as the Golgi apparatus, peroxisomes and plastids. In the present review we discuss the nature of the network, the role of shape-forming molecules such as the recently described reticulon family of proteins and the function of some of the major domains within the ER network.
