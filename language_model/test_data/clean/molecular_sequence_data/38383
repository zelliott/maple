One of the monoclonal antibodies raised against mitotic HeLa cells (termed as mH3) recognized a 27-kDa protein and stained microtubules in the mitotic spindles of HeLa cells. Immunoscreening of a HeLa cDNA library revealed that mH3 antigen is a small heat shock protein, HSP27. Immunoprecipitation analysis using mH3 suggested that both alpha- and beta-tubulin are associated with HSP27. Further, sucrose-cushioned ultra centrifugation revealed that HSP27 is co-sedimented with taxol-stabilized microtubules. These results indicate that HSP27 associates with tubulin/microtubules in HeLa cells.
