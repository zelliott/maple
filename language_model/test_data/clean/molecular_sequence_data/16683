Beauveria bassiana is an entomopathogenic fungus with a growing potential for pest control in different agro-ecosystems worldwide. Such potential brings the necessity of developing a strain specific typing system. In a previous study, we reported the identification of molecular variants in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphism in 15 North American isolates. Results indicated a highly conserved mitochondrial genome showing only two mitochondrial genotypes (mitotypes). In this study we used whole genomic DNA from 18 isolates of B. bassiana, two unidentified Beauveria spp., and one each of B. amorpha, B. cylindrospora and B. nivea from more diverse origins. By doing single- and double-restriction enzyme digestion of total genomic DNA with EcoRI, and HindIII and then probing with BbmtE2, the predominance of mitotypes A and B was observed again, along with three newly described mitotypes (C to E). Additionally, by using whole B. bassiana mtDNA digested with HpaII as probe, we further demonstrate up to nine different mitotypes within B. bassiana. With either of the two probes, distinguished between members of the genus Beauveria and from Paecilomyces farinosus and Metarhizium anisopliae. Phylogenetic analysis could not however distinguish B. amorpha and B. nivea isolates from B. bassiana, suggesting a close genetic relation between the three species of the genus. Altogether, these results show high variability in mitochondrial genome, which can be useful as a reliable tool for the biopesticide industry for both species and isolate specific identification.
