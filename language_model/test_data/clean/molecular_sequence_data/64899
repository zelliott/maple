The HERG K+ channel has very unusual kinetic behaviour that includes slow activation but rapid inactivation. These features are critical for normal cardiac repolarisation as well as in preventing lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Extensive mutagenesis of the HERG K+ channel has allowed identification of which regions of the channel are important for the unusual kinetic behaviour of the channel. Furthermore, structural studies on scorpion toxins that potently inhibit HERG are beginning to provide clues as to the structural differences between HERG and other voltage-gated K+ channels.
