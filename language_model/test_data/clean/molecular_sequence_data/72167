TFIIH is a multiprotein factor involved in transcription and DNA repair and is implicated in DNA repair/transcription deficiency disorders such as xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome and trichothiodystrophy. Eight out of the nine genes encoding the subunits forming TFIIH have already been cloned. We report here the identification, cDNA cloning and gene structure of the 52 kDa polypeptide and its homology with the yeast counterpart TFB2. This protein, along with p89/XPB, p62, p44 and p34, forms the core of TFIIH. Moreover, using in vitro reconstituted transcription and nucleotide excision repair (NER) assays and microinjection experiments, we demonstrate that p52 is directly involved in both transcription and DNA repair mechanisms in vitro and in vivo.
