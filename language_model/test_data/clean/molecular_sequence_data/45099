The genomic DNA sequence encoding the scorpion toxin Amm VIII was amplified from genomic DNA of the scorpion Androctonus mauretanicus mauretanicus from Morocco, subcloned and sequenced. An intron, with a high A+T content (73.5%), split a Gly codon at the end of the precursor signal peptide and the consensus GT/AG splice junction was identified in the Amm VIII gene. This intron of only 166 bp is the smallest intron described so far for a long-chain scorpion toxin gene. In addition, this study led to the identification of three new toxin-related genes. From the deduced amino acid sequences of the encoded precursor proteins, we found that the mature putative toxins were highly similar to the scorpion toxins Leiurus quinquestriatus quinquestriatus IV and Odonthobuthus doriae 1.
