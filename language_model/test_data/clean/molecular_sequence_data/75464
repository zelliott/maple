cDNA clones, termed pHP2, b32-3, b43, and b43-1, encoding cytochromes P-450 that are expressed in the liver of phenobarbital- (PB-) treated rabbits were isolated, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. pHP2 cDNA contains an open reading frame for a 490-residue protein and is a full-length counterpart of pP-450PBc2 [Leighton, J. K., Debrunner-Vossbrinck, B. A., & Kemper, B. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 204-210]. The b32-3 insert has a sequence for a protein whose primary structure is 91% similar to that of progesterone 21-hydroxylase P-450 1, though this cDNA lacks the sequence encoding the amino-terminal 110 residues. The overlapping clones b43 and b43-1 together encode an ethanol-inducible form of cytochrome P-450, though the amino-terminal five or more residues are missing in the composite b43/b43-1 sequence. Northern blot analysis showed that the b43/b43-1 protein is more strongly inducible by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and isosafrole than by PB, in contrast to the case of the HP2 and b32-3 proteins. A comparison of the primary structures of eight forms of cytochrome P-450, including the HP2, b32-3, and b43/b43-1 proteins, that are expressed in the liver of PB-treated rabbits showed that 149 out of 487-492 amino acid residues are conserved in these cytochromes P-450. The eight forms can be assigned to three rabbit cytochrome P-450 gene subfamilies, P450IIB, P450IIC, and P450IIE. It was also shown that the members of the rabbit P450IIC subfamily can be further classified into three subgroups on the basis of their sequence similarity.
