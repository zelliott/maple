A protein that binds specifically to Env 105-119 (HEDIISLWDQSLKPC) was found in pools of normal human plasma when this peptide was used in affinity chromatography procedures. These samples represented the negative control in experiments aimed at the purification of putative human antibodies to the Env 105-119 region from AIDS sera. In this article we describe the biochemical characterization of this protein, which turned out to be complement factor H (CFH). We propose a functional role for this protein in the complex, early steps of CD4-dependent HIV infection.
