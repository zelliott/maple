The 65-kDa mycobacterial heat shock protein (Bhsp65) has been invoked in the pathogenesis of both adjuvant arthritis (AA) in the Lewis rat (RT.1(l)) and human rheumatoid arthritis. Arthritic Lewis rats in the late phase of AA show diversification of the T cell response to Bhsp65 C-terminal determinants (BCTD), and pretreatment of naive Lewis rats with a mixture of peptides representing these neoepitopes affords protection against AA. However, the fine specificity and physiologic significance of the BCTD-directed T cell repertoire, and the role of homologous self (rat) hsp65 (Rhsp65), if any, in spreading of the T cell response to Bhsp65 have not yet been examined. We observed that T cells primed by peptides comprising BCTD can adoptively transfer protection against AA to the recipient Lewis rats. However, these T cells can be activated by preprocessed (peptide) form of BCTD, but not native Bhsp65, showing that BCTD are cryptic epitopes. The BCTD-reactive T cells can be activated by the naturally generated (dominant) C-terminal epitopes of both exogenous and endogenous Rhsp65 and vice versa. Furthermore, certain individual peptides constituting BCTD and their self homologs can also induce protection against AA. These results support a model for the diversification of T cell response to Bhsp65 during the course of AA involving up-regulation of the display of cryptic BCTD coupled with spontaneous induction of T cell response to the cross-reactive dominant C-terminal epitopes of Rhsp65. The identification of disease-regulating cryptic determinants in Ags implicated in arthritis provides a novel approach for immunotherapy of rheumatoid arthritis.
