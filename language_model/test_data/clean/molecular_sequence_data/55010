The Roseobacter clade has been recognized as one of the abundant bacterial lineages in marine environments, which makes the characterization of bacteriophages infecting members of the clade important. Here we report the complete genome sequence of bacteriophage P12053L, which infects Celeribacter sp. strain IMCC12053, a member of the Roseobacter clade.
