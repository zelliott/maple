Human surfactant protein B (SPB) is a 79-amino-acid hydrophobic protein that enhances the surface active properties of pulmonary surfactant. SPB is expressed in nonciliated bronchiolar and alveolar type II cells of the respiratory epithelium, and its expression increases markedly late in gestation. In the present study, a human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line, H441, was used in both functional and biochemical assays to identify DNA sequences controlling lung cell-specific expression of the SPB gene. DNase I hypersensitive studies demonstrated two distinct regions of lung cell-specific hypersensitivity located proximal to the SPB promoter and within the eighth intron of the gene. To functionally define these DNA sequences, a series of plasmid vectors were constructed in which segments of the human SPB gene and 5'-flanking sequence were linked to a CAT reporter gene and assayed for expression in lung and nonlung cell lines. Whereas far upstream and intronic sequences did not contain enhancer-like elements, a 259-base pair DNA segment (base pair -218 to +41) was sufficient to support lung cell-specific expression. DNase I footprinting demonstrated that this pulmonary epithelial cell-specific promoter fragment contained five nuclear protein-binding sites, two of which bound lung cell-specific nuclear protein complexes. These results suggest that the pulmonary epithelial cell-specific expression of SPB is determined, in part, by both ubiquitous and cell type-specific protein-DNA interactions within the proximal promoter region.
