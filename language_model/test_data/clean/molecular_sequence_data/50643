We have studied the regulation of proteolytic processing of the polyproteins encoded by cowpea mosaic virus M-RNA and B-RNA. For that purpose mutations were introduced in full-length cDNA clones of these RNAs. RNA transcripts were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and the effect of mutations on the processing was analysed. These studies revealed that the 32K protein is released from the 200K B-polyprotein by an intramolecular cleavage and remains associated with the 170K protein, probably by interaction with the 58K domain of the 170K protein. In this complex the conformation of the 170K protein is such that further cleavages are very slow. This complex carries out the processing of the Gln/Met site in the M-polyprotein. The 170K protein produced by a B-RNA mutant that lacks the 32K coding region was efficiently processed into 110K, 87K, 84K, 60K, 58K and 24K cleavage products. Thus, the 32K protein regulates the B-polyprotein processing by slowing it down and, on the other hand, enhances trans cleavage of M-polyproteins at a Gln/Met site.
