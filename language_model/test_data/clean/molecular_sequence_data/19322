A Gram-negative, aerobic bacterium, designated strain HO3-R19(T), which was isolated from seashore sand in Pohang city, Korea, was characterized on the basis of a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain HO3-R19(T) represents a new lineage within the Gammaproteobacteria; sequence similarities between strain HO3-R19(T) and members of other related genera were less than 93.5 %. Strain HO3-R19(T) was also distinguished from related genera based on differences in several phenotypic characteristics. Cells were straight or slightly curved rods and formed white colonies on R2A agar. The major isoprenoid quinone was ubiquinone 8 (Q-8), and predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C(16 : 0), iso-C(15 : 0) and iso-C(17 : 1)omega9c. The DNA G+C content of strain HO3-R19(T) was 65.0 mol%. Based on physiological, biochemical and chemotaxonomic traits together with results of comparative 16S rRNA sequence analysis, strain HO3-R19(T) is considered to represent a novel species in a new genus, for which the name Arenimonas donghaensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Arenimonas donghaensis is HO3-R19(T) (=KACC 11381(T)=DSM 18148(T)).
