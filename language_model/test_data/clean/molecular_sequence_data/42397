Sequence alignment and structure prediction are used to locate catalytic alpha-amylase-type (beta/alpha)8-barrel domains and the positions of their beta-strands and alpha-helices in isoamylase, pullulanase, neopullulanase, alpha-amylase-pullulanase, dextran glucosidase, branching enzyme, and glycogen branching enzymes--all enzymes involved in hydrolysis or synthesis of alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages in starch and related polysaccharides. This has allowed identification of the transferase active site of the glycogen debranching enzyme and the locations of beta-->alpha loops making up the active sites of all enzymes studied. Activity and specificity of the enzymes are discussed in terms of conserved amino acid residues and loop variations. An evolutionary distance tree of 47 amylolytic and related enzymes is built on 37 residues representing the four best conserved beta-strands of the barrel. It exhibits clusters of enzymes close in specificity, with the branching and glycogen debranching enzymes being the most distantly related.
