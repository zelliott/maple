5S rRNA and rDNA from Plasmodium falciparum have been characterized. The 5S rRNA transcripts isolated from erythrocytic stage parasites are composed of three distinct subclasses, 117-119 nucleotides in length, which are identical in sequence with the exception of one or two additional uridine residues at the 3' terminus. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA identified three 5S rRNA gene classes which are clustered within 1.5 kb of DNA. Cloning and sequence analyses of the 5S rDNA revealed identical coding regions surrounded by divergent extremely A+T rich flanking sequences (greater than 90%). Typical PolIII termination signals (6-8) T residues abut each coding region. Copy number analysis indicates that P. falciparum contains only three 5S rRNA genes, the lowest number reported for any organism.
