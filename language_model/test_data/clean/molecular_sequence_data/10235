In vitro selection experiments have produced nucleic acid ligands (aptamers) that bind tightly and specifically to a great variety of target biomolecules. The utility of aptamers is often limited by their vulnerability to nucleases present in biological materials. One way to circumvent this problem is to select an aptamer that binds the enantiomer of the target, then synthesize the enantiomer of the aptamer as a nuclease-insensitive ligand of the normal target. We have so identified a mirror-image single-stranded DNA that binds the peptide hormone vasopressin and have demonstrated its stability to nucleases and its bioactivity as a vasopressin antagonist in cell culture.
