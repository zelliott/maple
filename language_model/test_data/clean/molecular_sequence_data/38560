The O-chain polysaccharide of the lipopolysaccharide of Xanthomonas campestris pv. manihotis strains GSPB 2755 and GSPB 2364 was studied by sugar and methylation analyses and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, including 2D COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, and H-detected 1H, 13C heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence (HMQC) experiments. The polysaccharide was found to contain L-rhamnose and L-xylose in the ratio 3:1, and the following structure of the tetrasaccharide repeating unit was established: [formula: see text]
