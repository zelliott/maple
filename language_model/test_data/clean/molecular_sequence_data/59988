On the basis of our studies with HLA class II transgenic mice, we had proposed that complementation of HLA-DQ and HLA-DR alleles may determine both disease susceptibility and severity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). According to our model, certain HLA-DQ alleles, such as HLA-DQ8, predispose individuals to RA, while a self-peptide derived from the third hypervariable region (HV3 65-79) of HLA-DR alleles, such as DRB 1*0402, can protect from disease if presented by the DQ molecule. To test this hypothesis, we examined the immunomodulatory effects of the DRB1*0402 derived peptide (HV3 65-79) on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in HLA-DQ8 mice. Co-immunization of the DRB 1*0402 peptide significantly reduced the severity of arthritis (mean score = 1.5+/-0.6 vs 5.2+/-1.4 in controls), whereas multiple doses of the peptide reduced the incidence of disease (3.5% vs 35-60% in controls). Subsequent analysis revealed that the DRB1*0402 peptide mediated protection may be due to the generation of a subset of regulatory cells, which down-regulate collagen-specific pro-inflammatory responses. These results provide additional insights towards understanding the role of MHC class II molecules in RA predisposition.
