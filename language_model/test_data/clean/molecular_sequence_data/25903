Using a blister model of inflammation in the rat hind footpad, the present study was undertaken to examine possible peripheral effects of specific mu (DAGO) and delta (DSLET) opioid receptor agonists on an inflammatory response induced by substance P, the putative mediator of neurogenic inflammation. When perfused over the blister base, SP induced both plasma extravasation and vasodilatation responses. These responses were significantly inhibited in the presence of either opioid receptor agonist in a naloxone reversible manner. DSLET inhibited SP responses in a dose dependent manner and was 100 times more potent than DAGO. The role of primary afferent sensory nerve terminals in these modulatory effects was investigated in rats pretreated as neonates with capsaicin. The ability of DAGO and DSLET to inhibit the inflammatory response in these rats was significantly less than that in controls. The data raises the possibility that the inhibitory effect of the opioid receptor agonists on the inflammatory response might reflect a role for opioids in modulating tachyphylaxis to SP.
