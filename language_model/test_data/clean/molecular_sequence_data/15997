The complete amino acid sequence of thioesterase domain of chicken liver fatty acid synthase has been determined by sequencing peptides produced by trypsin, Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, and cyanogen bromide cleavage. The thioesterase domain consists of 300 amino acid residues. All of the tryptic peptides of the thioesterase domain were isolated and sequenced, except the segment covered from position 109 to position 124. Peptides resulting from digestion by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and cyanogen bromide cleavage filled the missing part and overlapped the complete sequence of the entire thioesterase domain. The NH2 terminus of the thioesterase domain was determined to be lysine by sequencing the whole domain up to 20 residues while the COOH terminus was identified as serine through carboxyl peptidase Y cleavage. The active site of the thioesterase domain of chicken fatty acid synthase was suggested to be the serine on position 101 according to its homology with other serine-type esterases and proteases which have a common structure of -Gly-X-Ser-Y-Gly- with the variable amino acids X and Y disrupting the homology.
