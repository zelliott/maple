The DNA-binding domain of Myb consists of three imperfect tandem repeats and the third one which is essential for sequence-specific binding was established to have a helix-turn-helix-related motif. DNA sequences recognized by Myb have been reported to contain TAACPy sequence. Here we have examined the details of Myb-binding sequence. Using DNAs with a single mutation on the various sites of two specific DNAs and some fragments of the DNA-binding domain of Myb, we have found that (i) in a specific DNA which contains only one AAC sequence, each AAC nucleotide is found to be essential for the specific binding of Myb, while any other mutations cause no serious binding loss, (ii) in a specific DNA which contains two AAC sequences separately, one AAC is not so important in the binding, and (iii) for the specific binding with DNA, at least both repeats 2 and 3 of Myb are required. These findings suggest that repeat 3 containing a helix-turn-helix-related structure recognizes the core AAC sequence and repeat 2 supports this recognition by interactions with phosphate groups of DNA.
