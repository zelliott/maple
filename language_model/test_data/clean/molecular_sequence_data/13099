Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a cytokine sharing structural and functional similarities with interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other helical cytokines that utilize the common signalling chain gp130. While IL-6 induces gp130 dimerization, CNTF, after the initial interaction with the specific, non-signalling receptor subunit, CNTFR, induces the formation of gp130/LIF-receptor heterodimers. Through immunoprecipitation experiments with tagged soluble receptor molecules, we recently demonstrated that IL-6 drives the formation of a hexameric receptor complex with a defined topology and composed of two IL-6, two IL-6R alpha and two gp130 molecules. Here, we apply the same strategy to study the assembly in vitro of the CNTF receptor complex. We present evidence that both the cytokine and the specific binding chain undergo dimerization in the presence of gp130. Furthermore, although gp130 and LIFR are able to bind independently to the CNTF/CNTFR sub-complex, they never form homodimers but only heterodimers. We propose that CNTF assembles a hexameric receptor complex composed of two CNTF, two CNTFR, one gp130 and one LIFR molecule, and present a model of the reciprocal interaction of these molecules based on similarities with the IL-6 hexameric complex.
