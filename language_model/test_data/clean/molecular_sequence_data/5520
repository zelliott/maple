Lipid-peptide interactions with the 27-residue peptide of sequence KLEALYILMVLGFFGFFTLGIMLSYIR reconstituted as beta-sheet assemblies in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers have been studied by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy with spin-labeled lipids. The peptide corresponds to residues 42-68 of the IsK voltage-gated K+ channel protein and contains the single putative transmembrane span of this protein. Lipid-peptide interactions give rise to a second component in the ESR spectra of lipids spin-labeled on the 14C atom of the chain that corresponds to restriction of the lipid mobility by direct interaction with the peptide assemblies. From the dependence on the lipid/peptide ratio, the stoichiometry of lipid interaction is found to be about two phospholipids/peptide monomer. The sequence of selectivity for lipid association with the peptide assemblies is in the order phosphatidic acid > stearic acid = phosphatidylserine > phosphatidylglycerol = phosphatidylcholine. Comparison with previous data for a corresponding 26-residue mutant peptide with a single deletion of the apolar residue Leu2 (Horvath et al., 1995. Biochemistry 34:3893-3898), indicates a very similar mode of membrane incorporation for native and mutant peptides, but a strongly modified pattern and degree of specificity for the interaction with negatively charged lipids. The latter is interpreted in terms of the relative orientations of the charged amino acid side chains in the beta-sheet assemblies of the native and deletion-mutant peptides.
