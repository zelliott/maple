Cellulose-affinity chromatography proved to be a fast and efficient purification procedure for exoenzymes of the thermophilic anaerobe Clostridium stercorarium, suitable for the preparation of large amounts of enzymes for technical applications. The cellulose-binding enzymes could be identified as the C. stercorarium; cellulolytic enzymes Avicelase I and Avicelase II characterized previously as endo-1,4-beta-glucanase and exo-1,4-beta-glucanase. A third protein was identified as xylanase A, the major endo-1,4-beta-xylanase of this organism.
