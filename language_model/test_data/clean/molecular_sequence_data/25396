Immuno-cross-reactivity between histidine decarboxylase (HDC) and dopa decarboxylase (DDC) was investigated. By comparing the cDNA sequences of rat HDC with rat and guinea-pig DDCs, we found a region that may possibly be related to the cross-reactivity of anti-rat HDC antibody with guinea-pig DDC. The peptide encoded by this region was synthesized and anti-peptide antibody was prepared. We also purified HDC and DDC homogeniously from fetal rat liver and guinea-pig liver, respectively. On immunoblotting, anti-peptide antibody recognized both rat HDC and guinea-pig DDC. Anti-HDC polyclonal antibody which also recognizes both enzymes detected only rat HDC when it was absorbed by the peptide. This result indicates that this region is responsible for the immuno-cross-reactivity of anti-rat HDC antibody with guinea-pig DDC.
