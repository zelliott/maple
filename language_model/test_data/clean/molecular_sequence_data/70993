A novel putative capsular polysaccharide consisting of D-Glcp and D-Fruf in the molar ratio of 1:1 was isolated as minor constituent from the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) fraction of Pseudomonas (Burkholderia) caryophylli. Its structure was determined, using mainly one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, as: -->6)-alpha-D-Glcp-(1-->1)-beta-D-Fruf-(2-->.
