The promoter for the rat follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) gene contains a conserved consensus E box sequence and an initiator-like region (InR) sequence. Deletion analysis and transient transfections showed that a 114-base pair region (-143 to -30) that encompasses the E box and the InR was sufficient for greater than 75% of promoter function. DNase I footprint analysis showed that the E box and InR were protected by nuclear proteins from rat Sertoli cells, and the E box region was shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) to be a site of Sertoli protein interactions. Mutations in the E box disrupted these interactions and reduced FSHR promoter activity. Co-transfection of the inhibitor of DNA binding (Id) with an FSHR/luciferase construct into mouse Sertoli 1 cells reduced FSHR promoter activity. Using EMSA, the upstream stimulatory factor was shown to be a component of the complexes that interacted with the E box in the FSHR promoter. Binding of proteins from rat Sertoli cells to the InR was demonstrated using EMSA. Also, an oligonucleotide that represented the sequence of the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase InR displaced the complexes at the FSHR InR. Mutations in the InR resulted in a significant reduction of FSHR promoter activity.
