Two psychrophilic, Gram-negative, rod-shaped, motile bacteria (strains 112T and 102T) that conserved energy from dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction concomitant with acetate oxidation were isolated from permanently cold Arctic marine sediments. Both strains grew at temperatures down to -2 degrees C, with respective temperature optima of 14 degrees C and 14-17 degrees C for strains 112T and 102T. The isolated strains reduced Fe(III) using common fermentation products such as acetate, lactate, propionate, formate or hydrogen as electron donors, and they also grew with fumarate as the sole substrate. As alternatives to Fe(III), they reduced fumarate, S0 and Mn(IV). Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain 112T was most closely related to Desulfuromonas acetoxidans (97.0 %) and Desulfuromonas thiophila NZ27T (95.5 %), and strain 102T to Malonomonas rubra Gra Mal 1T (96.3 %) and Desulfuromusa succinoxidans GylacT (95.9 %) within the Deltaproteobacteria. Strains 112T and 102T therefore represent novel species, for which the names Desulfuromonas svalbardensis sp. nov. (type strain 112T=DSM 16958T=JCM 12927T) and Desulfuromusa ferrireducens sp. nov. (type strain 102T=DSM 16956T=JCM 12926T) are proposed.
