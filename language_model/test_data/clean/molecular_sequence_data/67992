Cold agglutinins with the rare anti-Pr specificity were identified in an adult patient with fresh varicella infection. The antibody was of the IgM kappa type with subspecificity anti-Pr3d and caused a haemolytic episode in the patient. In the only previously reported case in which cold agglutinins were associated with varicella infection, the antibody specificity was also anti-Pr.
