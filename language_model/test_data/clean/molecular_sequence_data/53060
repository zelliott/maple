The fragile histidine triad (FHIT) gene is localized on chromosome 3p14 and spans the common fragile site FRA3B. Even though its role in carcinogenesis is still unclear, this gene is frequently inactivated by carcinogen-induced intragenic deletions in many types of cancers, and FHIT abnormal transcripts are found in many primary tumors and tumor-derived cell lines. We evaluated FHIT gene involvement in 39 esophageal carcinomas (18 adenocarcinomas [ACÂ¿, 21 squamous cell carcinomas [SCC]) by both reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification and loss of heterozygosity analysis (LOH). Thirty cases (77%) displayed either aberrant FHIT transcripts (12 cases) and/or LOH (24 cases); among these, only 6 samples displayed both aberrant transcripts and LOH, thus suggesting that the two events are probably independent. Moreover, LOH was significantly higher in SCC (80%) than in AC (44%), and because most of our patients are heavy smokers and/or alcohol consumers, these results suggest that the FHIT gene might be a common target for carcinogens also in the esophagus.
