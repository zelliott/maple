An ovoid to rod-shaped, phototrophic, purple sulfur bacterium, designated strain JA136(T), was isolated in pure culture from brackish water near Kakinada, India, in a medium that contained 2 % NaCl (w/v). Cells were Gram-negative and motile by means of a single polar flagellum. Strain JA136(T) had no absolute salt requirement for growth but was able to tolerate up to 4 % NaCl (w/v). Intracellular photosynthetic membranes were of the vesicular type. Bacteriochlorophyll a and the carotenoid lycopene of the rhodopinal series were present as photosynthetic pigments. Strain JA136(T) was able to grow photolithoautotrophically and photolithoheterotrophically. There was no vitamin requirement for growth of strain JA136(T). Phylogenetic analysis on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain JA136(T) clustered with species of the genus Allochromatium in the class Gammaproteobacteria. Strain JA136(T) showed highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with the type strains of Allochromatium vinosum (97.0 %), Allochromatium minutissimum (95.8 %) and Allochromatium warmingii (90.0 %). Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity data and morphological and physiological characteristics, strain JA136(T) was sufficiently distinct from recognized Allochromatium species to be described as representing a novel species of the genus, for which the name Allochromatium renukae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is JA136(T) (=JCM 14262(T) =DSM 18713(T)).
