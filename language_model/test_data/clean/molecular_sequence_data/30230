The gene encoding the beta-subunit of guanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins) has been cloned from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The predicted 340 amino acid sequence matches the highly conserved amino acid sequences of previously isolated G-protein beta-subunits from mammals and Drosophila. The coding region of the C. elegans beta-subunit gene, which has been mapped to the C. elegans chromosome II, is interrupted by eight introns. Southern analysis indicates that C. elegans has only one beta-subunit gene. A 2.8 kb (1 kb = 10(3) bases or base-pairs) transcript derived from this gene could be detected.
