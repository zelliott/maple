The isolation of an acidic protein, pI 4.5, that is abundant in turkey gizzard is described. Its apparent molecular weight measured by electrophoretic procedures is 24,000. This protein is phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and one phosphorylation site is indicated. From sequence determinations of tryptic peptides it is concluded that this protein is closely related to the C-terminal part of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase. The initiation site for the protein is to the C-terminal side of the calmodulin-binding site. From the sequence data an estimated molecular weight is 18,000. This protein is expressed independently, as indicated by a blocked N terminus, and is probably the translation product of the 2.7-kilobase RNA detected previously in chicken gizzard (Guerriero, V., Jr., Russo, M. A., Olson, N. J., Putkey, J. A., and Means, A. R. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 8372-8381). Because of its putative origin as the C-terminal end of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase, it is termed "telokin" (from a combination of kinase and the Greek telos, "end").
