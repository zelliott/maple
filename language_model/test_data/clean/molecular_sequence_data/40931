Metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) are being reported with increasing frequency worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of blalMP-1, blaVIM-1,2 and blaSPM-1 genes encoding metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) among a collection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from patients at different hospitals in Tehran and to trace the disseminated clones at these hospitals by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Susceptibility of 610 P aeruginosa to 14 different antibiotics was determined using disc diffusion method. Isolates showing resistance to imipenem and ceftazidime were subjected to micro broth dilution assay to determine their MIC values. The blaIMP-1, blaVIM-1, blaVIM-2, and blaSPM-1, genes were amplified by PCR. Isolates containing blaVIM-1 were analyzed by PFGE. Sixty-eight isolates were resistant to imipenem (MIC > or = 4 microg/ml) of which 16 isolates carried blaVIM-1 gene using PCR assay. No other MBL genes were detected in this study. Three different unrelated patterns were found for isolates containing blaVIM-1 gene by PFGE of which pattern A was predominant. All isolates were susceptible to colistin and polymixin B. blaVIM-1 was the main gene encoding MBL among the isolates of P aeruginosa in our study. Clonal spread of isolates containing blaVIM-1 had occurred at Tehran hospitals. However, heterogeneous clones also were involved in the outbreaks.
