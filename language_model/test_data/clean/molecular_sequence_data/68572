The present study describes a method for amplifying DNA in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans by using short, synthetic oligonucleotides of random sequence as primers in the polymerase chain reaction. Genomic DNA from each of 20 human isolates of A. actinomycetemcomitans was successfully amplified in a thermal cycler with a single synthetic primer (GGGTAACGCC) and reproducibly produced 14 different DNA amplification profiles (amplitypes). A. actinomycetemcomitans isolates from the same subject revealed the same amplitype. The arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction appears to be useful in characterizing human isolates of A. actinomycetemcomitans for studies of epidemiology and bacterial transmission.
