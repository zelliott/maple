In this study we present the complete genomic structure of the bovine PLP gene and its assignment to the long arm of the X-chromosome (BTXq2.1). We determined a total of 18,767 bp of the bovine PLP gene and compared it to the human heterolog. A very high similarity was detected between the non-coding regions, interrupted primarily by several transposable elements. A deletion of 13 bp in the vicinity to the translation start signal in the promoter of the bovine PLP gene was found. Functional studies of the 3' region showed the use of several polyadenylation signals. Three main transcripts were detected in adult cattle in the range of 3200, 2400, and 1600 nucleotides using Northern blot analysis. An additional shorter transcript was detected in the cerebrum of calves.
