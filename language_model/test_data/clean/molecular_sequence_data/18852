Dehydration responsive element binding (DREB) transcription factors play an important role in the regulation of stress-related genes. These factors contribute to resistance to different abiotic stresses. In the present study, a novel DREB transcription factor, BdDREB2, isolated from Buchloe dactyloides, was cloned and characterized. The BdDREB2 protein was estimated to have a molecular weight of 28.36kDa, a pI of 5.53 and a typical AP2/ERF domain. The expression of BdDREB2 was involved in responses to drought and salt stresses. Overexpression of BdDREB2 in tobacco showed higher relative water and proline content, and was associated with lower MDA content under drought stress, suggesting that the transgenic tobacco may tolerate drought stress better. Results demonstrate that BdDREB2 may play an important role in the regulation of abiotic stress responses, and mediate many physiological pathways that enhance stress tolerance in plants.
