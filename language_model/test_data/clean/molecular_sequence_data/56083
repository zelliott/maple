We developed a rapid method to determine DNA-binding sites for putative DNA-binding proteins. This procedure has been successfully used to define a specific consensus site for the human ZNF35 zinc finger gene. ZNF35 encodes a 58-kDA polypeptide containing 11 consecutive finger motifs located at the amino terminus, and an acidic domain located at the carboxy terminus. These features suggest that ZNF35 is a site-specific DNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of gene expression. We have expressed the ZNF35 protein from E. coli and have employed a Southwestern-polymerase chain reaction method using random oligonucleotides to identify its high-affinity binding site. The core sequence for the ZNF35 protein-binding site is 5'-C/GC/GAAG/TA-3'.
