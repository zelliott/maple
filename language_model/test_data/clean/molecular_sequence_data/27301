Crescent membranes are the first viral structures that can be discerned during poxvirus morphogenesis. The crescents consist of a lipoprotein membrane and an outer lattice scaffold, which provides uniform curvature. Relatively little is known regarding the composition of the crescent membrane or its mode of formation. Here, we show that the H7 protein, which is conserved in all vertebrate poxviruses but has no discernible functional motifs or nonpoxvirus homologs, contributes to the formation of crescents and immature virions. Synthesis of the 17-kDa H7 protein was dependent on DNA replication and occurred late during vaccinia virus infection. Unlike many late proteins, however, H7 was not incorporated into mature virions or localized in cellular organelles. To gain insight into the role of H7, an inducible mutant was constructed and shown to have a conditional lethal phenotype: H7 expression and infectious virus formation were dependent on isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. In the absence of inducer, viral late proteins were made, but membrane and core proteins were not processed by the I7 protease. A block in morphogenesis was demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy: neither typical crescents nor immature virions were detected in the absence of inducer. Instead, factory areas of the cytoplasm contained large, electron-dense inclusions, some of which had partially coated membrane segments at their surfaces. Separate, lower-density inclusions containing the D13 scaffold protein and endoplasmic reticulum membranes were also present. These features are most similar to those previously seen when expression of A11, another conserved nonvirion protein, is repressed.
