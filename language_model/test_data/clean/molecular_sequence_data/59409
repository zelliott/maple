A new glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger was isolated and characterized. The enzyme showed different kinetic and stability characteristics when compared to a commercially available batch of A. niger glucose oxidase. The gene encoding the new glucose oxidase was isolated and DNA sequence analysis of the coding region showed 80% identity to the sequence of a glucose oxidase gene previously published. However, the similarity of the non-coding sequences up- and downstream of the open reading frame was much less, showing only 66% and 50% identity respectively. Despite the low degree of similarity between the promotor region of the new gene and the previously published one, the new glucose oxidase was likewise induced by calcium carbonate. In addition, we showed that this induction occurred on the transcriptional level. Observations concerning the effect of gluconolactone and the levels of glucose-6 phosphate isomerase upon calcium carbonate induction suggested that the enhancement of glucose oxidase biosynthesis by calcium carbonate was accompanied by a metabolic shift from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway.
