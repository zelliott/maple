Transgenic mice carrying the bacterial lacl gene in a lambda shuttle vector were used to isolate and characterize background and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced mutations in skin. Adult male mice were treated once topically with either DMBA or acetone or were left untreated. Seven days later, DMBA treatment had significantly increased the mutant frequency in the skin (mean +/- SEM, 36 +/- 3 x 10(-5)) versus in vehicle-treated (6.4 +/- 1.2 x 10(-5)) and untreated mice (7.1 x 1.0 x 10(-5)). At least 10 mutants from each of three DMBA-treated and three untreated mice were selected for DNA sequence analysis. In each case, the entire 1080-bp target gene was sequenced. Base-pair substitutions predominated (86 of 96 mutations), although frameshift and deletion mutations were also detected. Twelve percent of the mutants carried more than one mutation. In controls, the mutations were predominantly GC-->AT transitions (26 of 42), and no AT-->TA transversions were recovered. In contrast, in the DMBA-treated mice, AT-->TA transversions represented 42% of the mutations (23 of 54) and GC-->AT transitions accounted for only 11%. The AT-->TA transversions occurred mostly at 5'-CA sites. This class of mutation has been recovered frequently in ras genes from DMBA-treated mice and probably represents an early event in carcinogenesis (Nelson MA et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 89:6398-6402, 1992). Our present results are consistent with the types of DNA damage induced by DMBA. The observation of different mutant frequencies and spectra in treated and control mice demonstrates the utility of this approach in the study of mutagenesis in vivo.
