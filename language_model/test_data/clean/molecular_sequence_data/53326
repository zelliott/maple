Glu126 (helix IV) and Arg144 (helix V) in the lactose permease of Escherichia coli are critical for substrate binding and transport, and the two residues are in close proximity and charge-paired. By using a functional permease construct with two tandem factor Xa protease sites in the cytoplasmic loop between helices IV and V, it is shown here that Cys residues in place of Glu126 and Arg144, as well as Ala122 and Val149, spontaneously form disulfide bonds in situ, indicating that this region of transmembrane domains IV and V is in the alpha-helical conformation. To determine if the local structure or environment is perturbed by the presence of an unpaired charge, either Glu126 or Arg144 or both were replaced with Ala, and cross-linking between the Cys pair Ala122-->Cys/Val149-->Cys was studied. Ala replacement for Arg144 causes a marked decrease in cross-linking, while Ala replacement for Glu126 alone or for both Glu126 and Arg144 has little effect. The data provide strong support for the argument that Glu126 and Arg144 are within close proximity and suggest that an unpaired carboxylate at position 126 causes a structural change at the interface between helices IV and V.
