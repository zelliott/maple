The nucleotide sequences of the enterotoxin plasmid P307 transfer genes traM, finP, traJ, traY, and gene 19 were determined. Gene 19 is highly conserved; its product is very similar to that coded by the F and R1 plasmids. The TraM protein is similar in P307 and in F; the R1 sequence shows differences in the 40 N-terminal amino acids. The traJ product is very different in P307, F, and R1. The traY gene from P307, which in F is almost twice as long, is similar in size to that from R1. The finP RNA shows a high degree of homology with that from R1 and F, except for the two loop regions where base changes were observed. The genes coding for proteins, except traY, could be expressed in minicell- and T7 promoter-driven expression systems, whereas traJ and gene 19 could be expressed only in the latter system.
