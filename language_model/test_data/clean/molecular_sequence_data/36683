Beaded cellulose (Perloza) was modified with acrylonitrile followed by reduction with diborane to give a functionalised support containing aminopropyl groups. This spacer arm was then further extended with a glycolamido or an Fmoc-amino acid-4-oxymethylphenoxyacetyl moiety. A number of peptides, including the Merrifield test peptide leucyl-alanyl-glycyl-valine, leucine-enkephalin, Acyl Carrier Protein (65-74), angiotensin I and II, ACTH(4-11) and LHRH were synthesised on the aminopropyl beaded cellulose support using modified t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) or fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) synthesis protocols. The peptides were cleaved from the support and further purified.
