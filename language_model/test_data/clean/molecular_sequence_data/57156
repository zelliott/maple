A previously undescribed bovine serum lectin (designated CL-43) was identified by its Ca(2+)-dependent binding to mannan and by its molecular mass of 43 kDa under reducing conditions on SDS-PAGE. The lectin was isolated by polyethylene glycol precipitation, affinity chromatography on mannan-Sepharose (followed by elution with EDTA), and absorption on Sepharose-4B-coupled rabbit anti-bovine Ig (to remove anti-mannan antibodies). Fractions containing the lectin were reapplied to mannan-Sepharose. Bound conglutinin was eluted with GlcNAc, and then the 43-kDa lectin, together with mannan-binding protein (MBP), was eluted with mannose. The 43-kDa lectin was separated from MBP by ion exchange chromatography on Mono-Q. On SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions the lectin showed a molecular mass of 120 kDa. On gel chromatography under nondissociating conditions the protein was eluted at a volume corresponding to a molecular mass of approximately 750 kDa. Amino acid analysis showed the presence of hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine and a high content of glycine (24.3%) indicating the presence of a collagen-like structure. This was supported by the susceptibility of the protein to collagenase digestion. The designation CL-43 was chosen since this molecule appears to belong to the collectins, i.e. proteins with collagen structure and lectin activity. The N-terminal sequence (27 amino acids) showed 56% identity with bovine SP-D and 44% identity to bovine conglutinin. An inhibition assay with biotinylated CL-43, using solid-phase mannan as ligand, revealed the following carbohydrate inhibition pattern: mannose and ManNAc > fucose > GlcNAc > glucose and maltose > galactose > lactose >> GalNAc. We conclude that CL-43 is a circulating lectin, with structural similarities to bovine conglutinin and SP-D, and a ligand binding profile resembling that of MBP.
