Chemical investigation of the metabolites produced when a new fungus, Hyphozyma lignicola, isolated from blackgalls on aspen, was grown in malt extract liquid medium resulted in the isolation and identification of five trehalose esters 1-5, which are unusual fungal metabolites. The major compound is 3,6-di-O-acetyl-2-O-octadecanoyl-alpha,alpha-D-trehalose [2]. The structures were established by the analysis of nmr and fabms data in combination with chemical degradation.
