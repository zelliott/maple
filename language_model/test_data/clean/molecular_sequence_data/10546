Yeast S-II was found to stimulate yeast RNA polymerase II only and not mouse RNA polymerase II. To identify the molecular region of S-II that defines species specificity, we constructed six hybrid S-II molecules consisting of three regions from yeast and/or Ehrlich cell S-II and examined their activity in terms of RNA polymerase II specificity and suppression of 6-azauracil sensitivity in the yeast S-II null mutant. We found that the region 132-270 (amino acid positions) of yeast S-II is indispensable for specific interaction with yeast RNA polymerase II in vitro and for suppression of 6-azauracil sensitivity in vivo. The corresponding region of Ehrlich cell S-II, the region 132-262, was also shown to be essential for its interaction with mouse RNA polymerase II. This region is known to be less conserved than the N- and C-terminal regions in the S-II family suggesting that it is important in the interaction with transcription machinery proteins in a tissue and/or species-specific manner.
