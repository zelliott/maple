The monoclonal antibody U5, which is a potent inducer of proliferation in human T-cells, was found to bind to an alkali-sensitive derivative of ganglioside GD3. Using immunochemical and spectroscopic methods, the structure of the U5 antigen was determined as 7-O-acetyl-GD3. The antibody U5 did not react with 9-O-acetyl-GD3 and bound severalfold more stronger to 7-O-acetyl-GD3 than to GD3. U5 is the first antibody known to detect preferentially 7-O-acetyl-GD3. Flow cytometric analysis showed that each major class of human leukocytes contained a significant fraction of cells binding the U5 antibody.
