PLTX II, a presynaptic calcium channel blocker in Drosophila isolated from the plectreurys spider venom, is a 44-residue peptide containing ten Cys residues and an O-palmitoylated threonine amide at the carboxy-terminus. In this study, the palmitoylated peptide was synthesized in solution by applying our maximum protection strategy using the HF method at the final deprotecting step. Before designing the synthesis, we examined the stability of the palmitoyl moiety under the conditions for the synthesis of the peptide using several model peptides. The O-palmitoyl group was confirmed to be stable during elongation of the peptide bonds, but was partially removable during the deprotection reaction in HF. The depalmitoylation reaction in HF was temperature- and time-dependent. Therefore, the decision was made to protect the Asp residues with benzyl ester, since it is more susceptible to HF than cyclohexyl ester, which is now commonly used in the Boc-based, solid-phase synthesis. Thus, the HF reaction was carried out at -10 degrees or -15 degrees C for 1 h in order to reduce the extent of the depalmitoylation reaction. The resulting palmitoylated and depalmitoylated products were separated, the remaining Acm groups were removed using Hg(OAc)2, and then the completely deprotected peptides were folded to their native forms. The final palmitoylated peptide was proven to be identical with the natural one using various HPLC systems and by bioassay.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
