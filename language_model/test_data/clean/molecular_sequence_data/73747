Although activity-dependent expression of neurotrophins has been studied extensively in the CNS, its physiological role during synapse development is not well established. At the developing neuromuscular junction in culture, exogenous application of the neurotrophin BDNF or NT-3 has been shown to acutely potentiate synaptic transmission and chronically promote synapse maturation. Using the same cell culture model, we have investigated activity-dependent neurotrophin expression in muscle cells and its role in developing neuromuscular synapses. Membrane depolarization, elicited by either depolarizing agents or repetitive electric stimulation, rapidly and specifically increased the levels of NT-3 mRNA in developing Xenopus laevis muscle cells in culture. NT-3 gene expression also was enhanced by acetylcholine (ACh), the neurotransmitter that causes muscle membrane depolarization. The effects of depolarization were mediated by increasing intracellular calcium concentration. Moreover, factor(s) induced by membrane depolarization appeared to enhance synaptic transmission at the developing neuromuscular junction. The frequency of spontaneous synaptic currents (SSCs) recorded from neuromuscular synapses was increased significantly after treatment with conditioned medium from depolarized muscle cultures. The amplitude, rise time, and decay time of SSCs were not affected, indicating a presynaptic action of the conditioned medium. The effects of the conditioned medium were blocked, partially, by the NT-3 scavenger TrkC-IgG, suggesting that the potentiation of synaptic efficacy was attributable, at least in part, to elevated NT-3 as a consequence of muscle depolarization. Thus, activity-dependent expression of muscle NT-3 may contribute to the development of the neuromuscular synapse.
