The presence of glycogen-accumulating organisms (GAO) has been hypothesized to be a cause of deterioration in enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) processes due to their abilities to out-compete polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAO). Based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, new members of uncultured gammaproteobacterial GAO (GB) were identified from sludge samples of a lab-scale sequencing batch reactor used for EBPR. The new GB formed a phylogenetic lineage (GB8) clearly distinct from the previously reported seven GB subgroups. Because the new GB8 members were not targeted by the known fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) oligonucleotide probes, a GB8-specific FISH probe (GB429) and a new FISH probe (GB742) targeting all eight GB subgroups were designed, and the phenotypic properties of the new GB8 members were investigated. FISH and microautoradiography approaches showed that GB429-targeted cells (GB8) were large coccobacilli (2-4 Âµm in size) with the ability to take up acetate under anaerobic conditions, but unable to accumulate polyphosphate under the subsequent aerobic conditions, consistent with in situ phenotypes of GB. FISH analyses on several sludge samples showed that members of GB8 were commonly detected as the majority of GB in lab- and full-scale EBPR processes. In conclusion, this study showed that members of GB8 could be a subgroup of GB with an important role in EBPR deterioration. Designs of FISH probes which hybridize with broader GB subgroups at different hierarchical levels will contribute to studies of the distributions and ecophysiologies of GB in lab- or full-scale EBPR plants.
