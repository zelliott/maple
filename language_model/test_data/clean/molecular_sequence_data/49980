A rare chromosomal translocation, (11;20)(p15;q11), was detected in a 29-year-old male patient diagnosed with acute monocytic leukemia (AMoL) according to the French-American-British classification criteria. Whole chromosome painting analysis with paints for chromosomes 11 and 20 confirmed the result of conventional cytogenetic analysis. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction revealed the NUP98-TOP1 fusion transcript. To our knowledge, this is the second report of the translocation involving NUP98 and TOP1 genes in AMoL. On reviewing the literature, we suggest that t(11;20)(p15q11) is associated with myelocytic disorders rather than lymphocytic proliferative diseases.
