Hydrophobic interactions are shown to be predominant in stabilization of the quaternary structure of the adenovirus fiber and in preservation of its antigenic activity. The computer analysis has revealed at least five peptides with maximal hydrophilicity in the fiber protein composition. They may participate in the formation of antigenic determinants. The presence of type-specific, subgenus-specific, intersubgenus-specific and new genus-specific (common for both human and monkey Ad) antigenic determinants are determined in the composition of the Ad h1 fiber by the enzyme-immunoassay.
