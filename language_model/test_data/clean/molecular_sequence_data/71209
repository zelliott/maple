memA was isolated by subtractive hybridization in which the mRNA repertoire was compared in a panel of human melanoma cell lines with different metastasizing potential. Expression of memA mRNA is elevated in the highly metastasizing human melanoma cell lines and derived xenografts, as compared with the non-metastasizing ones. In a collection of human tumor cell lines and melanoma metastasis lesions, memA mRNA expression could be detected in the A-431 (epidermoid carcinoma), HT-1080 (fibrosarcoma), JEG-3 and JAR (choriocarcinomas) cell lines and in three out of 11 melanoma metastasis lesions. The distribution of memA mRNA in a collection of healthy human organs is also tissue restricted. Sequence analysis revealed that the MEMA protein is identical with a 160 kDa nuclear 'domain rich in serines' (DRS) protein occurring free in the nucleoplasm and in U2-ribonucleoprotein structures. MEMA is also homologous to pinin, a 140 kDa protein associated with the desmosome-intermediate filament complex, and to a 32 kDa porcine neutrophilic protein that was copurified with components of the NADPH-oxidase enzyme complex. The encoded amino acid sequence predicts that the MEMA protein has three coiled-coil domains, one glycine loop domain, is very hydrophilic and contains regions rich in glutamine/proline, glutamic acid and serine residues.
