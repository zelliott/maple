A general problem in comparative modeling and protein design is the conformational evaluation of loops with a certain sequence in specific environmental protein frameworks. Loops of different sequences and structures on similar scaffolds are common in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). In order to explore both structural and sequential diversity of them, a data base of loops connecting similar secondary structure fragments is constructed by searching the data base of families of structurally similar proteins and PDB. A total of 84 loop families having 2-13 residues are found among the well-determined structures of resolution better than 2.5 A. Eight alpha-alpha, 20 alpha-beta, 19 beta-alpha, and 37 beta-beta families are identified. Every family contains more than 5 loop motifs. In each family, no loops share same sequence and all the frameworks are well superimposed. Forty-three new loop classes are distinguished in the data base. The structural variability of loops in homologous proteins are examined and shown in 44 families. Motif families are characterized with geometric parameters and sequence patterns. The conformations of loops in each family are clustered into subfamilies using average linkage cluster analysis method. Information such as geometric properties, sequence profile, sequential and structural variability in loop, structural alignment parameters, sequence similarities, and clustering results are provided. Correlations between the conformation of loops and loop sequence, motif sequence, and global sequence of PDB chain are examined in order to find how loop structures depend on their sequences and how they are affected by the local and global environment. Strong correlations (R > 0.75) are only found in 24 families. The best R value is 0.98. The data base is available through the Internet.
