Both positive and negative regulatory elements responsive to the product of the adenovirus type 12 E1A gene are located in the promoter region of the gene for mouse H-2Kbm1 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen (1). We have analyzed the negative regulatory element that is affected by E1A and identified a target CAA repeated motif, CAA(A)CAAA, within -1725 to -1705 and -1591 to -1568 in a 316-bp sequence located in the far upstream region of H-2Kb promoter (-1837 to -1522; +1 refers to the cap site). The extent of cell surface expression of the MHC class 1 antigen was significantly decreased in the case of transfectants obtained by introducing an expression plasmid that included MHC class 1 cDNA with the CAA repeated element, as compared with that of a plasmid with mutated CAA repeats. We have also characterized the nuclear proteins that bind to this motif. The analysis of the effects of mutations during competition assays of in vivo and gel retardation competition assays demonstrated that the CAA repeated element is essential not only for E1A-dependent repression of transcription but also for the cell surface expression of the product of the mouse H-2Kb class I gene, presumably through nuclear proteins that specifically bind to it.
