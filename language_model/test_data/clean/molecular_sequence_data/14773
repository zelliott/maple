 High-molecular-weight cell-associated proteins (HM-CAP) assay is the most popular serological immunoassay worldwide and has been developed from US isolates as the antigens. The accuracy is reduced when the sera are from adults and children in East Asia including Japan. To overcome the reduced accuracy, an enzyme immunoassay using Japanese strain-derived HM-CAP (JHM-CAP) was developed, in which the antigens were prepared by exactly the same procedure as HM-CAP. The performance of JHM-CAP was better than that of HM-CAP in Japanese adults as well as in children. The higher sensitivity was because of the presence of 100-kDa protein that was absent in the preparation of HM-CAP antigen.

 Immunoblot analysis and peptide mass fingerprinting methods were used to identify the distinctive 100-kDa protein present in JHM-CAP antigens. The peptide sequence and identification were analyzed by Mascot Search on the database of Helicobacter pylori. The identified protein was confirmed by immunoblot with a specific antibody and inhibition assay by the sera.

The distinctive 100-kDa protein was a fragment of CagA derived from Japanese clinical isolates, and the sera of Japanese patients had strongly reacted to the protein, probably to the exposed epitope on the fragmented CagA. The fragmentation of CagA had occurred in the process of antigen preparation in Japanese isolates, not in US isolates even under the same preparation.
