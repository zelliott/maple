CC-1065 is a large molecule that binds covalently to adenine residues of DNA in a sequence-specific manner and lies in the minor groove about four bases to the 5' side of the adducted residue. Using a reconstituted Escherichia coli nucleotide excision repair system, we have obtained data showing that the ABC excinuclease makes incisions both 5' and 3' to the CC-1065 adduct and that the incision activity is stimulated by the addition of helicase II and DNA polymerase I (and dNTPs). Our results with the CC-1065 adduct are consistent with the reported in vitro processing of other adducts (e.g., cisplatin, UV photoproducts) but do not agree with a recent study that reported anomalous processing of the CC-1065 adduct by ABC excinuclease and helicase II. Our results also imply that, in binding to damaged DNA, ABC excinuclease does not make important contacts in the minor groove four bases to the 5' side of the damaged residue.
