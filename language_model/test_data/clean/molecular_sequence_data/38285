A number of lines of evidence suggest that red wine exerts a protective effect against coronary heart disease, but the nature of the protective compounds is unclear and the mechanism is incompletely understood. In this study, total lipids of a Greek red wine were separated into neutral and polar lipids. Polar lipids were further separated into glyco- and phospholipids, which were fractionated by HPLC. Each lipid fraction was tested in vitro for its ability to inhibit platelet-activating factor (PAF) and thrombin-induced washed rabbit platelet aggregation and/or to cause platelet aggregation. A significant number of glyco- and phospholipids that exerted the above biological activities were detected. Structural data of an active phosphoglycolipid are also provided. trans-Resveratrol demonstrated also a dose-dependent inhibition of PAF-induced platelet aggregation along with the already reported inhibitory activity against thrombin and adenosine-5'-diphosphate. Because it has already been reported that PAF is involved in atheromatosis generation, the existence of PAF inhibitors in red wine may contribute to the protective role of red wine against atherosclerosis.
