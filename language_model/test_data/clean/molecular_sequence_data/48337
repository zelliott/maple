Age-related cataract (ARC) is a complex multifactorial disorder, including genetic and environmental factors. Ezrin (EZR), a member of the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) protein family, plays a crucial role in the development of the lens as a plasma membrane-cytoskeleton linker. We conducted this study to investigate the role of genetic variations of ezrin and the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in EZR and susceptibility to ARC in a Chinese population.

A total of 205 sporadic age-related cataract patients and 218 unrelated random healthy controls participated in our study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. All exons of EZR were sequenced after being amplified with polymerase chain reaction. The functional consequences of the mutations were analyzed using PolyPhen2. SNP statistical analysis was performed using SNPstats.

We found three novel variations in 205 patients. None presented in the 218 controls, including c.441C>G, c.924G>C, and c.1503G>A. PolyPhen2 predicted that the c.924G>C mutation probably had pathogenicity. Compared with the healthy controls, the rs5881286 -/GT genotype and - allele frequencies (p=0.0012; odds ratio [OR]=3.37; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.70-6.70; p=3.96e-5; χ(2)=18.98, respectively), rs2242318 T/C genotype and C allele frequencies (p=0.0045; OR=3.40; 95% CI=1.70-6.79; p=8.82e-6; χ(2)=21.86, respectively), and rs144581330 A/G genotype and G allele frequencies (p=0.0472; OR=14.46; 95% CI=1.29-162.43; p=0.0244, χ(2)=6.99, respectively) were higher in the patients with age-related cataract. SNP rs144581330 in exon 2 was also predicted to be probably damaging by PolyPhen2. Haplotype association including the - allele of rs5881286, C allele of rs2242318, and A allele of rs144581330 exhibited significantly higher distribution in the patients with ARC (p=8.0e-4; OR=3.38; 95% CI=1.66-6.87).

This study suggests that the genetic variations and SNPs in the gene EZR possibly contribute to the development of age-related cataracts in the Chinese population.
