The effect of concentration of coplanar PCB on the dechlorinating microbial community and dechlorination were investigated in anoxic estuarine sediment collected from Er-Jen River and enriched with 10 and 50 mg L⁻¹ of 3,4,4',5-tetrachlorobiphenyl, 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl, and 3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobipheny. Dechlorination rates were similar in the cultures enriched with 10 and 50 mg L⁻¹ of 3,4,4',5-tetrachlorobiphenyl, whereas significantly higher dechlorination rates were observed in cultures enriched with 10 mg L⁻¹ of 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl. No dechlorination was observed in sediment slurries enriched with 3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobipheny. Para dechlorination occurred prior to meta dechlorination during reductive dechlorination of 3,4,4',5-tetrachlorobiphenyl and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl. GC-MS and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) were used to detect dechlorination products and dechlorinating microorganisms in the enriched sediment cultures during the process of degradation. Two Chloroflexi phylotypes observed in DGGE were responsible for para and meta dechlorination respectively. Phylotype Cp-1 has 98% similarity to uncultured bacterium N5-12. Phylotype Cm-1 has 99% similarity to uncultured dechlorinating bacterium m1 or SF1 belonging to the ο-17/DF-1 group of PCB-dechlorinating bacteria.
