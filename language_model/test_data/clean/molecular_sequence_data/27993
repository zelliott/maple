A major 70 kDa protein of the yeast mitochondrial outer membrane is coded by a nuclear gene, synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes, and transported to the mitochondrial outer membrane. In order to investigate in detail the information necessary for localizing the 70 kDa protein at the outer membrane, we have examined the intracellular and intramitochondrial location of fusion proteins which consist of various lengths of the amino-terminal region of the 70 kDa protein with an enzymatically active beta-galactosidase. The results indicate that the extreme amino-terminal 12 amino acids of the 70 kDa protein function as a targeting sequence, whereas the subsequent uncharged region (up to residue 29) is necessary for "stop-transfer" and "anchoring" functions. Moreover, we have found that a fusion protein which contained the amino-terminal 19 amino acids of the 70 kDa protein is localized on the outer membrane as well as in the matrix space. Changes in the dual localization of this fusion protein accompanied its overproduction or expression in a respiration-deficient yeast mutant.
