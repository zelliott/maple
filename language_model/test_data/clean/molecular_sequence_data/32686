A screening of soil samples for D-amino acid oxidase (D-AAO) activity led to the isolation and identification of the gram-positive bacterium Arthrobacter protophormiae. After purification of the wild-type D-AAO, the gene sequence was determined and designated dao. An alignment of the deduced primary structure with eukaryotic D-AAOs and D-aspartate oxidases showed that the D-AAO from A. protophormiae contains five of six conserved regions; the C-terminal type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal that is typical for D-AAOs from eukaryotic origin is missing. The dao gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant D-AAO had a specific activity of 180 U mg protein(-1) for D-methionine and was slightly inhibited in the presence of L-methionine. Mainly, basic and hydrophobic D-amino acids were oxidized by the strictly enantioselective enzyme. After a high cell density fermentation, 2.29 x 10(6) U of D-AAO were obtained from 15 l of fermentation broth.
