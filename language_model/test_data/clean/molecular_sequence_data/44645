Angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in gastric ulcer repair. Several growth factors are involved in angiogenesis, and of these, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has received considerable attention, since it is the only factor that specifically acts on endothelial cells. However, the role of VEGF in gastric ulcer repair is not known. In the present study, we demonstrate the specific expression of VEGF at the gastric ulcer margin, using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. The specific receptors of VEGF, flt-1 and KDR were also detected in gastric mucosa. We further demonstrate the expression of VEGF by cultured human gastric fibroblasts which is enhanced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. These data suggest that VEGF may play a role in angiogenesis in the process of gastric ulcer healing.
