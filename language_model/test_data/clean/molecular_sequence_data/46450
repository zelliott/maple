The N-terminal part of the inhibitory peptide IF1 interacts with the central Î³ subunit of mitochondrial isolated extrinsic part of ATP synthase in the inhibited complex (J.R. Gledhill, M.G. Montgomery, G.W. Leslie, J.E. Walker, 2007). To explore its role in the different steps of IF1 binding, kinetics of inhibition of the isolated and membrane-bound enzymes were investigated using Saccharomyces cerevisiae IF1 derivatives modified in N-terminal extremity. First, we studied peptides truncated in Nter up to the amino acid immediately preceding Phe17, a well-conserved residue thought to play a key role. These deletions did not affect or even improve the access of IF1 to its target. They decreased the stability of the inhibited complex but much less than previously proposed. We also mutated IF1-Phe17 and found this amino acid not mandatory for the inhibitory effect. The most striking finding came from experiments in which PsaE, a 8 kDa globular-like protein, was attached in Nter of IF1. Unexpectedly, such a modification did not appreciably affect the rate of IF1 binding. Taken together, these data show that IF1-Nter plays no role in the recognition step but contributes to stabilize the inhibited complex. Moreover, the data obtained using chimeric PsaE-IF1 suggest that before binding IF1 presents to the enzyme with its middle part facing a catalytic interface and its Nter extremity folded in the opposite direction.
