The gene (Vn) encoding the mouse vitronectin was isolated and its nucleotide sequence determined. The gene covers approximately 3 kb of genomic DNA. Alignment of the genomic sequence with that of the cDNA revealed that Vn consists of eight exons, interrupted by seven introns ranging in size from 78 to 723 bp.
