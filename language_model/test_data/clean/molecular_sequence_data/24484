Inverse RT-PCR was used for detecting doxycycline-induced mRNA expression after viral transduction with a retroviral vector harboring human TDAG51. After the circularization of double-stranded cDNA, induced transcripts originating from integrated vector genomes were selectively amplified, even in the presence of DNA templates. Thus, DNase treatment before amplification was unnecessary.
