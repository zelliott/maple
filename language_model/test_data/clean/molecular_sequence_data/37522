New human and mouse cDNAs which are homologous to human intersectin gene (ITSN) mapped on a q22.1-22.2 region of human chromosome 21 have been obtained. ITSN gene structure has been determined using nucleotide sequences of human chromosome 21 presented in nucleotide's data bases. The analysis of human and mouse ITSN gene transcripts revealed that their pre-mRNA splicing could occur in different ways. New form of ITSN gene transcripts with alternatively spliced SH3C domain (exon 25 and 26) was detected in different human and mouse tissues. The other splice form with absence of exons 6-14 that results in reading frame shift and stop-codon formation was identified in the mouse adult lung and kidney. In addition, we showed alternative splicing of exons 20, 25 and part of exon 6.
