To establish a stable and large-scale bi-directional sequencing platform for genotyping MICA gene exons 2 to 4, and to analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNP) of the region.

Primers for particular alleles of MICA gene exons 2 to 5 were designed. Optimal conditions for PCR amplification and sequencing reaction were explored. A commercialized one-way sequencing kit for MICA allele was used as a parallel control. Four samples carrying a MICA *010 allele were subjected to cloning and haplotype sequencing.

Results of MICA allele typing of 100 samples for a parallel control group were confirmed by the establish method. Twenty-two SNP in MICA gene exons 2 to 4 were detected in Chinese population. Two novel allelic sequences were accepted by GenBank and IMGT/HLA database and officially named as MICA*065 and MICA*066 by the WHO Nomenclature Committee. A novel SNP in MICA gene intron 3 was discovered, with allelic sequence submitted to GenBank and IMGT/HLA database.

The bi-directional sequencing genotyping platform may be applied for large-scale study of MICA allelic polymorphisms, tissue typing, organ transplantation and disease research.
