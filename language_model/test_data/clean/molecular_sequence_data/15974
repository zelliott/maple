An antiserum (AS 98) was raised against a synthetic peptide deduced from published cDNA sequences of the alpha-subunit of the putative G-protein, GZ (Fong et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 3066-3070, 1988; Matsuoka et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 5384-5388, 1988). In membrane and cytosol preparations of many but not all tested mammalian tissues, AS 98 predominantly recognized two proteins of 40 and 43 kDa Mr. Whereas high levels of a 40 kDa GZ alpha-subunit were found in rat liver membranes and in brain cytosol, AS 98 failed to detect the alpha-subunit of GZ in brain membranes.
