To detect malaria DNA in mosquitoes.

A nested polymerase chain reaction (nested PCR) procedure which amplifies a 121 bp DNA of a SSUrRNA gene specific to Plasmodium vivax was used.

In laboratory-infected mosquitoes, nested PCR could detect as few as 3 sporozoites or 1 infected mosquito mixed in a group of 99 normal ones. Furthermore, no specific 121 bp band was seen with DNA templates from other malaria parasites or negative mosquitoes.

Sensitivity and specificity obtained indicated an advantage of the nested PCR over DNA probes or direct PCR for the detection of Plasmodium vivax sporozoites in mosquitoes with low-grade parasitic infections.
