Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of the insulin receptor in the cell nucleus. Recently, it was shown that the insulin receptor also exhibits nuclear tyrosine kinase activity. In the present investigation, I have searched for structural correlates to a nuclear localization of the insulin receptor as well as to other potential nuclear actions of this molecule. Interestingly, this analysis yielded that the insulin receptor (alpha-subunit) contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal (consistent with the preceding experimental data), several zinc finger-like motifs and an RGG box. These findings have intriguing implications with regard to a presumable role of the insulin receptor (alpha-subunit) as a gene regulatory molecule.
