Here we report the peculiarities of molecular evolution and divergence of paralogous heterochromatic clusters of the testis- expressed X-linked Stellate and Y-linked Su(Ste) tandem repeats. It was suggested that Stellate and Su(Ste) clusters affecting male fertility are the amplified derivatives of the unique euchromatic gene betaCK2tes encoding the putative testis-specific beta-subunit of protein kinase CK2. The putative Su(Ste)-like evolutionary intermediate was detected on the Y chromosome as an orphon outside of the Su(Ste) cluster. The orphon shows extensive homology to the Su(Ste) repeat, but contains several Stellate-like diagnostic nucleotide substitutions, as well as a 10-bp insertion and a 3' splice site of the first intron typical of the Stellate unit. The orphon looks like a pseudogene carrying a drastically damaged Su(Ste) open reading frame (ORF). The putative Su(Ste) ORF, as compared with the Stellate one, carries numerous synonymous substitutions leading to the major codon preference. We conclude that Su(Ste) ORFs evolved on the Y chromosome under the pressure of translational selection. Direct sequencing shows that the efficiency of concerted evolution between adjacent repeats is 5-10 times as high in the Stellate heterochromatic cluster on the X chromosome as that in the Y-linked Su(Ste) cluster, judging by the frequencies of nucleotide substitutions and single-nucleotide deletions.
