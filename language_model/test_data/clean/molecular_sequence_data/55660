The chemiluminescent detection methods described in this chapter have been successfully applied to the detection of plasmid DNA and genomic DNA in Southern and sequencing protocols. The high sensitivity and the simplicity of AMPPD are instrumental in making the chemiluminescent detection of DNA successful in hybridization assays. This detection technique has also been used to detect DNA in dot blots and in situ hybridization experiments as well as proteins in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and Western blots.
