L-29, a mammalian soluble lactose-binding lectin, was previously shown to be phosphorylated in confluent 3T3 fibroblasts (Cowles, E. A., Agrwal, N., Anderson, R. L., and Wang, J. L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 17706-17712), which contain a small amount of this protein. We have determined the site of phosphorylation on L-29, taking advantage of the abundance of L-29 (about 1% of total soluble cell protein) in confluent polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Approximately 15-20% of the L-29 is phosphorylated in these cells. Phosphoamino acid analysis showed phosphate incorporation only at serine. Analysis of chymotryptic and endoproteinase Asp-N-generated NH2-terminal fragments by Edman degradation showed that 90% of the phosphate was at Ser6 and 10% at Ser12. The sequence surrounding Ser6, which is conserved in all known L-29 sequences, indicated that this serine might be phosphorylated by casein kinase I or casein kinase II. Reaction of human recombinant L-29 with [gamma-32P]ATP and each of these casein kinases showed that only casein kinase I catalyzed significant incorporation of 32P into L-29; and, as with the L-29 from the MDCK cell extracts, most of the phosphate was incorporated at Ser6 and a small amount was incorporated at Ser12.
