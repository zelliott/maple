hSGT1 (human suppressor of Gcr two) was isolated as a suppressor gene of the gcr2 mutation. Since Gcr2p is a key regulatory factor of glycolytic gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, hSGT1 is a candidate for a novel human transcription factor involved in carbohydrate metabolism. SGT1 appears to be conserved from Schizosaccharomyces pombe to human but not present in S. cerevisiae. To further study its function, we cloned the hSgt1p orthologue of Sz. pombe (Spsgt1) from Sz. pombe genomic DNA. Overall identity and similarity between SpSgt1p and hSgt1p are 24% and 37%, respectively. Disruption of Spsgt1 showed that Spsgt1 is essential for growth and, using a construct which conditionally expresses sgt1, which with low level expression growth was severely affected on glucose but normal on non-fermentable carbon sources. DNA microarray analyses showed that the transcription of many genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism were upregulated in the mutant, suggesting that SpSgt1p may be involved in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. Furthermore, a GFP fusion of SpSgt1p was localized to the nucleus, fitting with the possibility of SpSgt1p as a transcription factor.
