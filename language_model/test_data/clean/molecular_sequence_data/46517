Microtubule-associated protein MAP2 binds to the Sau96.1 restriction monomer fragment of mouse satellite DNA. This fragment is also present in a lower proportion in bulk DNA. The digestion of MAP2-Sau96.1 fragment complex by DNase results in the protection of certain nucleotide sequences. The sequence poly(dA)4/poly(dT)4 is mainly protected against DNase digestion.
