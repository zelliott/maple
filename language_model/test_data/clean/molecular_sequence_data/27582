The covalent structure of rat ribosomal protein L21 was deduced from the sequence of nucleotides in a recombinant cDNA and confirmed from the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein. Ribosomal protein L21 contains 159 amino acids (the NH2-terminal methionine is removed after translation of the mRNA) and has a molecular weight of 18,322. Hybridization of the cDNA to digests of nuclear DNA suggests that there are 16-23 copies of the L21 gene. The mRNA for the protein is about 680 nucleotides in length.
