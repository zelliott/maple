Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) DNA binding factor is an inducible transcription factor that responds to various cellular signals. Levels of cortical NF-kappa B DNA binding activity were measured in a controlled lateral cortical impact model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rats. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), we found that NF-kappa B DNA binding activity in cerebral cortex ipsilateral to the injury site increased at 1, 3, 5 and 7 days after injury. Binding activity peaked at 3 days after injury and subsided by 10 days after injury. These data indicate that TBI produces transient increases in NF-kappa B DNA binding activity. Further insights into the role of NF-kappa B in TBI may provide new therapeutic opportunities for head trauma.
