A new method to detect mutations based on the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) technique, ligation-mediated (LM) PCR, and recombinant nuclease CEL I named LM-SAGE assay is reported in the present study. Mismatched DNA heteroduplexes formed from wild-type and mutant DNA are fragmented with CEL I nuclease at the mutant site to produce a double-strand fragment with an overhanging base at the 3'-end. The fragment is ligated to a linker, and digested with MmeI and then ligated to another linker. PCR is performed to amplify the ligation products, and NlaIII is used to release 17-bp tags containing mutation sites followed by purification, concatemerization, cloning, and sequencing. The locations of mutations can be identified from the homology analysis of tags. This new LM-SAGE assay can detect both known and unknown mutations with a sensitivity of 1:50 (mutant:wild-type DNA ratio) in 2.4 x 10(6) copies starting DNA sample. Our results show that this method could be used as a potentially high-throughput assay for mutation detection, particularly for the discovery of unknown mutations in genomic DNA.
