A transposon Tn5 mutagenesis library was generated from Caulobacter crescentus strain NA1000, and clones with deficiency in survival in a high concentration of NaCl were selected. One of these clones, 37G10, has the Tn5 integrated within the coding region of the transcription termination factor Rho. Analysis of this mutant phenotype showed that the cells are motile and present a normal cell cycle, but have a longer generation time. This strain is sensitive to acidic pH, to the presence of different salts and to heat shock, but it responds well to UV light and alkaline pH. The most striking phenotype of the rho mutant is that it is extremely sensitive to oxidative stress, in both exponential and stationary phases. Experiments using a transcriptional fusion of the rho promoter region to the lacZ gene showed that rho gene expression varies during the cell cycle, showing very low expression levels at the swarmer cell stage and presenting maximum levels in early predivisional cells. Transcription of the rho gene is increased in the rho mutant strain, which is indicative of an autoregulatory circuit, and there is a small variation in the cell cycle pattern of expression. Several peptides have their synthesis altered in the mutant strain, as analysed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, most of which show a reduction in expression. These results indicate that the Rho factor is essential for an efficient response to certain stresses in Caulobacter.
