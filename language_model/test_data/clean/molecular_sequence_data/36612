In the Arabidopsis thaliana mitochondrial genome the gene coding for subunit 4L of NADH dehydrogenase (nad4L) is located between exon c of the nad5 open reading frame and orf25. The physical proximity of these genes further supports the trans-splicing model for assembly of the nad5 mRNA. Some transcripts comprise the nad4L open reading frame cotranscribed with nad5 exon c and orf25, while other mRNAs contain only nad4L and orf25. Both open reading frames for nad4L and orf25 are edited in several positions with different frequencies.
