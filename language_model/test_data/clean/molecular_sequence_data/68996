Mutations in the human APC gene are linked to familial adenomatous polyposis and to the progression of sporadic colorectal and gastric tumors. To gain insight into APC function, APC-associated proteins were identified by immunoprecipitation experiments. Antibodies to APC precipitated a 95-kilodalton protein that was purified and identified by sequencing as beta-catenin, a protein that binds to the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin. An antibody specific to beta-catenin also recognized the 95-kilodalton protein in the immunoprecipitates. These results suggest that APC is involved in cell adhesion.
