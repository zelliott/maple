Site-specific recombinases from bacteriophage and yeasts have been developed as novel tools for manipulating DNA both in the test-tube and in living organisms. We discuss the characteristics of these enzyme systems, review their application in genetic and developmental studies and speculate on their future potential for large-scale directed modifications of eukaryotic genomes.
