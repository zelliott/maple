Trichuris arvicolae and T. muris are gastro-intestinal nematodes of respectively arvicoline and murine rodents. We aim to investigate the ecology of these Trichuris species using population genetics. We sampled nematodes from rodents trapped in the East of France. After confirming the species identification of the nematodes using ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 ribosomal DNA sequences, we isolated and characterized twelve dinucleotide microsatellite loci in T. arvicolae. A multiplex panel was developed. Application to a set of 30 individuals allowed clear and easy characterization of allele sizes. The number of alleles ranged from 2 to 6 per locus with observed heterozygosities ranging from 0 to 0.93. A test on eleven T. muris revealed that eight loci among twelve amplified, and five were polymorphic. These sets of microsatellite loci provide high throughput capacity for population genetic studies.
