Short tandem repeats (STR) are presently of particular use in the field of forensic science, evolution and anthropology. Y-chromosomal STR systems are widely used for population genetics, population history, and for male identification in forensic cases. Here we present an examination of DYS19, DYS390 and DYS393 allele frequencies in a northern Polish population sample. The calculated indices reflect the potential of these markers for application in forensic casework. Statistically significant differences were observed between most western European populations and the Polish cohort when comparing homogeneity of distribution of DYS19 and DYS390 alleles. For three analyzed loci in a sample of 176 males, 43 haplotypes were observed. The studies revealed some rare alleles and a new allele, allele 16, in the DYS393 system. Sequencing by capillary electrophoresis (PE ABI 310) showed the presence of 16 GATA repetitive elements, confirming results obtained after capillary electrophoresis of the DNA fragment. Additionally, sequencing revealed the presence of a novel transversion (A->C) in the analyzed sample.
