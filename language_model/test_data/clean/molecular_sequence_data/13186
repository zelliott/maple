We have cloned a Na,K-ATPase alpha-subunit gene from Caenorhabditis elegans and discovered that it is identical to the gene eat-6, eat-6 mutations cause feeble contractions and slow, delayed relaxations of pharyngeal muscle. The resting membrane potential of eat-6 mutant pharynxes is consistently depolarized compared to wild-type. The action potentials are smaller, and the return to resting potential is slower. To explain these abnormalities, we propose that a reduction of Na,K-ATPase activity in eat-6 mutants leads to a reduction of the ion concentration gradients that power membrane potential changes.
