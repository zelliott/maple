Differences between the immediate-early gene DNA sequences of two pseudorabies virus isolates (Indiana-Funkhauser and Ka) were resolved and confirmed. The deduced amino acid sequences showed that regions 2 and 4 have fewer changes than the rest of the molecules. These two conserved regions may be functionally important.
