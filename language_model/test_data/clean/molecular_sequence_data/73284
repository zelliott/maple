The KRE2/MNT1 mannosyltransferase gene family of Saccharomyces cerevisiae currently consists of the KRE2, YUR1, KTR1, KTR2, KTR3 and KTR4 genes. All six encode putative type II membrane proteins with a short cytoplasmic N-terminus, a membrane-spanning region and a highly conserved catalytic lumenal domain. Here we report the identification of the three remaining members of this family in the yeast genome. KTR5 corresponds to an open reading frame (ORF) of the left arm of chromosome XIV, and KTR6 and KTR7 to ORFs on the left arms of chromosomes XVI and IX respectively. The KTR5, KTR6 and KTR7 gene products are highly similar to the Kre2p/Mnt1p family members. Initial functional characterization revealed that some mutant yeast strains containing null copies of these genes displayed cell wall phenotypes. None was K1 killer toxin resistant but ktr6 and ktr7 null mutants were found to be hypersensitive and resistant, respectively, to the drug Calcofluor White.
