Rat embryo fibroblasts (REFs) are inefficiently transformed by the T24-ras oncogene. A contributing factor to cellular resistance to transformation is the limited tolerance to p21-ras oncoprotein expression. Here we present data suggesting that long-term glucocorticoid treatment of ras oncogene-transfected REFs results in increased tolerance to p21-ras oncoproteins, leading to expression of the transformed phenotype. Stably transformed cell lines that expressed high levels of H-ras and could be maintained in the absence of hormone were isolated. In three out of four lines studied, the AP-1-dependent collagenase gene was expressed at a low level. In one of these lines, low collagenase expression was paralleled by lack of c-jun mRNA. Immunochemical analysis revealed that progression to hormone independence was not paralleled by mutations in the p53 gene. We propose that a decreased expression of AP-1-driven genes may result in increased tolerance to p21-ras oncoprotein.
