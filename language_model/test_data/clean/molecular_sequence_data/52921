A gene encoding the mucin-desulfating sulfatase in Prevotella strain RS2 has been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in an active form. A 600-bp PCR product generated using primers designed from amino acid sequence data was used to isolate a 5,058-bp genomic DNA fragment containing the mucin-desulfating sulfatase gene. A 1,551-bp open reading frame encoding the sulfatase proprotein was identified, and the deduced 517-amino-acid protein minus its signal sequence corresponded well with the published mass of 58 kDa estimated by denaturing gel electrophoresis. The sulfatase sequence showed homology to aryl- and nonarylsulfatases with different substrate specificities from the sulfatases of other organisms. No sulfatase activity could be detected when the sulfatase gene was cloned into Escherichia coli expression vectors. However, cloning the gene into a Bacteroides expression vector did produce active sulfatase. This is the first mucin-desulfating sulfatase to be sequenced and expressed. A second open reading frame (1,257 bp) was identified immediately upstream from the sulfatase gene, coding in the opposite direction. Its sequence has close homology to iron-sulfur proteins that posttranslationally modify other sulfatases. By analogy, this protein is predicted to catalyze the modification of a serine group to a formylglycine group at the active center of the mucin-desulfating sulfatase, which is necessary for enzymatic activity.
