We describe here, the identification of a novel HLA-B*07 allele named HLA-B*0726. This allele was found in a Caucasian individual serologically typed as HLA-B7, B35. Novel DNA probe patterns for the HLA-B*07 allele were found using HLA-B specific reverse sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe (SSOP) and sequence-specific primer (SSP) typing. DNA sequencing demonstrated the presence of a new HLA-B*07 sequence variant encoding a single nucleotide substitution from a G to a T at nucleotide 539 in exon 3. This results in an amino acid substitution from arginine to leucine at residue 156 in exon 3.
