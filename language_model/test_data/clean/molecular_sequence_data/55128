The lysosomal membrane protein type 2 is a novel identified lysosomal sorting receptor for Î²-glucocerebrosidase (GC). Mutations in both genes underlie human pathologies causing action myoclonus-renal failure syndrome (AMRF) and Gaucher disease (GD), respectively. We now demonstrate that the lumenal acidification mediated by the vacuolar (H(+) )-ATPase triggers the dissociation of LIMP-2 and GC in late endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Moreover, we identified a single histidine residue in LIMP-2 that is necessary for LIMP-2 and GC binding. This residue is in close proximity to a proposed coiled-coil domain, which determines the binding to GC and may function as a critical pH sensor.
