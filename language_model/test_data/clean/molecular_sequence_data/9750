Basic transcription element binding (BTEB) protein is a newly identified member of the C2H2 zinc finger family that also includes the transcription factors, Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4. This family of proteins binds GC-rich motifs widely distributed in gene promoters, resulting in distinct activation or repression of transcriptional activities. Whereas Sp proteins are ubiquitously expressed, expression of BTEB appears more limited and has not been documented in the female reproductive tract of any mammalian species. This study was designed to identify and characterize the cellular distribution of BTEB in the porcine endometrium and placenta at known stages of pregnancy. Northern analysis of uterine endometrium detected BTEB mRNA that corresponds in size (5 kilobases) to that of the major BTEB transcript in rat brain. The steady-state levels of BTEB mRNA were higher (p < 0.05) in endometrium than placenta at corresponding days of pregnancy, although for each tissue, the levels did not change with pregnancy stage (p > 0.05). Luminal epithelial (LE), glandular epithelial (GE), and stromal (ST) cells isolated from pregnancy endometrium expressed the BTEB gene, but mRNA abundance varied with cell type (LE, GE > ST). Western blot analysis using an antiserum generated against the N-terminal region of a porcine BTEB fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli revealed the presence of BTEB protein only in endometrium, not in placenta. Immunohistochemical studies localized BTEB predominantly to the nuclei of endometrial GE and LE cells. Consistent with the presence of functional BTEB protein, binding to a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing multiple GC motifs was demonstrated in nuclear extracts prepared from endometrium and from endometrial LE and GE, but not ST, cells by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. These results demonstrate the preferential endometrial cell-type expression of BTEB and suggest its regulatory role in pregnancy-associated endometrial epithelial gene expression.
