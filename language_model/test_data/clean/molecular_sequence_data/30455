Plastid DNA (ptDNA) from the unicellular red alga Cyanidium caldarium was isolated. A 5.8 kb Eco RI, fragment containing the entire psbA-gene was cloned and the nucleotide sequence of the psbA-gene determined. At the carboxyl terminus the encoded protein (D1) contains the seven amino acid-insertion which was found to be typical of the cyanobacteria and the cyanelles of Cyanophora paradoxa. However, the overall sequence homology does not support a direct relationship between the plastids of Cyanidium, cyanelles and the cyanobacteria. As in other photosynthetic organisms the psbA-gene is transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA. The ribosomal RNA operon was located 4 kb upstream of the psbA-gene.
