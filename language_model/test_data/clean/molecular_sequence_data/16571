Myosuppressins are a group of 10-residues FMRFamide-related peptides reported in Dictyoptera, Orthoptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera. Myosuppressins inhibit visceral muscle contractions and, in the cockroach Blattella germanica, inhibit food intake. In B. germanica, the cDNA of leucomyosuppressin (LMS) has been cloned and sequenced. The deduced precursor is 96 amino acids long and contains a single copy of LMS. Brain mRNA levels remain constant during the first reproductive cycle of adult females, whereas those in the gut show a slight decline during the time of maximal food intake. Comparison of myosuppressin precursors of different species reveals that all have the same organization. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the precursor experienced an accelerated evolution in Lepidoptera and Diptera with respect to Dictyoptera, whereas only Lepidoptera has radical changes in the bioactive peptide.
