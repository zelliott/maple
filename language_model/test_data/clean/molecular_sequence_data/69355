An in situ hybridization technique using digoxigenin labelling was developed to study B19 infection. By using appropriate DNA probes, transcription of structural and non-structural genes was detected in bone marrow cell cultures. Such a simple system is useful to the study of B19-cell interactions in non-permissive cell lines.
