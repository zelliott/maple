Partial 16S rRNA gene sequences of 16 strains of the genera Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus were determined by direct sequencing of PCR products. Aligned sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analysis by maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony methods. Distance matrix and phylogenetic analysis did not separate the genera unambiguously. Taxonomic grouping of the bacteria closely paralleled taxonomic grouping of their nematode associates and their geographic origins. We found at least two well-supported taxonomic groups in Photorhabdus species, which suggests that the genus Photorhabdus is coevolving with the nematodes and may be polyspecific.
