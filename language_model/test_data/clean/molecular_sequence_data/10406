Smooth muscle cells (SMC) express a battery of cell-restricted differentiation genes, many of which are down-regulated during the course of vascular disease. Here, we present the mRNA expression, genomic structure and chromosomal mapping of the gene encoding human smooth muscle cell calponin (SMCC). Human SMCC transcripts are restricted to tissues and cells of SMC origin and, in the latter case, appear to be uniquely controlled in two distinct human SMC lines of uterine and aortic origin. Restriction mapping. Southern blot and PCR analysis of a 70-kb human bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) revealed a genomic structure (seven exons spanning > 11 kb) very similar to that reported for the mouse SMCC gene. Using a variety of human-rodent somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid mapping panels, the human SMCC gene was mapped to a genomic interval of less than 1.32 Mb in 19p13.2. These results provide new information concerning the regulation of SMCC gene expression and demonstrate the utility of two human SMC lines for the further characterization of this gene's expression control. The identification of a BAC harboring the entire human SMCC locus represents an important reagent for future analysis of SMCC regulatory sequences. Finally, the localization of SMCC to a defined genomic interval will facilitate an analysis of its potential as a candidate gene for disease phenotypes mapping to 19p13.2.
