Our studies of SecM (secretion monitor) in E. coli have revealed that some amino acid sequences can interact with ribosomal interior components, particularly with gate components of the exit tunnel, thereby interfering with their own translation elongation. Such translation arrest can be regulated by interaction of the N-terminal portion of the nascent polypeptide with other cellular components outside the ribosome. These properties of nascent proteins can in turn provide regulatory mechanisms by which the expression of genetic information at different levels is regulated.
