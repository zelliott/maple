1L-myo-inositol (inositol) is vital for the biogenesis of mycothiol, phosphatidylinositol and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors linked to complex carbohydrates in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. All these cellular components are thought to play important roles in host-pathogen interactions and in the survival of the pathogen within the host. However, the inositol biosynthetic pathway in M. tuberculosis is not known. To delineate the pathways for inositol formation, we employed a unique combination of tertiary structure prediction and yeast-based functional assays. Here, we describe the identification of the gene for mycobacterial INO1 that encodes inositol-1-phosphate synthase distinct in many respects from the eukaryotic analogues.
