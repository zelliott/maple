gamma-Tubulin is typically associated with microtubule organising centres, such as the centrosome, and appears to mediate microtubule nucleation. Centrosomes are usually not found in higher plants, but active genes homologous to gamma-tubulin have been identified in the plant kingdom, including the angiosperms Arabidopsis, maize and rice. We have isolated and characterised gamma-tubulin cDNA sequences of two further angiosperm species, barley and tobacco. Sequence comparison revealed a phylogenetic tree with distinct clusters corresponding to the systematic position of the species. Furthermore, domains, thought to be exposed in the folded protein and to be candidates for interaction with associated, nucleation-site related proteins, exhibited motifs highly specific of multicellular plants. Strong expression of the gamma-tubulin genes, as determined by Northern blotting, correlated with mitotic activity. Expression dropped distinctly when mitotic activity ceased. Thus, in post-mitotic tissues that showed intricate reshuffling of cortical microtubule arrays related to cell shaping only very low gamma-tubulin steady-state RNA levels were found, contrasting with the situation for alpha-tubulin. The findings indicate that gamma-tubulin expression in plants may be more tightly linked to mitosis, although there is some gamma-tubulin expression at the RNA level even after mitosis. It follows that the post-mitotic changes in microtubular arrays may be less dependent on concurrent gamma-tubulin RNA expression than mitotic cells.
