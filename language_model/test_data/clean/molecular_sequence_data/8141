An alpha-amylase gene from Streptomyces sp WL6 was cloned on a 3.1kb DNA fragment, which was completely sequenced. The 3088 nucleotide sequence obtained contains three putative coding regions in the same orientation. The one corresponding to the structural region of the alpha-amylase gene has a deduced amino acid sequence of 459 residues, showing up to 71% identity to other alpha-amylases. An incomplete ORF was identified upstream the alpha-amylase gene, and the deduced product presents some homology to proteins involved in catabolic regulation.
