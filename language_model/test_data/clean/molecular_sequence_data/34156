A new, widespread disease was recently observed in soybean in the United States. The disease, named Soybean vein necrosis, is manifested by intraveinal chlorosis and necrosis, and has been found in almost all of the 50 fields visited over a period of 3 years in the midwest and midsouth part of the United States. A virus was isolated from symptomatic material, and detection protocols were developed. More than 150 symptomatic specimens collected from seven US States were tested, and all were found positive for the virus unlike 75 asymptomatic samples, revealing the absolute association between virus and disease. Protein pairwise comparisons coupled with phylogenetic analyses indicate that the virus is a new member of the genus Tospovirus.
