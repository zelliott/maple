In order to define the RNA polymerase I transcriptional apparatus and how it might interact with regulatory signals, the DNA sequences necessary for 40S rRNA transcription in Neurospora crassa were determined. A systematic set of deletion, substitution and insertion mutations were assayed in a homologous in vitro system. The sequences required for transcription of the gene consist of two large domains (I and II) from -113 to -37, and -29 to +4, respectively. Complete deletion of either domain abolished transcription. Upstream sequences confer a small stimulation of transcription. Domain II includes a TATA sequence at -5 which is sensitive to a small (2 bp) substitution and which is conserved among the large rRNA genes of many organisms. Domain I includes a sequence, termed the 'Ribo box', which is also required for transcription of the Neurospora 5S rRNA genes (1), and which occurs in the 5' region of a Neurospora ribosomal protein gene. The 5S and 40S Ribo boxes are shown to be functionally interchangeable.
