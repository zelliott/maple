The line of human colon carcinoma cells known as COLO320-DM contains an amplified and abnormal allele of the proto-oncogene MYC (DMMYC). Exon 1 and most of intron 1 of MYC have been displaced from DMMYC by a rearrangement of DNA. The RNA transcribed from DMMYC is a chimera that begins with an ectopic sequence of 176 nucleotides and then continues with exons 2 and 3 of MYC. The template for the ectopic sequence represents exon 1 of a gene known as PVT, which lies 50 kilobase pairs downstream of MYC. We encountered three abnormal configurations of MYC and PVT in the cell lines analyzed here: (i) amplification of the genes, accompanied by insertion of exon 1 and an undetermined additional portion of PVT within intron 1 of MYC to create DMMYC; (ii) selective deletion of exon 1 of PVT from amplified DNA that contains downstream portions of PVT and an intact allele of MYC; and (iii) coamplification of MYC and exon 1 of PVT, but not of downstream portions of PVT. We conclude that part or all of PVT is frequently amplified with MYC and that intron 1 of PVT represents a preferred boundary for amplification affecting MYC.
