We have constructed a cDNA library from mature egg RNA of the silkmoth, Hyalophora cecropia. Differential screening of the library using cDNA made against mRNAs from the yolky cytoplasm (soluble fraction) and the cortical cytoplasm (cytoskeletal-associated or cortical fraction) resulted in several clones that hybridized to a higher degree to the cDNA from the cytoskeletal-associated fraction. We selected and analyzed the clone giving the strongest signal (designated Ec4b) for its distribution in situ and found that it bound to mRNAs in the nurse cell cytoplasm, in the cortex and in the follicle cells of oocytes. Hybridization of the insert from Ec4b to both detergent-soluble and -insoluble (cortical) RNA on dot blots further supported the observation that the mRNA corresponding to Ec4b was enriched in this cytoskeletal fraction. The mRNA for Ec4b was approximately 500 bases long and the gene seems to be a member of a large multigene family in the H. cecropia genome. Analyses of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences reveal similarity to lepidopteran chorion genes and a lesser but convincing similarity to vertebrate cytokeratins. The filter and in situ hybridization data point to the association of specific messenger RNAs with the cortical cytoskeleton of silkmoth oocytes. Aspects of the structure of the protein encoded by this mRNA suggest that it is a structural component necessary for formation of the cellular blastoderm of the embryo. The association of this maternal mRNA with the cortical cytoskeleton presents the interesting possibility that mRNA bound to the cytoskeleton may be capable of participating in the synthesis of new cytoskeleton or related structures during blastoderm formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
