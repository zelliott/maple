The Bacillus subtilis gpsA gene was cloned by complementation of an Escherichia coli gpsA strain auxotrophic for sn-glycerol 3-phosphate. The gene was sequenced and found to encode an NAD(P)H-dependent dihydroxyacetone phosphate reductase with a deduced molecular mass of 39.5 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence showed strong conservation with that of the E. coli homolog and to other procaryotic and eucaryotic dihydroxyacetone phosphate reductases. The physical location of gpsA on the B. subtilis chromosome was at about 200 degrees. Disruption of the chromosomal gpsA gene yielded B. subtilis strains auxotrophic for glycerol, indicating that the gpsA gene product is responsible for synthesis of the sn-glycerol 3-phosphate required for phospholipid synthesis. We also found that transformation of the classical B. subtilis glycerol auxotrophs with a gpsA-containing genomic fragment yielded transformants that grew in the absence of glycerol. In agreement with prior work, our attempts to determine the reductase activity in B. subtilis extracts were unsuccessful. However, expression of the B. subtilis gpsA gene in E. coli gave reductase activity that was only slightly inhibited by sn-glycerol 3-phosphate. Since the E. coli GpsA dihydroxyacetone phosphate reductase is very sensitive to allosteric inhibition by sn-glycerol 3-phosphate, these results indicate that the B. subtilis gpsA-encoded reductase differs from that of E. coli. It seems that B. subtilis regulates sn-glycerol 3-phosphate synthesis at the level of gene expression rather than through the E. coli mechanism of strong allosteric inhibition of an enzyme produced in excess.
