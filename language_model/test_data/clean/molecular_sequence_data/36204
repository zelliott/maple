We have studied the 5' upstream sequences required for the transcriptional regulation of the hamster gene encoding the intermediate filament protein, vimentin. Although vimentin is regarded as the intermediate filament protein of mesothelial tissue, it is also produced in most cultured cells. The human mammary carcinoma cell line, MCF-7, belongs to the exceptions. It contains no vimentin, and the complete upstream promoter region is inactive in this particular cell line. By using transient transfection of chimeric constructs into MCF-7 and HeLa cells, and subsequent chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays, we were able to show the presence of two negative control regions flanking a double AP-1 enhancer element. Our data indicate that these elements exert their effect irrespective of orientation and position, suggesting that they are silencers. In vitro footprinting assays, gel mobility assays and Southwestern (protein-DNA) blotting revealed the presence of trans-acting factors interacting with both silencer elements. The silencing effect was particularly pronounced in MCF-7 cells, although DNA-binding proteins are present in HeLa cells as well.
