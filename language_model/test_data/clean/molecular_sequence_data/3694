Plant steroid hormones, brassinosteroids (BRs), are perceived by a cell surface receptor kinase, BRI1, but how BR binding leads to regulation of gene expression in the nucleus is unknown. Here we describe the identification of BZR1 as a nuclear component of the BR signal transduction pathway. A dominant mutation bzr1-1D suppresses BR-deficient and BR-insensitive (bri1) phenotypes and enhances feedback inhibition of BR biosynthesis. BZR1 protein accumulates in the nucleus of elongating cells of dark-grown hypocotyls and is stabilized by BR signaling and the bzr1-1D mutation. Our results demonstrate that BZR1 is a positive regulator of the BR signaling pathway that mediates both downstream BR responses and feedback regulation of BR biosynthesis.
