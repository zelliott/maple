Previous studies have shown that the cellobiohydrolases of the white rot basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium are encoded by a family of structurally related genes. In this investigation, we identified and sequenced the most highly transcribed gene, cbh1-4. Evidence suggests that in this fungus the dominant isozyme, CBH1, is encoded by chb1-4.
