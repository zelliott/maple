Two analogs of the peptide mimicking the 1977-1991 C- terminal part of fibronectin have been synthesized and tested. AWLI simulated human fibronectin fragment 1977-1991, whereas AWLII hybridized to both RGD and 1977-1991 fragments. AWLI and AWLII peptides inhibited the migration of the ovarian carcinoma cell line OVP10 regardless of the presence RGD. AWLI peptide inhibited spontaneous and fibronectin-activated cell migration and ERK1/2 activity. Neither AWLI nor fibronectin induced changes in FAK proteins, as could be judged from Western blots. In conclusion, it seems that the C-terminal fragment of fibronectin inhibits ERK1/2-dependent (random) migration of ovarian carcinoma cells.
