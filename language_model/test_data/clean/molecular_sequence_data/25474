The 65-kDa protein of the intracellular pathogen M. leprae is prominent in the immune response to this mycobacterium, and individual T cell epitopes from this protein sequence have been defined. We have tested the stimulatory activity of extended analogs of the minimal peptide representing one such epitope, LQAAPALDKL, with a variety of tetrapeptide extensions added to enhance or destabilize alpha helix formation. The conformational potential of the peptides was measured by circular dichroism using aqueous trifluoroethanol as a secondary structure inducer. Although analogs with high helical potential activated T cells at low concentrations, a less helical variant was similarly potent. Activity also did not correlate with predicted overall alpha helical amphipathicity. One analog was found which stimulated T cell proliferation in the 50 pM range. The effect of tetrapeptide extensions on epitope activity is not consistent with the importance in activity of only a single stable secondary structure such as an alpha helix.
