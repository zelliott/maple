As part of a project involving large-scale sequencing of clones randomly selected from a human cDNA library, we isolated a novel human gene, termed TM7SF3 (transmembrane 7 superfamily member 3). Its open reading frame encodes a 570 amino acid protein containing seven putative transmembrane domains. The transcript of this gene was expressed in all human tissues examined, but most abundantlyin kidney. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated subcellular localization of TM7SF3 protein at the plasma membrane. We determined the chromosome location of TM7SF3 as 12q11.2-->q12 by a combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid mapping.
