Full-length cDNA sequences encoding human N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulphatase were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells under the transcriptional control of the human polypeptide chain elongation factor 1 alpha gene promoter. A clonal cell line overexpressing recombinant N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulphatase to a level of approx. 3 mg/l of culture medium was isolated. The secreted precursor enzyme was purified to homogeneity by a two-column procedure with an overall yield of 53% of the activity. The physical and catalytic parameters of the recombinant enzyme were similar to those of the mature form isolated from liver. On SDS/PAGE and gel filtration, recombinant N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulphatase had a native molecular mass of 58-60 kDa. Recombinant N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulphatase was endocytosed by mucopolysaccharidosis IVA fibroblasts via the mannose-6-phosphate receptor-mediated pathway and was efficiently localized to lysosomes.
