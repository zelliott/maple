A 26-kDa protein (OMP26) isolated and purified from nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) strain 289 has been shown to enhance clearance of infection following pulmonary challenge with NTHI in rats. DNA sequence analysis revealed that it was 99% identical to a gene encoding a cell envelope protein of the H. influenzae Rd strain (TIGR accession no. HI0916). The deduced amino acid sequence revealed a hydrophilic polypeptide rich in basic amino acids. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis suggested that the OMP26 gene was relatively conserved among isolates of NTHI. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the OMP26 gene from 20 different isolates showed that similarity with NTHI-289 ranged from 96.5% (1 isolate) to 99.5% (14 isolates). Two recombinant forms of OMP26, a full length 28-kDa protein (equivalent to preprotein) and a 26-kDa protein lacking a 23-amino-acid leader peptide (equivalent to processed protein), were assessed in immunization studies for the ability to induce an immune response that would be as effective as the native protein in enhancing the clearance of NTHI following pulmonary challenge in rats. Immunization with the recombinant protein that included the leader peptide was more effective in enhancing pulmonary clearance, and it induced a better cell-mediated response and higher titers of systemic and mucosal antibody. This study has characterized a 26-kDa protein from NTHI that shows significant potential as a vaccine candidate.
