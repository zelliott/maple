The structure and structural dynamics of chromatin and nucleosomes in transcription and replication were studied by DNA-protein crosslinking. A general strategy has been designed and a number of methods have been developed to map proteins bound to the genomic DNA, to sequence the arrangement of such proteins along DNA in multi-protein complexes, and to identify interacting nucleotides and amino acid residues. Perspectives for large-scale mapping of proteins associated with genomic DNA are discussed.
