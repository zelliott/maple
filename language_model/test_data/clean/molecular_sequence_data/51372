Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase F (PNGase F) and endo-beta-N-acetyl glucosaminidase F (Endo F) activities were monitored during cultivation of Flavobacterium meningosepticum using a new fluorescence-HPLC procedure based on a commercially available substrate. The PNGase F activity reached a maximum level at the end of the log phase and remained constant during the stationary phase, while Endo F continuously increased until late stationary phase. PNGase F obtained at the end of the log phase was less contaminated by other proteins compared with late stationary phase.
