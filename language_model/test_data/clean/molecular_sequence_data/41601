Paraconiothyrium cyclothyrioides is a recently described coelomycetous fungal species. We present a case in a renal transplant patient with chronic skin lesions of the lower extremities caused by P. cyclothyrioides. Treatment with posaconazole led to complete resolution of the lesions. P. cyclothyrioides should be considered an opportunistic human pathogen in immunocompromised patients.
