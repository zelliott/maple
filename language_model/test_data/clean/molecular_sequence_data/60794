Illegitimate recombination is the prevailing molecular mechanism for the integration of recombinant DNA into the genome of most eukaryotic systems and the generation of deletions by intrachromosomal recombination. We developed a ?selectable marker system to screen for intrachromosomal illegitimate recombination events in order to assess the sequence and structure-specific requirements for illegitimate recombination in tobacco. In 12 illegitimate recombination products analysed, we found that all deletion termini localise to sites of palindromic structures or to A+T-rich DNA elements. All deletion termini showed microhomologies of two to six nucleotides. In three plants, the recombination products contained filler-DNA or an inversion of an endogenous segment. Our data strongly suggest that illegitimate recombination in plants is mediated by a DNA synthesis-dependent process, and that this mechanism is promoted by DNA regions that can form palindromic structures or facilitate DNA unwinding.
