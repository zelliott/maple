Interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) of poly(acrylamide-co-ethylene glycol/acrylic acid) (p(AAm-co-EG/AAc) applied to model surfaces prevent protein adsorption and cell adhesion. Subsequently, IPN surfaces functionalized with the RGD cell-binding domain from rat bone sialoprotein (BSP) modulated bone cell adhesion, proliferation, and matrix mineralization. The objective of this study was to utilize the same biomimetic modification strategy to produce functionally similar p(AAm-co-EG/AAc) IPNs on clinically relevant titanium surfaces. Contact angle goniometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were consistent with the presence of the intended surface modifications. Cellular response was gauged by challenging the surfaces with primary rat calvarial osteoblast (RCO) surfaces in serum-containing media. IPN modified titanium and negative control (RGE-IPN) surfaces inhibit cell adhesion and proliferation, while RGD-modified IPNs on titanium supported osteoblast attachment and spreading. Furthermore, the latter surfaces supported significant mineralization despite exhibiting lower levels of proliferation than positive control surfaces. These results suggest that with the appropriate optimization, this approach may be practical for surface engineering of osseous implants.
