Eleven different missense and one nonsense mutant-type p53 cDNAs, which have been frequently detected in human colorectal carcinomas, were constructed and examined for their ability to cooperate with activated human H-ras genes, pSK2 and pHs49, in transfection of rat embryo fibroblasts (REF). Each missense mutant-type p53 cDNA with either of the two activated H-ras genes transformed REF with a different frequency of transformation depending on the different kind of mutation, whereas wild-type p53 (with ras), nonsense mutant-type p53 (with ras), as well as mutant-type p53 (alone) and ras (alone), did not transform REF. Six transformed REF cell lines were established from cotransfection with missense mutant-type p53 cDNA and ras gene; all of them exhibiting exogenous human p53 DNA, RNA, protein, and H-ras DNA and RNA. All six transformed cell lines showed both tumorigenicity and lung metastatic potential in nude mice. They also exhibited 92 kilodalton gelatinase activity, which was not detected in parental REF. These results suggest that missense mutations in p53 gene have a role in malignant transformation as well as metastatic potential.
