Examination was made of the effect of annexin V on Ca2+ movement into large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) using fura-2, a calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye. To avoid the possible difficulties relating to the addition of annexin V and/or Ca2+ in fura-2-loaded LUV, the burst method was used. LUV, preincubated with rat annexin V in the presence of Ca2+, were collected by centrifugation and resuspended, and then burst with Triton X-100 in the presence of fura-2. Inward Ca2+ movement across the artificial lipid membrane was measured by determination of fura-2 fluorescence due to the leaked Ca2+ from ruptured LUV. The observed Ca2+ signal increased dependent on annexin V and Ca2+ concentrations, whereas bovine serum albumin did not affect this signal up to 1 microM. Thus, annexin V shows Ca2+ channel activity in LUV. K201, a novel 1,4-benzothiazepine, inhibited inward Ca2+ movement into LUV caused by annexin V in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of 50 nM annexin V and 400 microM Ca2+, 3 microM K201 showed significant inhibition of Ca2+ movement due to annexin V, and 50% inhibition was achieved at 25 microM K201. On the other hand, diltiazem had no such effect even at 30 microM. K201 is thus shown to have inhibitory activity on inward Ca2+ movement due to annexin V in artificial vesicles and may prove useful as a probe for elucidating the functions of annexin V in vivo.
