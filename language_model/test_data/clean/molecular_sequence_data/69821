In conclusion, using concatenated AhRE sequences and the recognition site probe methodology, we have cloned the murine Hmg1 cDNA and determined an additional 141 bp of 5' noncoding sequence (GenBank Accession No. S50213; entry name MUSHMG1A). The gene product represents an HMG-box transcription factor that recognizes DNA shape- and sequence-specific elements; this is perhaps the reason that this cDNA was isolated with concatomeric oligonucleotides. We have mapped the Hmg1 gene to mouse Chr 2, between regions homologous with human Chr 2q and 11p11-q12.
