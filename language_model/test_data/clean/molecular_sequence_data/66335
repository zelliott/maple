The diversity and abundance of glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GH5) were studied in the North Atlantic Ocean. This family was chosen because of the large number of available sequences from cultured bacteria, the variety of substrates it targets, and the high number of similar sequences in the Sargasso Sea environmental genome database. Three clone libraries of a GH5 subcluster were constructed from the Mid-Atlantic Bight and the eastern and western North Atlantic Ocean. The two North Atlantic Ocean libraries did not differ from each other but both were significantly less diverse than the Mid-Atlantic Bight library. The abundance of GH5 genes estimated by quantitative PCR was positively correlated with chlorophyll concentrations in the eastern part of a transect from Fort Pierce, Florida, to the Azores and in a depth profile, suggesting that the supply of labile organic material selects for GH5-bearing bacteria in these waters. However, the data suggest that only <1% of all bacteria harbor the GH5 subcluster. These and other data suggest that the hydrolysis of polysaccharides requires complicated multi-enzyme systems.
