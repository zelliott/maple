Identification of genes selectively expressed in tumors or individual tissues is a crucial prerequisite for molecular diagnosis and treatment of cancer by addressing molecular targets. By screening an expression database, we identified the novel gene D-PCa-2 (Dresden prostate carcinoma 2), which is highly overexpressed in normal prostate tissue and prostate carcinoma (PCa). The corresponding transcript contained an open reading frame of 453 nucleotides encoding a putative protein of 150 amino acids. A large part of exon 8 of the D-PCa-2 gene shows strong similarity to the high-mobility-group nucleosomal binding protein 2 (HMGN2) cDNA. The highly specific transcription of the D-PCa-2 gene in normal and malignant prostate tissues and in a few additional tumors was demonstrated by using multiple tissue dot blot, cancer profiling dot blot and real-time PCR analyses. Examination of 18 pairs of tumorous and nontumorous prostate tissues from PCa patients by quantitative RT-PCR revealed D-PCa-2 transcripts in all specimens. The potential usefulness of D-PCa-2 as a sensitive marker for metastatic prostate carcinoma cells in lymph nodes was demonstrated by the detection of one LNCaP cell in 1 x 10(5) normal lymph node cells using real-time RT-PCR. Examination of 22 lymph nodes from PCa patients either containing metastatic prostate cancer cells or diagnosed as cancer-free was in full concordance with histopathologic diagnoses. These results validate D-PCa-2 as a transcript with high tissue specificity and with a potential application in the diagnosis of PCa.
