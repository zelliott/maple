A simple and reliable high-performance liquid chromatographic method with diode array detection has been developed and validated for the determination of insulin in human plasma. A good chromatographic separation was achieved on a C18 column with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 0.2M sodium sulfate (pH 2.4), 25:75 (v/v). Its flow rate was 1.2 mL/min. Calibration curve was linear within the concentration range of 0.15-25 µg/mL. Intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviations for insulin in human plasma were less than 6.3 and 8.5%, respectively. The limits of detection and quantification of insulin were 0.10 and 0.15 µg/mL, respectively. Also, this assay was applied to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of insulin in eight insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients after subcutaneous injection of 25 IU of Actrapid HM.
