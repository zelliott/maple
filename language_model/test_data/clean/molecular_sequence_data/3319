A wheat-infecting furovirus found in Tompkins County, New York, U.S.A. was identified as a strain of Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV) by means of sequence analyses of portions of its RNA 1 and 2. The nucleotide sequences of several of its genes differed by c. 9 to 12% from those of the corresponding genome regions of the Nebraska type strain of SBWMV. The deduced amino acid sequences of the putative translation products, however, suggested much closer relationships. Thus, the amino acid sequences of the coat proteins of the two virus strains were 100% identical despite the fact that their coding regions differed in as many as 68 nucleotide positions. The New York (NY) strain of SBWMV is possibly closely related to an isolate from Illinois for which so far only the nucleotide sequences of its coat protein gene and the 5' untranslated region of its RNA 2 are known.
