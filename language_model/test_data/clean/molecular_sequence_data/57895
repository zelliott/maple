Six pockets, designated A through F, which extend from the peptide binding site of class I HLA molecules, have been postulated to play an important role in determining peptide binding specificity. HLA-B27 mutant molecules with single amino acid substitutions at residues 9his-->phe, 24thr-->ser, 45glu-->thr, and 67cys-->ala in pocket B; 114his-->asn in pocket D; and 116asp-->phe in pocket F have been generated and characterized for their capacity to present an influenza A nucleoprotein peptide (NP 383-391) for cytotoxic T lymphocyte recognition. We report here that substitutions in residues 45, 67, and 116 affect presentation of NP 383-391 when peptide is processed and loaded during viral infection. Using 125I-labeled NP peptide, we demonstrate that substitutions in residues 67 and 116 alter the stability of NP-HLA-B27 complexes. A substitution at position 9 of the NP peptide complements the mutation introduced at residue 116, suggesting that the NP peptide binds with its carboxy terminal amino acid in pocket F. These findings indicate that polymorphic residues within pockets B and F of HLA-B27 play a crucial role in peptide binding and stability of peptide-MHC class I complexes. Furthermore, our results suggest that substitutions at allele-specific residues within pockets B and F alter the stability of NP-HLA-B27 complexes resulting in the diminution or abrogation of NP presentation during viral infection.
