Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolates derived from an outbreak of gastroenteritis in the Republic of Maldives did not have the genetic potential to produce the thermostable direct hemolysin, but one such isolate produced a hemolysin immunologically related to the thermostable direct hemolysin (T. Honda, Y. Ni, and T. Miwatani, Infect. Immun. 56:61-965, 1988). The Maldives isolates hybridized with the DNA probe for the gene encoding the thermostable direct hemolysin (the tdh gene) under reduced stringencies. A DNA fragment containing the probe-reactive nucleotide sequence was isolated from a selected strain and cloned into pBR322 in Escherichia coli. A clone producing the thermostable direct hemolysin-related hemolysin was obtained by screening with hemolysis assays and by an immunological assay. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned DNA fragment revealed that the gene encoding the thermostable direct hemolysin-related hemolysin (the trh gene), like the tdh gene, encoded the hemolysin subunit composed of 189 amino acid residues. The trh gene had significant nucleotide sequence homology with the tdh gene (68.4% with the tdh1 gene copy and 68.6% with the tdh2 gene copy). The amino acid sequences of the hemolysin subunits deduced from the nucleotide sequences of the trh gene and tdh gene were homologous (61.9% homology with the tdh1-encoded subunit and 63.0% homology with the tdh2-encoded subunit) and contained the two cysteine residues to form an intrachain bond at the same positions, and their possible conformations appeared to be similar as determined by hydrophobicity-hydrophilicity analysis and a secondary structure prediction. The trh and tdh genes may have had a common ancestor and may have evolved by single-base changes so that they maintained the fundamental architecture of the molecules.
