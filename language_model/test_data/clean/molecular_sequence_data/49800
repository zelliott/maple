Prostaglandins (PGs) act locally to maintain cellular homeostasis and stimulate stress response signaling pathways. These cellular effects are diverse and are tissue-dependent. PGE(2), and the synthetic analogue, 11-deoxy,16,16-dimethyl PGE(2) (DDM-PGE(2)), protect renal proximal tubular epithelial (LLC-PK1) cells against cellular injury induced by the potent nephrotoxic and nephrocarcinogenic metabolite of hydroquinone, 2,3,5-tris-(glutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone. Although this cytoprotective response (in LLC-PK1 cells) is mediated through a thromboxane or thromboxane-like receptor coupled to AP-1 signaling pathways, the mechanism of cytoprotection is unknown. In this study, we utilized HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometric (ESI MS/MS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric (MALDI TOF) analysis of proteins isolated from DDM-PGE(2)-stimulated LLC-PK1 cells to identify candidate cytoprotective proteins. DDM-PGE(2) selectively stimulated the synthesis of several proteins in LLC-PK1 cells. Peptide sequencing by ESI-MS/MS of in-gel tryptic protein digests revealed the identity of eight proteins: endothelial actin binding protein, myosin, elongation factor 2 (EF-2), elongation factor 1alpha-1 (EF-1alpha), heat shock protein 90beta (HSP90beta), glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP 78), membrane-organizing extension spike protein, and actin. Both ESI-MS/MS and MALDI-MS analysis resulted in the same protein identification. Western analysis confirmed the temporal induction of the majority of these proteins, including EF-2, EF-1alpha, HSP90beta, GRP78, and actin. The collective expression of these proteins suggests that DDM-PGE(2)-mediated cytoprotection may involve alterations in cytoskeletal organization and/or stimulation of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. The present studies provide insights into potential downstream targets of PG signaling.
