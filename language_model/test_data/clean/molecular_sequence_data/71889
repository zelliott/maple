The type 2 capsule locus of Streptococcus pneumoniae was characterized in Avery's strain D39, which is the parent strain of the standard transformation recipients currently used in pneumococcal research and is largely used as a virulent strain in studies on the pathogenesis of pneumococcal infections. The capsule locus was sequenced by using a 21.7-kb PCR fragment from the D39 genome as a template. Sequence data analysis showed the presence of 18 open reading frames, 17 of which have the same direction of transcription and all of which are potentially involved in capsule biosynthesis. It was also shown that R36A and R6, which are unencapsulated (rough) derivatives of D39, carry a 7,504-bp deletion involving nine capsule genes.
