The degradation of a prototypical small analogue of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) has been studied using HPLC and mass spectrometric techniques. These studies revealed that removal of the N-terminal amino acid was the primary catabolic event in vitro. Based on this information the N-terminus was remanufactured to provide a family of more stable analogues. Additional stabilization was provided through modification of the C-terminal tripeptide. Through dramatically more stable in vitro, these new analogues do not appear to have longer in vivo half-lives.
