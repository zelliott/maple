The ADAM family of transmembrane metalloproteinases has important functions in fertilization, development and disease, and is widely distributed throughout the Metazoa. In this study, we identified a novel ADAM protein in Xenopus tropicalis (X. tropicalis) with closest overall sequence similarity to the Xenopus ADAM10 protein. Based on comparisons of available sequence information, putative orthologs of this ADAM (which we designate ADAM41) are identified in several other vertebrate species including non-placental mammals, but absent from placental mammals and aves. ADAM41 mRNA is maternally deposited in X. tropicalis with subsequent zygotic expression detected in the neural plate at neurula stages. Antisense morpholino knockdown of ADAM41 results in a delay in early neuronal marker expression, which can be rescued by a non-targeted ADAM41 transcript. Thus, ADAM41 is likely required for maintaining proper timing of neurogenesis in X. tropicalis.
