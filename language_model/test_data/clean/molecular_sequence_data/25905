Polyclonal antibodies were raised by the repeated injection of rabbits with a synthetic peptide corresponding to a highly selective portion (amino acid residues 243 to 268) of the amino acid sequence of the rat 5-HT1A receptor. The anti-peptide antiserum allowed the immunoprecipitation of 5-HT1A receptors but not of other 5-HT1 sites solubilized from rat hippocampal membranes. Immunoautoradiographic labelling of rat brain sections with the anti-peptide antiserum was superimposed with the autoradiographic distribution of 5-HT1A sites labelled by the selective radioligand [3H]8-OH-DPAT.
