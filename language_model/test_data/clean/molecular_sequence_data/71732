An L-N-carbamoyl amino acid amidohydrolase (L-N-carbamoylase) from Arthrobacter aurescens DSM 3747 was cloned in E. coli and the nucleotide sequence was determined. After expression of the gene in E. coli the enzyme was purified to homogeneity and characterized. The enzyme was shown to be strictly L-specific and exhibited the highest activity in the hydrolysis of beta-aryl substituted N alpha-carbamoyl-alanines as e.g. N-carbamoyl-tryptophan. Carbamoyl derivatives of beta-alanine and charged aliphatic amino acids were not accepted as substrates. The N-carbamoylase of A. aurescens DSM 3747 differs from all known enzymes with respect to its substrate specificity although amino acid sequence identity scores of 35-38% to other N-carbamoylases have been detected. The enzyme consists of two subunits of 44,000 Da, and has an isoelectric point of 4.3. The optima of temperature and pH were determined to be 50 degrees C and pH 8.5 respectively. At 37 degrees C the enzyme was completely stable for several days.
