To understand the molecular mechanism of ovule development, a MADS box gene, HoMADS 1 , has been isolated from the ovule tissues of Hyacinthus . Sequence comparison showed that HoMADS 1 is highly homologous to both class C and D genes. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis suggests that HoMADS 1 is most likely a class D MADS box gene. RNA hybridization revealed that HoMADS 1 was exclusively expressed in the ovules. Over-expressing HoMADS 1 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants produced ectopic carpelloid structures, including ovules, indicating that HoMADS 1 is involved in the determination of carpel and ovule identities. Interestingly, during in vitro flowering, no HoMADS 1 mRNA was detected in the floral tissues at high level hormones in the media. However, HoMADS 1 mRNA accumulated in the floral tissues when the regenerated flowers were transferred to the media containing low level hormones which could induce in vitro ovule formation. Our data suggest that the induction of HoMADS 1 by plant hormones may play important roles during ovule initiation and development in the regenerated flower. Whether HoMADS 1 expression is also regulated by cytokinin and auxin during ovule development in planta remains to be investigated.
