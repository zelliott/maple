A UGA suppressor derived from a glutamine tRNA gene of Escherichia coli K12 was isolated and characterized. Phages carrying the suppressor su+2UGA could be obtained only from a hybrid transducing phage, h80cI857psu+2oc, but not from the original transducing phage lambda cI857psu+2oc. By DNA sequence analysis, it was found that the su+2 UGA suppressor obtained has two mutations; one is in the anticodon (TTA----TCA), as expected, and the other (C----T) is at the 7th position from the 3' end of tRNA(2Gln). The significance of these mutations and the lethal effect on phage lambda of the increased amounts of UGA suppressor tRNAs are discussed.
