In order to better understand the relationship between dopamine and the release of diapause hormone into the blood, we cloned and characterized cDNAs encoding Bombyx mori dopamine receptor-1 and -2 (BmDopR1 and 2) from the pupal brain-suboesophageal ganglion. BmDopR1 and 2 had high similarities to group 1 (Drosophila melanogaster DOP1 and Apis mellifera DOP1) and group 2 (D. melanogaster DopR99B, A. mellifera DOP2 and Papilio xuthus DOP1), respectively. When BmDopR1 and 2 were expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, they responded to dopamine by increasing intracellular cAMP levels, thus indicating the presence of D1-like receptors. There were no clear differences in BmDopR1 and 2 mRNA levels between brain-suboesophageal ganglion complexes of diapause and nondiapause egg producers during pupal-adult development. BmDopR1 and 2 mRNAs were concentrated in the mushroom body calyx rather than in the suboesophageal ganglion. Taking into account the results of earlier experiments on excised regions corresponding to mushroom bodies, BmDopR1 and 2 in the mushroom body apparently play a role in the release of diapause hormone.
