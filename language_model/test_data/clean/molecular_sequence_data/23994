The presence and distribution of agouti-related protein (AgRP) immunoreactivity were investigated in the hypothalamus and adrenal gland of the duck using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Expression of AgRP mRNA was also studied using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A partial coding sequence (cds) of the duck AgRP gene was identified. Western blot analysis showed the presence of an AgRP-like peptide having a molecular weight consistent with the number of predicted amino acids of the avian AgRP. In the hypothalamus, AgRP immunoreactivity was found in neurons of the nucleus infundibularis and in fibers projecting to the median eminence. In the adrenals, AgRP immunoreactivity was observed in medullary cells. These findings suggest that in the duck, AgRP may play a role in regulating energy homeostasis and adrenal endocrine functions.
