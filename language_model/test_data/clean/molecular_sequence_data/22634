The effect of Mg2+ on the binding of the Streptococcus pneumoniae single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) proteins, SsbA and SsbB, to various dT(n) oligomers was examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The results were then compared with those that were obtained with the well characterized SSB protein from Escherichia coli, SsbEc. In the absence of Mg2+, the results indicated that the SsbEc protein was able to bind to the dT(n) oligomers in the SSB(35) mode, with only two of the four subunits of the tetramer interacting with the dT(n) oligomers. In the presence of Mg2+, however, the results indicated that the SsbEc protein was bound to the dT(n) oligomers in the SSB(65) mode, with all four subunits of the tetramer interacting with the dT(n) oligomers. The SsbA protein behaved similarly to the SsbEc protein under all conditions, indicating that it undergoes Mg2+ -dependent changes in its DNA binding modes that are analogous to those of the SsbEc protein. The SsbB protein, in contrast, appeared to bind to the dT(n) oligomers in an SSB(65)-like mode in either the presence or the absence of Mg2+, suggesting that it may not exhibit the pronounced negative intrasubunit cooperativity in the absence of Mg2+ that is required for the formation of the SSB(35) mode. Additional experiments with a chimeric SsbA/B protein indicated that the structural determinants that govern the transitions between the different DNA binding modes may be contained within the N-terminal domains of the SSB proteins.
