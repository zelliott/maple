Neuraminidases (sialidases) have an essential role in the removal of terminal sialic acid residues from sialoglycoconjugates and are distributed widely in nature. The human lysosomal enzyme occurs in complex with beta-galactosidase and protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA), and is deficient in two genetic disorders: sialidosis, caused by a structural defect in the neuraminidase gene, and galactosialidosis, in which the loss of neuraminidase activity is secondary to a deficiency of PPCA. We identified a full-length cDNA clone in the dbEST data base, of which the predicted amino acid sequence has extensive homology to other mammalian and bacterial neuraminidases, including the F(Y)RIP domain and "Asp-boxes." In situ hybridization localized the human neuraminidase gene to chromosome band 6p21, a region known to contain the HLA locus. Transient expression of the cDNA in deficient human fibroblasts showed that the enzyme is compartmentalized in lysosomes and restored neuraminidase activity in a PPCA-dependent manner. The authenticity of the cDNA was verified by the identification of three independent mutations in the open reading frame of the mRNA from clinically distinct sialidosis patients. Coexpression of the mutant cDNAs with PPCA failed to generate neuraminidase activity, confirming the inactivating effect of the mutations. These results establish the molecular basis of sialidosis in these patients, and clearly identify the cDNA-encoded protein as lysosomal neuraminidase.
