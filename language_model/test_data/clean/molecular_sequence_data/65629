We have developed a molecular method using PCR-direct sequencing to identify the infective 3rd juvenile stage of Angiostrongylus cantonensis, a nematode parasite of rodents that can accidentally infect humans and cause eosinophilic meningitis. We demonstrate that the 5' end of the small subunit (SSU) ribosomal (r) RNA gene is a suitable marker to identify A. cantonensis and distinguish it from other closely related Angiostrongylus species. When the SSU rRNA marker was employed on nematode populations extracted from the black slug Laevicaulis altae collected in 2 test sites in the Philippines, the infective 3rd juvenile stage A. cantonensis was detected without difficulty. The phylogenetic position of other non-angiostrongylid nematodes isolated was also determined. The molecular technique developed in this study provides a rapid and accurate method for the identification of A. cantonensis when morphological identification proves difficult or inadequate.
