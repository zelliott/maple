Branched polylactosamines on animal cell surfaces are believed to contribute to multivalent interactions in cell adhesion and cell signalling. Their biosynthesis proceeds via linear precursors that become branched by beta1,6-GlcNAc transferases (IGnT6, GlcNAc to Gal). Previous work has identified the tetrasaccharide Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc (1) and the hexasaccharide Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta1- 3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc (4) as acceptors for a rat serum enzyme activity (cIGnT6), which transfers GlcNAcbeta1-6 units to the midchain galactose residues. Thereby, 1 is converted to the branched pentasaccharide Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta1-3(GlcNAcbeta1-6)Galbeta1-4 GlcNAc and 4 to the doubly branched octasaccharide Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta1-3(GlcNAcbeta1-6)Galbeta1-+ ++4GlcNAcbeta1-3(GlcNAcb eta1-6)Galbeta1-4GlcNAc [Lepp√§nen, A., Salminen, H., Zhu, Y., Maaheimo, H., Helin, J., Costello, C. E., & Renkonen, O. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 7026-7036]. Here we report that neither the alpha1, 3-fucose-containing derivatives of 1 [Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta1-3Galbeta1-4(Fucalpha1-3)G lcNAc and Galbeta1-4(Fucalpha1-3)GlcNAcbeta1-3Galbeta1-4Gl cNAc] nor a similar derivative of 4 [Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta1-3Galbeta1-4(Fucalpha1-3)+ ++GlcNAcbeta1-3Galbeta1- 4GlcNAc] were acceptors for the rat serum cIGnT6 activity. Hence, the enzyme's branch-forming action was completely prevented at sites in the immediate neighborhood of the fucosylated loci of the polylactosamines. In Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta1- 3Galbeta1-4(Fucalpha1-3) GlcNAc, the inhibition of the branch-forming reaction was restricted to the fucose-carrying LacNAc unit; at the middle LacNAc, the branching proceeded normally. However, in the isomeric Galbeta1-4(Fucalpha1-3)GlcNAcbeta1-3Galbeta1- 4GlcNAcbeta1-3Galbeta1-4 GlcNAc, the fucose residue prevented branching completely at the middle LacNAc and almost completely at the reducing end LacNAc. In summary, alpha1,3-fucose residues in polylactosamine chains inhibited the cIGnT6 reaction in a site-specific manner, at the fucosylated LacNAc unit itself and also at sites one and two LacNAc units upstream, but not at the LacNAc units downstream from the fucosylated locus. These data imply that site-directed branching in polylactosamines is possible in vitro with the aid of specifically positioned alpha1,3-fucosyl units, that can be removed afterward without harming the branched backbones.
