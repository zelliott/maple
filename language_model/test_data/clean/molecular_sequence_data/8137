The tritium-labeled bis-norleucine analog of Helicoverpa zea pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide ([3H]NLPBAN) was incubated in vitro with hemolymph from Manduca sexta or H. zea adult females. The incubations resulted in the formation of several tritium-labeled degradation products. At a [3H]NLPBAN concentration of 0.9 microM the degradation proceeded at a very slow but physiologically plausible rate (2-10 fmol/min/microliters hemolymph). The primary [3H]NLPBAN degradation reaction in M. sexta hemolymph was not inhibited by 20 microM leupeptin, 0.1 mM amastatin, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM 1,10-phenanthroline, or 2 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; but secondary reactions may have been affected, as some of the inhibitors changed the radio-HPLC profile of the degradation products. It is concluded that hemolymph of M. sexta and H. zea contains peptidase(s) capable of inactivating circulating PBAN.
