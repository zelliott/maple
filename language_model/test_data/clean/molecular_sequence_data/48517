The gene mutation for oral-facial digital syndrome type II (Mohr syndrome) is unknown. We describe a Saudi female infant with Mohr syndrome. An unclassified variant: c.2044 A>G, p.T682A in exon 12 of the GLI3 gene in a heterozygous state was identified in the infant. Mutation Taster (http://www.mutationtaster.org) considers this variant as "disease causing". However, when the unaffected parents were tested, the father was found to have the same variant, also in a heterozygous state. Hence, the pathogenic role of this variant seems unlikely; although apparent non-penetrance remains a possibility.
