Four triterpenoid saponins were isolated from Anemone hupehensis. On the basis of chemical and spectroscopic evidence, two new saponins, hupehensis saponins D and E, were elucidated as 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl (1-->3)-beta-D-ribopyranosyl (1-->3)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1-->2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl oleanolic acid-28-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1-->4)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl (1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside and 3-O-beta-D-glucopyransoyl (1-->3-beta-D-ribopyranosyl (1-->3)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1-->2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl hederagenin-28-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1-->4)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl (1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside. The two known saponins were identified as huzhangosides B and D.
