Prostaglandin G/H synthase (8,11,14-icosatrienoate, hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.14.99.1) catalyzes the first step in the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin endoperoxides G and H. This enzyme is the site of action of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We have isolated a 2.7-kilobase complementary DNA (cDNA) encompassing the entire coding region of prostaglandin G/H synthase from sheep vesicular glands. This cDNA, cloned from a lambda gt 10 library prepared from poly(A)+ RNA of vesicular glands, hybridizes with a single 2.75-kilobase mRNA species. The cDNA clone was selected using oligonucleotide probes modeled from amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides prepared from the purified enzyme. The full-length cDNA encodes a protein of 600 amino acids, including a signal sequence of 24 amino acids. Identification of the cDNA as coding for prostaglandin G/H synthase is based on comparison of amino acid sequences of seven peptides comprising 103 amino acids with the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA. The molecular weight of the unglycosylated enzyme lacking the signal peptide is 65,621. The synthase is a glycoprotein, and there are three potential sites for N-glycosylation, two of them in the amino-terminal half of the molecule. The serine reported to be acetylated by aspirin is at position 530, near the carboxyl terminus. There is no significant similarity between the sequence of the synthase and that of any other protein in amino acid or nucleotide sequence libraries, and a heme binding site(s) is not apparent from the amino acid sequence. The availability of a full-length cDNA clone coding for prostaglandin G/H synthase should facilitate studies of the regulation of expression of this enzyme and the structural features important for catalysis and for interaction with anti-inflammatory drugs.
