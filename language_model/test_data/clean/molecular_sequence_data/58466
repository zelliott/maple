The outer arm dynein of sea urchin sperm axoneme contains three intermediate chains (IC1, IC2, and IC3; M(r) 128,000, 98,000, and 74,000, respectively). IC2 and IC3 are members of the WD family; the WD motif is responsible for a protein-protein interaction. We describe here the molecular cloning of IC1. IC1 has a unique primary structure, the N-terminal part is homologous to the sequence of thioredoxin, the middle part consists of three repetitive sequences homologous to the sequence of nucleoside diphosphate kinase, and the C-terminal part contains a high proportion of negatively charged glutamic acid residues. Thus, IC1 is a novel dynein intermediate chain distinct from IC2 and IC3 and may be a multifunctional protein. The thioredoxin-related part of IC1 is more closely related to those of two redox-active Chlamydomonas light chains than thioredoxin. Antibodies were prepared against the N-terminal and middle domains of IC1 expressed as His-tagged proteins in bacteria. These antibodies cross-reacted with some dynein polypeptides (potential homologues of IC1) from distantly related species. We propose here that the three intermediate chains are the basic core units of sperm outer arm dynein because of their ubiquitous existence. The recombinant thioredoxin-related part of IC1 and outer arm dyneins from sea urchin and distantly related species were specifically bound to and eluted from a phenylarsine oxide affinity column with 2-mercaptoethanol, indicating that they contain vicinal dithiols competent to undergo reversible oxidation/reduction.
