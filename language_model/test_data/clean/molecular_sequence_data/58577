Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is widely distributed in sensory neurons and nerve fibers. To clarify the function of CGRP on the immune system, the effect of CGRP on phagocytosis by peritoneal macrophages was examined by means of flow cytofluorometry. CGRP enhanced phagocytosis of latex beads in a dose-dependent manner. Because the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl, 1-methylxanthine (IBMX) enhanced the CGRP-induced enhancement of phagocytosis, the enhancement might be mediated by cAMP. In the presence of mannan, the phagocytosis was suppressed and the CGRP-induced enhancement was also blocked, suggesting that mannose receptors on macrophages were involved in mediating the phagocytosis of latex beads, and CGRP enhanced the mannose receptor-mediated phagocytosis. The present results indicate that CGRP can modulate the function of macrophages in nerve terminals of sensory neurons during the development and maintenance of inflammation.
