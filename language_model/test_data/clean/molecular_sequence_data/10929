We were the first to report 5'-flanking sequences of goat beta-lactoglobulin (beta LG) gene (867 bp) including a promoter (770 bp) and part of the first exon (97 bp). The fragment was isolated from Chinese goat tissue with PCR, and then cloned and sequenced. Sequence comparison showed 94.6% homology with sheep and 88% homology with cattle, respectively. There are highly conserved transcription factor binding sites as well. It suggested that the proximal 406 bp of 5'-flanking sequences of sheep beta LG possess strong tissue-specific DNAaseI-hypersensitive sites. Sheep beta LG transgenes containing only the 406-bp 5'-flanking sequences were efficiently expressed in the mouse mammary gland at a high level. These goat beta LG 5'-flanking sequences could possibly direct heterologous protein expression in the milk of transgenic animals.
