The adenovirus (Ad) single-stranded DNA binding protein (DBP) is a multifunctional protein. It is thought to consist of two domains, the amino-terminal domain involved in host-range determination and the carboxyl-terminal domain functioning in DNA replication and DNA binding. We have determined the nucleotide sequences of the DBP genes of Ad40 and Ad41, two human adenoviral serotypes that differ significantly from other adenoviruses. Regions of structural and functional importance in the corresponding proteins could be identified by comparison of the amino acid sequences with those of other known DBPs. In addition, the nucleotide sequences of the DBP early promoters, of the 23K protease genes, and of parts of the hexon and 100K protein genes have been determined. It can be deduced from the nucleotide sequences, that the Ad40 and Ad41 DBPs are relatively small (473 and 474 amino acids (a.a.), respectively, versus 529 a.a. for the Ad5 DBP). This is caused by the presence of very small amino-terminal domains of 119 a.a. (Ad40) and 120 a.a. (Ad41), as compared to 173 a.a. for the corresponding Ad5 domain. Only a few amino acids in this domain have been conserved in all known DBPs. The carboxyl-terminal domains show a higher degree of sequence conservation. In this domain, four strongly conserved regions can be identified, one of which might form a metal-binding site. The 23K proteases of both Ad40 and Ad41 show a strong homology to the Ad2 and Ad5 proteins, with the exception of the carboxyl-terminal end of the proteins. The 23K protease gene of Ad41 has an open reading frame that extends beyond the polyadenylation signal, in contrast to the Ad40 gene that ends well in front of the signal.
