Aleuria aurantia lectin (AAL) shows sugar-binding specificity for L-fucose. A lambda gt11 expression library was constructed from A. aurantia poly(A) RNA and screened with a polyclonal antiserum directed against AAL. An immunopositive clone carrying 1.3-kb EcoRI fragment was obtained. The fragment encoded AAL, but lacked a nucleotide sequence corresponding to the two amino-terminal amino acids. The 5'-terminal part of the fragment was replaced with a chemically synthesized DNA fragment and inserted into an expression vector to yield a plasmid pKA-1. Escherichia coli carrying pKA-1 expressed functional AAL and the recombinant AAL showed the same immunological properties as those of natural AAL.
