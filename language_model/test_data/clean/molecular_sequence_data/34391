Enfuvirtide (T-20), a C-terminal heptad repeat (C-HR)-derived peptide of HIV-1 glycoprotein, gp41, effectively suppresses HIV-1 replication through a putative mechanism that involves it acting as a decoy and binding to the N-terminal heptad repeat (N-HR) of the virus. In this study, we address whether the anti-HIV-1 activity of T-20 is antagonized by a variety of N-HR-derived peptides.

Multinuclear activation of galactosidase indicator assays were used to evaluate T-20 activity in the presence of N-HR-derived peptides. The gp41-derived peptides were chemically synthesized.

We demonstrate additive anti-HIV activity when T-20 is used in combination with N-HR-derived peptides that do not have a putative binding region for the tryptophan-rich domain in T-20. The presence of a deep pocket-forming region in the N-HR-derived peptides enhanced their anti-HIV-1 activity, but had little effect on the activity of T-20.

These results indicate that T-20-based antiviral therapies can be combined with N-HR-derived peptides.
