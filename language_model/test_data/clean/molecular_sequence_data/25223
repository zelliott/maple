The expression of Bacillus subtilis phage phi 29 late genes from the A3 promoter requires the viral protein p4. This protein is a transcriptional activator which binds to a region of the A3 promoter located between nucleotides -56 to -102, relative to the transcription start point. Mutants at the N terminus of protein p4 have been constructed and their function investigated. The binding of these deletion mutants to the late A3 promoter has been analyzed by gel retardation and DNase I footprinting assays. The results indicate that the N terminus of protein p4 could be involved in its binding to the A3 promoter, suggesting that it may not be a typical Cro-like helix-turn-helix DNA-binding protein.
