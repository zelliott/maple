Acyl-ACP thioesterases (FATs) terminates the fatty acid synthesis and allow the transport of fatty acids out of the plastids, which are the important determinants of cellular metabolism. FATB is a member of FAT enzymes that has been described previously in most of the plants. In silico cloning is a new method that utilizes the bioinformatics on the complete genome and available EST database. In this study, a full-length cDNA clone of PtFATB gene was isolated from Populus tomentosa using this approach. It is 1,450 bp in length and the open reading frame encodes a peptide of 421 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence shows significant homology with those from other plant species, which contain typical domains owned by FATB proteins. The transcripts of PtFATB were abundant in leaves, and less in roots detected by using semiquantitative RT-PCR. When the shoots were subjected to the stress treatments (cold, dry, NaCl) and ABA (Abscisic acid), the expression of PtFATB was only slightly reduced under the treatment of low temperature. This suggests that the expression of PtFATB is in a constitutive fashion. This study provides the basis not only for the identification and characterization of this gene but also for the improvement of cold tolerance by controlling the expression of the PtFATB gene in trees in near future.
