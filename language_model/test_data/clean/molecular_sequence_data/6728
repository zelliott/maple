The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used in an attempt to detect Bacteroides fragilis by amplifying a segment of the gene encoding B. fragilis neuraminidase. Forty-five reference strains representing 45 species and 113 clinical isolates were tested. Only B. fragilis was PCR positive, except for Bacteroides merdae ATCC 43184, which gave a band by ethidium bromide staining that showed no signal by Southern hybridization. Using a protocol that employed DNA extraction by Sepa Gene kit and a highly sensitive digoxigenin-chemiluminescence detection system, detection of B. fragilis by PCR was in complete agreement with culture results for 44 clinical specimens from which a wide range of aerobic and anaerobic organisms and fungi were recovered.
