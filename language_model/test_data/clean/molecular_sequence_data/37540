Chalcone synthase (CHS) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of all classes of flavonoids. The production of flower pigment is specifically regulated by the activity of CHS. We cloned the cDNA sequence of CHS-A gene from Narcissus by PCR and analyzed the coding sequence of gene. The result demonstrated that the sequence of the coding region was 1167bp, encoding a protein of 389 amino acid which was more than 80% homology with CHS of the other 8 plants, such as Nicotine abacus and Solana tuberosum.
