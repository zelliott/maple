The three-dimensional structure of the basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper domain of the transcription factor Max complexed with DNA has been determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.9 A resolution. Max binds as a dimer to its recognition sequence CACGTG by direct contacts between the alpha-helical basic region and the major groove. This symmetric homodimer, a new protein fold, is a parallel, left-handed, four-helix bundle, with each monomer containing two alpha-helical segments separated by a loop. The two alpha-helical segments are composed of the basic region plus helix 1 and helix 2 plus the leucine repeat, respectively. As in GCN4, the leucine repeat forms a parallel coiled coil.
