The RING3 gene encodes a 90-kDa mitogen-activated nuclear protein. In proliferating cells, including in leukemia, RING3 has serine-threonine kinase and autophosphorylation activities. The cloning of D26362, a gene closely related to RING3, suggests a gene family. RING3 and D26362 are also related to the Drosophila developmental gene fsh. A database search for further members of the RING3 family identified an EST derived from a testis-specific library. cDNA clones representing the full coding sequence of the gene were isolated. The gene encodes a protein of 947 amino acids with extensive homology to RING3, D26362, and fsh. Similar to these proteins, it possesses two bromodomain motifs and a PEST sequence. Northern analysis of 16 normal tissues and eight cancer cell lines shows transcripts of 3.5 and 4.0 kb expressed specifically in testis. The gene has been named BRDT (for bromodomain, testis specific). PCR analysis of a panel of monochromosomal human/rodent hybrid cell lines and the GeneBridge 4 panel of radiation hybrids localizes the gene to chromosome 1p between markers WI-7719 and WI-3099 (D1S2154).
