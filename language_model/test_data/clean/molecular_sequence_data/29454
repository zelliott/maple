The protein product of the Methanococcus jannaschii MJ1256 gene has been expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and shown to be involved in coenzyme F(420) biosynthesis. The protein catalyzes the transfer of the 2-phospholactate moiety from lactyl (2) diphospho-(5')guanosine (LPPG) to 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin (Fo) with the formation of the L-lactyl phosphodiester of 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin (F(420)-0) and GMP. On the basis of the reaction catalyzed, the enzyme is named LPPG:Fo 2-phospho-L-lactate transferase. Since the reaction is the fourth step in the biosynthesis of coenzyme F(420), the enzyme has been designated as CofD, the product of the cofD gene. The transferase requires Mg(2+) for activity, and the catalysis does not appear to proceed via a covalent intermediate. To a lesser extent CofD also catalyzes a number of additional reactions that include the formation of Fo-P, when the enzyme is incubated with Fo and GDP, GTP, pyrophosphate, or tripolyphosphate, and the hydrolysis of F(420)-0 to Fo. All of these side reactions can be rationalized as occurring by a common mechanism. CofD has no recognized sequence similarity to any previously characterized enzyme.
