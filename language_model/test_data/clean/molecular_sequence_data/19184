Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents the most prevalent form of sustained cardiac arrhythmia and contributes substantially to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Aggregating evidence demonstrates that genetic risk factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of AF. However, AF is a genetically heterogeneous disease and the genetic defects responsible for AF in an overwhelming majority of patients remain unclear. In the present study, the whole coding region and splice junction sites of the PITX2c gene, which encodes a paired-like homeobox transcription factor essential for normal cardiovascular development, were sequenced in 160 unrelated patients with lone AF, and a novel heterozygous mutation, c.349C > T equivalent to p.P117S, was identified in a patient with positive family history of AF. The missense mutation, which co-segregated with AF in the family with complete penetrance and was absent in 700 unrelated ethnically matched healthy individuals, altered the amino acid completely conserved evolutionarily across species and was predicted to be pathogenic by MutationTaster and PolyPhen-2. Biological assays revealed that the mutant PITX2c protein was associated with significantly decreased transcriptional activity when compared with its wild-type counterpart. The findings implicate PITX2c loss-of-function mutation in familial AF for the first time, providing novel insight into the molecular pathology of AF.
