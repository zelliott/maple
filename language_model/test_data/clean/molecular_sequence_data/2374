The mouse myeloma cell line MPC 11 carries two C gamma 2a immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes on the expressed chromosome, a duplication shown to have occurred through unequal sister chromatid exchange (USCE). In the present report, we present the nucleotide sequence of the USCE joint and show that both breaks occurred within tracts of repeated TC dinucleotides. Additional TC dinucleotide tracts and two oligonucleotide segments (N sequences) were inserted at the USCE site.
