Two regions of the primary structure of the small subunit rRNA of Sarcocystis muris bradyzoites were compared with nucleotide sequences of S. gigantea, Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium berghei and Mus musculus and used to design genus- and species-specific probes for the detection and identification of coccidia. Total cellular RNA of purified S. muris, S. cruzi, T. gondii and Eimeria nieschulzi and coccidia-infected tissues of mouse, ox, sheep and pig, were assayed using twenty-base oligomers labelled with 32P. Hybridization occurred at temperatures ranging from 21 degrees C to 41 degrees C or 51 degrees C. One probe detected only S. muris and another successfully hybridized to several members of coccidia, including S. muris, S. cruzi, T. gondii and E. nieschulzi. One ng of total cellular RNA was sufficient to yield detectable hybrids in slot blot assays. The excellent sensitivity suggests that rRNA-based probes are capable of detecting individual parasites, and can assay low levels of coccidial infections not detectable by other methods. The results of this study show that it is possible to customize the specificity of rRNA-based probes for diagnostic, epidemiological or taxonomic purposes.
