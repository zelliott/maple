A 2.2 kb SphI/ClaI fragment of the Clostridium pasteurianum chromosome has previously been cloned and shown to complement leuB401 and leuC171 mutations in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of this fragment has been determined (2327 bp) and carries three open reading frames. The products of translation of these reading frames display significant homologies with the alpha-isopropylmalate isomerase subunit (leuD) gene of Salmonella typhimurium, the beta-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (leuB) genes of several organisms, and the dihydroxyacid dehydrase (ilvD) gene of E. coli.
