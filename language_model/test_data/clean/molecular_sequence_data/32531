With the aim of identifying genes involved in development and parasite adaptation in cestodes, four coding sequences were isolated from the cyclophyllidean Mesocestoides corti larval stage (tetrathyridium). Genes showed significant similarity to the cysteine-rich secreted protein (CRISP) encoding genes, a large family that includes stage and tissue-specific genes from diverse organisms, many associated with crucial biological processes. The full-length McCrisp2 cDNA encodes a predicted protein of 202 residues in length, containing 10 cysteines and a putative signal peptide. The expression level of McCrisp2 was estimated by Real-time PCR, relative to GAPDH, showing an increase of 75% in segmented worms compared to tetrathyridia. By in situ hybridization, McCrisp2 expression was localized mainly at the larvae apical region of tetrathyridia and in the proglottids of segmented worms. Taken together our results suggest a possible role for M. corti CRISP proteins as ES products, potentially involved in differentiation processes as proposed for homologs in other organisms.
