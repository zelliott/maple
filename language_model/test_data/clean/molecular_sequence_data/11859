A 42-kilobase pair region of rat DNA containing the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaM kinase IV) gene has been cloned and characterized. The gene consists of 12 exons and 11 introns and is predicted to encode both beta and alpha forms of CaM kinase IV as well as the testis-specific calmodulin-binding protein calspermin. The promoter utilized to generate the alpha-kinase isoform is located in intron 1, whereas the promoter utilized to produce the calspermin transcript is contained in intron 10. The calspermin promoter region which extends from -200 to +321 relative to the calspermin transcription initiation site that contains two cyclic AMP response elements (CRE) at -70 and -50 and has been shown previously to be inactive in NIH3T3 cells (Sun, Z., Sassone-Corsi, P., and Means, A. R. (1995) Mol. Cell. Biol. 15, 561-571) was ligated to the lacZ reporter gene and used to generate transgenic mice. The promoter was expressed exclusively in postmeiotic testis where beta-galactosidase was found predominantly in elongating spermatids. The cell and developmental specificity of transgene expression was very similar to the pattern shown by the endogenous gene. Although the transgene promoter was silent in somatic tissues, beta-galactosidase expression could be restored in primary cultures of skin fibroblasts by introduction of vectors encoding CREM tau and CaM kinase IV.
