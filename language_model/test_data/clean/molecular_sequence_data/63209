FLO/LFY homologue genes were initially characterized as floral meristem identity genes and play a key role in flower development among diverse species. The inflorescence organization of chrysanthemum differs from typical dicotyledons such as Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum as clear sepals are absent, and instead, a pappus, a rudimentary sepal, is formed. To understand the mechanism of reproduction of chrysanthemum at the molecular level, DFL, a FLORICAULA/LEAFY homologous gene, was cloned from Dendranthema lavandulifolium, which is one of the original species of chrysanthemum. The DFL gene consists of a 1,236-bp open reading frame and encodes a putative protein of 412 amino acids, which is 63% identical to LFY and 70% to FLO. The expression patterns of DFL during the flower development were analyzed, and RT-PCR results showed that DFL was strongly expressed in the flower bud. In situ hybridization experiments showed that it is strongly expressed in the inflorescence bract, petal and stamen primordial tissues throughout the inflorescence development. Its expression signals were also detected in stems, leaf primordial tissues and developing inflorescence bracts.
