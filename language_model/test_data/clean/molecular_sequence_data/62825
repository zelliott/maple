The genome of Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis is estimated to encode 2588 theoretical proteins. In this study, we have vitalized approximately 46% of the theoretical proteome experimentally using a proteomic strategy that combines three different methods, shotgun digestion plus high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ion-trap tandem mass spectrometry (shotgun-liquid chromatography (LC)/MS), one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) plus HPLC with ion-trap tandem mass spectrometry (one-dimensional electrophoresis (1DE)-LC/MS), and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis plus matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (2DE-MALDI-TOF-MS). Of the 1200 proteins identified, as few as 76 proteins were globally found by all three approaches, and notably, most of these proteins were in the soluble fraction. However, there were a number of unique proteins detected by one method only, suggesting that our strategy provides a means toward obtaining a comprehensive view of protein expression profile. Proteins from the major metabolic pathways are strongly represented on the map, and a number of these enzymes were identified by more than one proteomic method. Based upon the proteins identified in the present study, we are able to broaden the understanding of how T. tengcongensis survives under high temperature environment, whereas several of its properties can not be fully explained by genome data.
