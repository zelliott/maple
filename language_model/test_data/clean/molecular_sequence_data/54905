Crosstalk between intracellular signalling pathways is a functionally important and widespread phenomenon in cell physiology across phyla. In the salivary gland of the blowfly, serotonin induces fluid secretion via parallel activation of both the InsP(3)/Ca(2+) and the cAMP/PKA signalling pathways, which interact on multiple levels. We have determined the molecular identity of a link between both pathways that mediates a Ca(2+)-dependent rise of intracellular cAMP. Whereas hydrolysis of cAMP via phosphodiesterases is largely independent of Ca(2+), cAMP synthesis by adenylyl cyclases (AC) is potentiated in a Ca(2+)/calmodulin (Ca(2+)/CaM)-dependent manner. The existence of a Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent AC is supported by physiological data and a molecular approach. We have cloned Cv rutabaga cDNA, encoding the first blowfly AC, and confirmed its expression in the salivary gland via reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction. The putative gene product of Cv rutabaga is a Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent type I AC and shows highest homology to Rutabaga from Drosophila. Thus, a Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent AC serves as a link between the InsP(3)/Ca(2+) and the cAMP/PKA signalling pathways in the salivary gland of the blowfly and might be important for the amplification and optimization of the secretory response.
