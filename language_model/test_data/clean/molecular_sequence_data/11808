The structure of the acidic polysaccharide from Serratia marcescens serogroup O1 has been investigated. NMR spectroscopy together with sugar and methylation analysis have been used as well as a uronic degradation. The polysaccharide consists of pentasaccharide repeating units having the following structure. (sequence see text) The polysaccharide also contains one equivalent of O-acetyl groups per repeating unit present on, inter alia, a hydroxymethyl group.
