In this paper, we cloned a novel full-length cDNA that encodes a Trichinella spiralis cathepsin B-like protease gene (TsCPB) using 3'-RACE PCR. The recombinant mature TsCPB protein (rTsCPB) was then expressed in an Escherichia coli expression system and purified with Ni-affinity chromatography. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that TsCPB was expressed across all development stages of the parasite but had the highest expression level during the adult stage. Furthermore, rTsCPB was detected in Trichinella excretory-secretory products with anti-rTsCPB rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Interestingly, rTsCPB was strongly recognized by the T. spiralis-infected sera in Western blotting, implying that TsCPB protein appeared in the peripheral blood of Trichinella-infected mice as circulating antigens (CAg). We then analyzed the dynamic levels of TsCPB CAg and its antibodies in T. spiralis-infected sera by using an improved double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect ELISA, respectively. The results showed that TsCPB CAg can be detected much earlier compared to antibody detection in Trichinella-infected mice. In addition, we monitored the effects of albendazole drug therapy (a dosage of 370Â mg/kg body weight, twice a day) on T. spiralis-infected mice by detecting the levels of TsCPB CAg and its antibody in the sera of drug-treated mice. The results showed that the levels of CAg dramatically decreased after successful drug treatment, while the antibody level remained unchanged. Overall, the novel Trichinella antigen TsCPB could be a promising novel circulating antigen molecule for the detection of Trichinella infection and for monitoring the efficacy of drug treatment of trichinellosis.
