The interferon-mediated induction of the gene encoding the human tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase (WRS) results in the production of two mRNA species differing in size by approximately 800 base pairs (bp). Two distinctly sized cDNAs differing by approximately 800 bp were isolated from a cDNA library generated from mRNA prepared from IFN-gamma-treated cells. Northern blot analysis using cDNA probes recognizing different regions of the WRS mRNA reveals distinctly sized mRNAs differing in the length of their 3' untranslated regions. Differential display analysis using oligo dT primers demonstrates that the different sized WRS mRNAs result from alternative polyadenylation of this transcript.
