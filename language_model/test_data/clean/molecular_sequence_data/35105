Apple mosaic virus (ApMV) is a widespread ssRNA virus which infects diverse species of Rosales. The phylogenetic analysis of complete capsid protein gene of the largest set of ApMV isolates discriminated two main clusters of isolates: one cluster correlates with Maloideae hosts and Trebouxia lichen algae hosts; a second with hop, Prunus, and other woody tree hosts. No correlation was found between clusters and geographic origin of virus isolates, and positive selection hypothesis in distinct hosts was not confirmed: in all virus populations, purifying selection had occurred. GGT→AAT substitution resulted in Gly→Asn change inside the zinc-finger motif in the capsid protein was revealed specific for discrimination of the clusters and we hypothesise that could influence the host preference.
