Twelve (54.5%) of 22 free-roaming dogs in Ishigaki Island had tick infestation identified as Rhipicephalus sanguineus. There were 121 ticks recovered and consisted of 28 females, 58 males, 22 nymphs and 3 larvae. Infection of dogs possibly with canine ehrlichial pathogens was examined by both indirect immunofluorescence assay and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Two dogs of the 13 examined were sero-positive for the human granulocytic ehrlichia agent, and one of two dogs was PCR positive for Ehrlichia platys. This dog had platelet numbers slightly lower than normal value, however, no morulae were found within platelet on peripheral blood smear stained with Giemsa.
