The present study describes the first isolation and characterization of a prokaryotic protein and gene for sucrose-phosphate phosphatase (SPP), the enzyme that catalyzes the terminal step in sucrose synthesis. For gene isolation, a 2,015-bp DNA fragment containing an open reading frame with about 31% amino acid identity to Synechocystis SPS was amplified from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 DNA. Surprisingly, expression of the putative gene in Escherichia coli demonstrated that it encoded an SPP protein. The expressed protein cross-reacted with antibodies against the native form of Anabaena SPP and its biochemical properties were identical to those of the enzyme purified from the cyanobacterial cells. Comparisons of the Anabaena SPP with the higher-plant enzyme revealed important differences in the C-terminal region, molecular mass, subunit composition and immunoreactivity. Nevertheless, two conserved motifs, including four invariant aspartate residues similar to those found in members of the phosphohydrolase superfamily, were identified in the Anabaena SPP deduced amino acid sequence.
