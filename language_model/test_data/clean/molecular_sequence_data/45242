Calmodulin, a highly versatile and ubiquitously expressed Ca2+ sensor, regulates the function of many enzymes and ion channels. Both Ca2+-dependent inactivation and Ca2+-dependent facilitation of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels Cav1.2 andCav2.1 are regulated through an interaction with Ca2+-bound calmodulin. This review addresses the functional regulation of Cav1.2 and Cav2.1 by calmodulin and discusses how Ca2+ binding to a single calmodulin molecule can regulate opposing functions of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.
