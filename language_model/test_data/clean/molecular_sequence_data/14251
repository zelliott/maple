Psychrobacter spp. have shown characteristics indicating remarkable capabilities at subzero temperatures that identify them as potential model organisms for the study of low-temperature adaptations. Here we present the draft genome sequence of Psychrobacter sp. PAMC 21119, which was isolated from permafrost soil of Antarctica; this information could provide insight into adaptation and evolution strategies under extreme environmental conditions.
