There are four known members of the C/EBP family of basic region-leucine zipper transcription factors: Cebpa, Cebpb, Cebpd, and Cebpe. Cebpa has previously been mapped to mouse chromosome 7. Here, we show that Cebpb maps to mouse chromosome 2, Cebpd to chromosome 16, and Cebpe to chromosome 14. The assignment of Cebpd to chromosome 16 identifies a new region of homology between mouse chromosome 16 and human chromosome 8.
