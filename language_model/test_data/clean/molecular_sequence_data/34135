Recent developments in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics analyses provide an unprecedented opportunity for cost and time effective high quality microsatellite marker discovery in nonmodel organisms for which no genomic information is available. Here, we use shotgun pyrosequencing of a microsatellite-enriched library to develop, for the first time, microsatellite markers for Alnus glutinosa, a keystone tree species of European riparian woodland communities. From a total of 17â€‰855 short sequences, we identified 590 perfect microsatellites from which 392 had designed primers. A subset of 48 loci were tested for amplification, 12 of which were polymorphic in A. glutinosa. These 12 loci were successfully coamplified in a single multiplex polymerase chain reaction experiment and validated for population genetics applications. In addition, 10 and 8 of these microsatellites were found to be transferable to the related A. incana and A. cordata species. The developed multiplex of 12 microsatellite markers therefore provides new opportunities for experimental evolutionary and forest genetics research in Alnus.
