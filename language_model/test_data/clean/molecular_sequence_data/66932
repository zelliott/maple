PEX5, PEX7 and PEX2 are involved in the peroxisomal matrix protein import machinery. PEX5 and PEX7 are the receptors for the proteins harbouring, respectively, a PTS1 and a PTS2 peroxisomal targeting sequence and cycle between the cytoplasm and the peroxisome. PEX2 belongs to the RING-finger complex located in the peroxisomal membrane and acts in protein import downstream of PEX5 and PEX7; it is therefore required for the import of both PTS1 and PTS2 proteins. We have shown previously that PEX2 deficiency leads to an impairment of meiotic commitment in the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina. Here we report that both PEX5 and PEX7 receptors are dispensable for this commitment but are needed for normal sexual cycle. Data suggest also a new role of PEX2 and/or the RING-finger complex in addition to their role in PTS1 and PTS2 import. Strikingly, Deltapex5 and Deltapex7 single and double knockout strains analyses indicate that Deltapex7 acts as a partial suppressor of Deltapex5 life cycle deficiencies. Moreover, contrary to pex2 mutants, Deltapex5 and Deltapex7 show mitochondrial morphological abnormalities.
