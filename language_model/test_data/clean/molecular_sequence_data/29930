cis-Acting elements involved in E2 modulation of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) P97 promoter activity and HPV-18 P105 promoter activity were examined. In transfected primary human keratinocytes, each promoter had a basal activity that could be repressed by the bovine papillomavirus type 1 E2 gene product. Mutational analysis of the E2-binding sites in the long control region upstream of each promoter revealed that E2 repression was mediated through the E2-binding sites proximal to each promoter. In the context of a mutated E2-binding site at the promoter proximal position, the HPV-16 P97 and HPV-18 P105 promoters could be transactivated by E2. E2-mediated repression of HPV-18 P105 promoter activity was shown to be a transcriptional effect. The interaction of E2 with promoter-proximal E2-binding sites is likely to be important for the controlled expression of viral genes transcribed from the HPV-16 P97 promoter and the HPV-18 P105 promoter in infected human genital epithelial cells.
