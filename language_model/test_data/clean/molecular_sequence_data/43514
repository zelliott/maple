Recently, we reported the isolation of a new subfamily of serine-threonine protein kinases. This subfamily was shown to consist of at least four members. Sequencing and FISH mapping of all 4 members now reveals that the Y-homolog (PRKY) of the previously mapped PRKX gene (Xp22.3) is located in Yp11.2, in close vicinity to AMELY. The other two copies reside on Xq12-->q13 (PRKXP2) and 15q26 (PRKXP1, containing CA repeat STS D15S87) and represent pseudogenes.
