Recently, a nonenveloped single-stranded DNA virus named TT virus (TTV) has been reported in association with non-A to G post-transfusion as well as sporadic acute and chronic liver disease. A method was developed for the detection of antibody to TTV (anti-TTV) by means of immune precipitation and detection of TTV DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. The test serum was incubated with TTV, recovered from feces of a carrier, and after incubation, the formed immune complexes were precipitated with goat antiserum to human IgG. TTV DNA was sought for by the polymerase chain reaction in both precipitate and supernatant. The detection of TTV DNA in the precipitate, but not in the supernatant, was considered to represent anti-TTV in the test serum. Of the 44 healthy blood donors in Japan, anti-TTV was detected in one of the six (17%) with TTV DNA and 11 of the 38 (29%) without TTV DNA. In the two patients with post-transfusion non-A to G hepatitis, free anti-TTV developed as they cleared TTV in serum. Anti-TTV complexed with TTV in serum, detectable by precipitating sera with goat anti-human IgG and testing for TTV DNA, elicited while the patients had elevated alanine transaminase levels. The determination of anti-TTV would be useful for detecting resolved infection in surveys for exposure to TTV in the general population, and for establishing the mechanism of liver injury associated with TTV infection.
