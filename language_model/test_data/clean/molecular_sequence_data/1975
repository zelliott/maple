The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the autoantigen in seropositive myasthenia gravis (MG) that is a T cell-dependent B cell-mediated autoimmune disorder. We tested the immunogenicity and myasthenogenicity of the extracellular and first transmembrane domain of the epsilon-chain(1-221) of the nAChR in inbred and MHC congenic rat strains. Immunodominant T and B cell determinants did not induce experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG), although immunization resulted in strong Th1 and B cell responses, which could be mapped with overlapping peptides of the nAChR epsilon-subunit in eight different rat strains. Our data underscores the concept that immunodominant autoantigen-specific T and B cell responses can lack pathogenicity in autoimmune disease and might be of relevance for the physiological integrity of the organism.
