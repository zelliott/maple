A total of 30 field isolates of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype Asia1 belonging to two different lineages and five isolates belonging to a divergent group as delineated earlier in 1D (encodingVP1 protein) gene-based phylogeny were sequenced in the structural protein (P1) coding region. Phylogenetic comparison of these isolates along with some of the published exotic sequences revealed the presence of five different lineages around the world. Similar grouping pattern was observed for the P1 region and 1D gene-based phylogeny, where the Indian isolates were clustered in two genetic lineages. The recently identified divergent group of virus falls into a separate sub-cluster. Similar grouping was also observed in L gene-based phylogeny. Comparison of amino acid sequences identified lineage-specific signature residues in all the structural proteins. Comparison of Asia1 field isolates at the identified key residues of other FMD viruses involved in the formation of the heparan sulfate-binding ligand confirmed many of them to be conserved and the presence of VP3(56) Arg suggested their cell culture adaptation. Although a considerable genetic variation was observed among the isolates of present study, all of them tested in micro-neutralization test were serologically related to the vaccine strain.
