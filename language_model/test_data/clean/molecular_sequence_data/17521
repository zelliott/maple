Gene 22 of bacteriophage T4 encodes a major prohead scaffolding core protein of 269 amino acid residues. From its nucleotide sequence the gene product (gp) 22 has a predicted Mr of 29.9 and a pI of 4.3. The protein is rich in charged residues (glutamic acid and lysine) and contains low amounts of proline and glycine and no cysteine residues. We suggest that gp22 undergoes limited proteolytic processing which eliminates the short C-terminal piece from the molecule during the early steps of prohead assembly. Most amino acid residues of the gp22 polypeptide chain (80%) have an alpha-helical conformation and form seven peculiar alpha-helices. A model suggesting the spatial organization of gp22 is presented. Three long alpha-helices numbered 1 (1A and 1B), 3, and 5 (5A and 5B) are packed in an antiparallel fashion along the major axis of the road-shaped molecule. Two rather short alpha-helices (2 and 4) are located at the distal and proximal ends of the protein molecule, respectively. Helix number 2, which is a proteolytic fragment of gp22 found in mature T4 heads, is packed with helices 1A and 3, similar to a novel element of supersecondary structure, the alpha alpha-corner. Helix number 4 probably interacts with the gp20 connector of the prohead. The implications of the structure of the gp22 molecule for the assembly of the prohead core are discussed.
