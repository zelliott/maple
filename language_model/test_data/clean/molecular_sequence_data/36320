Sequence analysis of the Clostridium butyricum chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, catB, showed that it encoded a CAT monomer of 219 amino acids with a molecular weight of 26,114. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the CATB monomer to those of sixteen other CATs showed that it was most closely related to the CATQ monomer from Clostridium perfringens.
