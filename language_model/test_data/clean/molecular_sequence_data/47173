We have analyzed sequence homologies between nonimmunogenic phage displayed peptides mimicking GD3 ganglioside and human/mouse self-proteins. The GD3 ganglioside phagotopes showed homology to proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism/transport. Besides this expected homology, molecular mimicry of critical regulatory proteins was found. These data contribute to our understanding of the structural relatedness of antigenic determinants defined by specific anti-GD3 monoclonal antibodies and, in addition, suggest that molecular mimicry might explain the nonimmunogenicity of these peptides otherwise characterized by specificity to the mAb counterpart. We conclude that construction of peptides harboring motifs absent or scarcely represented in endogenous self-proteins might be a useful approach in melanoma immunotherapy.
