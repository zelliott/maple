To address the role of oxytocin in the control of cardiovascular reactivity, we examined the effect of central injection of oxytocin, vasopressin and mixed base antisense oligodeoxynucleotides on stress-induced cardiovascular and endocrine changes. Antisense oligomers were injected into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), 4 h prior to the stress test. The oxytocin antisense abolished the tachycardia produced by 5 min of shaker stress. The blood pressure and plasma oxytocin responses were not different between the groups. PVN levels of OT were reduced in the oxytocin antisense-treated group while brain stem levels were increased. These results demonstrate the importance of a specific peptide system, the PVN/oxytocin axis, in stress-induced tachycardia. Further, the data illustrate the effectiveness of short-term treatment with antisense oligomers on physiological responses.
