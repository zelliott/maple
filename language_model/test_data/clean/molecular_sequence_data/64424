The natural all d- and/or unnatural all l-1,4- and 1,6-oligosaccharides were synthesized from furan alcohols using a palladium-catalyzed glycosylation reaction. The 1,4- and 1,6-alpha-manno-disaccharides were achieved in seven total steps starting from chiral furan alcohols. Similarly, 1,4- and 1,6-alpha-manno-trisaccharides were also synthesized in nine total steps. Key to the overall efficiency of this process was the use of highly diastereoselective palladium-catalyzed glycosylations, reductions, and dihydroxylations.
