The cDNA encoding a swelling-induced chloride conductance regulatory protein, plcln, was cloned from rabbit ciliary epithelium by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach. The open reading frame encoding 236 amino acids possesses high amino acid identity (93/%) with the previously cloned plcln from human ciliary epithelium. Outwardly rectifying currents were recorded in Xenopus oocytes injected with plcln cRNA, a result consistent with plcln expression in ciliary epithelium. A widespread distribution and marked expression of plcln mRNA in both nonpigmented ciliary epithelial (NPE) cells and pigmented ciliary epithelial (PE) cells was found for the first time. In situ hybridization analysis showed that plcln expression is more abundant in NPE than PE. These findings are consistent with the idea that plcln may be an important regulatory element in these secretory cells.
