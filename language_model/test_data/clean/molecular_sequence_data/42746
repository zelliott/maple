Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering skin disease associated with the occurrence of autoantibodies directed to a limited series of antigens located at the basement membrane zone of the dermo-epidermal junction. Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of activated T cells in BP lesions although their actual contribution to the pathogenesis of the disease has remained unclear. One approach to better understanding the significance of these T-cell infiltrates is to study the diversity of the recognition receptors (TCRs) expressed at the lesion sites. We report here an extensive analysis, performed in one patient with typical BP, where 187 TCR in frame transcripts from a lesional area, from clinically normal skin or from peripheral blood lymphocytes have been sequenced and compared. The data show preferential usage of the V alpha 8 subfamily gene segments in the lesion. It is therefore suggested that T-cell infiltration in BP may not simply reflect a non-specific inflammatory process but include antigen-specific responses.
