We have completely sequenced the genome of an isolate of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) obtained following an outbreak in geese. The genomic sequence consists of 15192 nt, which is six nt longer than the published full length genome of the NDV strains La Sota, B1, Clone-30, Beaudette C and HB V4. The six nt insertion was located in the non-coding region of the nucleoprotein (NP) gene between nt 1646 and nt 1647 of the NDV genome (numbered according to the genomic sequence of the La Sota strain). An additional 22 NDV strains were searched for the existence of this six nt insertion. NDVs in genotypes VI, VII, VIII and IX had this insertion while NDV's in genotypes I, II, III, IV, and V did not. The significance of this insertion in NDV evolution is discussed.
