Porphyromonas gingivalis is known to be a major etiologic agent in the onset and progression of chronic periodontitis. Among various virulence factors that this bacterium produces, Arg- and Lys-specific cysteine proteinases (gingipains) are believed to be major determinants of the pathogenicity of P. gingivalis. Here, we report on our finding that there are inhibitors of these cysteine proteinases in a rice protein fraction. Comprehensive affinity chromatography and MS analyses resulted in the identification of 17 Arg-gingipain (Rgp)-interacting proteins in the rice endosperm. Of these, four proteins (i.e., a 26 kDa globulin, a plant lipid transfer/trypsin-alpha amylase inhibitor, the RA17 seed allergen, and an alpha amylase/trypsin inhibitor) were estimated to account for 90% of the Rgp inhibitory activity in the rice protein fraction, using a two-dimensional gel system of double-layer reverse zymography. In addition, a synthetic peptide derived from an Rgp-interacting protein, cyanate hydratase, could inhibit the growth of P. gingivalis and showed inhibitory activity against both the Arg- and Lys-gingipains. These results suggest that these rice proteins may be useful as nutraceutical ingredients for the prevention and management of periodontal diseases.
