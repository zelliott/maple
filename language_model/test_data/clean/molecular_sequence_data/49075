The aggregation process of beta-amyloid peptide Abeta into amyloid is strongly associated with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aggregation may involve a transition of an alpha helix in Abeta(1-28) into beta sheets and interactions between residues 18-20 of the "Abeta amyloid core." We applied an i, i+4 cyclic conformational constraint to the Abeta amyloid core and devised side chain-to-side chain lactam-bridged cyclo(17, 21)-[Lys(17), Asp(21)]Abeta(1-28). In contrast to Abeta(1-28) and [Lys(17), Asp(21)]Abeta(1-28), cyclo(17, 21)-[Lys(17), Asp(21)]Abeta(1-28) was not able to form beta sheets and cytotoxic amyloid aggregates. Cyclo(17, 21)-[Lys(17), Asp(21)]Abeta(1-28) was able to interact with Abeta(1-28) and to inhibit amyloid formation and cytotoxicity. Cyclo(17, 21)-[Lys(17), Asp(21)]Abeta(1-28) also interacted with Abeta(1-40) and interfered with its amyloidogenesis. Cyclo(17, 21)-[Lys(17), Asp(21)]Abeta(1-28) or similarly constrained Abeta sequences may find therapeutic and diagnostic applications in AD.
