Velogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was recovered from two dead Eurasian Scops Owls (Otus scops) from a wildlife rescue center in Korea during 2005. Phylogenetic analysis based on the sequence of the partial fusion (F) protein revealed that the isolates had the highest level of homology to recent Korean NDV strains from poultry.
