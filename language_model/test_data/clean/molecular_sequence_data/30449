Cerulenin, an inhibitor of fatty acid synthesis, inhibits the biosynthesis of iturin by Bacillus subtilis. With a cerulenin concentration of 2 micrograms/mL, 50% inhibition was achieved. At this concentration, cerulenin does not affect growth or total protein synthesis but does inhibit the incorporation of sodium [14C]acetate, [14C]myristic acid, and [14C]asparagine into iturin. Since cerulenin is known to block the condensation of malonyl-CoA subunits in the formation of fatty acids, the inhibition of iturin and beta-amino acid syntheses by cerulenin is discussed in relation with lipid synthesis.
