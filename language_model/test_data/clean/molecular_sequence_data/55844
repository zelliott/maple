Blood and post-mortem tissues from a 10-years-old girl were submitted to the Australian Animal Health Laboratory. Clinical signs and histopathological lesions had suggested a diagnosis of rabies, but, an unusually long incubation period of at least 5 years did not encourage such a diagnosis. Serological examinations by the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test revealed a dramatic increase in rabies virus-neutralising antibody during the 10-day period of hospitalisation. The results of a fluorescent antibody test on brain smears, and an immunoperoxidase test on formalin-fixed sections of brain were also consistent with a diagnosis of rabies. Attempts to isolate virus were unsuccessful. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were conducted on a 10% suspension of a post-mortem sample from the patient's brain, using primers based on the published sequence of the Pasteur virus strain of rabies virus. 413 and 513 bp fragments from the nucleoprotein gene and a 403 bp fragment from the glycoprotein gene were amplified. Subsequent sequencing of these fragments, and comparison with equivalent regions of known rabies viruses, confirmed that the fragments originated from a virus belonging to the rabies virus serotype. This case demonstrated the advantage of using a range of laboratory techniques to obtain a definitive diagnosis. In particular, a PCR-based test may allow a diagnosis, even in the face of conditions that preclude virus isolation such as apparently occurred in this case. Finally, this case demonstrated that an unusually long incubation period should not discourage a tentative clinical diagnosis of rabies.
