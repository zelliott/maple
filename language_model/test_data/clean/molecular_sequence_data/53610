Synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) is a neuronal membrane protein essential for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. To investigate the mechanisms by which SNAP-25 mediates neurosecretion, we performed a search for proteins that interact with SNAP-25 using a yeast two-hybrid screen. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a SNAP-25-interacting protein that is the rat homologue of mouse hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs). Hrs specifically interacts with SNAP-25, but not SNAP-23/syndet. The association of Hrs and SNAP-25 is mediated via coiled-coil interactions. Using an Hrs-specific antibody, we have shown that Hrs is highly enriched in brain, where it codistributes with SNAP-25 in most brain regions. Subcellular fractionation studies demonstrate that in brain, Hrs exists in both cytosolic and membrane-associated pools. Studies using indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy reveal that, in addition to early endosomes, Hrs is also localized to large dense-core secretory granules and synaptic-like microvesicles in nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells. Moreover, overexpression of Hrs in PC12 cells inhibits Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis. These results suggest that Hrs is involved in regulation of neurosecretion through interaction with SNAP-25.
