Calf thymus terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was used to incorporate several products of oxidative base damage onto the 3' end of oligodeoxyribonucleotides. Under the defined conditions described in this report, single residues of dihydrothymine, beta-ureidoisobutyric acid, thymine glycol, urea, 7-hydro-8-oxoadenine, 7-hydro-8-oxoguanine, 5-hydroxycytosine and 5-hydroxyuracil were incorporated into oligodeoxyribonucleotides of different lengths. The reaction is both efficient and cost effective. The 3' termini of the reaction products were suitable substrates for ligation by phage T4 DNA ligase, facilitating greatly the construction of oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing unique and site specific oxidative DNA lesions.
