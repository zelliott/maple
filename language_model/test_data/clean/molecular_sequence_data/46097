Animal trypanosomiasis is one of the major constraints of livestock industry in developing countries. In the present study, prevalence of Trypanosome evansi was assessed in the blood of dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) brought to Al Bassatein abattoir, Cairo, Egypt, by mouse inoculation test out of 84 tested camels, 4 animals (4.7%) were infected. Molecular analysis was achieved by PCR amplification and sequence analysis of part of ribosomal RNA gene including 18S, ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2 regions. Despite the conserved nature of 18S region, ITS region showed obvious heterogeneity compared to analogous sequences in database. Analysis of transferrin receptor encoding gene (ESAG6) showed variable repertoire in the studied isolates, which may indicate to a novel structure of T. evansi population from Egypt and/or a difference in host range. Furthermore, analysis of variable surface glycoprotein RoTat 1.2 gene marker revealed some heterogeneity at this gene locus. To our knowledge, this is the first molecular analysis of T. evansi in Egypt.
