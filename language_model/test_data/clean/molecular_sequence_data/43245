Cathelicidins are the precursors of potent antimicrobial peptides that have been identified in several mammalian species. Prior work has suggested that members of this gene family can participate in host defense through their antimicrobial effects and activate mesenchymal cells during wound repair. To permit further study of these proteins a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction approach was used to identify potential mouse homologs. A full-length 562-base pair cDNA clone was obtained encoding an NH2-terminal prepro domain homologous to other cathelicidins and a unique COOH-terminal peptide. This gene, named Cramp for cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide, was mapped to chromosome 9 at a region of conserved synteny to which genes for cathelicidins have been mapped in pig and man. Northern blot analysis detected a 1-kilobase transcript that was expressed in adult bone marrow and during embryogenesis as early as E12, the earliest stage of blood development. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction also detected CRAMP expression in adult testis, spleen, stomach, and intestine but not in brain, liver, heart, or skeletal muscle. To evaluate further the expression and function of CRAMP, a peptide corresponding to the predicted COOH-terminal region was synthesized. CD spectral analysis showed that CRAMP will form an amphipathic alpha-helix similar to other antimicrobial peptides. Functional studies showed CRAMP to be a potent antibiotic against Gram-negative bacteria by inhibiting growth of a variety of bacterial strains (minimum inhibitory concentrations 0.5-8.0 microM) and by permeabilizing the inner membrane of Escherichia coli directly at 1 microM. Antiserum against CRAMP revealed abundant expression in myeloid precursors and neutrophils. Thus, CRAMP represents the first antibiotic peptide found in cells of myeloid lineage in the mouse. These data suggest that inflammatory cells in the mouse can use a nonoxidative mechanism for microbial killing and permit use of the mouse to study the role such peptides play in host defense and wound repair.
