The concept of small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been extended to include not only short double-stranded RNA of 19-25bp, but also single-stranded antisense RNA of the same length, since such single-stranded antisense siRNAs were recently found to be able to inhibit gene expression as well. We made comprehensive comparison of double- and single-stranded siRNA functions in RNA interference (RNAi), targeting multiple sites and different mRNAs, measuring RNAi effects at different time-points and in different cell lines, and examining response curves. Duplex siRNAs were found to be more potent than single-stranded antisense siRNAs. This was verified by the observation that single-stranded antisense siRNAs, which were inefficient in some cases when used alone, could be rescued from inefficiency by sequentially transfecting with the sense siRNAs. This result suggests that the structural character of siRNA molecules might be a more important determinant of siRNA efficiency than the cellular persistence of them.
