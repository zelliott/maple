Knowledge on antifungal biomolecules is limited compared to antibacterial peptides. A strictly antifungal peptide from the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis named mytimycin (MytM) was reported in 1996 as partial NH(2) 33 amino acid sequence. Using back-translations of the previous sequence, MytM-related nucleotide sequences were identified from a normalized Mytilus galloprovincialis expressed sequence tag library. Primers designed from a consensus sequence have been used to obtain a fragment of 560 nucleotides, including the complete coding sequence of 456 nucleotides. Precursor is constituted by a signal peptide of 23 amino acids, followed by MytM of 54 amino acids (6.2-6.3 kDa, 12 cysteines) and C-terminal extension of 75 amino acids. Only two major amino acid precursor sequences emerged, one shared by M. galloprovincialis from Venice and Vigo, the other belonging to M. galloprovincialis from Palavas, with nine amino acid differences between the two MytM. Predicted disulfide bonds suggested the presence of two constrained domains joined by amino acidic NIFG track. Intriguing was the presence of conserved canonical EF hand-motif located in the C-terminus extension of the precursor. The MytM gene was found interrupted by two introns. Intron 2 existed in two forms, a long (1,112 nucleotides) and a short (716 nucleotides) one resulting from the removal of the central part of the long one. Both the short (GenBank FJ804479) and the long (GenBank FJ804478) genes are simultaneously present in the mussel genome.
