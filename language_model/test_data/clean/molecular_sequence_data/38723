We have cloned a novel gene, Ehm2, that is expressed in high-metastatic but not in low-metastatic K-1735 murine melanoma cells. The Ehm2 gene encodes a protein of 527 amino acid residues, showing up to 41% amino acid identity with the FERM domain of NF2/ERM/4.1 superfamily proteins, which have the function of connecting cell surface transmembrane proteins to cytoskeletal molecules. The Ehm2 gene was mapped to chromosome 4 and was expressed in the liver, lung, kidney, and testis and in 7- to 17-day embryos. The highest level of homology was observed with NBL4, which is a new subfamily protein of the NF2/ERM/4.1 superfamily. A human homologue of the mouse Ehm2 gene, showing significant homology (83% identity), was identified in the genomic DNA and EST databases. Furthermore, seven rat EST clones and one pig EST clone in the GenBank EST database were identified as having 83-92% sequence homology with the cDNA sequence of the mouse Ehm2 gene. Thus, Ehm2 is a highly conserved gene that encodes a novel member of the NF2/ERM/4.1 superfamily proteins.
