The Ah receptor is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-PAS protein and functions as a ligand-activated DNA binding protein directly interacting with target genes by binding to xenobiotic responsive elements. We have sought to identify possible cellular proteins that can interact with the Ah receptor. The bHLH domain of the Ah receptor was fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and the resulting fusion protein was used as a probe to help us to identify receptor associated protein(s). At least one such protein, 45kDa (p45), was detected in mouse liver extracts, but it does not bind to the bHLH domain of the Ah receptor nuclear translocator, nor to the transactivation domain of Ah receptor or GST alone.
