During last ten years in the hypothalamus various neuropeptides have been identified. These peptides play the role of neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, neurohormones, regulator substances in neuroendocrine neurones etc. The last discovery of a novel neuropeptide was determined by experimental results suggested that the ovine hypothalamus contains an unknown substance, which simulated adenylate cyclase level in the pituitary cells culture. This substance is a novel 38 acid peptide named as pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP). Recently PACAP complementary DNA has been cloned in human and some species of mammals. Besides the localization of PACAP-synthetizing neurones have described in the mammalian brain. Moreover PACAP was detected in the hypophysial and general circulation. Since the information about PACAP has not published in Russia. So far the review is dedicated to analyzing of foreign literature as well author's own data on biochemistry, molecular biology, neuroanatomy and physiology of PACAP-synthetizing structures in the hypothalamo-hypophysial neuroendocrine complex.
