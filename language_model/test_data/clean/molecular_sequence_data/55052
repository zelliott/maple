Uruburuella suis is a novel species isolated from lungs and heart of pigs with pneumonia and pericarditis. Phenotypic and phylogenetic evidences showed that it represented a hitherto unknown subline within the family Neisseriaceae. In the present work we defined the whole structure of the LPS isolated from Uruburuella suis. The structural determination, which was achieved by chemical, spectroscopic and spectrometric approaches, indicates a novel rough type lipopolysaccharide rich in negatively charged groups in the lipid A-inner core region. The elucidation of the structural features of the LPS from Uruburuella suis is a first step toward the comprehension of the characteristics of the cell envelope in such new and interesting microorganisms.
