A novel actinomycete strain, YIM 0006(T), was isolated from soil of a tropical rainforest in northern Thailand. The isolate displayed the following characteristics: aerial mycelium is absent, short spore chains are formed directly on the substrate mycelium, contains meso-diaminopimelic acid, arabinose and galactose (cell-wall chemotype IV), the diagnostic phospholipid is phosphatidylcholine, MK-9(H(4)) is the predominant menaquinone and the G+C content of the genomic DNA is 69.0 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic characteristics showed that strain YIM 0006(T) belongs to the family Pseudonocardiaceae but can be distinguished from representatives of all genera classified in the family. The novel genus and species Actinomycetospora chiangmaiensis gen. nov., sp. nov. are proposed, with strain YIM 0006(T) (=CCTCC AA 205017(T) =DSM 45062(T)) as the type strain of Actinomycetospora chiangmaiensis.
