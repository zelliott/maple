Acinetobacter sp. strain M-1 accumulated a large amount of wax esters from an n-alkane under nitrogen-limiting conditions. Under the optimized conditions with n-hexadecane as the substrate, the amount of hexadecyl hexadecanoate in the cells reached 0.17 g/g of cells (dry weight). Electron microscopic analysis revealed that multilayered disk-shaped intracellular inclusions were formed concomitant with wax ester formation. The contribution of acyl-CoA reductase to wax ester synthesis was evaluated by gene disruption analysis.
