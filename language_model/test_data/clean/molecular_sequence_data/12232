Transgalactosylated derivatives of cyclomalto-hexaose (alpha CD), -heptaose (beta CD), and -octaose (gamma CD) were synthesized by alpha-galactosidase from coffee bean using melibiose as a donor and alpha CD, beta CD or gamma CD as an acceptor. Mono- and di-O-alpha-D- galactosylated CDs were isolated and purified by HPLC. Their structures were elucidated by fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS) and 13C NMR spectroscopy. For structural determination of positional isomers of 6(1),6n-di-O-alpha-D-galactosyl-CDs, digestion products with cyclodextrin glucanotransferase were analyzed by HPLC and FABMS.
