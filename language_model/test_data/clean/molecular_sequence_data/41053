Several nucleoside antibiotics from various actinomycetes contain a high-carbon sugar nucleoside that is putatively derived via C-5'-modification of the canonical nucleoside. Two prominent examples are the 5'-C-carbamoyluridine- and 5'-C-glycyluridine-containing nucleosides, both families of which were discovered using screens aimed at finding inhibitors of bacterial translocase I involved in the assembly of the bacterial peptidoglycan cell wall. A shared open reading frame was identified whose gene product is similar to enzymes of the nonheme, Fe(II)-, and α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. The enzyme LipL from the biosynthetic pathway for A-90289, a 5'-C-glycyluridine-containing nucleoside, was functionally characterized as an UMP:α-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, providing the enzymatic imperative for the generation of a nucleoside-5'-aldehdye that serves as a downstream substrate for an aldol or aldol-type reaction leading to the high-carbon sugar scaffold. The functional assignment of LipL and the homologous enzymes-including bioinformatic analysis, iron detection and quantification, and assay development for biochemical characterization-is presented herein.
