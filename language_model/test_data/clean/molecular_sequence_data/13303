Proper maintenance of translational reading frame by ribosomes is essential for cell growth and viability. In the last 10 years it has been shown that a number of viruses induce ribosomes to shift reading frame in order to regulate the expression of gene products having enzymatic functions. Studies on ribosomal frameshifting in viruses of yeast have been particularly enlightening. The roles of viral mRNA sequences and secondary structures have been elucidated and a picture of how these interact with host chromosomal gene products is beginning to emerge. The efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting is important for viral particle assembly, and has identified ribosomal frameshifting as a potential target for antiviral agents. The availability of mutants of host chromosomal gene products involved in maintaining the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting bodes well for the use of yeast in future studies of ribosomal frameshifting.
