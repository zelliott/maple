The detection of methamphetamine and other chemically related illicit drugs relies extensively on immunoassays. Here we report the cloning and affinity maturation of an anti-methamphetamine antibody which is being employed in the current commercial assays. An anti-methamphetamine scFv was cloned from hybridoma cells, expressed in bacteria and its affinity towards methamphetamine and N-ethylamphetamine (ethamphetamine) was determined by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). The anti-methamphetamine scFv gene was subjected to random mutagenesis by error prone PCR and variants with improved affinity were isolated from the resulting library by a novel screening methodology termed Anchored Periplasmic Expression (APEx) [Harvey, B.R., Georgiou, G., Hayhurst, A., Jeong, K.J., Iverson, B.L., Rogers, G.K. (2004). Anchored periplasmic expression, a versatile technology for the isolation of high-affinity antibodies from Escherichia coli-expressed libraries. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 101, 9193.]. The isolated clones exhibited improved affinity to these illicit drugs, yet maintained low cross-reactivity to over-the-counter drugs. In addition, all clones displayed improved expression characteristics in Escherichia coli. The affinity improved scFv antibodies are thus likely to be useful in methamphetamine class immunodiagnostics.
