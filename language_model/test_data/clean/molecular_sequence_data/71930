Glutamine synthetase is a key enzyme in the recycling of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Expression of this enzyme is regulated by glucocorticoids, which induce a high level of glutamine synthetase in neural but not in various non-neural tissues. This is despite the fact that non-neural cells express functional glucocorticoid receptor molecules capable of inducing other target genes. Sequencing and functional analysis of the upstream region of the glutamine synthetase gene identified, 5' to the glucocorticoid response element (GRE), a 21-base pair glutamine synthetase silencer element (GSSE), which showed considerable homology with the neural restrictive silencer element NRSE. The GSSE was able to markedly repress the induction of gene transcription by glucocorticoids in non-neural cells and in embryonic neural retina. The repressive activity of the GSSE could be conferred on a heterologous GRE promoter and was orientation- and position-independent with respect to the transcriptional start site, but appeared to depend on a location proximal to the GRE. Gel-shift assays revealed that non-neural cells and cells of early embryonic retina contain a high level of GSSE binding activity and that this level declines progressively with age. Our results suggest that the GSSE might be involved in the restriction of glutamine synthetase induction by glucocorticoids to differentiated neural tissues.
