Metal-dependent superoxide dismutases (SODs) with a specific requirement for a manganese or iron ion for catalytic activity and copper- and zinc-dependent enzymes are essential for detoxification of superoxide anion radicals. Genome sequence analyses predict the existence of a nickel-dependent enzyme (NiSOD) as the unique SOD in oxygen-evolving marine cyanobacteria. NiSOD activity was observed in Escherichia coli when sodN and sodX (encoding a putative peptidase) from Prochlorococcus marinus MIT9313 were coexpressed.
