During infection with Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the envelope proteins are highly immunogenic and glycoprotein E (gE) is one of the most abundant and antigenic. We have previously identified the immunodominant regions of gE and mapped the B-cell epitopes. In this study, we have evaluated the immunogenicity of recombinant hybrid Ty-virus-like particles (VLPs) carrying amino acids (1-134) or (101-161) of gE which contain the immunodominant sequences. VZV-specific antibodies were detected by ELISA in sera from mice and guinea pigs immunized with either gE(1-134)-VLPs or gE (101-161)-VLPs. The dominant B-cell epitopes, mapped by pepscan analysis of the sera, were found in peptides spanning amino acids 41-60, 56-75, 101-120, 116-135, 131-150 and 141-161. These sera also showed neutralizing activity against VZV in vitro. Epitopes recognized by neutralizing MAbs were mapped to both gE sequences (3B3 MAb recognizing amino acids 141-161 and IFB9 MAb recognizing amino acids 71-90). Lymphocyte proliferative responses to VZV were detected in four different mouse strains immunized with either gE(1-134)-VLPs or gE(101-134)-VLPs in alum. All mouse strains immunized with gE(1-134)-VLPs recognized epitopes in amino acids 11-30 and 71-90 and all those immunized with gE(101-161)-VLPs recognized epitopes in amino acids 91-110 and 106-125. These results indicate that VLPs carrying these gE sequences can prime potent humoral and cellular anti-VZV responses in small animals and warrant further investigation as potential vaccine candidates against varicella-zoster infections.
