The phenotypic characteristic of strain AW-1(T) of Pseudomonas chloritidismutans that is most relevant from the taxonomic point of view appears to be the capacity of growth under anaerobic conditions using chlorate as electron acceptor. This property is not restricted to this species only within the genus Pseudomonas, since it is also present in strains of genomovars 1 or 5, and 3 of Pseudomonas stutzeri. P. chloritidismutans has been described as a non-denitrifying species, but the isolation of variants that are able to grow anaerobically in the presence of nitrate is possible after subcultivation under selective conditions. The subdivision of P. stutzeri into a number of species on the basis of these characteristics does not help to clarify the phylogenetic relationships among the members of an otherwise coherent group of strains, and the considerations presented in this communication support the reclassification of the new species name P. chloritidismutans, which in our opinion, should be considered as a Junior name of P. stutzeri. A multilocus sequence analysis, together with a phenotypic analysis of the anaerobic oxidative metabolism, gives new insights into the phylogeny and evolution of the species.
