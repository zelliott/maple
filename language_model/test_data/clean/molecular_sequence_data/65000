We used differential display to isolate epidermis cDNAs corresponding to juvenile-hormone analog-regulated mRNA from the beetle Tenebrio molitor. One of them encodes a putative extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, named Tenebrin. Indeed, the deduced protein sequence contains ECM typical features like the presence of a signal peptide, internal repeats, a RGD tripeptide sequence motif known to bind integrins and von Willebrand factor type c domains involved in protein-protein interactions. Northern blot analysis reveals a single transcript of about 11 kb with an expression pattern correlated to 20-hydroxyecdysone fluctuations during metamorphosis. In vivo injections of exogenous 20-hydroxyecdysone alone or combined with cycloheximide show that Tenebrin expression is directly induced by this hormone. Methoprene (a juvenile hormone analog) application experiments show that Tenebrin expression is rapidly induced by this analog. This gene is still up-regulated in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor but, in these conditions, the mRNA induction level is not maximal.
