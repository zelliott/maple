HIV-1 subtype C is predominant in India and globally. In the present study, we analyze HIV-1 subtype C regulatory protein Nef sequences from five recent Indian seroconverters and five long-term survivors (LTSs) for variability at crucial functional domains. Sequence analysis suggested the possibility of using regulatory gene sequences for viral subtyping and evolutionary studies apart from structural genes. In the phylogenetic tree, Indian nef sequences segregated away from other reported subtype C sequences, forming an Indian subclade within subtype C. Our studies also suggested no evidence for the association of truncated Nef with slow progression of disease, as all LTSs had intact Nef. We could identify some variations in juxtapositions to crucial functional domains, especially in seroconverter sequences, when comparing them with others. In phylogenetic analysis, specifically for the base-pair regions 411-428 and 478-525, our seroconverter sequences segregated away from those reported earlier in the literature, indicating specific evolutionary changes in these conserved regions of nef in currently circulating viruses. But the dN/dS ratio for our samples was less than one on comparing them with reported subtype C and representative sequences of different clades, strongly emphasizing the necessity of sequence conservation at different disease stages and even across clades. HLA-I binding epitope predictions for common Indian HLAs indicated that specific mutations in seroconverter Nef may alter the intensity of epitope binding, which may alter the outcome of the immune response. Hence these data would be useful in designing Nef epitopes to be included in multi-epitope HIV-1 vaccine for the Indian population and would also be of immense help in HIV-1 evolutionary studies.
