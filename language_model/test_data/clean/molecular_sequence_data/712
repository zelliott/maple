C3HC4-type RING finger genes comprise a large family in the plant kingdom and play important roles in various physiologic processes of plant life. In this study, we identified 29 C3HC4-type RING finger family genes in rice (Oryza sativa) by database search. Motif analysis revealed the presence of three conserved motifs with unknown functions within the predicted proteins. Promoter analysis found 196 cis-elements in the 2-kb upstream regions of these genes, including a stress-responsive element, a hormone-responsive element, and a light-responsive element. In addition, a comprehensive expression analysis of these genes has been performed using microarray data obtained from 27 tissues or organs of three rice genotypes, Minghui 63, Zhenshan 97, and Shanyou 63. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed that five C3HC4-type RING finger genes are preferentially expressed in reproductive tissues or organs such as stamen, panicle, and endosperm. Expression analysis of C3HC4-type RING finger genes under abiotic stresses suggests that twelve genes are differentially regulated by hormones or stress in rice seedlings. These results would be useful for elucidating their roles in the growth, development, and stress response of the rice plant.
