Leucine dehydrogenase [EC 1.4.1.9] was purified to homogeneity from Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum ICR 2210. The enzyme consisted of a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of about 34,000. Stepwise Edman degradation provided the N-terminal sequence of the first 24 amino acids, and carboxypeptidase Y digestion provided the C-terminal sequence of the last 2 amino acids. Although the enzyme catalyzed the reversible deamination of various branched-chain L-amino acids, L-valine was the best substrate for oxidative deamination at pH 10.9 and the saturated concentration. The enzyme, however, had higher reactivity for L-leucine, and the kcat/Km value for L-leucine was higher than that for L-valine. The enzyme required NAD+ as a natural coenzyme. The NAD+ analogs 3-acetylpyridine-NAD+ and deamino-NAD+ were much better coenzymes than NAD+. The enzyme activity was significantly reduced by sulfhydryl reagents and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. D-Enantiomers of the substrate amino acids competitively inhibited the oxidation of L-valine.
