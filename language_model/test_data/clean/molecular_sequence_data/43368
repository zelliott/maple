Laminin trimers composed of alpha, beta, and gamma chains are major components of basal laminae (BLs) throughout the body. To date, three alpha chains (alpha1-3) have been shown to assemble into at least seven heterotrimers (called laminins 1-7). Genes encoding two additional alpha chains (alpha4 and alpha5) have been cloned, but little is known about their expression, and their protein products have not been identified. Here we generated antisera to recombinant alpha4 and alpha5 and used them to identify authentic proteins in tissue extracts. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting showed that alpha4 and alpha5 assemble into four novel laminin heterotrimers (laminins 8-11: alpha4beta1gamma1, alpha4beta2gamma1, alpha5beta1gamma1, and alpha5beta2gamma1, respectively). Using a panel of nucleotide and antibody probes, we surveyed the expression of alpha1-5 in murine tissues. All five chains were expressed in both embryos and adults, but each was distributed in a distinct pattern at both RNA and protein levels. Overall, alpha4 and alpha5 exhibited the broadest patterns of expression, while expression of alpha1 was the most restricted. Immunohistochemical analysis of kidney, lung, and heart showed that the alpha chains were confined to extracellular matrix and, with few exceptions, to BLs. All developing and adult BLs examined contained at least one alpha chain, all alpha chains were present in multiple BLs, and some BLs contained two or three alpha chains. Detailed analysis of developing kidney revealed that some individual BLs, including those of the tubule and glomerulus, changed in laminin chain composition as they matured, expressing up to three different alpha chains and two different beta chains in an elaborate and dynamic progression. Interspecific backcross mapping of the five alpha chain genes revealed that they are distributed on four mouse chromosomes. Finally, we identified a novel full-length alpha3 isoform encoded by the Lama3 gene, which was previously believed to encode only truncated chains. Together, these results reveal remarkable diversity in BL composition and complexity in BL development.
