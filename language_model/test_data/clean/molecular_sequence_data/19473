Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and high-resolution (1)H and (13)C NMR spectral data for methyl 3,4-di-O-acetyl-1,5-anhydro-2-deoxy-D-arabino-hex-1-enopyranuronate are reported. The (5)H(4) conformation was found to be the preferred form for this glycal, both in the crystal lattice and in solution. The factors determining the (4)H(5)<==>(5)H(4) conformational equilibrium for acetylated glycals are discussed.
