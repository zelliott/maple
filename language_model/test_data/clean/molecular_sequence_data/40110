Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling is required for otic placode induction and patterning of the developing inner ear. We have cloned the chick ortholog of Fgf16 and analyzed its expression pattern in the early chick embryo. Expression is restricted to the otic placode and developing inner ear through all the stages examined. By the closed otocyst stage, expression has resolved to anterior and posterior domains that partially overlap with those of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4), a marker of the developing sensory patches, the cristae of the anterior and posterior semicircular canals. Platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFA), another growth factor with restricted otic expression, also overlaps with Fgf16 expression. The restricted expression pattern of Fgf16 suggests a role for FGF signaling in the patterning of the sensory cristae, together with BMP signaling.
