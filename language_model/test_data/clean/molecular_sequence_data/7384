Cyanobacteria produce toxins that kill animals. The two main classes of cyanobacterial toxins are cyclic peptides that cause liver damage and alkaloids that block nerve transmission. Many toxin-producing strains from Finnish lakes were brought into axenic culture, and their toxins were characterized. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, probing with a short tandemly repeated DNA sequence found at many locations in the chromosome of Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120, distinguishes hepatotoxic Anabaena isolates from neurotoxin-producing strains and from Nostoc spp.
