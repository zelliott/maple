Apolipoprotein (apo)B mRNA editing is a novel mechanism for the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in mammals. It consists of a C-->U conversion of the first base of the codon CAA, encoding glutamine-2153, to UAA, an in-frame stop codon, in apoB mRNA. Since its initial description in 1987, substantial progress has been made in the last few years on the mechanism of editing. Apobec-1, the catalytic component of the apoB mRNA editing enzyme complex, has been cloned. This article begins with an overview of the general biology of apoB mRNA editing. It then provides an in-depth analysis of the structure, evolution and possible mechanism of action of apobec-1. ApoB mRNA editing is the prototype of RNA editing in mammals. What we learn from apoB mRNA editing will be useful in our understanding of other examples of RNA editing in vertebrates which are being described with increasing frequency.
