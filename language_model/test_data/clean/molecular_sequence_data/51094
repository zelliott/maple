The interaction between fibrinogen gamma-peptide 392-411, LTIGEGQQHHLGGAKQAGDV, and monoclonal antibody 4A5, an antibody with a high affinity for both for the peptide and native fibrinogen, is being studied as a model for peptide-antibody interaction. Two-dimensional NMR studies of the free peptide at pH 5.2 indicated the presence of a significant population, about 60%, of type II beta-turn, spanning residues Gln407-Asp410. At pH 2.7, little, if any, turn structure is present. The D-Ala409 analog, which, for steric reasons, would be expected to preserve the beta-turn, and the L-Ala409 analog, which would not be expected to have this conformational feature, were synthesized, and NMR studies confirmed the respective structural predictions. The affinity of the D-Ala analog for antibody 4A5 is even greater than that displayed by native gamma 392-411, while the affinity of the L-Ala analog is less than one-tenth that of the native peptide. Both conformational and steric effects involving residues 407-410 may be important in recognition by antibody 4A5. Since gamma 392-411 includes a platelet receptor binding locus of fibrinogen, and this and related peptides are inhibitors of platelet aggregation, the D-Ala409 and L-Ala409 analogs were tested for platelet binding. Neither of the analogs displays any measurable platelet binding, indicating that the recognition requirements for the platelet receptor differ considerably from those for antibody 4A5.
