Motility of the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. C-125, a flagellate bacterium, was demonstrated to be Na(+)- and pH-dependent. Flagellin protein from this strain was purified to homogeneity and the N-terminal sequence determined. Using the hag gene of Bacillus subtilis as a probe, the hag gene of Bacillus sp. C-125 was identified and cloned into Escherichia coli. Sequencing of this hag gene revealed that it encodes a protein of 272 amino acids (M(r) 29,995). The predicted N terminal sequence of this protein was identical to that determined by N-terminal sequencing of the flagellin protein from strain C-125. The alkalophilic Bacillus sp. C-125 flagellin shares homology with other known flagellins in both the N- and C-terminal regions. The middle portion, however, shows considerable differences, even from that of flagellin from the related species, B. subtilis.
