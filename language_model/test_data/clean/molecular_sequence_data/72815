A novel full-length cDNA showing homology with rho genes was isolated from a human placenta cDNA library. Sequencing of a total of 1086 nucleotides of this clone revealed an open reading frame of 630 nucleotides (210 amino acids). In view of its degree of homology to members of the Rho family of molecules (50-54% identical amino acids, 60-63% identical nucleotides within the coding region), the predicted product was designated RhoHP1(Rho-related protein HP1). Northern analysis indicated that a message about 1.2-kb long is expressed in human heart, placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas and, with weaker intensity, in several other tissues.
