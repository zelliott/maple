The Klebsiella pneumoniae mdcR gene, which encodes a LysR-type regulator, was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Purified MdcR was found to bind specifically to the control region of either the malonate decarboxylase (mdc) genes or mdcR. We have also demonstrated that MdcR is an activator of the expression of the mdc genes, whereas it represses the transcription of the putative control region of mdcR, PmdcR, indicating a negative autoregulatory control.
