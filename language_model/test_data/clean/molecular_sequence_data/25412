The conformational properties of the cyclic dinucleotide d less than pApA greater than were studied by means of molecular mechanics calculations in which a multiconformation analysis was combined with minimum energy calculations. In this approach models of possible conformers are built by varying the torsion angles of the molecule systematically. These models are then subjected to energy minimization; in the present investigation use was made of the AMBER Force field. It followed that the lowest energy conformer has a pseudo-two-fold axis of symmetry. In this conformer the deoxyribose sugars adopt a N-type conformation. The conformation of the sugar-phosphate backbone is determined by the following torsion angles: alpha +, beta t, gamma +, epsilon t and zeta +. The conformation of this ringsystem corresponds to the structure derived earlier by means of NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The observation of a preference for N-type sugar conformations in this molecule can be explained by the steric hindrance induced between opposite H3' atoms when one sugar is switched from N- to S-type puckers. The sugars can in principle switch from N- to S-type conformations, but this requires at least the transition of gamma + to gamma -. In this process the molecule obtains an extended shape in which the bases switch from a pseudo-axial to a pseudo-equatorial position. The calculations demonstrate that, apart from the results obtained for the lowest energy conformation, the 180 degrees change in the propagation direction of the phosphate backbone can be achieved by several different combinations of the backbone torsion angles. It appeared that in the low energy conformers five higher order correlations are found. The combination of torsion angles which are involved in changes in the propagation direction of the sugar-phosphate backbone in DNA-hairpin loops and in tRNA, are found in the dataset obtained for cyclic d less than pApA greater than. It turns out, that in the available examples, 180 degrees changes in the backbone direction are localized between two adjacent nucleotides.
