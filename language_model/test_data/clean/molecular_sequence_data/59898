The maturation of the 2S albumin, napin, in Brassica napus L. involves removal of an amino-terminal and an internal propeptide. Pulse-chase experiments with B. napus embryos showed that intermediates are detectable during the pronapin processing. Intact pronapin was expressed by baculovirus in Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells in order to obtain substrate for studying the processing event. Processing of pronapin with a crude B. napus embryo protein extract resulted in several fragments of similar sizes to those of napin heavy and light chains. The character of the major processing activity in the B. napus extract suggested that it was due to an aspartic proteinase. A secondary activity indicated an additional endoproteinase involved in the pronapin processing. Limited proteolysis of pronapin with a purified aspartic proteinase from Hordeum vulgare showed that cleavage occurred exclusively in the prosequences. The cleavage products formed in-vitro requires additional trimming of the propeptides in order to obtain the subunits of mature napin.
