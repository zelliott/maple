The aim of this study was to gain further insight into the evolution and classification of hepatitis C virus (HCV) by assessing the subtype distribution of 273 genotype 2 strains isolated from French blood donors from 1990 to 2010 and by determining complete coding sequences in subtype 2 strains. These classified into 7 of the established subtypes and into 15 additional lineages not yet assigned to a known subtype. Phylogenetic tree construction showed two well-supported clusters. Cluster 1 included most subtype 2 strains while cluster 2 included subtype 2l and one unassigned subtype 2. Full genome sequencing was performed on 15 genotype 2 strains belonging to both clusters, that is, one subtype 2b, two subtype 2c, three subtype 2i, two subtype 2j, one subtype 2k, two subtype 2l, and four unassigned strains. Genomes included a 9042- to 9108-nucleic acid open reading frame coding for a polyprotein comprising 3014-3036 amino acids. Mean nucleotide distances between subtypes belonging to the first cluster was 20.2 ± 1.4% while the mean distance between the two clusters was 25.9 ± 0.3%. Analysis indicated that the bifurcation between subtype 2l and other subtype 2 strains occurred early in the evolutionary process. Subtype 2l retained a genomic feature characteristic of non-genotype 2, that is, absence of the 60-nucleotide insertion in the NS5A region. This finding suggests that appearance and fixation of this insertion occurred late in the evolutionary history of HCV type 2 and that its absence is an ancestral feature of HCV.
