A cDNA library was constructed from white spot syndrome virus (WSSV)-infected penaeid shrimp tissue. cDNA clones with WSSV inserts were isolated and sequenced. By comparison with DNA sequences in GenBank, cDNA clones containing sequence identical to those of the WSSV envelope protein VP28 and nucleoprotein VP15 were identified. Poly(A) sites in the mRNAs of VP28 and VP15 were identified. Genes encoding the major viral structural proteins VP28, VP26, VP24, VP19 and VP15 of 5 WSSV isolates collected from different shrimp species and/or geographical areas were sequenced and compared with those of 4 other WSSV isolate sequences in GenBank. For each of the viral structural protein genes compared, the nucleotide sequences were 100 to 99% identical among the 9 isolates. Gene probes or PCR primers based on the gene sequences of the WSSV structural proteins can be used for diagnoses and/or detection of WSSV infection.
