Calcitonin gene-related polypeptide (CGRP) was purified from ovine hypothalamic extracts. Its amino acid sequence was determined as: Ser-(Cys)-Asn-Thr-Ala-Thr-(Cys)-Val-Thr-His-Arg-Leu-Ala-Gly-Leu-Leu-Ser- Arg-Ser - Gly-Gly-Val-Val-Lys-Ser-Asn-Phe-Val-Pro-Thr-Asn-Val-Gly-Ser-Gln-Ala-Phe- NH2. This sequence differs from rat CGRP by two amino acid substitutions (Ser for Asp25 and Gln for Glu35). Adenylate cyclase stimulating activity in rat pituitary cell cultures was monitored during the isolation. CGRP had adenylate cyclase stimulating activity comparable to corticotropin-releasing hormone, suggesting a hypophysiotropic role for CGRP. This is the first chemical characterization of CGRP in the brain (hypothalamus).
