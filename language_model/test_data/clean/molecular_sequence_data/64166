Forum domains are 50-150 kb DNA fragments that are released during spontaneous fragmentation of chromosomes. They are separated by islands of putative heterochromatin boundary regions. The SuUR protein, which is involved in the control of chromosome organization, is localized exclusively in heterochromatin and often colocalizes on chromosomes with Polycomb group proteins. To test whether the SuUR protein is associated with boundary regions, we used gel retardation assays and found that the SuUR protein binds specifically to boundary regions and that boundary regions are under-replicated. These results suggest that the regular distribution of boundary regions in chromosomes may represent the dispersion of sites designed for chromosomal silencing.
