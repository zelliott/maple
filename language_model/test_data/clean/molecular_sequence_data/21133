A Gram-negative anaerobic microorganism, MRG-1, isolated from human intestine showed high activities of deglycosylation and reduction of daidzin, based on rapid TLC analysis. A rod-shaped strain MRG-1 was identified as a new species showing 91.0% homology to Coprobacillus species, based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis. The strain MRG-1 showed Î²-glucosidase activity toward daidzin and genistin, and daidzein and genistein were produced, respectively. However, the strain MRG-1 did not react with flavone glycosides, flavanone glycosides, and isoflavone C-glucoside. Besides, MRG-1 showed stereoselective reductase activity to isoflavone, daidzein, genistein, 7-hydroxyisoflavone, and formononetin, resulting in the formation of corresponding R-isoflavanone enantiomers. The new isoflavanones of 7-hydroxyisoflavanone and dihydroformononetin were characterized by NMR, and the absolute configurations of the enantiomers were determined with CD spectroscopy. The kinetic study of the anaerobic biotransformation showed both activities were exceptionally fast compared to the reported conversion by other anaerobic bacteria.
