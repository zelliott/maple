To obtain the full-length cDNA sequence of Secoisolariciresinol Dehydrogenase gene from Dysosma versipellis by RACE PCR,then investigate the character of Secoisolariciresinol Dehydrogenase gene.

The full-length cDNA sequence of Secoisolariciresinol Dehydrogenase gene was obtained by 3'-RACE and 5'-RACE from Dysosma versipellis.

We first reported the full cDNA sequences of Secoisolariciresinol Dehydrogenase in Dysosma versipellis. The acquired gene was 991bp in full length, including 5' untranslated region of 42bp, 3' untranslated region of 112bp with Poly (A). The open reading frame (ORF) encoding 278 amino acid with molecular weight 29253.3 Daltons and isolectric point 6.328. The gene accession nucleotide sequence number in GeneBank was EU573789. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the Secoisolariciresinol Dehydrogenase gene was highly expressed in stem. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of Secoisolariciresinol Dehydrogenase indicated there may be some significant amino acid sequence difference among different species.
