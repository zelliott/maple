The interleukin-11 receptor alpha-chain, a member of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily, forms, together with gp130, a functional high-affinity receptor complex for interleukin 11. We, and others, reported the cloning of the murine interleukin 11 receptor alpha-chain cDNA (IL11Ra) and recently described the structure of the IL11Ra locus. We also described the presence of a second IL11Ra-like locus in some mouse strains. In this study we report that the second locus, designated IL11Ra2, encodes an mRNA species. The transcript was 99% identical to the IL11Ra transcript in the coding and 3'-untranslated region, but had a different 5'-untranslated region. The complete genomic organization of the IL11Ra2 locus is presented, and the two loci are shown to be located on a 200-kb NaeI genomic fragment. Comparison of the expression pattern of the IL11Ra and IL11Ra2 genes using an RT-PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism strategy revealed that while the expression of IL11Ra was widespread, expression of IL11Ra2 was restricted to testis, lymph node, and thymus.
