Base pairing between the RNA components of box H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs) and sequences in other eukaryotic RNAs target specific uridines for pseudouridylation. An RNA called HJ1 has been developed that interacts with the rRNA sequence targeted by the 5' pseudouridylation pocket of human U65 snoRNA the same way as intact U65 snoRNA. Sequences on both strands of the analog of the U65 snoRNP pseudouridylation pocket in HJ1 pair with its substrate sequence, and the resulting complex, called HJ3, is strongly stabilized by Mg(2+). The solution structure of HJ3 reveals an Omega-shaped RNA interaction motif that has not previously been described, which is likely to be common to all box H/ACA snoRNP-substrate complexes. The topology of the complex explains why the access of substrate sequences to snoRNPs is facile and how uridine selection may occur when these complexes form.
