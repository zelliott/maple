SOX genes share a high sequence identity with the HMG box present in the testis determining gene SRY. We have identified a HMG box-like sequence motif on six contiguous cosmids, which cross-hybridize to a SOX9 cDNA probe. A data base search revealed a high similarity of the deduced amino acid sequence to the human SOX12 and the murine Sox16 HMG domains. The cosmids were assigned to chromosome 17p13 by FISH analysis.
