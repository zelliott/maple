Uncoupling proteins (UCP) are known to transport anions, such as Cl-, in addition to H+ transport. Although H+ transport by UCP is clearly involved in thermogenesis, the mechanism of its anion transport is not clearly understood. In this study, we examined the anion channel characteristics of the six individual helical transmembrane (TM) domains of the human UCP2. The second TM domain peptide (TM2) forms multi-state channels by assemblies of conductive oligomers. Furthermore, the TM2 exhibited voltage-dependent anion channels with properties comparable to those of UCP1 chloride channel. However, the other five TM peptides did not form UCP1-like channels. Moreover, an analog of TM2 in which two Arg residues were substituted by Ala residues did not form stable channels, implying the significance of Arg residues for anion transport. These results suggest that the anion channel structure of UCP2 protein is oligomeric and the second TM domain is essential for the voltage-dependence of this anion channel.
