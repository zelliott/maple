From a human fetal-brain cDNA library we isolated two novel genes encoding peptides containing six EGF-like repeats. Both showed significant homologies with nel, a gene strongly expressed in neural tissues of chicken. The cDNAs, designated NELL1 (nel-like, type 1) and NELL2 (nel-like, type 2), contained open reading frames encoding 810 and 816 amino acids, respectively. NELL2 is strongly expressed in brain of adult and fetus but only weakly in fetal kidney. NELL1 and NELL2 were mapped by FISH to chromosomal bands 11p15.1-p15.2 and 12q13.11-q13.12, respectively.
