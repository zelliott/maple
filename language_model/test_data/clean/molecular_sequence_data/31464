A novel Gram-stain-positive, non-motile, rod-shaped bacterium, designated 5GHs34-4(T), was isolated from greenhouse soil in Yongin, Republic of Korea. Growth occurred in the temperature range of 10-37 °C (optimum 28-30 °C) and at pH 5.0-9.0 (optimum pH 7.0). It can tolerate up to 3 % (w/v) NaCl. The strain showed 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity levels of 95.1-97.0 % with species of the genus Leifsonia, 95.7-96.7 % with species of the genus Herbiconiux, 95.1-96.4 % with species of the genus Salinibacterium and 96.1 % with Labedella gwakjiensis and Homoserinimonas aerilata. The highest sequence similarities (97.0 %) were with Leifsonia aquatica JCM 1368(T), Leifsonia poae VKM Ac-1401(T) and Leifsonia psychrotolerans LI1(T). The peptidoglycan type determined for strain 5GHs34-4(T) was B2γ with dl-2,4-diaminobutyric acid at position 3. The murein was of the acetyl type. The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and two unknown glycolipids. The menaquinones detected were MK-13, MK-12 and MK-14, and the major fatty acids were summed feature 8 (C18 : 1ω7c and/or C18 : 1ω6c), anteiso-C17 : 0 and anteiso-C15 : 0. The phenotypic and phylogenetic traits of strain 5GHs34-4(T) differed in some respects from those of members of the family Microbacteriaceae. Therefore, strain 5GHs34-4(T) is considered to represent a novel species of a new genus in the family Microbacteriaceae, for which the name Rudaibacter terrae gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 5GHs34-4(T) ( = KACC 15523(T) = NBRC 108754(T)).
