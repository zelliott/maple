A multidimensional chromatographic regimen was used to isolate and purify alpha-neo-endorphin-like immunoreactive material from guinea pig small intestine. Microsequence analysis of the material obtained showed that the sequence of this peptide in guinea pig is the same as that previously reported for pig and rat, namely: H-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu-Arg-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Lys(OH). Thus, the sequence of alpha-neo-endorphin is conserved in all species thus far examined.
