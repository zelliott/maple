Six cases of angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy with dysproteinemia (AILD)-like T cell lymphoma were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot analysis. Five cases out of six showed gene rearrangements of the T cell receptor beta chain, indicating the existence of a clonal T cell proliferation. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA was detected in all six AILD type cases by PCR amplifying the sequence located in the internal repeat I, and confirmed by Southern blot hybridization, using a BamHI-W fragment as a probe. Detection of the EBV genome occurred more frequently as compared with other types of lymphoid disorders. Furthermore, EBV determined nuclear antigen (EBNA) was detected in UCHL-1 (CD45RO, pan-T cell marker) positive cells by immunostaining. These results suggest that a significant number of AILD type cases are T cell origin lymphomas and EBV infection may be relevant to the biological features of this type of lymphoma.
