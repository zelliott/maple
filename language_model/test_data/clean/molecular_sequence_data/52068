In the carbodiimide mediated coupling of Z-Gly-L-Val-OH with H-L-Val-OMe in DMF, the simultaneous use of HOBt and copper(II) chloride as additives was found to give the desired peptide in a high yield without racemization. In the presence of HOBt, reducing the amount of copper(II) chloride produced a higher yield. Besides improving the coupling efficiency as compared with the case using copper(II) chloride alone as an additive, the present procedure offered another advantage for racemization suppression. Thus, even for the couplings where a low level of racemization was observed in the presence of copper(II) chloride, the simultaneous addition of HOBt and copper(II) chloride resulted in the elimination of racemization. The effectiveness of this new procedure using the two carbodiimide additives in the synthesis of biologically active peptides was assessed by the preparation of a protected Leu-enkephalin. In the 4 + 1 segment condensation using HOBt and copper(II) chloride simultaneously as additives, no racemization was detected and the yield was high enough. The elimination of racemization and improvement of coupling efficiency produced by the present procedure can be attributable to a reduced tendency for the activated forms of the carboxyl component to form a 5(4H)-oxazolone by the action of HOBt, and to the prevention of racemization by copper(II) chloride of the small amount of the oxazolone formed which is not eliminated by the action of HOBt alone.
