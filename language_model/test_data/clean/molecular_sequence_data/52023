Using single-strand conformation polymorphism electrophoresis, heteroduplex analysis, and direct sequencing, we have searched for possible disease-causing mutations in the adRP family in which we originally found tight linkage of the disease to 6p. We have now identified a single base change in exon 2, which results in the replacement of a serine residue at codon 212 for a glycine residue. The mutation cosegregates with the disease with a lod score of 12.1 at theta = 0.0.
