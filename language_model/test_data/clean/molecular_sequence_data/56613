The DNA base sequence changes induced by diethyl sulfate (DES) were analyzed in postmeiotic male germ cells of Drosophila melanogaster. 31 transmissible vermilion mutants were recovered in F1 and F2 generations, with a frequency of 2.6 x 10(-4) for the F1, and of 1.8-13 x 10(-4) for the F2. The results show that DES induces both base pair substitutions (93%) and deletions (7%). In accord with its relatively high ability to alkylate oxygens in DNA, the most frequent type of sequence alteration among the basepair changes are GC-AT transitions, accounting for 73% of mutations, followed by transversions AT-TA (10%). DES also induced AT-GC transitions and AT-CG transversions. Both induced deletions were intralocus deletions, not occurring between basepair repeats. No influence of neighboring bases on the mutation position was found.
