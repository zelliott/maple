Extracts of Chlamydia psittaci and Chlamydia trachomatis were used to transcribe molecularly cloned chlamydial genes in vitro. The extracts were prepared by lysing reticulate bodies, obtaining the 10,000 x g centrifugation pellet, and eluting RNA polymerase from the pellet by treatment with 2M KCl to yield a fraction designated SS2. Some in vitro transcription was initiated from non-chlamydial promoters and a small amount of transcription was from endogenous DNA template in SS2. However, optimal transcription from exogenous templates required chlamydial promoter sequences, and primer extension analysis indicated that chlamydia promoter-specific in vitro transcription was initiated from the same start sites recognized in vivo. A monoclonal antibody that was generated against Escherichia coli sigma 70 and which immunologically cross-reacts with C. trachomatis sigma 66 inhibited in vitro transcription of vector and cloned chlamydial DNA, suggesting that transcriptional initiation in the SS2 fraction is mediated by sigma 66. An in vitro transcription assay based on detection of transcripts of specific lengths was applied to the chlamydial system; this assay and others described here should be useful in defining chlamydial promoters and other transcriptional regulatory elements.
