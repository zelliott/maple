rZIP is an approx. 32 kDa, multi-domain protein of Dictyostelium discoideum whose structural motifs include a RING (zinc-binding) domain, a leucine zipper, a glutamine repeat, an SH3-binding region and a consensus phosphorylation site for MAP kinase. In vitro, rZIP forms homodimers and interacts specifically with the SH3 domain(s) of the Nck adaptor protein. rZIP is expressed maximally during cell differentiation at approximately equivalent levels in all cells. Disruption of the rZIP gene rzpA results in altered cellular aggregation, impaired slug migration, and aberrant patterning of prespore and prestalk cells, the major progenitor classes. In rzpA- strains, prespore-specific genes are overexpressed and prestalk expression zones are reduced. Conversely, constitutive overexpression of rzpA markedly decreases prespore-specific gene expression and significantly increases the expression of prestalk-specific genes. Further, induced transdifferentiation of prespore cells into prestalk cells is inhibited in rzpA-slugs. In light of these patterning defects, we suggest that the RING/zipper protein rZIP plays an important role in early cell fate decisions in Dictyostelium, acting as a positive regulator of prestalk differentiation and an inhibitor of prespore differentiation.
