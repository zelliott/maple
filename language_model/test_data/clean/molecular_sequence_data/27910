Two tyrosine-O-sulfate containing cholecystokinin-related peptides were synthetized, i.e. the undeca- and the dodecapeptide amide corresponding to the C-terminus of this gut hormone; in the undecapeptide the N-terminal serine was O-substituted with the 2-deoxy-alpha-D-galactosyl group. Within the limits of error of the biological assay systems the two CCK peptides exhibited potencies in stimulating amylase secretion from dispersed rat pancreatic acini comparable to those of the CCK deca-, nona- and octapeptide.
