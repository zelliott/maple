The variability of Kluyveromyces lactis strains in sensitivity to glucose is correlated with genetic differences in Kluyveromyces hexose transporter (KHT) genes. The glucose sensitive strain JA6 was shown to contain an additional gene, KHT2, not found in strains that are less sensitive. KHT2 is tandemly arranged with KHT1 which is identical to the low-affinity transporter gene RAG1, except for the C-terminus. Sequence analysis indicated that most of KHT2 had been lost by a recombination event between KHT1 and KHT2 generating the chimeric gene RAG1. Recombination between KHT1 and KHT2 was also found in mutants of JA6 selected as 2-deoxyglucose resistant colonies. These mutants, like kht1 kht2 double mutants were unable to grow on glucose when respiration was blocked (Rag- phenotype) and glucose repression was strongly reduced. kht1 or kht2 single mutants of JA6 were Rag+ but still an influence of the kht mutations on glucose repression was detectable. Repression was not affected in a Rag- mutant deleted for the phosphoglucose isomerase gene suggesting that the influence of transporter genes on repression is not caused by a reduction of the glycolytic flux. The data rather suggest that sensitivity to glucose repression is dependent on the rate of glucose uptake.
