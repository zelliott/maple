ycf33 encodes a small protein with a molecular mass of 7.5 kDa and is found from cyanobacteria to higher plants. A ycf33 deletion mutant was constructed in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and characterized. The mutant showed a higher phycobilisome/chlorophyll ratio than the wild type and a higher photosystem II/photosystem I fluorescence ratio measured at 77 K. Under photoautotrophic conditions, the growth rates were not much different from those of the wild type. Cyclic electron transport activities around photosystem I were not much different between the wild type and the mutant. However, the effects of diphenyleneiodonium, an inhibitor of flavoprotein, on cyclic electron transport in the mutant were different from those in the wild type; it was severely inhibited in the wild type but not much in the mutant. Together with the effects of nitrite, which accepts electrons from ferredoxin via nitrite reductase and those of HgCl2, it was suggested that the pathway of cyclic electron transport is altered in the mutant.
