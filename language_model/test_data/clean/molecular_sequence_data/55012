The mode of thioether macrocyclization of peptides containing an N-terminal 2-chloroacetyl group and two or three competing cysteine residues at downstream positions has been extensively studied, leading to a strategy for designated formation of overlapping-bicyclic peptides or dumbbell-type bicyclic peptides.
