The possible role of centrally administered tetrapeptide FMRFamide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2) on gastric acid secretion in pylorus ligated rats was investigated. Intracerebroventricularly administered FMRFamide stimulated the gastric acid secretion in a dose-dependent manner. This stimulatory effect was abolished by vagotomy and atropine pretreatment. The presence of FMRFamide in rat brain and the ability of FMRFamide to stimulate gastric acid secretion suggest that FMRFamide plays a physiological role in brain modulation of gastric acid secretion.
