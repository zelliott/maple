Recently we found that the human papillary renal cell carcinoma-associated protein PRCC interacts with the cell cycle control protein Mad2B, and translocates this protein to the nucleus where it exerts its mitotic checkpoint function. Here we have successfully isolated Xenopus laevis Mad2B and PRCC cDNAs. The full-length xMad2B cDNA encodes a 211 amino acid protein that is highly homologous to human Mad2B, thus pointing to an important function for this protein in higher eukaryotes. The full-length xPRCC cDNA encodes a 544 amino acid protein. Remarkably, this protein contains an amino-terminal region distinct from that in mouse and human, whereas the C-terminal region is highly conserved. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses revealed a relatively low expression of both xMad2B and xPRCC in most tissues examined. However, an abundant expression was observed in testis and oocyte, indicating a role in meiotic division processes. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that, despite its distinct amino terminus, the xPRCC-protein is still capable of interacting with xMad2B and of shuttling this protein to the nucleus. Therefore, the well-established animal model Xenopus laevis can be used as a powerful system to study in detail the role of xPRCC and xMad2B in the intricate processes of cell cycle control.
