Molecular cloning of the Cux-1 isolate of chicken anemia virus (CAV), which had been passaged 173 times in cell culture, resulted in the isolation of an attenuated strain, designated cloned isolate 10, which reverted to virulence following 10 passages in young chicks (D. Todd, T. J. Connor, V. M. Calvert, J. L. Creelan, B. M. Meehan, and M. S. McNulty, Avian Pathol. 24:171-187, 1995). The attenuated cloned isolate 10 differs from the molecularly cloned pathogenic Cux-1 isolate in that it possesses a 21-nucleotide insertion within the nontranscribed region of the CAV genome and 17 individual nucleotide substitutions dispersed throughout the genome. Comparative analyses with other published CAV sequences indicated that cloned isolate 10 was unique at nine nucleotide positions and at five amino acid positions. The molecular basis of the attenuation exhibited by cloned isolate 10 was investigated by evaluating the pathogenicities of two sets of complementary chimeric viruses. These sets were produced by transfection with chimeric double-stranded replicative-form (RF) DNA equivalents that contained DNA sequences derived from cloned isolate 10 and the pathogenic cloned Cux-1 isolate. The construction of the chimeric RFs exploited the occurrence of unique EcoRI, PstI, and BamHI restriction sites, which allowed their respective circular CAV RFs to be manipulated as three restriction fragments of 0.58, 0.93, and 0.71 kbp. Examination of the levels of anemia and gross pathology in the thymuses and bone marrows of 14 day-old specific-pathogen-free chicks following infection of 1-day-old chicks with the chimeric and cloned parental isolates indicated that nucleotide changes in each of the three genomic regions contributed towards attenuation. The significance of this result to the development and use of live attenuated CAV vaccines is discussed.
