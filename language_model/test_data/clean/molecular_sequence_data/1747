Knowledge of the geographical distribution of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) subtypes is important for understanding different disease courses and for vaccine design. Intersubtype recombination may develop in areas where more than one subtype is prevalent and has the potential to create new transmittable variants with novel pathogenic properties. In this study, 40 FIV-positive DNA samples were classified by sequence analysis of the LTR-gag region. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that 32 Canadian FIV isolates clustered with previously identified subtypes A, B and C and that subtype A was most frequent in Ontario. Four strains with inconsistent clade assignment were further analysed by sequencing of the env-LTR regions. Comparisons of phylogenetic trees constructed from the two different regions of the genome and analysis of similarities to reference sequences yielded classification of three samples as A/B and one as A/C intersubtype recombinants. Although the A/B recombinant samples were obtained from unrelated cats in geographically disparate regions, a common breakpoint was consistently identified within gag. In addition, there was no evidence of co-infection with parental strains of subtypes A and B as indicated by PCR-based limiting dilution assays, although these assays allowed for the identification of two different recombinant viruses co-existing in one sample. Both sequences contained the same breakpoint. These findings suggested that a new circulating recombinant FIV may be enzootic in Ontario.
