A novel gene, RTVP-1, which shows significant sequence identity to the mammalian testis-specific proteins, a family of plant pathogenesis-related proteins and the vespid venom allergen, antigen-5, has been isolated from a cDNA library of the human glioblastoma brain tumor cell line, U-251 MG. The highest degree of sequence identity was with the human testis-specific protein, TPX1 (38.7% over 119 amino acids). Northern hybridization analysis revealed that in fetal tissue RTVP-1 RNA was detected only in the kidney, but its expression was ubiquitous in adult tissues including brain. Multiple mRNAs encoded by RTVP-1 were highly expressed in a panel of cell lines from nervous system tumors arising from glia, although expression was low or absent in nonglial-derived nervous system tumor cell lines.
