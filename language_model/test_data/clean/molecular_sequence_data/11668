5' untranslated and partial core (C) region sequence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 21 Singaporean and 15 Indonesian isolates were amplified by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and sequenced with the use of conserved primer sequences deduced from HCV genomes identified in other geographical regions. The HCV genotypes are predominantly that of Simmonds type 1 and less of type 2 and 3 with the latter genotype currently not detected in Indonesia. The 5' untranslated sequences are related to HCV-1. DK-7 (Denmark), US-11 (United States of America), HCV-J4, SA-10 (South Africa), T-3 (Taiwan), HCV-J6, HCV-J8, Eb-1 and Eb-8. When compared with the prototype HCV-1, insertions are found within the 5' untranslated region of Singaporean isolates and not in the Indonesians. There are Singaporean and Indonesian isolates that have sequences within the 5' untranslated region that differ slightly from each other. Microheterogeneity is observed in the core region of two Singaporeans and one Indonesian isolate. Finally, not all HCV isolates can be amplified with the conserved core sequence primers when compared with the ease with which these isolates can be amplified with 5' untranslated region conserved primers.
