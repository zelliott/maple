The type I 'antifreeze' proteins, found in the body fluids of fish inhabiting polar oceans, are alanine-rich alpha-helical proteins that are able to inhibit the growth of ice. Within this class there are two distinct subclasses of proteins: those related to the winter flounder sequence HPLC6 and which contain 11-residue repeat units commencing with threonine; and those from the sculpins that are unique in the N-terminal region that contains established helix breakers and lacks the 11-residue repeat structure present in the rest of the protein. Although 14 type I proteins have been isolated, almost all research has focused on HPLC6, the 37-residue protein from the winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus. This protein modifies both the rate and shape (or 'habit') of ice crystal growth, displays hysteresis and accumulates specifically at the {2 0 2; 1} ice plane. Until very recently, all models to explain the mechanism for this specific interaction have relied on the interaction of the four threonine hydroxyls, which are spaced equally apart on one face of the helix, with the ice lattice. In contrast, proteins belonging to the sculpin family accumulate specifically at the {2 1; 1; 0} plane. The molecular origin of this difference in specificity between the flounder and sculpin proteins is not understood. This review will summarize the structure-activity and molecular modelling and dynamics studies on HPLC6, with an emphasis on recent studies in which the threonine residues have been mutated. These studies have identified important hydrophobic contributions to the ice growth inhibition mechanism. Some 50 mutants of HPLC6 have been reported and the data is consistent with the following requirements for ice growth inhibition: (a) a minimum length of approx. 25 residues; (b) an alanine-rich sequence in order to induce a highly helical conformation; (c) a hydrophobic face; (d) a number of charged/polar residues which are involved in solubility and/or interaction with the ice surface. The emerging picture, that requires further dynamics studies including accurate modelling of the ice/water interface, suggests that a hydrophobic interaction between the surface of the protein and ice is the key to explaining accumulation at specific ice planes, and thus the molecular level mechanism for ice growth inhibition.
