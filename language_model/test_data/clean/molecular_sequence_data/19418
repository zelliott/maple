Among the group of lactic acid bacteria, Streptococcus thermophilus has found a wide application in industrial processes used for the manufacture of dairy products. Taking advantage of different proteome extraction and subfractionation protocols, bacterial cytosolic and membrane proteins were isolated and resolved by independent gel-free and gel-based separation procedures. Whole cytosolic fraction and its acid, basic and low molecular mass protein components were separated by different resolutive 2-DE and tricine 1-DE gels and identified by MALDI-TOF PMF and/or microLC-ESI-IT-MS/MS. Membrane proteins were resolved by 2-DE and SDS-PAGE gels and similarly identified by PMF and TMS analysis. In parallel, whole extract was trypsinized and resulting peptides were identified by shotgun 2-D LC-ESI-IT-MS/MS analysis. Using this combined approach, expression products corresponding to 458 different genes were identified, which cover almost a third of the predicted vegetative proteome. Relative protein concentration and hydrophobicity affected protein detection. Broad recognition was obtained for enzymes involved in carbohydrate, fatty acid, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, replication, transcription, translation, cell wall synthesis, as well as for proteins affecting bacterial functions important for industrial applications, i.e. milk sugar import and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis. By providing detailed reference electrophoretic/chromatographic maps to be used in future comparative proteomic investigations on bacteria grown under various experimental conditions or on different bacterial strains, our results will favour dedicated studies on S. thermophilus metabolism and its regulation or on detection of biomarkers for selection of optimal strains for industrial applications.
