A murine monoclonal antibody (MA-30) recognizing a sequential epitope on porcine zona pellucida-3 beta glycoprotein (ZP3 beta) and capable of inhibiting sperm-egg interaction was previously described. Polyclonal antibodies against a approximately 6 kDa fragment from the tryptic digest of ZP3 beta, reacting with MA-30, can also inhibit porcine gamete interaction in vitro. Partial N-terminal sequencing of the smallest fragment from the ZP3 beta tryptic digest having reactivity with MA-30 shows sequence homology with human ZP3.
