A hybrid selectable marker for transformation was constructed by placing the promoter (TEF1p) from the gene encoding the Aureobasidium pullulans translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1) adjacent to the 5' end of the Escherichia coli hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene (HPT). Plasmids containing this hybrid gene (TEF1p/HPT) transformed A. pullulans strain R106 to a hygromycin B-resistant (HmBR) phenotype. A PCR-generated DNA fragment consisting of the TEF1p/HPT resistance marker flanked by 41bp of homologous DNA has also been shown to transform A. pullulans to HmBR. Linearized plasmid DNA consistently produced more transformants than circular plasmid DNA. Analyses of 23 HmBR transformants revealed integration of the plasmid in only eight of these transformants. In two transformants, integration into the largest chromosome (VIII) resulted in an alteration of the molecular karyotype. In four other transformants, integration occurred in chromosome VI (the chromosome containing TEF1) but only one was the result of homologous recombination with the genomic copy of the TEF1 promoter. The remainder of the transformants contained replicative plasmids that could be visualized on an agarose gel by ethidium bromide staining. These plasmids were generally 7-8kb in size. One transformant appeared to contain four plasmids ranging in size from 4 to 8kb, suggesting rearrangement of the transforming DNA. One plasmid obtained from a HmBR A. pullulans transformant was able to transform E. coli to ampicillin resistance. However, after recovery from E. coli, this plasmid (approximately 4kb) was unable to transform A. pullulans to HmBR.
