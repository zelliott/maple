Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) genotyping has been well established for the rapid assessment of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and deletions. A design is presented that allows the typing of short tandem oligo repeat sequences using the LightTyper/LightCycler system. The protocol was evaluated and applied to the typing of a tetranucleotide promoter repeat of the human gene encoding the immunity-related GTPase family, M (IRGM) molecule in >2000 individuals from Ghana, West Africa.
