DNA fragments containing the sequence d(GCGAAAGC) prefer to adopt a base-intercalated (zipper-like) duplex in the crystalline state. To investigate effects of point mutation at the 5th residue on the structure, two crystal structures of d(GCGAGAGC) and d(GCGATAGC) have been determined by X-ray crystallography. In the respective crystals, the two octamers related by a crystallographic two-fold symmetry are aligned in an anti-parallel fashion and associated to each other to form a duplex, suggesting that the base-intercalated duplex is stable even when the 5th residue is mutated with other bases. The sheared G3:A6 pair formation makes the two phosphate backbones closer and facilitates formation of the A-X*-X-A* base-intercalated motif. The three duplexes are assembled around the three-fold axis, and their 3rd and 4th residues are bound to the hexamine cobalt chloride. The central 5th residues are bound to another cation.
