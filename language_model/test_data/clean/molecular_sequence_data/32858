Two isoforms of regulatory (R) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), named R(myt1) and R(myt2), were identified so far in the sea mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Out of them, only R(myt2) was phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase 2 (CK2) using GTP as phosphate donor. CK2 catalytic subunit (CK2alpha) itself was sufficient to phosphorylate R(myt2), but phosphorylation was enhanced by the presence of the regulatory subunit CK2beta. Even in the absence of CK2, R(myt2) was phosphorylated to a certain extent when it was incubated with GTP. This basal phosphorylation was partially abolished by the known inhibitors apigenin and emodin, which suggests the presence of a residual amount of endogenous CK2 in the preparation of purified R subunit. CK2-mediated phosphorylation significantly decreases the ability of R(myt2) to inhibit PKA catalytic (C) subunit activity in the absence of cAMP. On the other hand, the sequence of several peptides obtained from the tryptic digestion of R(myt2) showed that mussel protein contains the signature sequence common to all PKA family members, within the "phosphate binding cassette" (PBC) A and B. Moreover, the degree of identity between the sequences of peptides from R(myt2), as a whole, and those from type II R subunits was 68-75%, but the global identity percentage with type I R subunits was only about 30%, so that R(myt2) can be classified as a type II R subunit.
