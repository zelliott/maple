A synthetic peptide, corresponding to the 14-amino acid tryptic fragment containing phosphorylation sites one and two of bovine mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase, was coupled to Limulus polyphemus hemocyanin and used to produce rabbit polyclonal antibodies. A positive signal was observed when Western blots of bovine, porcine, or yeast mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes were probed with the antibodies but not with blots of bacterial, cellular slime mold, plant mitochondrial, or plant plastid pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes. The antibodies also gave a positive signal when used to probe blots of the bovine kidney branched chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex. The ATP-dependent phosphorylation/inactivation of rat liver mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex could be inhibited by prior incubation with the anti-peptide antibodies.
