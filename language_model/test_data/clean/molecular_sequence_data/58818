We present here the analysis of the genomic organization of the Fugu gene coding for ribosomal protein S3 and its intron encoded U15 RNA, and compare it with the homologous human and Xenopus genes. Only two of the six Fugu S3 gene introns do not contain the U15 sequence and are in fact shorter than 100 nucleotides, as most Fugu introns. The other four introns are somewhat longer and contain sequences homologous to U15 RNA; two of these represent functional copies, as shown by microinjections of Fugu transcripts into Xenopus oocytes, whereas the other two appear to be nonfunctional pseudocopies. Thus Fugu turns out to be ideal for the study of intron encoded snoRNAs, partly because of the reduced cloning and sequencing workload, and partly because the intron length per se can be an indication of the presence of a snoRNA coding sequence.
