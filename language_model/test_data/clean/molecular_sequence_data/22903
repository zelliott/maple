IL-5 is a key regulator of eosinophilic inflammation and is selectively expressed by antigen-activated Th2 lymphocytes. An important role for the proximal AP-1 and GATA sites in regulating IL-5 transcription is generally accepted but the significance of an adjacent Ets/NFAT site has remained unclear. We have investigated its role using the mouse Th2 clone D10.G4.1. Transcription of IL-5 reporter gene plasmids could be induced in D10 cells by phorbol myristate acetate/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (PMA/cAMP) stimulation and significantly further enhanced by activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways. Strong induction of IL-5 mRNA was also induced by PMA/cAMP. Mutagenesis showed that the Ets/NFAT site is of critical importance along with the AP-1 and GATA sites in regulating IL-5 transcription stimulated by PMA/cAMP and MAP kinase activation. Transactivation was used to investigate the transcription factors which could function at the three sites and possible synergistic interactions. AP-1 (c-Fos/c-Jun) strongly induced IL-5 transcription and dominant negative AP-1 constructs confirmed that AP-1 plays an important role in regulating IL-5 expression. Ets1, unlike other members of the Ets/NFAT family, synergized strongly with AP-1 suggesting that Ets1 is the family member which functions at the Ets/NFAT site. AP-1/Ets1 transactivation also stimulated IL-5 mRNA expression. Ets1 binding to the proximal promoter region, demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation, was stimulated by PMA/cAMP. The absolute dependence on the binding sites for Ets1, AP-1 and GATA-3 together with the strong synergy between Ets1 and AP-1 suggest close cooperative interactions between the three transcription factors in the regulation of IL-5 expression in mouse T cells.
