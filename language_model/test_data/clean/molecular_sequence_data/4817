We isolated the cDNA clone coding for a major root specific protein (CR16) of carrots. The CR16 protein (154a.a.) has a high homology to intracellular pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, stress-induced proteins and also the major allergen protein of celery (Api g1). The CR16 protein gene formed a super gene family and transcripts of this CR16 protein gene are predominant in root tissue, not in leaves or flowers.
