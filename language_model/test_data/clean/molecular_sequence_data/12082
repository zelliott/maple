Methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFS) catalyses the obligatory initial metabolic step in the intracellular conversion of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate to other reduced folates. We have isolated and sequenced a human MTHFS cDNA which is 872-bp long and codes for a 203-amino-acid protein of 23,229 Da. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), transfected with pET11c plasmids containing an open reading frame encoding MTHFS, showed a 100-fold increase in MTHFS activity in bacterial extracts after IPTG induction. Northern blot studies of human tissues determined that the MTHFS mRNA was expressed preferentially in the liver and Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA suggested the presence of a single-copy gene.
