Discovery of a second, inducible prostaglandin synthase provides explanations for many previously puzzling observations, but also raises new questions about prostanoid synthesis. A cis-acting sequence closely related to the cyclic AMP response element has been shown to play a role in both basal and induced prostaglandin synthase 2 gene expression. Aspirin and other currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit prostaglandin synthase activity do not effectively discriminate between the inducible prostaglandin synthase 2 and constitutive prostaglandin synthase 1 enzymes. Identification of a second prostaglandin synthase, induced by inflammatory stimuli, initiated a search for isoform-specific inhibitors. Use of prostaglandin synthase 2 specific inhibitors and antisense oligonucleotides has led to the suggestion that specific ligands activate alternative pathways of prostanoid production, using one of the prostaglandin synthase isoforms preferentially. The coupling mechanisms by which these pathways are activated in response to alternative stimuli should provide additional routes of intervention in prostanoid production.
