We have set out to clone the trypanosomal gene encoding the largest subunit of RNA polymerase I. We screened a genomic library with a synthetic oligonucleotide probe encoding an eleven amino acid sequence motif, YNADFDGDEMN, which has been found in all eukaryotic RNA polymerase largest subunit genes analyzed so far. We isolated the Trp11 locus and determined the complete sequence of the gene encoded within this locus. The deduced amino acid sequence contains the highly conserved RNA polymerase domains as well as the previously identified RNA polymerase I-specific hydrophilic insertions. Therefore, the gene most closely resembles the largest subunit of RNA polymerase I.
