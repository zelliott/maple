PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) regulated adaptor molecule 1 (PRAM-1) is an intracellular adaptor molecule that is upregulated during the induced granulocytic differentiation of promyelocytic leukemic cells and during normal human myelopoiesis. This report describes the generation of PRAM-1-deficient mice and an analysis of the function of this adaptor in neutrophil differentiation and mature neutrophil function. We demonstrate here that neutrophil differentiation is not impaired in PRAM-1-deficient mice and that PRAM-1-deficient neutrophils function normally following engagement of Fcgamma receptors. In contrast, mature PRAM-1-null neutrophils exhibit significant defects in adhesion-dependent reactive oxygen intermediate production and degranulation. Surprisingly, other integrin-dependent responses, such as cell spreading and activation of several signaling pathways, are normal. Together, these findings demonstrate the uncoupling of key integrin-dependent responses in the absence of PRAM-1 and show this adaptor to be critical for select integrin functions in neutrophils.
