The gamma-tubulin ring complex (gammaTuRC), consisting of multiple protein subunits, can nucleate microtubule assembly. Although many subunits of the gammaTuRC have been identified, a complete set remains to be defined in any organism. In addition, how the subunits interact with each other to assemble into gammaTuRC remains largely unknown. Here, we report the characterization of a novel gammaTuRC subunit, Drosophila gamma ring protein with WD repeats (Dgp71WD). With the exception of gamma-tubulin, Dgp71WD is the only gammaTuRC component identified to date that does not contain the grip motifs, which are signature sequences conserved in gammaTuRC components. By performing immunoprecipitations after pair-wise coexpression in Sf9 cells, we show that Dgp71WD directly interacts with the grip motif-containing gammaTuRC subunits, Dgrips84, 91, 128, and 163, suggesting that Dgp71WD may play a scaffolding role in gammaTuRC organization. We also show that Dgrips128 and 163, like Dgrips84 and 91, can interact directly with gamma-tubulin. Coexpression of any of these grip motif-containing proteins with gamma-tubulin promotes gamma-tubulin binding to guanine nucleotide. In contrast, in the same assay Dgp71WD interacts with gamma-tubulin but does not facilitate nucleotide binding.
