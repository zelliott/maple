We have cloned and determined the structure of the 5' region of the mouse Nktr gene located on the distal end of mouse chromosome 9. This gene encodes an NK-cell-specific 150-kDa protein (NK-TR) homologous to cyclophilin, Nopp140, and SR-containing proteins. NK-TR expression is important for maintaining the lytic activity of natural killer cells. The region of the Nktr gene cloned in this study spans 25 kb and contains the promoter, eight exons, and a single alternative exon. The boundaries of exons 6-8 and the alternate splicing events in this region are identical to those previously described for the human NKTR gene. The Nktr promoter region has features that are typical of a housekeeping gene, including high G + C content, high frequency of CpG dinucleotides, and a lack of canonical TATAA and CCAAT boxes. The activity of Nktr promoter/beta-gal reporter constructs was equivalent in lymphocyte and fibroblast cell lines, suggesting that NK-TR protein expression is regulated by posttranscriptional mechanisms. In support of this hypothesis, two levels of splicing control have been identified within the Nktr gene. A 10-kb intron was found to remain in mRNAs produced in bone marrow, and an alternative exon capable of interrupting the Nktr open reading frame was found in immature NK cells. A conserved intronic sequence has been identified that may be important for the regulation of the Nktr gene by pre-mRNA splicing.
