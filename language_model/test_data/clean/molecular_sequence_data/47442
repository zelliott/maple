Progesterone (P) biphasically modulates follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion in the rat both in vivo and in vitro with the duration of estrogen priming determining the biphasic nature of the P action, probably through estrogen up-regulation of the anterior pituitary progesterone receptor (PR) levels. P has been also shown to regulate anterior pituitary levels of FSH-beta mRNA in the rat. Although the mechanism of this action has not been determined, steroids may regulate gene expression through the binding of liganded receptors to gene sequences known as hormone response elements (HRE); however, it is not known whether HRE's exist on the rat FSH-beta gene. We have localized a series of progesterone response elements (PRE)-like sequences on the rat FSH-beta gene and have begun testing the hypothesis that P modulates the expression of the rat FSH-beta gene through the direct binding of the P/PR complex to these PRE-like sequences. Electromobility shift assays indicate that these PRE-like sequences bind PR with high affinity and specificity. In addition, when a 361-base pair sequence, which contains the three PRE-like sequences localized in the upstream region of the gene, was cloned into a luciferase expression vector driven by a heterologous promoter and transiently transfected into anterior pituitary cell cultures, progestin stimulation elicited increased luciferase expression. These results indicated that the 361-base pair sequence conferred P-responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. The data further suggest that FSH synthesis in the rat is modulated by direct binding of PR to PRE-like sequences.
