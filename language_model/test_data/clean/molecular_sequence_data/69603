Based on the demonstration that active enzyme is formed in vitro and in vivo from polypeptide fragments of the catalytic chains of aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase; EC 2.1.3.2) and the evidence that NH2 and COOH termini of wild-type chains are in close proximity, we constructed altered genes to determine whether circularly permuted catalytic chains could fold and assemble into active catalytic trimers. Two slightly different genetic constructs led to the expression in good yield of circularly permuted catalytic chains, which associated in vivo into active trimers. They, in turn, combined in vitro with wild-type regulatory dimers to form ATCase-like molecules. Both polypeptide chains began at residue 235 in a different domain from the NH2 terminus of wild type and had an overlapping sequence of eight residues at the COOH terminus. One had a six-amino-acid linker, and the other had a deletion of four residues. Enzymes containing rearranged chains were similar to their wild-type counterparts in physical properties. Whereas values of Vmax were close to those of wild-type trimers and ATCase, the Km values were more than 10-fold greater. Also the allosteric properties characteristic of wild-type ATCase were lacking in the enzymes containing permuted chains. Denaturation of trimers by urea was reversible, and recovery of activity in both rate and yield was comparable to that of wild-type trimers. The experiments demonstrate that folding of chains into clearly defined domains and the assembly of active, thermodynamically stable oligomers are not dependent on the positions of NH2 and COOH termini; the folded structures are a consequence of the final sequence and not the order of biosynthetic addition of amino acids.
