A set of aligned homologous protein sequences is divided into two groups consisting of m and n most related sequences. The value of position variability for homologous protein sequences is defined as a number of failures to coincide in the intergroup comparison of all possible m*n pairs of amino acid residues in that position divided by m*n. The position variability value plotted versus the sequence position number with a window of 10 positions gives the intergroup local variability profile. Area S of the figure included between the local variability profile and the straight line corresponding to the mean local variability value is compared with the average area Sr for 1000 random homologous protein families. If S is greater than Sr by more than 2 standard deviation units sigma r, the local variability profile is assumed to contain peaks and hollows corresponding to significant variable and conservative regions of the sequences. The profile extrema containing the area surplus delta S = S-(Sr+ 2 sigma r) are cut off by two straight lines to locate significant regions. The difference (S-Sr) given in standard deviation units sigma r is believed to be the amino acid substitution overall irregularity along the homologous protein sequences OI = (S-Sr)/sigma r. The significant conservative and variable regions of six homologous sequence families (phospholipase A2, cytochromes b, alpha-subunits of Na,K-ATPase, L- and M-subunits of photosynthetic bacteria photoreaction centre and human rhodopsins) were identified. It was shown that for artificial homologous protein sequences derived by k-fold lengthening of natural protein sequences, the OI value rises as square root of k. To compare the degree of substitution irregularity in homologous protein sequence families of different lengths L the value of standard substitution overall irregularity for L = 250 is proposed.
