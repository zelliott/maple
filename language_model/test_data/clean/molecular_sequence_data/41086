The gene Tri12 encodes a predicted major facilitator superfamily protein suggested to play a role in export of trichothecene mycotoxins produced by Fusarium spp. It is unclear, however, how the Tri12 protein (Tri12p) may influence trichothecene sensitivity and virulence of the wheat pathogen Fusarium graminearum. In this study, we establish a role for Tri12 in toxin accumulation and sensitivity as well as in pathogenicity toward wheat. Tri12 deletion mutants (tri12) are reduced in virulence and result in decreased trichothecene accumulation when inoculated on wheat compared with the wild-type strain or an ectopic mutant. Reduced radial growth of tri12 mutants on trichothecene biosynthesis induction medium was observed relative to the wild type and the ectopic strains. Diminished trichothecene accumulation was observed in liquid medium cultures inoculated with tri12 mutants. Wild-type fungal cells grown under conditions that induce trichothecene biosynthesis develop distinct subapical swelling and form large vacuoles. A strain expressing Tri12p linked to green fluorescent protein shows localization of the protein consistent with the plasma membrane. Our results indicate Tri12 plays a role in self-protection and influences toxin production and virulence of the fungus in planta.
