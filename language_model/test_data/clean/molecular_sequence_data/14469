A Gram-positive-staining, non-motile, rod- or coccoid-shaped actinobacterium, designated strain H17T, was isolated from a soil sample from Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, PR China. The organism grew optimally at 30 °C, pH 7.0 and with 3 % NaCl (w/v). Strain H17T contained L-Lys-D-Asp as the cell-wall peptidoglycan type and galactose, xylose and mannose as the whole-cell sugars. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0 and iso-C15:0. The total polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phospholipids, phosphatidylinositol, phosphoglycolipid, one unidentified glycolipid and one unidentified lipid. The menaquinone was MK9(H4). Mycolic acids were not detected. The DNA G+C content was 72.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis of this strain based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed 97.8-99.6 % similarity to recognized species of the genus Isoptericola. The low level of DNA-DNA relatedness to other species of the genus Isoptericola and the many phenotypic properties that distinguished strain H17T from recognized species of this genus demonstrated that isolate H17T should be classified as representing a novel species of the genus Isoptericola. The name Isoptericola nanjingensis sp. nov. is proposed for this novel species. The type strain is H17T (=DSM 24300T=CCTCC AB 2011005T).
