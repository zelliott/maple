Actin-related proteins, a group of protein families that exhibit about 50% sequence identity among each other and to conventional actin, have been found in a variety of eukaryotic organisms. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, genes for one conventional actin (ACT1) and for three actin-related proteins (ACT2, ACT3, and ACT5) are known. ACT3, which we recently discovered, is an essential gene coding for a polypeptide of 489 amino acids (Act3p), with a calculated molecular mass of 54.8 kDa. Besides its homology to conventional actin, Act3p possesses a domain exhibiting weak similarity to the chromosomal protein HMG-14 as well as a potential nuclear localization signal. An antiserum prepared against a specific segment of the ACT3 gene product recognizes a polypeptide band of approximately 55 kDa in yeast extract. Indirect immunofluorescence experiments with this antiserum revealed that Act3p is located in the nucleus. Nuclear staining was observed in all cells regardless of the stage of the cell cycle. Independently, immunoblotting experiments with subcellular fractions showed that Act3p is indeed highly enriched in the nuclear fraction. We suggest that Act3p is an essential constituent of yeast chromatin.
