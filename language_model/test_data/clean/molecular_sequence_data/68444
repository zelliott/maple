Transplant recipients successively develop benign, premalignant and malignant skin lesions on sun-exposed areas. It has been suggested that UV radiations might induce mutations in ras oncogenes and p53 tumour-suppressor gene, responsible for skin cancers. With PCR and oligoprobe hybridization, we investigated c-Ha-ras gene mutations at codons 12 and 61 in 120 cutaneous lesions from grafted patients, since they could represent a marker of the evolution of benign skin lesions towards malignancy in this population; 29 similar skin biopsies from non-immunosuppressed patients were also analyzed. In transplant recipients, we detected mutations at codon 12 only in 1/42 non-melanoma skin cancers and 2/29 pre-cancerous keratoses. No mutation was detected in 11 cases of cutaneous Bowen's disease from grafted patients and in pre-malignant and malignant skin samples from control patients. Benign warts exhibited an overall incidence of 18% and 15% of mutations at codon 12 of c-Ha-ras gene in grafted and control patients respectively. We detected only one mutation at codon 61 in a plantar wart. Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are thought to be involved in the malignant evolution of cutaneous disorders in transplant recipients and cooperate with a ras oncogene to induce malignancy in vitro. The presence of HPV DNA in our series of skin samples from grafted patients showed no correlation with the occurrence of c-Ha-ras mutations. Our findings indicate that c-Ha-ras-gene activation by mutations is rare in cutaneous lesions from transplant recipients, and is unlikely to play a crucial role in transformation towards malignancy in skin carcinogenesis among grafted patients.
