Challenge experiments using Lawsonia intracellularis as oral inocula have established its aetiological role in porcine proliferative enteropathy. Thirty piglets, in four groups, were weaned at 21 days of age and inoculated orally at 24 days. Six piglets were challenged with 1.0 x 10(8) L intracellularis strain 916/91 (NCTC 12657) passaged 12 times in vitro, six with 5.0 x 10(8) of the same strain, seven with 3.0 x 10(8) L intracellularis strain LR 189/5/83, passaged nine times, and 11 controls were dosed with sucrose-potassium glutamate buffer. An immunofluorescence assay for L intracellularis was applied to faecal smears and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) incorporating L intracellularis-specific primers was applied to extracts of bacterial DNA derived from the faeces samples. Up to five pigs in each challenge group excreted detectable L intracellularis in faeces, in samples taken between two and 10 weeks after challenge. Some of the pigs had up to 7 x 10(8) L intracellularis g-1 faeces. The average weight gains of the higher dose challenge groups were moderately below those of the control pigs between three and nine weeks after challenge; diarrhoea was also observed in six pigs, two to four weeks after challenge. Numerous L intracellularis were detected in the intestines of all the pigs challenged with strain LR 189/5/83 and two of the pigs challenged with 916/91, but not in other tissues.
