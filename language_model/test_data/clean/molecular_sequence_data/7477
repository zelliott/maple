Superantigens (SAg) encoded by endogenous mouse mammary tumor viruses (Mtv) interact with the V beta domain of the T cell receptor (TcR-V beta). Presentation of Mtv SAg can lead to stimulation and/or deletion of the reactive T cells, but little is known about the quantitative aspects of SAg presentation. Although monoclonal antibodies have been raised against Mtv SAg, they have not been useful in quantitating SAg protein, which is present in very low amounts in normal cells. Alternative attempts to quantitate Mtv SAg mRNA expression are complicated by the fact that Mtv transcription occurs from multiple loci and in different overlapping reading frames. In this report we describe a novel competitive polymerase chain reaction assay which allows the locus-specific quantitation of SAg expression at the mRNA level in lymphocyte subsets from mouse strains with multiple endogenous Mtv loci. In B cells as well as T cells (CD4+ or CD8+), Mtv-6 SAg is expressed at the highest levels, followed by Mtv-7 SAg and (to a much lesser extent) Mtv-8,9. Consistent with functional Mtv-7 SAg presentation studies, we find that Mtv-7 SAg expression is higher in B cells than in CD8+ T cells and very low in the CD4+ subset. The overall hierarchy in Mtv SAg expression (i.e. Mtv-6 > Mtv-7 > Mtv 8,9) was also observed for mRNA isolated from neonatal thymus. Furthermore, the kinetics of intrathymic deletion of the corresponding TcR-V beta domains during ontogeny correlated with the levels of Mtv SAg expression. Collectively our data suggest that T cell responses to Mtv SAg are largely controlled by SAg expression levels on presenting cells.
