A crustacean gene, encoding for a new class of GFP-like protein, has been isolated from a cDNA library of the deep-sea (benthic) copepod crustacean, Chiridius poppei, by expression cloning. The cDNA library was constructed in a pBluescript II vector and screened using a non-UV transilluminator, obtaining a positive clone. The clone consisted of a 781-bp fragment of cDNA with a 660-bp open reading frame, which encoded for a 219-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 24.7 kDa. The protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatographies. The protein, CpYGFP, had excitation and emission maxima at 507 and 517 nm, respectively. CpYGFP existed as a dimer in solution and could be expressed either alone or as a fusion protein in HeLa cells. Dual labeling experiments carried out with CpYGFP-actin and DsRed2-Nuc demonstrated the usefulness of CpYGFP as a reporter in the subcellular localization of actin.
