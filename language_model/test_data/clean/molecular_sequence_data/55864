An 85-kDa cell surface protein recognized by monoclonal antibody MRK-20 was identified in adriamycin-resistant tumor cells. The expression of the 85-kDa protein has recently been reported to be associated with the differentiation of hematopoietic cells. However, the primary structure of the 85-kDa protein has not been determined. To clarify its primary structure, we carried out cDNA expression cloning of the 85-kDa protein with monoclonal antibody MRK-20. We found that the 85-kDa protein is identical to CD36 (GP VI), but at least two species of transcript exist in the tumor cells and one of these transcripts has a novel sequence at the 3'-region. The transcript with the novel sequence at the 3'-region was found to be expressed during the differentiation of hematopoietic cells.
