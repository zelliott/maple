The pulse of ecdysone that triggers Drosophila metamorphosis activates six early genes in a primary response made visible by polytene chromosome puffs. The secondary response is detected by the induction of over 100 late puffs, only a few of which have been subject to molecular genetic analysis. We present a molecular and mutational analysis of the L63 gene responsible for the late puff at 63E. This gene contains overlapping L63A, B, and C transcription units of which the A unit encodes two isoforms and the B unit three. The C unit, which exhibits little activity, encodes one of the B isoforms. Evidence that L63B, but not L63A, transcription is ecdysone responsive derives from their developmental transcription profiles and from P-element mutagenesis showing that ecdysone induction of the 63E puff requires sequences adjacent to the 5' end of L63B but not those adjacent to the 5' end of L63A. L63-specific lethal mutations showed that L63 is required not only for metamorphosis, but also maternally and for embryonic and larval development. The L63 proteins contain a common C-terminal 294-aa sequence that is 71% identical to the CDK sequence of the murine PFTAIRE protein. In vivo tests of L63 proteins altered by site-directed mutagenesis showed that they exhibit CDK functions. L63 proteins are widely distributed among late larval and prepupal tissues and are unlikely to be involved in cell cycle functions.
