The reverse-transcriptase inhibitor lamivudine (Zeffix, GlaxoSmithKline) is often used to treat chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) until resistance develops. Treatment may then be switched to the reverse-transcriptase inhibitor adefovir (Hepsera, Gilead), which has a lower frequency of resistance. Here, we describe three cases of primary adefovir resistance that were sensitive to tenofovir (Viread, Gilead). All three cases involved a rare HBV variant with a valine at position 233 of the reverse-transcriptase domain instead of isoleucine (rtI233V), as in the wild-type virus. This HBV variant also displayed resistance to adefovir and sensitivity to tenofovir in vitro.
