Proteasomes are nonlysosomal multicatalytic proteases involved in antigen processing. Three of the 10 mammalian proteasome beta subunits (LMP2, LMP7, and LMP10) are induced by IFN-gamma. Two of these (LMP2 and LMP7) are encoded in the major histocompatibility complex of both human (chromosome 6) and mouse (chromosome 17). However, the human homologue of Lmp10, MECL1, is found on chromosome 16. Here we show that in mice, Lmp10 is a single-copy gene localized to chromosome 8, in a region of conserved synteny with human chromosome 16. Sequencing of a 129/SvJ strain genomic clone revealed that the gene has eight exons spanning 2.3 kb. Characterization of a full-length mouse cDNA clone indicates that Lmp10 encodes a protein of 273 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 29 kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.86. Northern analysis of Lmp2, Lmp7, and Lmp10 showed expression in heart, liver, thymus, lung, and spleen, but not in brain, kidney, skeletal muscle, or testis.
