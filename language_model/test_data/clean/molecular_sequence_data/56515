HSP47, a 47-kDa heat-shock protein (HSP), is a member of a group of HSPs with the unique characteristics of collagen binding as well as transformation sensitivity. The protein belongs to the serpin (serine protease inhibitor) superfamily as determined from its amino acid sequence homology. We have isolated and characterized the mouse HSP47 including about 1 kb of the 5'-flanking region. This gene spans about 7.8 kb, consisting of six exons separated by five introns. This exon-intron structure is different from other serpin family proteins. Southern blot analysis revealed the existence of a single copy of HSP47. The promoter region contains a TATA box, four Sp1-binding sites and one AP-1-binding site. A complete heat-shock element (HSE) was found between nucleotides (nt) -61 and -79. Furthermore, the heat inducibility was reproduced by transfecting mouse BALB/3T3 cells with a plasmid carrying cat under the control of the HSE-containing fragment (nt -197 and +38) of HSP47. Computer analysis of the promoter region did not show marked homology to other vertebrate promoters.
