Anew HLA-A*11 allele, A*1113, was identified in a healthy Japanese female. She was typed as HLA-A11?, A2, B46, B67, Cw1, Cw7 (Bw6) with unusual serological reactivity of A11, suggesting possible presence of a new A*11 allele. The novel A*1113 allele was identified by haplotypic group-specific allele amplification using A*11 allele-specific primer pairs and sequence-based typing. The A*1113 allele differs from A*11011 by one nucleotide substitution in exon 3 at position 503 (A --> G) which causes an amino acid change in the alfa2 domain at residue 144 (lysine : K --> arginine : R), thus resulting in the unusual serological reactivity.
