The Epstein-Barr virus/C3d receptor (EBVR-CR2) was detected on three T-lymphoblastoid cell lines. The apparent Mrs of purified EBVR-CR2 of T-cell and B-cell origin were identical. The N-terminal amino acid sequence from the T-cell EBVR-CR2 confirmed the placement of this receptor in a multigene family of complement regulatory proteins. All EBVR-CR2-positive T-cell lines were T6 and T4-T8 antigen positive.
