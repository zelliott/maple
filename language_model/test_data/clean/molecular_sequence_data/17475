Two monobiotinylated analogs of neuropeptide Y (NPY) were synthesized by coupling the N-hydroxysuccinimidyl esters of biotin and (6-biotinylamido)-hexanoic acid, respectively, to the free alpha-NH2 group of the side chain protected NPY peptide resin. Crude peptides obtained by HF cleavage were purified by RPLC and their integrities were confirmed by amino acid and mass spectral analysis. As with NPY, both biotinylated analogs inhibited 125I-NPY binding and adenylate cyclase activity of rat cardiac ventricular membranes in a dose-dependent manner. N-alpha-[(6-biotinylamido)-hexanoyl]-NPY exhibited potencies comparable to that of NPY whereas N-alpha-biotinyl-NPY was slightly less potent. In the in vivo experiments, however, both the biotinylated analogs exhibited responses comparable to NPY in increasing arterial blood pressure and decreasing heart rate in anesthetized rats. The responses of the biotinyl analogs were longer lasting than those of NPY. Histochemical studies revealed that N-alpha-[(6-biotinylamido)-hexanoyl]-NPY could label the NPY receptors in rat cardiac ventricular tissues. This labeling was specific since intact NPY inhibited the staining. These studies show that biotinyl-NPY analogs exhibit biological potencies comparable to intact NPY and can therefore be used to further probe the NPY-receptor interaction.
