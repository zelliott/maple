In this study, a full-length cytosolic heat shock protein 70 complementary DNA (cDNA) of Laminaria japonica (designated as LJHsp70) was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) coupled with rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The full length of LJHsp70 cDNA was 2,918 bp, with a 5' untranslated region of 248 bp, a 3' untranslated region of 696 bp, and an open reading frame of 1,974 bp encoding a polypeptide of 657 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 72.03 kDa and an estimated isoelectric point of 4.97. There was highly repeated sequence of CAA in 5' untranslated region of LJHsp70. The result of phylogenetic tree of Hsp70s, the BLAST program, analysis and cytosolic Hsp70-specific motif of LJHsp70 verified that the cloned LJHsp70 belonged to cytosolic Hsp70 family. Three typical Hsp70 signature motifs were detected in LJHsp70 by InterPro analysis. Under different stress conditions, messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of LJHsp70 were quantified by quantitative RT-PCR. To L. japonica sporophytes kept in different temperatures for 1 h, the expression level of LJHsp70 at 30 degrees C was highest and twofold higher than that at 10 degrees C. To L. japonica sporophytes kept at 25 degrees C for different times, the mRNA expression level of LJHsp70 reached a maximum level after 7 h and then dropped progressively. The expression level of LJHsp70 at 0 or 5 per thousand salt concentration for 2 h was twofold higher than that at 30 per thousand salt concentration for 2 h. The results showed that LJHsp70 may be a kind of potential biomarker used to monitor environment conditions.
