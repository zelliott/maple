Externally applied Ni(2+), which apparently competes with Ca(2+) in all three isoforms of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, inhibits exchange activity of NCX1 or NCX2 with a 10-fold higher affinity than that of NCX3, whereas stimulation of exchange by external Li(+) is significantly greater in NCX2 and NCX3 than in NCX1 (Iwamoto, T., and Shigekawa, M. (1998) Am. J. Physiol. 275, C423-C430). Here we identified structural domains in the exchanger that confer differential sensitivity to Ni(2+) or Li(+) by measuring intracellular Na(+)-dependent (45)Ca(2+) uptake in CCL39 cells stably expressing NCX1/NCX3 chimeras or mutants. We found that two segments in the exchanger corresponding mostly to the internal alpha-1 and alpha-2 repeats are individually responsible for the alteration of Ni(2+) sensitivity, both together accounting for approximately 80% of the difference between NCX1 and NCX3. In contrast, the segment corresponding to the alpha-2 repeat fully accounts for the differential Li(+) sensitivity between the isoforms. The Ni(2+) sensitivity was mimicked, respectively, by simultaneous substitution of two amino acids in the alpha-1 repeat (N125G/T127I in NCX1 and G159N/I161T in NCX3) and substitution of one amino acid in the alpha-2 repeat (V820A in NCX1 and A809V in NCX3). On the other hand, the Li(+) sensitivity was mimicked by double substitution mutation in the alpha-2 repeat (V820A/Q826V in NCX1 and A809V/V815Q in NCX3). Single substitution mutations at Asn(125) and Val(820) of NCX1 caused significant alterations in the interactions of the exchanger with Ca(2+) and Ni(2+), and Ni(2+) and Li(+), respectively, although the extent of alteration varied depending on the nature of side chains of substituted residues. Since the above four important residues are mostly in the putative loops of the alpha repeats, these regions might form an ion interaction domain in the exchanger.
