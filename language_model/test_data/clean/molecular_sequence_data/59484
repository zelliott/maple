A novel HLA-DQB1 allele was detected by oligotyping in the Bubi population of Equatorial Guinea. In order to characterize the new allelic variant, a RT-PCR method which permitted the cloning of its complete coding region was designed. With this method, we have determined the nucleotide sequence of the new DQB1*0612 allele, related to *0604 and *0609 but differing from them at polymorphic codon 70. A proposal for the improvement of the sequencing strategies of HLA class II alleles is made.
