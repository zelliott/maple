This study aimed to identify candidate new diagnosis and prognosis markers and medicinal targets of prostate cancer (PCa), using state of the art proteomics. A total of 20 prostate tissue specimens from 10 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 10 with PCa (Tumour Node Metastasis [TNM] stage T1-T3) were analyzed by isobaric stable isotope labeling (iTRAQ) and two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (2DLC-MS/MS) approaches using a hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight system (QqTOF). The study resulted in the reproducible identification of 825 nonredundant gene products (p < or = 0.05) of which 30 exhibited up-regulation (> or =2-fold) and another 35 exhibited down-regulation (< or =0.5-fold) between the BPH and PCa specimens constituting a major contribution toward their global proteomic assessment. Selected findings were confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis of prostate tissue specimens. The proteins determined support existing knowledge and uncover novel and promising PCa biomarkers. The PCa proteome found can serve as a useful aid for the identification of improved diagnostic and prognostic markers and ultimately novel chemopreventive and therapeutic targets.
