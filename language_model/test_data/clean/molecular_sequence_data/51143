A cDNA clone coding for cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase was isolated from a guinea-pig liver cDNA library. The cDNA, MSr2, contained a complete coding region of 678 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of the guinea-pig cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase showed approx. 90% identities with those of rat, human, rabbit, pig enzymes indicating conservation of primary structure of the enzyme during evolutionary divergence of species. The high conservation of acidic residues of the enzyme sustained the importance of them to maintain its function [corrected].
