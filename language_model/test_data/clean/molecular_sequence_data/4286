Genes encoding triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) are fused and form a single transcriptional unit (tigA) in Phytophthora species, members of the order Pythiales in the phylum Oomycota. This is the first demonstration of glycolytic gene fusion in eukaryotes and the first case of a TPI-GAPDH fusion in any organism. The tigA gene from Phytophthora infestans has a typical Oomycota transcriptional start point consensus sequence and, in common with most Phytophthora genes, has no introns. Furthermore, Southern and PCR analyses suggest that the same organization exists in other closely related genera, such as Pythium, from the same order (Oomycota), as well as more distantly related genera, Saprolegnia and Achlya, in the order Saprolegniales. Evidence is provided that in P. infestans, there is at least one other discrete copy of a GAPDH-encoding gene but not of a TPI-encoding gene. Finally, a phylogenetic analysis of TPI does not place Phytophthora within the assemblage of crown eukaryotes and suggests TPI may not be particularly useful for resolving relationships among major eukaryotic groups.
