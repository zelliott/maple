An epizootic in pond cultured three striped tigerfish, Terapon jarbua, in Taiwan was caused by Nocardia seriolae. Diseased fish first showed clinical signs and mortalities in February and March 2003. The cumulative mortality within 2 months was 2.4% (1200 of 50 000) and affected fish were 7 months old with total lengths from 18 to 25 cm. Most affected fish were pale and lethargic with haemorrhages and ulcers on the skin. The most significant gross pathological changes were varying degrees of ascites and enlargement of the spleen, kidney and liver. Obvious white nodules, varying in size, were found in these organs. Bacteria were either coccal or filamentous in appearance, with bead-like forms. Isolates from diseased fish were characterized using the API ZYM (Analytical profile index; Bio MÃ©rieux, France) systems and conventional tests and identified as Nocardia sp. The isolate was designated NS127 and was confirmed as N. seriolae by a polymerase chain reaction assay that gave the expected specific 432 bp amplicon. In addition, its 16S rDNA sequence gave 100% sequence identity with N. seriolae. A partial sequence of the 16S rRNA gene, heat shock protein gene and RNA polymerase gene (rpo B) of NS127 and the type strain of N. seriolae BCRC 13745 formed a monophyletic clade with a high sequence similarity and bootstrap value of 99.9%. White nodules induced in experimental fish were similar to naturally infected cases and N. seriolae was re-isolated on brain heart infusion agar. This is the first report of N. seriolae-infection in three striped tigerfish in aquaculture.
