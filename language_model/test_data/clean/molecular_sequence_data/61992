Coxsackie B viruses of serotype 5 are associated frequently with sporadic cases of neurological diseases, epidemics of meningitis, and chronic diseases such as cardiomyopathy and diabetes. In this article, 15 strains of Coxsackievirus B5 isolated from patients with neurological disorders and healthy people were investigated by partial sequencing in the 5' half of the VP1 region and compared to other published sequences of Coxsackievirus B5, in the same genomic region. All Coxsackievirus B5 sequences showed less than 25% nucleotide difference between each other and a minimum of 27.8% of divergence with prototype sequences from other Coxsackievirus B serotypes. Within the Coxsackievirus B5 group of sequences, four clusters were individualized and may correspond to four genotypes: one genotype with large geographical distribution, containing most recent strains that have circulated from 1984 to 2000, another genotype represented by the prototype Faulkner strain, isolated in the early 1950s, and two intermediate genotypes, comprising strains isolated from 1970 to 1999 and closely related to swine vesicular disease virus. This study confirms the ability of partial sequencing in VP1 to determine serotype and to genetically characterize Coxsackievirus B5 field isolates. It gives a first approach on the molecular epidemiology of these viruses, which have a particular importance in human health.
