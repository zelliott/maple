The peptide (35 residues) corresponding to the basic subdomain (bSD) of c-Jun (residues 252-281) and its fragments NP (N-terminal peptide, 1-19) and CP (C-terminal peptide, 16-35) were synthesized in stepwise solid-phase using the tert-butyloxycarbonyl/benzyl strategy. In a previous paper, we have shown that during its binding to the DNA site CRE (cAMP-responsive element) the bSD structure was converted into alpha-helix from an initial random coil conformation [Krebs, D., Dahmani, B., El Antri, S., Monnot, M., Convert, O., Mauffret, O., Troalen, F. & Fermandjian, S. Eur. J. Biochem. 231, 370-380 (1995)]. Our results suggested both a high flexibility and a helical potential in bSD, these two properties seeming crucial for the accommodation of the basic subdomain of c-Jun to its specific DNA targets. In this work, we assessed the conformational variability of bSD through the study of the secondary structures of its NP and CP fragments in trifluoroethanol (TFE)/2H2O mixtures, using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The IR results were critically analyzed in light of our previously reported circular dichroism (CD) and NMR data [Krebs, D., Dahmani, B., Monnot, M., Mauffret, O., Troalen, F. & Fermandjian, S. Eur. J. Biochem, 235, 699-712 (1996)]. Upon addition of TFE, the relative areas of the seven components of the amide I. band (1700-1620 cm-1) reflected the conversion of a large amount of random coil conformation into alpha-helix for the two fragments and bSD. This effect was accompanied by more subtle variations of the less populated structures, in agreement with the results of CD and NMR experiments. The IR results stipulated the conservation of the parent bSD secondary structures in both fragments; however, NP and CP peptides did not display similar random-to-alpha-helix stabilization pattern upon additions of TFE to aqueous solutions. The profile from CD signal at 222 nm was found sigmoidal for NP and almost linear for CP, while that corresponding to the parent peptide bSD was just in between those of its fragments. Thus, the present study confirms the high flexibility and helix propensity of the c-Jun basic subdomain and suggests that the N- and C-terminal parts of the peptide do not follow the same random-to-helix conversion profile during their complexation with DNA.
