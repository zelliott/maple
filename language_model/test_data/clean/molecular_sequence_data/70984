We have characterized the genomic structure and expression of the mouse gene for Pur-1. The cloned Pur-1 gene spans a 5-kb region encompassing the promoter, five exons, four introns and the 3'-untranslated region. All exon-intron junction sequences conform to the GT/AG rule. The promoter region has typical features of a housekeeping gene: a high G + C content (77.5%); a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides, in particular within the region 0.5 kb upstream of the site of initiation of translation; and the absence of canonical TATA and CAAT boxes. S1 nuclease protection assay demonstrated the presence of multiple sites for initiation of transcription around a site 108 nucleotides upstream of the ATG codon. Comparison of Pur-1 with the human gene for MAZ (Myc-associated zinc finger protein) revealed a striking homology of both their nucleotide and deduced protein sequences, an identical genomic organization and high similarity in promoter architecture and mRNA expression pattern. Sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking region of Pur-1 revealed numerous potential binding sites for transcription factors Sp1, AP-2 and Pur-1/MAZ itself. An element required for basal Pur-1 expression was mapped from nucleotide -258 to +43. This region also mediated stimulation of basal transcription by ectopically expressed MAZ protein. We conclude that the Pur-1 gene is the murine homolog of human MAZ and, like it, belongs to the family of housekeeping genes.
