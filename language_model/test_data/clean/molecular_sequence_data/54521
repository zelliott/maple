RNA helicase A (RHA) has been shown to promote HIV-1 replication at both the translation and reverse transcription stages. A prerequisite step for reverse transcription involves the annealing of tRNA(3)(Lys), the primer for reverse transcription, to HIV-1 RNA. tRNA(3)(Lys) annealing is a multistep process that is initially facilitated by Gag prior to viral protein processing. Herein, we report that RHA promotes this annealing through increasing both the quantity of tRNA(3)(Lys) annealed by Gag and the ability of tRNA(3)(Lys) to prime the initiation of reverse transcription. This improved annealing is the result of an altered viral RNA conformation produced by the coordinate action of Gag and RHA. Since RHA has been reported to promote the translation of unspliced viral RNA to Gag protein, our observations suggest that the conformational change in viral RNA induced by RHA and newly produced Gag may help facilitate the switch in viral RNA from a translational mode to one facilitating tRNA(3)(Lys) annealing.
