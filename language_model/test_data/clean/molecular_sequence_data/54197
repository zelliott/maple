A continuous-flow column study was conducted to investigate the long-term effects of persulfate oxidation on the abundance and activity of the indigenous microbial community and phenanthrene-degrading bacteria in contaminated soil from a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site. Approximately six pore volumes of a 20 g/L persulfate solution were introduced into the column, followed by simulated groundwater for 500 days. Soil samples were collected from the surface of the soil bed and along the column length immediately before and after persulfate injection and up to 500 days following injection. Exposure to persulfate led to a 2- to 3-log reduction in total bacterial 16S rRNA genes, severe inhibition of (14)C-acetate mineralization (as a measure of general microbial activity), and a decrease in community diversity. However, relatively rapid recovery of both bacterial gene abundance and activity was observed within 30 days after persulfate exposure. Mineralization of (14)C-phenanthrene was also inhibited but did not recover until 100 days postoxidation. Known phenanthrene-degrading bacterial groups decreased to below detection limits throughout the column, with recovery times from 100 to 500 days after persulfate injection. These findings suggest that coupling biological processes with persulfate oxidation is possible, although recovery of specific contaminant degraders may occur much later than the general microbial community recovers. Furthermore, the use of total bacterial quantity or nonspecific measures of activity as a surrogate for the recovery of contaminant degraders may be inappropriate for evaluating the compatibility of chemical treatment with subsequent bioremediation.
