We isolated a novel mouse gene, RP42, in a systematic search for genes expressed in proliferating neuroblasts whose human orthologs map to susceptibility loci for autism. This gene is intronless and encodes a putative 259-amino-acid protein that exhibits 30-36% overall sequence identity to a fission yeast and a nematode protein (GenPept Accession Nos. CAA17006 and CAB54261). Nevertheless, no homology to any known gene was found. RP42 has developmentally regulated expression, particularly in proliferating neuroblasts from which neocortical neurons originate. Its human ortholog is located in a cluster of embryonic neuronally expressed genes on the 6q16 chromosome, making it a positional candidate susceptibility gene for autism.
