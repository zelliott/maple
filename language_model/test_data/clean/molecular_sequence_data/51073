Each of the two active sites of thymidylate synthase contains amino acid residues contributed by the other subunit. For example, Arg-178 of one monomer binds the phosphate group of the substrate dUMP in the active site of the other monomer [Hardy et al. (1987) Science 235, 448-455]. Inactive mutants of such residues should combine with subunits of other inactive mutants to form heterodimeric hybrids with one functional active site. In vivo and in vitro approaches were used to test this hypothesis. In vivo complementation was accomplished by cotransforming plasmid mixtures encoding pools of inactive Arg-178 mutants and pools of inactive Cys-198 mutants into a host strain deficient in thymidylate synthase. Individual inactive mutants of Arg-178 were also cotransformed with the C198A mutant. Subunit complementation was detected by selection or screening for transformants which grew in the absence of thymidine, and hence produced active enzyme. Many mutants at each position representing a wide variety of size and charge supported subunit complementation. In vitro complementation was accomplished by reversible dissociation and unfolding of mixtures of purified individual inactive Arg-178 and Cys-198 mutant proteins. With the R178F + C198A heterodimer, the Km values for dUMP and CH2H4folate were similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. By titrating C198A with R178F under unfolding-refolding conditions, we were able to calculate the kcat value for the active heterodimer. The catalytic efficiency of the single wild-type active site of the C198A + R178F heterodimer approaches that of the wild-type enzyme.
