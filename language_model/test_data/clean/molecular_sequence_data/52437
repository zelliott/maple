EBV/C3d receptor (CR2) interacts with the p53 anti-oncoprotein expressed in the human B lymphoma cells, Raji but not in normal B cells, and with the p68 calcium-binding protein, expressed in normal B lymphocytes but not in transformed B lymphocytes. To characterize the CR2 domain interacting with these two intracellular proteins, we synthesized a 34-amino acid peptide, pep34, corresponding to its intracytoplasmic carboxy-terminal domain and analyzed its binding and antigenic properties. Binding of 125I-labeled p53 or 125I-labeled p68 on immobilized pep34 was specific, additive, and totally inhibited by unlabeled p53 or p68, respectively, but not by unlabeled p68 or p53, respectively. Antigenic properties of pep34 were analyzed by immunizing rabbits with particle-bound pep34. Polyclonal anti-pep34 Ab carried anti-CR2 specificities that recognized only the intracellular domain of CR2. In addition, anti-pep34 Ab also carried anti-p53 or anti-p68 specificities. Anti-p53 or anti-p68 specificities were not due to putative common structural or conformational antigenic determinants between the pep34 synthetic peptide and the p68 or p53 proteins. These anti-p53 and anti-p68 specificities were identified as anti-idiotypic anti-CR2 Ab mimicking either p53 or p68 binding sites of CR2. These data clearly establish that despite its short length, the intracytoplasmic C-terminal tail of CR2 is involved in direct protein-protein interactions with the two intracellular regulatory proteins, p53 and p68. An additional feature of these data is the demonstration that particle-bound pep34 triggered "in vivo" anti-Id Ab restricted to either p53 or p68 specificities.
