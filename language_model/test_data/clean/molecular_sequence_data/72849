The yeast nuclear gene RML2, identified through genomic sequencing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome V, was shown to encode a mitochondrial homologue of the bacterial ribosomal protein L2. Immunoblot analysis showed that the mature Rml2p is a 37-kDa polypeptide component of the mitochondrial 54 S large ribosomal subunit. Null mutants of RML2 are respiration-deficient and convert to [rho-] or [rho degrees ] cytoplasmic petites, indicating that Rml2p is essential for mitochondrial translation. RML2 is regulated transcriptionally in response to carbon source and the accumulation of Rml2p is dependent on the presence of the 21 S large rRNA. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that a highly conserved 7-amino acid sequence (Val336 to Asp342) of Rml2p is essential for function. Substitution of Gln for His-343, the most highly conserved histidine in the L2 protein family, caused cold-sensitive respiratory growth but did not affect the assembly of 54 S ribosomal subunits. Mitochondrial protein synthesis was normal in the His343 to Gln (H343Q) mutant grown at the permissive temperature (30 degrees C) and was severely impaired after growth at the nonpermissive temperature (18 degrees C). His343 corresponds to His229 in Escherichia coli L2, which has been implicated in a direct involvement in peptidyl transferase activity. The conditional phenotype of the H343Q mutant indicates that His343 is not essential for peptidyl transferase activity in yeast mitochondria.
