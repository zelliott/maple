We have investigated the roles of the cytoplasmic domains of the human parainfluenza virus type 2 (PI2) and type 3 (PI3) fusion (F) proteins in protein transport and cell fusion activity. By using the vaccinia virus-T7 transient expression system, a series of F protein cytoplasmic tail truncation mutants was studied with respect to intracellular and surface expression and the ability to induce cell fusion when coexpressed with the corresponding hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins. All of the cytoplasmic tail truncation mutants of PI2F were expressed at high levels intracellularly or on cell surfaces as measured by immunoprecipitation and cell surface biotinylation assays. In addition, when coexpressed with PI2HN, these truncation mutants of PI2F were all found to be essentially unimpaired in the ability to induce cell fusion as measured by a quantitative cell fusion assay. In contrast, surface expression and cell fusion activity were found to be eliminated by a mutant of PI3F in which the entire cytoplasmic tail was deleted, and the mutant protein appeared to be unable to assemble into a high-molecular-weight oligomeric structure. To further investigate whether there is a specific sequence requirement in the cytoplasmic tail of PI3F, a chimeric protein consisting of the PI3F extracellular and transmembrane domains and the PI2F cytoplasmic tail was constructed. This chimeric protein was detected on the surface, and it was capable of inducing cell fusion when expressed together with PI3HN, although the fusogenic activity was reduced compared with that of wild-type PI3F. These results demonstrate that although PI2 and PI3 viruses belong to the same parainfluenza virus genus, these viruses show marked differences with respect to functional requirements for the cytoplasmic tail of the F glycoprotein.
