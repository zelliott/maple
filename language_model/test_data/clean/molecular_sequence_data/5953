The process of self-renewal which occurs in the gastrointestinal epithelium is greatly amplified and accelerated during the intestinal adaptation which occurs in the residual ileum after massive small bowel resection (MSBR). As with growth and development, these processes must involve the coordinated regulation of many genes. Several families of nuclear proteins are known to be involved in the control of gene expression during development including the POU-domain genes; their expression has not been characterized in the gastrointestinal tract during normal cellular renewal or adaptation, and POU-domain encoding cDNAs were cloned from ileal RNA. Three known genes were cloned: Oct-1, Brn-1 and Tst-1 but no novel members of this gene family were identified. The encoded sequence for rat Oct-1 differs from that previously reported. Oct-1 is relatively ubiquitously expressed with increased expression during both development and adaptation. Minimal expression of Tst-1 was observed. Brn-1 exhibits limited expression in the adult gastrointestinal tract but may play a role in the fetal gastrointestinal tract.
