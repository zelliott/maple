A PCR product was generated from embryonic chicken spinal cord cDNA using primers designed to conserved regions of the human and bovine amino and carboxyl-terminal coding sequences of the Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1, EC 1.15.1.1) gene. DNA sequencing confirmed this product to be the chicken homologue of the SOD1 gene. This sequence was compared to SOD1 from bovine, human and Xenopus laevis. Important structural features of SOD1 are shown to be conserved in the chicken gene.
