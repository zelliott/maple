The effects of peripherally administered thyroid hormone (TH; 500 micrograms/kg; i.p.; q.d.) on the relative abundances of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) RNA were determined by rtPCR in the cortex and hippocampus of young adult rats. Corresponding changes in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity were measured since NGF and BDNF have been shown to enhance the expression of this marker enzyme of central cholinergic pathways. Abundance levels of NGF and NT-3, relative to cyclophilin (cycl), were increased significantly (+50%, P < 0.05) in the hippocampus following TH treatment. Despite enhanced abundance of NGF in the hippocampus, ChAT activity was unchanged, whereas ChAT activity was modestly increased by 28% in the cortex without corresponding changes in NGF, NT-3 or BDNF. These results demonstrate that TH administration is capable of inducing the accumulation of NT-3, in addition to NGF but that the induction levels of RNA cannot be directly correlated with responsivity of the cholinergic system as measured by ChAT activity.
