A full-length cDNA encoding a non-photosynthetic ferredoxin was isolated from apical buds of morning glory (Pharbitis nil), a short-day plant, by differential screening under flower-inducing and non-inducing conditions. Northern analysis and in situ hybridization showed that the transcript was abundant in shoot apices and root tips. The transcript level in the apical buds decreased with the flower-inducing light treatment.
