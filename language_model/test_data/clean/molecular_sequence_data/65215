Polysaccharide from Tinospora cordifolia was isolated, purified, methylated, hydrolyzed, reduced and acetylated. The partially methylated alditol acetate (PMAA) derivative thus obtained was subjected to GC-MS studies. The following types of linkages were noticed: terminal-glucose, 4-xylose, 4-glucose, 4,6-glucose and 2,3,4,6-glucose.
