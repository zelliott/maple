Epirubicin has been widely used for chemotherapeutic treatment of gastric cancer; however, intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance remains an obstacle to successful management. The mechanisms underlying epirubicin resistance are still not well defined. Here we report the construction and application of a partially randomized retrovirus library of 4 x 10(6) small interfering RNAs to identify novel genes whose suppression confers epirubicin resistance in gastric cancer cells SGC7901. From 12 resistant cell colonies, two small interfering RNAs targeting GAS1 (growth arrest-specific 1) and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), respectively, were identified and validated. We identified a previously unrecognized chemoresistance role for GAS1. GAS1 suppression resulted in significant epirubicin resistance and cross-resistance to 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin in various gastric cancer cell lines. GAS1 suppression promoted multidrug resistance through apoptosis inhibition, partially by up-regulating the Bcl-2/Bax ratio that was abolished by Bcl-2 inhibition. GAS1 suppression induced chemoresistance partially by increasing drug efflux in an ATP-binding cassette transporter and drug-dependent manner. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein) but not MRP-1 were up-regulated, and targeted knockdown of P-gp and BCRP could partially reverse GAS1 suppression-induced epirubicin resistance. Verapamil, a P-gp inhibitor, could reverse P-gp substrate (epirubicin) but not non-P-gp substrate (5-fluorouracil and cisplatin) resistance in GAS1-suppressed gastric cancer cells. BCRP down-regulation could partially reverse 5-fluorouracil but not cisplatin resistance induced by GAS1 suppression, suggesting 5-fluorouracil but not cisplatin was a BCRP substrate. These results suggest that GAS1 might be a target to overcome multidrug resistance and provide a novel approach to identifying candidate genes that suppress chemoresistance of gastric cancers.
