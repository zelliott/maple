Studies on New World hystricomorph rodents have revealed interesting structural divergences in the peptide hormones of the islets of Langerhans, particularly with respect to insulin and glucagon. Herein we report the isolation and sequencing of a cDNA encoding the precursor of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) from a guinea pig pancreas cDNA library. The 126-residue precursor sequence is predicted to include a 26-residue NH2-terminal signal peptide followed by the 36-amino acid PP hormonal sequence and a large COOH-terminal extension. The sequence identity between guinea pig and human PP is 89% (32/36 residues), and the predicted sequence is in agreement with that reported by Eng et al. (Eng, J., Huang, C.-G., Pan, Y.-C. E., Hulmes, J. D., and Yalow, R. S. (1987) Peptides 8, 165-168). In contrast, the icosapeptide domain in the guinea pig precursor exhibits only 40% (8/20) identity with the corresponding human precursor domain, and the COOH-terminal extension differs greatly in both sequence and size. The guinea pig precursor lacks the monobasic processing site (Pro-Arg) found at the COOH terminus of the icosapeptide domain in human, ovine, canine, and feline proPP. An icosapeptide is thus not likely to be liberated as such from this precursor. Of particular interest in guinea pig proPP is the substitution of serine for arginine at the dibasic amino acid processing site on the COOH-terminal side of the PP domain. Results of radioimmunoassays of gel-filtered protein fractions from a guinea pig pancreas extract indicate that efficient proteolytic cleavage takes place at this Lys-Ser site and that mature guinea pig PP is normally carboxyamidated.
