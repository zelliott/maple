CD and nmr spectroscopy were used to compare the conformational properties of two related peptides. One of the peptides, Model AB, was designed to adopt a helix-turn-extended strand (alpha beta) tertiary structure in water that might be stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between two leucine residues in the amino-terminal segment and two methionine residues in the carboxyl terminal segment. The other peptide, AB Helix, has the same amino acid sequence as Model AB except that it lacks the -Pro-Met-Thr-Met-Thr-Gly segment at the carboxyl-terminus. Although the carboxyl-terminal segment of Model AB was found to be unstructured, its presence increases the number of residues in a helical conformation, shifts the pKas of three ionizable side chains by 1 pH unit or more compared to an unstructured peptide, stabilizes the peptide as a monomer in high concentrations of ammonium sulfate, increases the conformational stability of residues at the terminal ends of the helix, and results in many slowly exchanging amide protons throughout the entire backbone of the peptide. These results suggest that interactions between adjacent segments in a small peptide can have significant structure organizing effects. Similar kinds of interactions may be important in determining the structure of early intermediates in protein folding and may be useful in the de novo design of independently folding peptides.
