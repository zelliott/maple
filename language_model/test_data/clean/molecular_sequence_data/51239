We used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the breakpoint area of alpha-thalassemia-1 of Southeast Asia type and several parts of the alpha-globin gene cluster to make a differential diagnosis between alpha-thalassemia-1 and Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis. The procedure involved three primers to detect the homozygote of alpha-thalassemia-1, then amplifies the other alpha-globin gene cluster with three other pairs of primers to double check the results. The PCR products were checked again by allele specific probes. Twenty-two cases were diagnosed prenatally, two were normal, 17 were alpha-thalassemia-1, and three Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis. All cases were confirmed either by Southern blot hybridization or follow-up by sonography or after delivery. No false positive or false negative results were obtained by our strigent procedure. We conclude it to be a rapid, accurate and economic method.
