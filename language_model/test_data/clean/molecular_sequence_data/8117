We recently demonstrated a high frequency of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the D17S856 and D17S855 (within the BRCA1 gene) loci in primary prostate cancer, suggesting that the BRCA1 gene and/or other tumor suppressor gene(s) located within the interval of the D17S856 and D17S855 loci and/or within the vicinity of this interval may be important in prostate cancer (Cancer Res., 55: 1002-1005, 1995). To further define the exact boundary of the deleted region (i.e., D17S856/D17S855) and to detect other possible LOH regions on the long arm of chromosome 17, we analysed 23 matched normal and tumor DNAs with 15 polymorphic microsatellite markers spanning chromosome 17q12-21. Eleven of 22 (50%) informative tumors showed allelic deletion at one or more of the loci studied. A minimal area of LOH was identified to extend from the proximal boundary at the D17S776 locus to the distal boundary at the D17S855 locus, spanning an estimated < 2 Mb segment on chromosome 17q21. Our results suggest that a potential tumor suppressor gene(s) may reside in the < 2 Mb region centromeric (inclusive) to the BRCA1 gene and that this tumor suppressor gene(s) may be involved in the formation of prostate cancer.
