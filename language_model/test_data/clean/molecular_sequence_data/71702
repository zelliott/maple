In order to elucidate the structure-antibiotic activity relationship of cecropin A-magainin 2 and cecropin A-melittin hybrid peptides, several truncated peptides and the analogues with amino acid substitutions were synthesized and their antibacterial, antitumor and hemolytic activities of were examined. Cecropin A-magainin 2 hybrid analog, L16-CA(1-8)-MA(1-12) (termed as L-CA-MA in this study: KWKLFKKIGIGKFLHLAKKF-NH2), is known to have potent antibacterial and antitumor activity with less hemolytic activity. We found that the C-terminal region of L-CA-MA is more involved in the alpha-helical structure on cell membrane-like environment than N-terminal one by circular dichroism analysis. Deletion of the Gly-Ile-Gly sequence, the central hinge region of L-CA-MA, produced a considerable reduction in antitumor and hemolytic activity rather than an antibacterial one. The insertion of Pro, Gly-Ile or Gly-Pro in this hinge region of L-CA-MA caused retention of both antibacterial and antitumor activity while causing a significant decrease in hemolytic activity. However, the substitution with Gly-Pro-Gly instead of the Gly-Ile-Gly in CA(1-8)-MA(1-12), CA(1-8)-ME(1-12), CA(1-13)-MA(1-13) and CA(1-13)-ME(1-13) hybrids resulted in a drastic decrease in antibacterial, antitumor and hemolytic activity. The increase of hydrophobicity at position 16 in CA(1-8)-MA(1-12) by substituting Trp or Phe induced a significant increase in hemolytic activity without a considerable change in either antibacterial or antitumor activity. Therefore, these results suggested that the appropriate flexibility in the hinge region of CA-MA and CA-ME hybrid peptides and the appropriate hydrophobicity at position 16 in the hydrophobic region of CA (1-8)-MA(1-12) are important in potent antibacterial and antitumor activity with no hemolytic effect.
