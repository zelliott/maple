In extraocular muscle tissue of elderly humans small amounts of point mutations in tRNA genes of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were identified by point mutation-specific PCR. These mutations were not found in navel-string samples from newborns. While the mutations in tRNA(Leu(UUR)) (np 3243) and tRNA(Gly) (np 10006), previously identified in patients with MELAS and CIPO, respectively, were found in most elderly people, the mutations in tRNA(Ser(GCU)O (np 12246) and tRNA(Asn) (np 5692), identified in patients with CIPO and CPEO, respectively, were found only in two of 15 tissue samples from different individuals. The data suggest that some nucleotides of mtDNA represent "hot spots" for somatic mutations, which contribute to human aging.
