This paper is devoted to the comparative study of redundancy of genetic texts of various organisms and viruses. To determine the redundance of a gene, we have introduced the strict measure for that latter. The measure for a text's redundance is the length of restriction of Frequency/Correlation Dictionary of a given genetic text. Frequency/Correlation Dictionary is the ser of all subsequences belong to a given genetic text, accompanied by the frequencies of their occurrence. The restriction length is defined as that one, for which all the subsequences (of that length) are unique. We have found, that genes of human viruses are less redundant, in comparison to those of human genes. Other aspects of a comparative redundance investigations of the genes are discussed. The problem of the determination of "truet" intron could be treated by this methodology, as well, as the evolution of genome.
