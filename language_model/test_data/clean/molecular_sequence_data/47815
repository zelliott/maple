Using differential-display RT-PCR analysis between androgen-dependent LNCaP-FGC and androgen-independent LNCaP-LNO human prostate-cancer cells, we have identified a gene not previously described as being expressed in prostate. The gene is more highly expressed in androgen-independent than in androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate-cancer cells. Sequence analysis showed that the gene has already been cloned as a transcript present in embryonic brain, with unknown functions. Expression of the gene was found not to be restricted to the prostate, and not regulated by androgens in androgen-independent prostate-cancer cells. In concert with the cell-culture system, Northern-blot analysis of gene expression in vivo, using a panel of human prostate-cancer xenografts, demonstrated that the gene is more highly expressed in androgen-independent than in androgen-dependent prostate-cancer xenografts. The gene could be mapped on human chromosome 8q11. The 8q arm is known to be frequently amplified during prostate-cancer progression and harbors several proto-oncogenes potentially involved in cancer development. Since expression of the gene is positively correlated with prostate-cancer progression and its 8q11 chromosomal localization, we hypothesize that the gene may be involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer.
