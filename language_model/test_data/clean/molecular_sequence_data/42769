A cDNA clone containing an insert of about 3.4 kb, pCIREBP, was isolated from the chicken liver cDNA library and identified as a clone for the chicken homologue of iron-responsive element-binding protein (IREBP). The deduced amino acid sequence showed 88% identity with that of the mouse IREBP and 17 out of the 20 active site residues of the pig heart mitochondrial aconitase were conserved. Another cDNA clone, pZOV3, containing an insert of about 4.5 kb was isolated from the chicken ovary cDNA library. This cDNA contained an open reading frame for 327 amino acid residues, whose sequence had partial similarity to two immunoglobulin superfamily proteins; mouse GP-70 and chicken HT7. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using corresponding genomic clones revealed that both genes are localized on the Z chromosome; the ZOV3 gene at the middle of the short arm and the IREBP gene at the boundary of heterochromatin on the long arm. Southern blot hybridization to male and female genomic DNA preparations from six species representing five avian genera suggested that these two genes are Z-linked in all the species tested.
