A modified protocol for DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with laser densitometric determination of the amount of PCR products, which allowed quantitation of target sequence numbers in soil extracts, was developed. The method was applied to monitor target loss during incubation of purified plasmid DNA in natural nonsterile soils. It revealed soil-specific kinetics of target loss. After 60 days, 0.2, 0.05, and 0.01% of the initially added nahA genes on plasmids were detectable by PCR in a loamy sand soil, a clay soil, and a silty clay soil, respectively. Electroporation of Escherichia coli was used in parallel to quantitate plasmid molecules in soil extracts by their transforming activity. It was found that transformation by electroporation was about 20 times more efficient and much less inhibited by constituents of soil extracts than transformation of Ca(2+)-treated cells (G. Romanowski, M.G. Lorenz, G. Sayler, and W. Wackernagel, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 58:3012-3019, 1992). By electroporation, greater than 10,000-fold plasmid loss was monitored in nonsterile soils. Transforming activity was found up to 60 days after inoculation of the soils. The studies indicate that PCR and electroporation are sensitive methods for monitoring the persistence of extracellular plasmid DNA in soil. It is proposed that plasmid transformation by electroporation can be used for the monitoring in soil and other environments of genetically engineered organisms with recombinant plasmids. The data suggest that genetic material may persist in soil for weeks and even for months after its release from cells.
