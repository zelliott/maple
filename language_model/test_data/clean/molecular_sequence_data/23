Plants show distinct morphologies in different light conditions through a process called photomorphogenesis. A predominant feature of photomorphogenesis is the reduced growth of seedlings under light conditions compared with darkness. For this adaptive event, the most well-known molecular mechanism involves photoreceptor-mediated inhibition of cell elongation. However, it is not known whether additional pathways exist. Here, we describe a newly discovered pathway of light-modulated plant growth mediated by the halotolerance protein HAL3, a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding protein involved in cell division. We found that light, especially blue light, suppresses growth of rice seedlings by reducing the activity of Oryza sativa (Os) HAL3. Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed that OsHAL3 is structurally inactivated by light through photo-oxidation and by direct interaction with photons. In addition, the transcriptional expression of OsHAL3 is synergistically regulated by different light conditions. Further investigation suggested that OsHAL3 promotes cell division by recruiting a ubiquitin system, rather than by its 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine (PPC) decarboxylase activity. Our results uncover a new mechanism for light-regulated plant growth, namely, light not only inhibits cell elongation but also suppresses cell division through HAL3 and E3 ubiquitin ligase. This study thus brings new insights into our understanding of plant photomorphogenesis.
