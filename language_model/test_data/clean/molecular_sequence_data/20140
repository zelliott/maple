We report the synthesis of collagen related peptides containing the peptide sequence Lys-Hyp-Gly-Glu-Hyp-Gly-Pro-Lys. The alpha-triple helix peptides behave as type III collagen analogues supporting platelet aggregation, while the homotrimer which does not exhibit a triple-helical conformation inhibits type III collagen-induced human platelet aggregation. The incorporation of the octapeptide sequence in type III collagen mimetic peptides may lead to the loss of the anti-thrombotic activity for a pro-thrombotic one.
