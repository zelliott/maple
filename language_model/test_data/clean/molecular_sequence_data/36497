Polyclonal (RP) and monoclonal (Ab) antibodies were raised against synthetic peptides (or fusion proteins) corresponding to amino acid sequences unique to human and mouse retinoic acid receptor-beta (RAR beta) isoforms. Antibodies directed against the A2 region [Ab6 beta 2(A2), Ab7 beta 2(A2), and RP beta 2(A2)], the D2 region [RP beta(D2)], or the F region [Ab8 beta(F)2, RP beta(F)1, and RP beta(F)2] were selected. The monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies directed against the D2 and F regions specifically immunoprecipitated and recognized by Western blotting all human and mouse RAR beta isoforms (mRAR beta 1, -beta 2, -beta 3, and -beta 4), produced in COS-1 cells transfected with expression vectors containing the corresponding RAR beta cDNA. Furthermore, in gel retardation assays, the monoclonal antibodies supershifted RAR beta protein-RA response element oligonucleotide complexes. Antibodies directed against the A2 region were specific for the RAR beta 2 isoform. The above antibodies allowed us to detect the presence of mRAR beta 2 proteins in mouse embryos and to show that their presence in embryonal carcinoma cells (F9 and P19 cell lines) is dependent upon RA treatment. The antibodies were also used to demonstrate that RAR beta proteins produced by transfection in COS-1 cells are phosphorylated. RAR beta 2 phosphorylation was not affected by RA treatment, whereas the phosphorylation of RAR beta 1 and RAR beta 3 isoforms was greatly enhanced by RA. We also show that, in contrast to RAR alpha 1 and RAR gamma 1, RAR beta 2 proteins contain phosphotyrosine residues and are only weakly phosphorylated in vitro by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These results support our previous proposal that the various receptors have distinct functions in the RA-signaling pathway.
