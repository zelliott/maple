The authors have previously reported that the glycoprotein of the pathogenic Nishigahara strain of rabies virus is required to lethality for adult mice. A cluster region of amino acid substitutions exists at the positions 164 to 303 on the glycoprotein between avirulent and virulent strains. In this study, the authors generated a chimeric strain having the region at the positions 164 to 303 of the glycoprotein derived from the pathogenic Nishigahara strain in the genetic background of the avirulent RC-HL strain. The chimeric R(G 164-303) strain restores the lethality for adult mice. This result clearly shows that the region at the position 164 to 303 of glycoprotein plays an important role in the lethality for adult mice. Moreover, the authors observed that the lethality for adult mice correlated well with the viral growth in a brain but not with the pH-dependent fusion activity in vitro.
