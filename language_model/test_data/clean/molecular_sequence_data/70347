Thirteen (GT)n and four (CT)n microsatellite loci (n = 10 or more and n = 20 or more, respectively) have been isolated from a partial genomic library of brown trout and sequenced. On average, a (GT)n repeat sequence occurs approximately every 23 kb and a (CT)n repeat sequence every 76 kb in brown trout genome. Primers for DNA amplifications using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were synthesized for three single locus microsatellites. Mendelian inheritance of the observed polymorphisms was confirmed in full-sib families. Four brown trout populations (10 unrelated individuals per population) were screened for polymorphism with these three microsatellite loci. The total number of alleles detected in the four populations is five at one locus, six at the other two microsatellite loci and is three, on average, per population. Heterozygosities range from 0.18 to 0.74. The largest differences in allelic frequencies occurred between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic populations: this result is congruent with previous allozymic data. The gene-centromere distances of the three microsatellite markers were determined on gynogenetic lines: post-reduction rates range from 0.17 to 0.60. For all the three microsatellite loci, the primers designed from brown trout sequences can be used in another closely related species of salmonid, the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). This last aspect supports the view that microsatellite markers may have wide application in genetic studies in salmonid species and fishes in general.
