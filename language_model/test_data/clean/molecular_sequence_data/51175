Characterization of unstable hemoglobins by protein analysis is often difficult. However, it is facilitated by DNA analysis, especially in the case of hyperunstable beta-chain variants, which produce a beta-thalassemia phenotype. We have applied an efficient strategy to the detection of such variants at the DNA level, based on computer-designed denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of amplified DNA fragments. This approach makes it possible to detect any anomaly in the beta-globin gene. We describe the use of the DGGE method for rapid characterization of beta-chain variants and report a new missense mutation in the beta-globin gene third exon, beta 127 CAG-CGG/Gln-Arg, which is responsible for the synthesis of a highly unstable hemoglobin.
