The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is up-regulated in response to sensitizing treatments with serotonin (5-HT), plays a critical role in inducing long-term facilitation (LTF) of sensory-to-motor synapses in Aplysia. We characterized the structure of the polyubiquitin gene of Aplysia and studied its expression. At least six ubiquitin coding units exist in tandem, one of which encodes a protein with an amino acid sequence identical to human ubiquitin. Although the synthesis of polyubiquitin is induced by strong stimuli in many organisms, we found that the expression of ubiquitin in Aplysia is not affected by protocols that produce LTF.
