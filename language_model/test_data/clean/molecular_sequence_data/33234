Mab7.3 to Yersinia pestis LcrV antigen (LcrV(Ype)) protected J774A.1 macrophages in vitro from killing by a Yersinia pseudotuberculosis strain expressing LcrV(Ype). Of 4 site-directed mutations in the coiled-coil region (148-169) and 7 mutations in the 225-255 sequence of LcrV(Ype), only the mutation of N255 to D255, abrogated the binding of Mab7.3 and reduced its protective capacity against plague. Since the Mab7.3 epitope in LcrV(Ype) (135-275) encompasses a region (136-180) thought to be exposed on the injectisome, we suggest that Mab7.3 protects by binding to LcrV(Ype) and interfering with protein-protein interactions necessary for type three secretion.
