The nuclear thyroid hormone (T3) receptor, encoded by the c-erbA genes, represses transcriptional activation by the transcription factor AP-1 in a T3-dependent fashion. The viral homologue of the T3 receptor, the v-erbA gene product, does not repress AP-1 activity. Inhibition by T3 involves reduced binding of AP-1 to its cognate DNA target sequence. The reduction in AP-1 binding does not, however, result from competitive binding by the T3 receptor to the AP-1 response element.
