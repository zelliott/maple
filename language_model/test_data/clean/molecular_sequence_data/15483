A novel actinomycete strain, designated SCSIO 01066(T), was isolated from a marine sediment sample collected from the Nansha Islands in the South China Sea and was subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. A phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain SCSIO 01066(T) had the highest similarity (96.5 %) to members of the genus Streptomyces and was loosely associated with Streptomyces armeniacus JCM 3070(T), Streptomyces cacaoi subsp. cacaoi NBRC 12748(T) and Streptomyces sodiiphilus YIM 80305(T). Predominant menaquinones, major fatty acids and morphological properties were also consistent with typical characteristics of the genus Streptomyces; however, the presence of phosphatidylglycerol in the phospholipid pattern differs greatly from those of members of the genus Streptomyces. Additionally, strain SCSIO 01066(T) showed some physiological differences from its most closely related neighbours. Based on the polyphasic data, a novel species, Streptomyces nanshensis sp. nov., is proposed, with the type strain SCSIO 01066(T) (=KCTC 19400(T)=CCTCC AA 208005(T)).
