Although it has been established that CD45 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level, neither the regulatory elements that are responsible for its unique expression pattern nor the relevance of its three distinct transcriptional start sites (P1a, P1b, and P2) has been fully characterized. We studied the contribution of the three start sites to CD45 mRNA production in haematopoietic cell lines and primary haematopoietic cells. In myeloid and lymphoid cells and cell lines most CD45 transcripts originate from P1b with the exception of the thymoma-derived T cell line EL4, in which approximately 90% of CD45 transcripts originate from P1a. The degree of contribution of P1a is highest in lymphoid cells and increases in T cells following mitogen stimulation. In vitro evaluation of sequence upstream of the start sites shows that the P2 start site is sufficient for CD45 expression in lymphoid but not in myeloid cells, confirms the presence of a PU.1-binding site essential for myeloid expression of CD45, and reveals an Octamer-binding site that interacts with both Oct-1 and Oct-2 and activates CD45 transcription in lymphoid and myeloid cells. These findings are the first evidence that Octamer-binding factors are involved in the control of CD45 expression.
