Group A rotaviruses (RV-A) are the leading cause of viral gastroenteritis in children worldwide and genotype G9P[8] is one of the five most common genotypes detected in humans. In order to gain insight into the degree of genetic variability of G9P[8] strains circulating in Cameroon, stool samples were collected during the 1999-2000 rotavirus season in two different geographic regions in Cameroon (Southwest and Western Regions). By RT-PCR, 15 G9P[8] strains (15/89=16.8%) were identified whose genomic configurations was subsequently determined by complete or partial gene sequencing. In general, all Cameroonian G9 strains clustered into current globally-spread sublineages of the VP7 gene and displayed 86.6-100% nucleotide identity amongst themselves and 81.2-99.5% nucleotide identity with global G9 strains. The full genome classification of all Cameroonian strains was G9-P[8]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1 but phylogenetic analysis of each gene revealed that the strains were spread across 4 or more distinct lineages. An unusual strain, RVA/Human-wt/CMR/6788/1999/G9P[8], which shared the genomic constellation of other Cameroonian G9P[8] strains, contained a novel G9 subtype which diverged significantly (18.8% nucleotide and 19% amino acid distance) from previously described G9 strains. Nucleotide and amino acid alignments revealed that the 3' end of this gene is highly divergent from other G9 VP7 genes suggesting that it arose through extensive accumulation of point mutations. The results of this study demonstrate that diverse G9 strains circulated in Cameroon during 1999-2000.
