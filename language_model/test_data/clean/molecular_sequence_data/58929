The growth and function the normal prostate is dependent on the presence of androgen. As prostate tumors progress there is a loss of androgen-dependent cell growth. The identification of the genes that are regulated by androgens may be of pathological and clinical significance.

In this study the differential display method was used to identify genes regulated by androgen in an androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP-FGC.

A gene whose expression is down-regulated in LNCaP-FGC cells after 30 hr of androgen deprivation has been identified. This gene is a previously identified member of the S100 gene family of calcium-binding proteins, namely S100P. Here we show that S100P expression is regulated by the synthetic androgen R1881, but not by serum growth factors. It is dysregulated in the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP-R, DU145, and PC3.

The data indicate that S100P may play a role in the etiology of prostate cancer.
