A gene similar to lef-8 of the Autographa californica (Ac) nucleopolyhedrovirus (MNPV) was identified in the Spodoptera littoralis (Spli) MNPV. The SpliMNPV lef-8-like gene was localized on the genomic map between 26.9 and 29 map units and is flanked by a chitinase gene and p47 gene. This gene arrangement differs from that of similar genes in the AcMNPV genome, where the lef-8 gene is located about 62 kbp from the chitinase gene and about 7 kbp from the p47 gene. Sequence analyses of the lef-8 gene revealed an ORF of 2730 nucleotides, predicted to encode a protein with Mr 104876. The putative protein is 60.9% identical to the AcMNPV LEF-8 and contains an identical sequence of a conserved motif of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Sequences downstream of the lef-8 gene contain two sequence repeats which resemble a repeated motif of the SpliMNPV enhancer element and other repetitive sequences from the viral genome.
