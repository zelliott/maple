PAL (L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase), the first enzyme of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, is often encoded by multigene families in plants. A PCR-based approach was used to isolate cDNA clones corresponding to the four PAL genes of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). By careful comparison of cDNA and genomic clones, a new PAL gene (PAL4) was defined. PCR amplification of PAL sequences from cDNA led to the generation of chimaeric clones between PAL1 and PAL4, and incorrect annotation of PAL4 ESTs (expressed sequence tags) as PAL1 in the EST database has given rise to a randomly shuffled tentative consensus sequence. The PAL2 previously described in the literature was shown, by domain swapping experiments with PAL1, to possess a single nucleotide substitution leading to an inactive enzyme. The altered amino acid resulting from this substitution maps to the base of the active site pocket in the three-dimensional structure of PAL. The inactive PAL2 allele could not be recovered from 13 different tobacco cultivars examined. PALs 1-4 were co-expressed in multiple plant organs, and were also co-induced following exposure of cell cultures to yeast elicitor or methyl jasmonate. All four tobacco PAL proteins expressed in Escherichia coli displayed normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with Km values between 36 and 60 muM. Co-expression of different PAL proteins in E. coli resulted in formation of heterotetramers, which possessed kinetic properties within the same range as those of the individual homotetramers. The potential physiological function of heterotetrameric PAL forms is discussed.
