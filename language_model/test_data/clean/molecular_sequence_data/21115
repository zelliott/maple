Mycoplasma synoviae is an important causative agent of avian mycoplasmosis. In the present study the conserved domain of the variable lipoprotein and hemagglutinin (vlhA) gene of M. synoviae was sequenced and analyzed for 19 field strains of M. synoviae isolated from chickens across Japan. This analysis revealed that there were at least nine genotypes of M. synoviae present in Japan. Furthermore, we found a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within this region in all the Japanese isolates, and based on this finding, we established a PCR method with cycling probe technology to differentiate between these field isolates and the live M. synoviae vaccine strain Mycoplasma synoviae-H (MS-H).
