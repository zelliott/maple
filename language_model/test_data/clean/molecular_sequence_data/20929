Cervid herpesvirus 2 (CvHV2) has never been isolated from reindeer in Norway, but serological data and investigations by PCR indicate that the virus is endemic in the country, with horizontal and vertical transmission, systemic spread, and latency in the trigeminal ganglion. In this study two seropositive reindeer, one of which was pregnant, were administered dexamethasone, to reactivate CvHV2 latent infection. One control animal received sterile water. All animals including the control reactivated, as shown by amplification of CvHV2 DNA from nasal swabs. The pregnant animal showed lesions in the lip mucosa 10 days after the first dexamethasone injection and CvHV2 was visualized by electron microscopy and isolated from those lesions, as well as from nasal and vaginal swabs. On day 13 she aborted and CvHV2 was isolated from both the aborted calf and the mother. CvHV2 was isolated from the other animal administered dexamethasone. Despite amplification of viral DNA in the control animal, it was never possible to isolate the virus. Molecular characterization of the new isolates confirmed these to be CvHV2, and similar to the previous known strain Salla82. Present results represent the first isolation of CvHV2 in Norway and reconfirm that this virus can cause systemic infections in reindeer even after reactivation episodes, and infect the fetus in utero despite a prompt immune response. While it is not possible to atribute the abortion to CvHV2 alone, present data together with previous reports of vertical transmission of CvHV2 and neonatal death, point to an abortogenic potential, which should be further investigated.
