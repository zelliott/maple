The gene lcc3-2 encoding a second laccase of the white-rot fungus Pycnoporus cinnabarinus has been cloned, sequenced, and characterized. The isolated gene consists of 2840bp, with the coding region interrupted by ten introns and flanked by an upstream region in which putative CAAT and TATA boxes were identified. The cDNA of lcc3-2 contains an open reading frame of 1563bp. The deduced mature laccase protein consisted of 498 amino acids and was preceded by a signal peptide of 23 amino acids. The sequence of lcc3-2 reveals 73% similarity on the protein level to the previously characterized lcc3-1. The new laccase gene shares highest similarity to lcc1 from Trametes villosa (75%), and lcc2 from the unidentified basidiomycete CECT 20197 (75%). The calculated isoelectric point (pI) of 6.1 for the gene product LCC3-2 was in good agreement with the experimentally determined pI of a laccase secreted by P. cinnabarinus grown on cellulose. Transcription analysis using competitive reverse transcription (RT)-PCR showed that lcc3-2 was expressed in glucose and cellulose containing cultures. However, in contrast to lcc3-1, lcc3-2 transcription was not increased in response to 2,5-xylidine.
