The Ca2+ pump of the plasma membrane (PMCA) is regulated by a number of agents. The most important is calmodulin (CaM), which binds to a domain located in the C-terminal portion of the pump, removing it from an autoinhibitory site next to the active site. The CaM-binding domain is preceded by an acidic sequence which contains a hidden signal for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention. Chimeras of the PMCA and endoplasmic reticulum (SERCA) pumps have revealed the presence of a strong signal for ER retention in the first 45 residues of the SERCA pump. Four gene products of the PMCA pump are known: two of them (1 and 4) are ubiquitously expressed, two (2 and 3) are specific for nerve cells and may be induced by their activation. Mutagenesis work has identified four residues in three of the transmembrane domains of the pump which may be components of the trans-protein Ca2+ path. The mutation of two of these residues alters the membrane targeting of the pump.
