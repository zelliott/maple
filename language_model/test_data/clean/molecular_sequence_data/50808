The gene encoding a putative G protein-coupled receptor (HG10) was cloned from human genomic DNA by low stringency PCR and found to be homologous to the recently described rat bradykinin B2 receptor. The receptor was expressed in xenopus oocytes and stably transfected CHO cell lines. Binding studies demonstrated that HG10 encodes a high affinity BK receptor with an apparent Kd of 150 pM. Displacement by BK agonists and antagonists allowed the characterization of the receptor as a B2 subtype. Functional coupling to the Ca(2+)-phosphatidylinositol cascade was demonstrated in transfected CHO cells where inositol phosphates accumulation and intracellular calcium concentration were elevated in response to BK stimulation. The agonistic and antagonistic properties of BK analogs do not match strictly the pharmacological profile described for the rat or guinea pig B2 receptor subtypes or the putative B3 subtype. This discrepancy is attributed either to species variability or to differences in the coupling efficiency of receptors to the transduction cascade in different cell types. From our results, the existence of B3 receptors and of B2 subtypes appears questionable.
