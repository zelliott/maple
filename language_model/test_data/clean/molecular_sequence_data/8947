Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infects wild and domestic birds but causes contagious and lethal disease in domestic poultry. ND is currently endemic in Pakistan, but no complete genome sequence of a Pakistani NDV isolate has been reported. An NDV strain isolated from a commercial poultry farm was completely sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolate is closely related to genotype VII and, more specifically, to subgenotype VIIb, yet with substantial enough differences to be regarded as new subgenotype (VIIf). These findings provide insight into the genetic nature of NDV circulating in Pakistan and are useful for both laboratory diagnosis and vaccine development for NDV.
