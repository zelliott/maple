Glucosamine (Gln), glucosamine polymers, and their catecholamine adducts were characterized using positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS) and tandem mass spectrometry (ESMS-MS). N-acetyldopamine (NADA), a catecholamine found in many insect cuticles, was oxidized using mushroom tyrosinase, and the resulting quinone derivatives were reacted with Gln, (Gln)3, and polymeric glucosamine (chitosan). Adducts of glucosamine and its trisaccharide with NADA were readily identified as [M + H]+ ions in ESMS spectra, and ESMS-MS of selected ions confirmed the condensation of 1-3 NADA residues with Gln. In addition to Gln modification by the quinone derivatives of NADA, other spectra were consistent with the formation of adducts with N-acetylnoradrenaline and moieties formed by intramolecular cyclization following oxidation. The primary amine of glucosamine was involved in initial adduct formation, but the sites for subsequent additions of oxidized NADA to glucosamine, presumably via hydroxyl groups, could not be identified by ESMS alone. The ESMS spectra of chitosan films infused into the spectrometer following solubilization in acidic methanol/water produced spectra similar to that of (Gln)3 up to m/z 502. Ions of gradually decreasing intensity consistent with (Gln)x, where x = 4-8, were observed. Modification of chitosan films following incubation with NADA plus tyrosinase rendered the films insoluble in dilute acid, simulating the cross-linking process proposed to occur during insect cuticle sclerotization. Acid hydrolysates of the pupal stage of the mosquito Toxorhynchites amboinensis, using only two pupal exuviae for the hydrolyses, were infused into the mass spectrometer without preliminary chromatography. Eight amino acids, glucosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, catecholamines, and a variety of polymers incorporating these compound classes were identified.
