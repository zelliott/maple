Frog, Rana esculenta, pituitary and testis gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors were characterized by using 125I-chicken IIGnRH (cIIGnRH) as radiolabeled ligand. At 4 C equilibrium binding of 125I-cIIGnRH to pituitary homogenates was achieved after 90 min of incubation; binding of 125I-cIIGnRH to testis membrane fractions reached its maximum at 60 min of incubation. Binding of the radioligand was a function of tissue concentration, with a positive correlation over the range 0.5-2 tissue equivalents per tube. One pituitary and one testis per tube were used as standard experimental condition. Incubation of the pituitary homogenate with increasing concentrations of 125I-cIIGnRH indicated saturable binding at radioligand concentrations of 1 nM and above while for the testis membrane preparation saturation was achieved using 5 nM 125I-cIIGnRH. The binding of 125I-cIIGnRH was found to be reversible after addition of the cold analog and the displacement curves could be resolved into one linear component for both tissues. Scatchard analysis suggested the presence of one class of binding sites for both pituitary and testis (Pituitary: Kd = 1.25 +/- 0.14 nM and Bmax = 8.55 +/- 2.72 fmol/mg protein; testis: Kd = 2.23 +/- 0.89 nM and Bmax = 26.48 +/- 7.39 fmol/mg protein). Buserelin displaced the labeled 125I-cIIGnRH with a lower IC50 as compared with cIIGnRH cold standard, while Arg-vasopressin (AVP) was completely ineffective, confirming the specificity of binding.
