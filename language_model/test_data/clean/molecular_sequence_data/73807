Diagnostics for genetic diseases were run and sequence analysis of DNA was carried out by hybridization of RNA transcripts with oligonucleotide array microchips. Polyacrylamide gel pads (100 x 100 x 20 microm) were fixed on a glass slide of the microchip and contained allele-specific immobilized oligonucleotides (10-mers). The RNA transcripts of PCR-amplified genomic DNA were fluorescently labeled by enzymatic or chemical methods and hybridized with the microchips. The simultaneous measurement in real time of the hybridization and melting on the entire oligonucleotide array was carried out with a fluorescence microscope equipped with CCD camera. The monitoring of the hybridization specificity for duplexes with different stabilities and AT content was enhanced by its measurement at optimal, discrimination temperatures on melting curves. Microchip diagnostics were optimized by choosing the proper allele-specific oligonucleotides from among the set of overlapping oligomers. The accuracy of mutation detection can be increased by simultaneous hybridization of the microchip with two differently labeled samples and by parallel monitoring their hybridization with a multi-wavelength fluorescence microscope. The efficiency and reliability of the sequence analysis were demonstrated with diagnostics for beta-thalassemia mutations.
