This paper presents the first molecular phylogeny of the genus Passiflora encompassing almost all sections of this large genus. The nuclear-encoded chloroplast-expressed glutamine synthetase gene (ncpGS) was used to examine the relationships among Passiflora species (passionflowers), which was then compared with the new classification proposed by Feuillet and MacDougal. The resulting Bayesian, likelihood, and parsimony trees are congruent and well supported. The 90 Passiflora species examined apparently split into eight main subgenera: Plectostemma, Granadilla, Astrophea, Deidamioides, Polyanthea, Dysosmia, Tetrapathea, and Tryphostemmatoides. These results are in overall agreement with the Feuillet and MacDougal's classification but here we propose that three additional subgenera, Polyanthea, Dysosmia, and Tetrapathea, should be maintained. We observe a striking overall correlation between the phylogenetic position of the different species and their chromosome number. The first clade contains the arborescent species of the subgenus Astrophea, with n=12. The second clade, subgenus Plectostemma, includes species from four subgenera of Killip's classification with n=6 chromosomes. The last clade, subgenus Granadilla, includes species of seven old subgenera with n=9. Subgenus Dysosmia, with a variable chromosome number of n=9-11, is considered here as a separate subgenus closely related to the subgenus Granadilla.
