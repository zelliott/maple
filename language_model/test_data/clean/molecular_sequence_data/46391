We report a rare case of kerion celsi of the scalp caused by Microsporum gypseum in a boy 1 month after he received dermatoplasty for a scalp injury from a road accident. Species identification was performed by observation of morphologic and biochemical characteristics and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) 1 and 2. Treatment with oral terbinafine and topical naftifine-ketoconazole cream after washing the hair with ketoconazole shampoo was effective.
