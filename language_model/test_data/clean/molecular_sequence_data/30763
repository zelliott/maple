A computer program is designed to facilitate the identification of coding gene's fragments using a set of peptides. The program is written on Basic programming language for personal computer "Iskra-226" (USSR). To accelerate some operations, computer code commands are used. Treatment of 50 DNA fragments by means of 10 peptides takes ca. 1 h of computer time. The program outputs list coding gene's fragments and corresponding peptides. The suggested algorithm is based on our finding that the number of false identifications of a coding gene fragments may be predicted by Poisson distribution and minimized using correct criteria. The suggested method enables one to evaluate the reliability of the true identification of DNA fragments in case of mistakes in primary structure of the gene fragments or peptides.
