The heparin-binding acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF, bFGF) and their receptors in the bovine oviduct are described. By means of western blot analysis one 18 kDa aFGF and two bFGF proteins (16 and 18 kDa, respectively) were detected in oviductal flushings. Different concentrations of these two growth factors could be measured in oviductal flushings during the oestrous cycle: concentrations of aFGF protein were significantly higher at ovulation (mean +/- SEM; 5.3 +/- 0.5 ng ml-1) than during the luteal phase (3.0 +/- 0.3 ng ml-1); concentrations of bFGF were higher at the preovulatory stage (3.5 +/- 0.7 ng ml-1) than at the post-ovulatory stage (1.3 +/- 0.15 ng ml-1). Immunohistochemical studies using a/bFGF-specific antibodies indicated that these growth factors were localized mainly in oviduct epithelial cells. The sequence of the bovine FGF receptor (FGFR) was partly determined. Quantification of mRNAs by an RNase-protection assay (RPA) showed that expression of aFGF and bFGF was different during the oestrous cycle, indicating that the regulation of aFGF is separate from that of bFGF. Only mRNA encoding bFGF and FGFR could be detected in cumulus-oocyte complexes by reverse transcription PCR. In summary, the components of the FGF system were found in the bovine oviduct suggesting an autocrine or paracrine regulation involving oviduct cells and cumulus-oocyte complexes.
