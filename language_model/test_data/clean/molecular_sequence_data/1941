Faecal samples from 50 pigeons all originating from different lofts were screened for the presence of macrolide and lincosamide (ML)-resistant isolates of Streptococcus gallolyticus and Enterococcus columbae by plating the samples onto selective media. Sixty-eight ML-resistant E. columbae strains were recovered from the faecal samples of 29 animals. Two of these samples also harboured ML-resistant S. gallolyticus strains. The erm(B) gene was detected in 58 E. columbae and in five S. gallolyticus isolates. Four of these E. columbae isolates also carried the mef(A) gene. Five E. columbae strains possessed the mef(A) gene in the absence of erm(B). On the basis of the sequence of the complete erm(B) gene, 10 E. columbae isolates clustered together in six groups. In two of these isolates, the erm(B) gene sequence was identical to that of S. gallolyticus strains, indicating that exchange of resistance genes might occur between pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacterial species belonging to the pigeon's intestinal flora.
