An ahpC mutant derivative of Azospirillum brasilense Sp245 (strain SK586) that encodes an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase was found to be more sensitive to oxidative stress caused by organic hydroperoxides compared with the wild-type. In addition, the ahpC mutant strain had multiple defects in a large array of cellular functions that were consistent with alteration of cell-surface properties, such as cell morphology in stationary phase, Calcofluor White-, Congo Red- and lectin-binding abilities, as well as cell-to-cell aggregation and flocculation. All phenotypes of the ahpC mutant were complemented by in trans expression of AhpC, and overexpression of AhpC in the wild-type strain was found to affect the same set of phenotypes, suggesting that the pleiotropic effects were caused by the ahpC mutation. SK586 was also found to be fully motile, but it lost motility at a higher rate than the wild-type during growth, such that most SK586 cells were non-motile in stationary phase. Despite these defects, the mutant did not differ from the wild-type in short-term colonization of sterile wheat roots when inoculated alone, and in competition with the wild-type strain; this implied that AhpC activity may not endow the cells with a competitive advantage in colonization under these conditions. Although the exact function of AhpC in affecting these phenotypes remains to be determined, changes in cell morphology, surface properties, cell-to-cell aggregation and flocculation are common adaptive responses to various stresses in bacteria, and the data obtained here suggest that AhpC contributes to modulating such stress responses in A. brasilense.
