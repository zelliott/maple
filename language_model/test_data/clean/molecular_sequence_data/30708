The effects of bovine beta-casomorphin(1-7) (Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile) on neonatal sleep in rats were studied. The pups received intraperitoneal injections of beta-casomorphin(1-7) (1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg/kg) or a corresponding volume of sodium chloride. In any of the doses used, beta-casomorphin(1-7) had no effect on waking. Only 100 mg/kg caused significant changes in sleep: the percentage of quiet state of the total recording time (TRT) increased and the percentage of active sleep decreased. Beta-casomorphin(1-7) did not cause significant respiratory depression. Naloxone pretreatment (1 mg/kg IP) reversed the effects of beta-casomorphin(1-7) on sleep, a finding which suggests that opiate mu-receptors are involved in mediating the sleep effects of beta-casomorphin.
