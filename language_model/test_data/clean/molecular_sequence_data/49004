The enzyme, glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase (GNPI) or deaminase (GNPDA) (EC 5.3.1.10), catalyzes the conversion of GNP to fructose-6-phosphate and ammonia, with an aldo/keto isomerization and an amination/deamination. A hamster sperm-derived protein (Oscillin) with high similarity to bacterial GNPI has been proved to be capable of inducing calcium oscillation in eggs at fertilization. GNPI/Oscillin was supposed to be an important factor in starting embryonic development. From the cDNA library of human dendritic cells (DC), we isolated a novel full-length cDNA encoding a 276-amino acid-residue protein that shares high homology with human GNPI/Oscillin. So, the novel molecule is named as GNPI2. The GNPI2 gene consists of seven exons and six introns. It is mapped to chromosome 4. Northern blot analysis indicated that the tissue distribution of GNPI2 mRNA is different from that of human GNPI or Oscillin mRNA. GNPI2 is ubiquitously expressed in most of human tissues with high expression in testis, ovary, placenta, and heart. Like GNPI, the recombinant GNPI2 has been proved to have the enzymatic activity to catalyze the conversion of GNP to fructose-6-phosphate. Our results indicated that GNPI2 is a novel protein with definite function as a GNPI.
