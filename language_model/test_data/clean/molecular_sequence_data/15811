Diphtheria toxin must undergo a specific cleavage reaction and subsequent reduction to express the enzymatic ADP-ribosyltransferase activity that is responsible for its toxicity. In an effort to identify potential cellular enzymes that might be involved in this process we have found that a human urinary plasminogen activator, urokinase, is capable of specifically cleaving diphtheria toxin to yield an enzymatically active A fragment (more homogeneous than that produced by trypsin cleavage) and a B fragment (with an identical amino-terminal sequence to that produced by trypsin cleavage). The results raise the possibility that urokinase or urokinase-like enzymes play a role in diphtheria toxin-mediated intoxication.
