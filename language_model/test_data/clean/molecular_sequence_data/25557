Structural resemblance of the human Alu family with a subset of vertebrate tRNAs was detected. Of four tRNAs, tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Ile), tRNA(Thr), and tRNA(Tyr), which comprise a structurally related family, tRNA(Lys) is the most similar to the human Alu family. Of the 76 nucleotides in lysine tRNA (including the CCA tail), 47 are similar to the human Alu family (60% identity). The secondary structure of the human Alu family corresponding to the D-stem and anticodon stem regions of the tRNA appears to be very stable. The 7SL RNA, which is a progenitor of the human Alu family, is less similar to lysine tRNA (55% identity), and the secondary structure of the 7SL RNA folded like a tRNA is less stable than that of the human Alu family folded likewise. Insertion of the tetranucleotide GAGA, which is an important region of the second promoter for RNA polymerase III in the Alu sequence, occurred during the deletion and ligation process to generate the Alu sequence from the parental 7SL RNA. These results suggest that the human Alu family was generated from the 7SL RNA by deletion, insertion, and mutations, which thus modified the ancestral 7SL sequence so that it could form a structure more closely resembling lysine tRNA. The similarities of several short interspersed sequences to the lysine tRNA were also examined. The Galago type 2 family, which was reported to be derived from a methionine initiator tRNA, was also found to be similar to the lysine tRNA. Thus lysine tRNA-like structures are widespread in genomes in the animal kingdom. The implications of these findings in relation to the mechanism of generation of the human Alu family and its possible functions are discussed.
