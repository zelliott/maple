Six human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) and eight human T-cell leukemia virus type II (HTLV-II) cases newly isolated from the South American countries of Colombia and Chile were analyzed together with the two Amerindian HTLV-I isolates previously reported. All of the HTLV-I isolates belonged to the transcontinental subgroup of the "cosmopolitan" group, and Colombian isolates, including those from native Amerindians and Negroes, formed a single tight cluster within this subgroup. The transcontinental subgroup consisted of isolates from various regions such as the Caribbean basin, India, Iran, South Africa, Sakhalin, and Japan, and included isolates from the "Ainu" and "Okinawa" people, regarded as relatively pure Japanese descended from the prehistoric "Jomon" period which began more than 10,000 years ago. This implied a dissemination of the subgroup associated with the movement of human beings in ancient times. On the other hand, all of the HTLV-II isolates from native Amerindians in Colombia and Chile belonged to the HTLV-IIb subtype which has previously been reported to be mainly endemic in certain populations of native Amerindians. The southernmost isolate from Chile, showing wide distribution of the IIb subtype in native South Amerindians and largest heterogeneity of the subtype in Colombian isolates, supported the idea that the HTLV-IIb subtype has been endemic for a long time in native Indians of South America.
