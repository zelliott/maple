1. Lugworm protease C further purified by benzamidine-affinity chromatography, exhibited peptidase specificity for arginyl and lysyl bonds. 2. Protease C consisted of a single polypeptide with a mol. wt of ca 23,000 as determined by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, exhibited a u.v. absorption maximum at 280 with an (mg/ml) extinction coefficient of 0.93 and fluorescence spectra typical of a protein containing tryptophan, and had an amino acid composition similar to trypsins. 3. The Kms of the cleavages of the arginyl bond of oxidized insulin B chain and of the lysyl bond of the gly23-ala30 fragment were determined to be 0.72 and 0.96 mM; the corresponding kcats were 38 sec-1 and 1.5 sec-1. The Km and kcat for TAME were 0.042 mM, and 110 sec-1. 4. Lugworm protease C was confirmed to be a trypsin.
