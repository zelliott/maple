A sequence highly homologous to beta1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase III (beta4GalNAc-T3) was found in a database of human expressed sequence tags. The full-length open reading frame of the gene, beta4GalNAc-T4 (GenBank accession number AB089939), was cloned using the 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends method. It encodes a typical type II transmembrane protein of 1039 amino acids having 42.6% identity with beta4GalNAc-T3. The recombinant enzyme transferred N-acetylgalactosamine to N-acetylglucosamine-beta-benzyl with a beta1,4-linkage to form N,N'-diacetyllactosediamine as did beta4GalNAc-T3. In specificity toward oligosaccharide acceptor substrates, it was quite similar to beta4GalNAc-T3 in vitro, however, the tissue distributions of the two enzymes were quite different. These results indicated that the two enzymes have similar roles in different tissues.
