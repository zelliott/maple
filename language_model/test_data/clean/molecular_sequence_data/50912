A sterol C-14 reductase (erg24-1) mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was selected in a fen1, fen2, suppressor background on the basis of nystatin resistance and ignosterol (ergosta-8,14-dienol) production. The erg24-1 allele segregated genetically as a single, recessive gene. The wild-type ERG24 gene was cloned by complementation onto a 12-kb fragment from a yeast genomic library, and subsequently subcloned onto a 2.4-kb fragment. This was sequenced and found to contain an open reading frame of 1,314 bp, predicting a polypeptide of 438 amino acids (M(r) 50,612). A 1,088-bp internal region of the ERG24 gene was excised, replaced with a LEU2 gene, and integrated into the chromosome of the parental strain, FP13D (fen1, fen2) by gene replacement. The ERG24 null mutant produced ergosta-8,14-dienol as the major sterol, indicating that the delta 8-7 isomerase, delta 5-desaturase and the delta 22-desaturase were inactive on sterols with the C14 = 15 double bond.
