Cleavage by restriction endonucleases MvaI kappa EcoRII of DNA duplexes, in which the internal deoxycytidine in one of the strands of the recognition site is substituted for 5-fluorodeoxycytidine, has been studied. It has been found that the modified strands of these duplexes are scissed by endonuclease MvaI with a greater efficiency than the intact ones. Endonuclease EcoRII does not practically cleave such substrate analogs. The UV absorbance spectra of 5-fluorodeoxycytidine and the 14-member oligodeoxyribonucleotide with modification in the middle of the strand have been measured. A hypothesis has been put forward about the structural features of 5-fluorodeoxycytidine-containing DNA duplexes.
