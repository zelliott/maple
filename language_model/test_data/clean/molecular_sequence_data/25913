Normal mammalian lungs, including human fetal lungs, contain significant amounts of a decapeptide which releases arginine-vasopressin from the neurophypophysis and therefore has antidiuretic activity. The rat peptide is: Tyr-Gly-Glu-Pro-Lys-Leu-Asp-Ala-Gly-Val-NH2. The peptide from human fetal lungs has Ala instead of Tyr. It may be a normal regulatory substance and its role in the pathogenesis of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis associated with lung diseases merits investigation. In view of its source and action, the antidiuretic lung peptide may be called Pneumadin.
