Comparison of the Arabidopsis thaliana vacuolar proton-pumping inorganic pyrophosphatase with three F0F1-ATPase c-subunits revealed a strong similarity between a stretch containing amino acids 227-245 of the H(+)-PPase and a transmembrane alpha-helix of the c-subunits which contains the glutamate which binds N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.
