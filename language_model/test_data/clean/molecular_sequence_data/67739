A 3-year-old Texas Longhorn steer had a long history of progressive swelling of the soft tissues of the jaw and neck. At necropsy, multifocal to coalescing dermal and subcutaneous pyogranulomas were surrounded by fibrous tissue. Microscopically, the pyogranulomas contained aggregates of gram-negative coccobacilli surrounded by Splendore-Hoeppli material and were separated by bands of fibrovascular tissue (botryomycosis). Phylogenetic analysis of multilocus sequence-typing data revealed that the bacteria recovered in pure culture from swabs of submandibular tissue were most closely related to Bibersteinia [Pasteurella] trehalosi. The bacterial colonies were immunohistochemically reactive with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Pasteurella class C acid phosphatase antibody. Botryomycosis is a pyogranulomatous inflammation caused by a variety of nonbranching, nonfilamentous bacteria that elicit the formation of Splendore-Hoeppli material. This case of botryomycosis is unique for its association with Bibersteinia trehalosi.
