Nacre or mother-of-pearl in the shell of Pinctada margaritifera is composed of 95-99% calcium carbonate and 1-5% organic matrix. In this study, we developed an original technique to characterize the genes differentially expressed in nacre-forming cells (NFC) by combining suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), to establish a cDNA subtractive library, with rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR. Seventy-two specific cDNA sequences have been obtained so far. These include a protein containing two EF-hand Ca2+-binding domains which was completely sequenced after amplification by RACE-PCR. Its specific expression as well as the specificity of the SSH method was confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on NFC and mantle cells.
