A murine cDNA clone was isolated by screening a mouse cDNA library with the human CLN3 cDNA. Sequence analysis indicates that the corresponding CLN3 proteins are highly homologous. We have compared these with recently identified CLN3 sequences from the dog, the nematode C. elegans, and baker's yeast S. cerevisiae. The CLN3 protein is remarkably conserved across eukaryotic species. Several protein modification sites which may be crucial for the function of the protein are conserved.
