A RecA-independent chromosomal rearrangement in the upstream region of the streptolysin O (slo) gene of Streptococcus pyogenes which affects slo expression was identified. PCR analysis was used to demonstrate that this kind of rearrangement was found in several strains of different lineages. Chromosomal loci involved in the recombination were found to be 746 kb apart on the 1.85-Mb-long chromosome. The primary structure of the splicing region, the reproducibility of the rearrangement, and the fact that reconstructed recombinant molecules fused to erm and lacZ reporter genes affected their expression indicate that this event is not accidental but may play a role in the expression of the slo gene. In addition, the product of the recombining DNAs, including the splicing site, does not follow any example of a known recombination mechanism. The implications of this rearrangement for slo expression are discussed.
