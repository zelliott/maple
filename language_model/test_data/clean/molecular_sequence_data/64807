The cauliflower mosaic virus reinitiation factor TAV interacts with host translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) and the 60S ribosomal subunit to accomplish translation of polycistronic mRNAs. Interaction between TAV and eIF3g is critical for the reinitiation process. Here, we show that eIF4B can preclude formation of the TAV/eIF3 complex via competition with TAV for eIF3g binding; indeed, the eIF4B- and TAV-binding sites on eIF3g overlap. Our data indicate that eIF4B interferes with TAV/eIF3/40S ribosome complex formation during the first initiation event. Consequently, overexpression of TAV in plant protoplasts affects only second initiation events. Transient overexpression of eIF4B in plant protoplasts specifically inhibits TAV-mediated reinitiation of a second ORF. These data suggest that TAV enters the host translation machinery at the eIF4B removal step to stabilize eIF3 on the translating ribosome, thereby allowing translation of polycistronic viral RNA.
