The seven rRNA operons in Escherichia coli each contain two promoters, rrn P1 and rrn P2. Most previous studies have focused on the rrn P1 promoters. Here we report a systematic analysis of the activity and regulation of the rrnB P2 promoter in order to define the intrinsic properties of rrn P2 promoters and to understand better their contributions to rRNA synthesis when they are in their natural setting downstream of rrn P1 promoters. In contrast to the conclusions reached in some previous studies, we find that rrnB P2 is regulated: it displays clear responses to amino acid availability (stringent control), rRNA gene dose (feedback control), and changes in growth rate (growth rate-dependent control). Stringent control of rrnB P2 requires the alarmone ppGpp, but growth rate-dependent control of rrnB P2 does not require ppGpp. The rrnB P2 core promoter sequence (-37 to +7) is sufficient to serve as the target for growth rate-dependent regulation.
