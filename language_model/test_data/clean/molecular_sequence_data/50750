Protein D2 of the outer membrane of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to form the imipenem-permeable pore. We cloned and sequenced the protein D2 gene. The protein D2 gene encodes a polypeptide with 443 amino acids consisting of 23 and 420 amino acid residues for the signal peptide and mature polypeptide (M(r), 46,010), respectively. Protein D2 contains the highest molar ratio of glycine and no cysteine. The polar amino acids are scattered throughout the sequence.
