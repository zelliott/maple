It has been previously observed that various ColE1-like plasmids replicate differentially in Escherichia coli cells during the relaxed response to amino acid starvation. Here we develop a kinetic model to explain these observations based on the possibility of interaction of the 3' CCA-OH sequence with the UGG triplets in loops of RNA I and RNA II encoded by ColE1-like plasmids. According to our model, when the interaction of uncharged CCA with RNA I is possible, the replication of the ColE1-like plasmid is affected by differences in the concentration of various tRNAs in the starved cell, but it is not affected by the tRNA concentration if the hypothetical pairing occurs between the CCA-OH and RNA II. Using the previously determined parameters for the pBR322 plasmid, the concentration of uncharged tRNAs in the amino acid starved relaxed strains and the assumed efficiency of binding of tRNA and RNA I, we show that our model explains the differences in pBR322 copy number in the relaxed strain starved for several amino acids.
