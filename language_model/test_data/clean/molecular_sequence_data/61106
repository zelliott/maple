Cold-shock domain proteins in vertebrates contain a highly conserved domain which is related to the Escherichia coli cold-shock proteins. Here we report the cloning of a cold-shock domain protein from zebrafish embryo. Using the combination of PCR techniques with degenerate primers, 5'RACE and 3'RACE, the full length cDNA of a cold-shock domain protein in the zebrafish embryo was successfully cloned without constructing and screening a library. Determined from the deduced amino acid sequence, this protein is most similar to Xenopus, FRGY1, and this newly cloned zebrafish gene was therefore designated as zfY1.
