We studied a rare polymorphism at exon 6 (CD 213) of the p53 gene in a healthy Turkish population (n = 26) and in Turks with different types of tumors such as malignant lymphoma (n = 12), osteosarcoma (n = 5), and nasopharyngeal sarcoma (n = 4). The polymorphic allele was found in only one of the malignant lymphoma patients (4.16%). Our data revealed that CD 213 (A-G) polymorphism is very rare in the Turkish population and there is no association with the tumors.
