Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), a birnavirus, is an important pathogen in fish farms. Analyses of viral proteins showed that VP2 is the major structural and immunogenic polypeptide of the virus. All neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against IPNV are specific to VP2 and bind to continuous or discontinuous epitopes. In order to determine which parts of the protein are involved in antigenic variations, five IPNV strains were sequenced over the VP2 coding region. Comparison of the sequences obtained with three previously published strains revealed a central variable domain (positions 183 to 335) which encompasses two hydrophilic hypervariable segments. Viral mutants which escaped neutralization were then selected with anti-VP2 mAbs directed against discontinuous epitopes. Sequencing of three mutants revealed a single amino acid mismatch in each of them. All of these substitutions occurred in the hypervariable segments, suggesting that these regions are involved in the formation of a discontinuous epitope. Finally, expression of different truncated VP2s in Escherichia coli allowed localization of the binding site for neutralizing mAbs which recognize continuous epitopes. One of these mAbs bound to the region adjacent to the C-terminus of the variable domain of VP2, while two others reacted with the central and C-terminal parts of the variable domain. No antibody reacted with the N-terminus of VP2. These results suggest that the variable domain of VP2 and the 20 adjacent amino acids of the conserved C-terminal part are the most important in inducing an immune response for the protection of animals.
