RASSF1A, one of the two major isoforms of the putative tumor suppressor gene RASSF1, located at 3p21.3, is inactivated in a variety of human cancers including lung, breast, bladder and renal cell carcinomas. We have isolated and cloned two human homologues of this gene, RASSF3 and NORE1, located at 12q14.1 and 1q32.1, respectively. Both RASSF3 and NORE1 share almost 60% homology, at the amino acid level, with RASSF1. The RASSF3 gene contains five exons and encodes a 247 amino acid protein (MW of 28.6 kDa) with a highly conserved Ras association (RalGDS/AF-6) (RA) domain at the C-terminus. RASSF3 is ubiquitously expressed in all normal tissues and cancer cell lines analysed. NORE1, which is homologous to the previously described mouse Nore1 gene, exists in at least two spliced isoforms, A and B. Transcript A encodes a protein of 418 amino acids (MW or 47 kDa) while transcript B contains an ORF of 265 aa (MW of 30.5 kDa). Both share a RA domain, encoded by exons 3 through 6. NORE1A and NORE1B are expressed in most of the normal tissues analysed but they appear to be down-regulated in several cancer cell lines. However, contrary to RASSF1A, gene silencing by methylation of the CpG islands at which the two NORE1 transcripts initiate is not a common event in human primary tumors. RASSF3 and NORE1B are very similar, at the N-terminus, to the splice variant C of RASSF1 (RASSF1C), which does not seem to be involved in tumorigenesis. NORE1A is most closely related to RASSF1A, for sequence homology and genomic organization. However, aberrations in tumors have so far not been found. The presence of a Ras association domain common to NORE1, RASSF1, and RASSF3 suggests their possible involvement in Ras-like signaling pathways.
