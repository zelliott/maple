A novel non-sporulating, non-motile, catalase- and oxidase-positive, facultatively anaerobic, moderately halophilic, Gram-positive coccus, designated JSM 076033(T), was isolated from a sea urchin (Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus) collected from the South China Sea. Strain JSM 076033(T) was able to grow in the presence of 0.5-25.0 % (w/v) total salts and at pH 6.0-10.0 and 10-45 degrees C; optimum growth was observed with 5.0-10.0 % (w/v) total salts and at pH 7.0-8.0 and 25-30 degrees C. The major amino acid constituents of the cell wall were glycine, lysine and alanine. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(15 : 0) and anteiso-C(17 : 0). The respiratory quinones were MK-7 (60.7 %) and MK-6 (39.3 %) and the polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and an unidentified phospholipid. The DNA G+C content was 40.3 mol%. A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons revealed that strain JSM 076033(T) should be assigned to the genus Jeotgalicoccus. The sequence similarities between the novel isolate and the type strains of recognized Jeotgalicoccus species were in the range 95.2-97.2 %. The results of the phylogenetic analysis, combined with DNA-DNA relatedness data, phenotypic characteristics and chemotaxonomic information, support the view that strain JSM 076033(T) represents a novel species of the genus Jeotgalicoccus, for which the name Jeotgalicoccus marinus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is JSM 076033(T) (=CCTCC AA 207028(T) =DSM 19772(T) =KCTC 13189(T)).
