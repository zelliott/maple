White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) was first reported in farmed Litopenaeus vannamei stocks in Sinaloa and Sonora, Mexico during 1999 and continues to cause severe shrimp losses. WSSV genes encoding nucleocapsid (VP26 and VP15) and envelope proteins (VP19 and VP28) of a Mexican isolate were cloned in the pMosBlue vector. The nucleotide sequences of these genes were compared with WSSV isolates in GenBank. VP15 is highly conserved, and VP26 showed 99% homology to a Chinese isolate. The VP28 fragment demonstrated 100% homology to the majority of the isolates analysed (UniProt accession no. Q91CB7), differing from two Indian WSSV and one Chinese WSSV isolates by two non-conserved and one conserved replacements, respectively. Because of their highly conserved nature, these three structural proteins are good candidates for the development of antibody-based WSSV diagnostic tools or for the production of recombinant protein vaccines to stimulate the quasi-immune response of shrimp. In contrast, VP19 of the Mexican isolate was distinguishable from almost all isolates tested, including an American strain of WSSV (US98/South Carolina, GenBank accession no. AAP14086). Although homology was found with isolates from Taiwan (GenBank accession no. AAL89341) and India (GenBank accession no. AAW67477), VP19 may have application as a genetic marker.
