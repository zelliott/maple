Ascidians are hermaphrodites releasing sperm and eggs simultaneously, but many species are self-sterile because of a self/nonself-recognition system in spermegg interaction. Here, we show that a 70-kDa vitelline coat protein, HrVC70, consisting of 12 epidermal growth factor-like repeats, plays a key role in self/nonself recognition during ascidian fertilization. We discovered that the amount of HrVC70 of the self-sterile mature oocytes is markedly higher than that of the self-fertile immature oocytes and that the selfsterile mature oocytes become self-fertile by acid treatment, which is able to release the HrVC70 from isolated vitelline coats. In addition, fertilization is strongly inhibited by the pretreatment of sperm with HrVC70 from a different individual, but not from the same individual, and the number of nonself sperm bound to HrVC70-agarose was significantly higher than that of self-sperm. A sequence analysis of HrVC70 disclosed that several amino acid residues in a restricted region are substituted at an individual level, with no identical sequences among the 10 individuals tested. Furthermore, genomic DNA analysis revealed that the epidermal growth factor-like domains correspond to the exons, and each intron is highly conserved among even- and odd-numbered introns, suggesting that multiple gene duplications or amplification of this region might have taken place during evolution. It was also found that diversity in cDNA sequences is derived from genomic DNA polymorphism probably elicited by crossing over and specific nucleotide substitutions. These results indicate that HrVC70 is a candidate allogeneic recognition molecule in the gamete interaction of the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi.
