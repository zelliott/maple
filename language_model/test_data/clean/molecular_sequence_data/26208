Growth cone particle (GCP) membranes prepared from fetal day 17 rat brain are comprised of 5 major polypeptides as analyzed by SDS-PAGE: tubulin (p52), actin (p42), pp46/GAP-43 and two unidentified species, p38 and p34. Antibodies specific for the alpha- and beta-subunits of G proteins recognize p38 and p34, respectively, on immunoblots following one- and two-dimensional electrophoretic separation. That G protein subunits comprise major species of GCP membrane-associated polypeptides suggests a role for G proteins in transmembrane signaling in nerve growth cones.
