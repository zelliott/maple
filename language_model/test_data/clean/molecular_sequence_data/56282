Dimerization of leucine zipper-containing proteins has been associated characteristically with the formation of a coiled-coil structure between two compatible leucine zipper motifs. In the present study we demonstrate the association of the leucine zipper of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) with a zinc finger motif of ATF-2. The association of the CREB leucine zipper with the ATF-2 zinc finger is stabilized if the ATF-2 leucine zipper is intact, implying that the preferred interactive structure of ATF-2 juxtaposes the amino-terminal zinc finger motif of this protein with the carboxy-terminal leucine zipper of this same protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the association of the CREB leucine zipper with the ATF-2 zinc finger in vitro blocks the association of the adenoviral E1a protein with ATF-2. Similarly, overexpression of full-length CREB, or a truncated version of this protein corresponding to the carboxy-terminal 74 amino acids that make up the DNA-binding and dimerization domains, can block the ATF-2-mediated transcriptional stimulation by E1a in vivo. Mutation of the ATF-2 zinc finger motif stimulates DNA binding of this protein, and abolishes interactions with E1a and CREB proteins. These results demonstrate that the structural conformation of ATF-2 is critical for DNA binding and protein-protein interactions and, further, that leucine zippers can mediate protein-protein interactions with structural motifs other than leucine zippers.
