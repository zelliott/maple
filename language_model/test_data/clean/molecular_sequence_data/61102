Ribonuclease II is a processive 3'- to 5'-exoribonuclease in Escherichia coli with two binding sites: a catalytic site associated with the first few 3'-nucleotides and an anchor site binding nucleotides approximately 15 to 25 from the 3'-end. When RNase II degrades single-stranded helical poly(C), the enzyme-substrate complex dissociates at discrete intervals of 12 nucleotides. RNase II stalled at the last rC of single-stranded 3'-(rC)(n)(dC)(m) oligonucleotides. The more residues released, the faster the stalled complex dissociated and the less it inhibited RNase II activity, i.e. the enzyme-substrate association weakened progressively. Using phosphodiesterase I (PDE I) as a probe, a method was developed to identify cytidine residues in (32)P-oligonucleotides interacting with a protein. PAGE bands corresponding to nucleotides 1-6 from the 3'-end were consistent with interaction at the catalytic site, and following a gap, bands approximately 15 to 25 from the 3'-end, with anchor site association. Both 3' and 5' binding were necessary to maintain the complex. Of most significance, the original anchor site nucleotides remained fixed at the anchor site while the 3'-end was pulled, or threaded, through the catalytic site, i.e. the substrate did not 'slide' through the enzyme. DNA oligonucleotides with double-stranded stem-loops were good competitive inhibitors of RNase II. A 3'-single-stranded arm was essential, while optimal binding required both 5'- and 3'-arms. PDE I probing indicated that the nucleotides at the anchor site were specified by the spatial distance from the catalytic site, and on only one of the duplex strands. When degradation of a structured RNA paused or stopped, the RNase II-product commenced cycles of dissociation-reassociation. Duplex strand binding by RNase II made complex DNA or RNA structures accessible to degradation by other nucleases and further verified the PDE I footprinting method.
