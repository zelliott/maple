The Frizzled genes encode WNT receptors. Frizzled-10 (FZD10), a novel member of the Frizzled gene family, has been cloned and characterized. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that human FZD10 gene encodes a seven-transmembrane-receptor of 581 amino acids, with the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain and the C-terminal Ser/Thr-Xxx-Val motif. Larger amounts of FZD10 mRNA, 4.0 kb in size, were detected in the placenta and fetal kidney, followed by fetal lung and brain. In adult brain, FZD10 mRNA was abundant in the cerebellum. Among cancer cell lines, FZD10 was highly expressed in a cervical cancer cell line, HeLa S3, and moderately in a colon cancer cell line, SW480. The FZD10 gene was mapped to human chromosome 12q24.33. FZD10 shares 65.7% amino-acid identity with Frizzled-9 (FZD9). FZD10 and FZD9 constitute a subfamily among the Frizzled genes.
