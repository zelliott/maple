As a first step in a molecular dissection of the pathway controlling the determination of vulval cell fates in Caenorhabditis elegans, we have analyzed the gene lin-10. We show that loss-of-function mutations in this gene specifically prevent the induction of vulval cell lineages and result instead in the expression of hypodermal cell lineages. We isolated a transposon-insertion allele of lin-10 and used it to clone a genomic region that contains the lin-10 locus. The location of lin-10 within this region was determined by identifying a transcript affected by three independent lin-10 mutations and by delimiting the minimal segment of DNA sufficient to rescue the lin-10 mutant phenotype in germ line transformation experiments. The predicted lin-10 protein sequence is not similar to sequences in current data bases, suggesting that lin-10 defines a novel class of gene involved in the specification of cell fates. Although our genetic studies indicate that lin-10 is required specifically for the determination of vulval cell fates, lin-10 transcripts are present in cells other than vulval precursor cells. This result suggests that lin-10 may have a general but redundant role in development, functioning in diverse cell lineages to control cell fates. Alternatively, lin-10 may function specifically in vulval development, in which case lin-10 activity could be regulated at a post-transcriptional level or could have biological consequences only in conjunction with the products of other genes.
