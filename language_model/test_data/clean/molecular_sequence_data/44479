AT-AC introns constitute a minor class of eukaryotic pre-mRNA introns, characterized by 5'-AT and AC-3' boundaries, in contrast to the 5'-GT and AG-3' boundaries of the much more prevalent conventional introns. In addition to the AT-AC borders, most known AT-AC introns have highly conserved 5' splice site and branch site sequence elements of 7-8 nt. Intron 6 of the nucleolar P120 gene and intron 2 of the SCN4A voltage-gated skeletal muscle sodium channel are AT-AC introns that have been shown recently to be processed via a unique splicing pathway involving several minor U snRNAs. Interestingly, intron 21 of the same SCN4A gene and the corresponding intron 25 of the SCN5A cardiac muscle sodium channel gene also have 5'-AT and AC-3' boundaries, but they have divergent 5' splice site and presumptive branch site sequences. Here, we report the accurate in vitro processing of these two divergent AT-AC introns and show that they belong to a functionally distinct subclass of AT-AC introns. Splicing of these introns does not require U12, U4atac, and U6atac snRNAs, but instead requires the major spliceosomal snRNAs U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6. Previous studies showed that G --> A mutation at the first position and G --> C mutation at the last position of a conventional yeast or mammalian GT-AG intron suppress each other in vivo, suggesting that the first and last bases participate in an essential non-Watson-Crick interaction. Our results show that such introns, hereafter termed AT-AC II introns, occur naturally and are spliced by a mechanism distinct from that responsible for processing of the apparently more common AT-AC I introns.
