Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are associated with platelet activation. The aim of the present study was to study the protein expression level associated with glycolysis, oxidative stress, cytoskeleton and cell survival in platelets obtained during an ACS. Platelets from 42 coronary ischemic patients, divided into patients admitted within 24 h after the onset of chest pain (ACS group; n=16) and patients with stable coronary ischemic disease (CAD, n=26), were analyzed using proteomics. The expression levels of proteins involved in cellular cytoskeleton (F-actin capping, β-tubulin, α-tubulin isotypes 1 and 2, vinculin, vimentin and two Ras-related protein Rab-7b isotypes), glycolysis pathway (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase and two pyruvate kinase isotypes) and cellular-related antioxidant system (manganese superoxide dismutase) and even the expression and activity of glutathione-S-transferase were significantly reduced in platelets from ACS patients compared to CAD patients. Moreover, reduction in the expression of proteins associated with cell survival such as proteasome subunit β type 1 was also observed in ACS platelets compared with CAD platelets. Principal component and logistic regression analysis suggested the existence of factors (proteins) expressed in the platelets inversely associated with acute coronary ischemia. In summary, these results suggest the existence of circulating antioxidant, cytoskeleton and glycolytic-"bewildered" platelets during the acute phase of a coronary event.
