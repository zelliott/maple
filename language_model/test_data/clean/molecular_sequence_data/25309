Chitinases are believed to play an important role in plant defence against bacterial and fungal attack. In peanut (Arachis hypogaea) chitinase genes form a small multigene family. Four chitinase cDNAs (chit 1-4) were isolated from cultured peanut cells. Expression of individual chit genes was assayed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP). UV irradiation, dilution of cell cultures and treatment with Phytophthora megasperma (Pmg) elicitor or yeast extract were used to induce expression of chit genes. The chit 3 gene is constitutively expressed at a low level in untreated as well as in treated cultures; the expression of chit 4 gene is induced by each of the stimuli tested, whereas the chit 1 gene is activated by cell culture dilution and by yeast extract treatment. The chit 2 gene is strongly activated by treatment with cell wall components from the fungus Phytophthora megasperma but not by the other stimuli. These results indicate that chit 2 gene expression may be controlled by pathogen-specific regulatory elements.
