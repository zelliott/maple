A human polyomavirus, JC virus (JCV) is ubiquitous in humans and infects children asymptomatically. It persists in renal tissue and is excreted progeny in urine. DNAs from urine samples of 100 healthy Korean individuals were screened for the presence of JCV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Twenty of the samples were positive for JCV. JCV DNA was found in one individual (4%) in the 1-19-year group, two individuals (9%) in the 20-39-year group, ten individuals (38%) in the 40-59-year group, seven individuals (28%) in the over 60-year group. The prevalence of JC viral DNA was the highest in the 40-59-year-old Korean population. To investigate genotypes of JCV in Korea, the genotypes were determined by DNA sequence analysis of the regulatory region (333 bp) and the VT-intergenic region (656 bp) of DNA from the 20 JCV isolates. We have identified three distinctive JCV strains in the regulatory region and ten distinctive JCV strains in the VT-intergenic region of DNA from the 20 isolates. Based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and phylogenetic analysis of the VT-intergenic region of JCV, two distinct subtypes, CY and type 2A (MY), were found to be prevalent in this Korean population. CY and type 2A of JCV were identified in 13 individuals (65%) and four individuals (20%), respectively. Interestingly, type 1, which was distributed mostly in Europe, was found in 3 (15%) isolates from healthy Korean individuals.
