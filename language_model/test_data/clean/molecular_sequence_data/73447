A 120-base pRNA encoded by bacteriophage b29 has a novel and essential role in genomic DNA packaging. Six DNA-packaging RNAs (pRNAs) were bound to the sixfold symmetrical portal vertex of procapsids during the DNA translocation process and left the procapsid after the DNA-packaging reaction was completed, suggesting that the pRNA participated in the translocation of genomic DNA into procapsids. To further investigate the mechanism of DNA packaging, it is crucial to determine whether these six pRNA molecules work as an integrated entity or each pRNA acts as a functional individual. If pRNAs work individually, then do they work in sequence with communication or in random order without interaction? Results from compensation and complementation analysis did not support the integrated model. Computation of the probability of combination between wild-type and mutant pRNAs and experimental data of competitive inhibition excluded the random model while favoring the proposal that the six pRNAs functioned sequentially. Sequential action of the pRNA also explains why the pRNA is so sensitive to mutation, since the effect of a pRNA mutation will be amplified by 6 orders of magnitude after six consecutive steps, resulting in the observed complete loss of DNA-packaging activity caused by small alterations. When any one of the six pRNAs was replaced with an inactive one, complete blockage of DNA packaging resulted, strongly supporting the speculation that individual pRNAs, presumably together with other components such as the packaging ATPase gp16, take turns mediating successive steps of packaging. Although the data provided here could not exclude the integrated model completely, there is no evidence so far to argue against the model of sequential action.
