Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a ubiquitous protein playing various immunologic, enzymatic, and hormonal roles. MIF was originally identified for its capacity to inhibit the random movement of macrophages in vitro. MIF is widely expressed in many tissues with particularly high levels in the nervous system. Using the reversed-phase HPLC, N-terminal microsequence analysis, and database searching, we have identified in bovine brain several MIF-like proteins. According to mass spectral analysis, the molecular masses for three of them were determined as 12,369.2, 12,299.7, and 9,496.2 Da. In addition, we have identified another MIF-related protein (29,568.9 Da) by Western blotting using anti-MIF antibody raised to MIF (having an apparent molecular weight of 12 kDa) isolated to homogeneity from bovine brain cytosol. The modified purification procedure was mainly based on exclusion- and ion-exchange chromatography. Using p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid as a substrate, we have demonstrated tautomerase activity of the isolated MIF. The N-terminal sequences for all MIF-like proteins were found to be identical. Several other higher molecular weight putative MIF-related proteins were also revealed in the bovine brain cytosol extract. A multifunctional nature of MIF is suggested to be a result of its occurrence in different oligomerization states in a wide variety of tissues and cells.
