The specificity of three DNA methyltransferases M.Alw26I, M.Eco31I and M.Esp3I, isolated from Acinetobacter Iwoffi RFL26, Escherichia coli RFL31 and Hafnia alvei RFL3+, respectively, was determined. All the enzymes methylate both strands of asymmetric recognition sites yielding m5C in the top-strand and m6A in the bottom-strand, as below: 5'-GTm5CTC 5'-GGTm5CTC 5'-CGTm5CTC 3'-Cm6AGAG 3'-CCm6AGAG 3'-GCm6AGAG (M.Alw26I) (M.Eco31I) (M.Esp3I) They are the first members of type IIs methyltransferases that modify different types of nucleotides in the recognition sequence.
