We report a case of postoperative endophthalmitis due to an as yet unclassified Acinetobacter gyllenbergii-like isolate. The functional outcome was rapidly negative despite antibacterial therapy. This novel species, which cannot be identified by classical biochemical methods, may represent an underestimated opportunistic pathogen responsible for acute pyogenic infections.
