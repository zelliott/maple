A 4040-bp cDNA was cloned from a human placenta library by screening with a polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment. The fragment was generated from the library using primers corresponding to conserved sequences encompassing the topa quinone (TPQ) cofactor sites of the copper-containing proteins, bovine serum amine oxidase (BSAO) and human kidney diamine oxidase (DAO). The cloned cDNA contains a coding sequence from positions 161 to 2449. Between bases 2901 and 2974, in a very long 1591-bp 3'-untranslated region, there is a G/A-rich region in the minus strand, which contains a (AGG)5 tandem repeat. The human placenta cDNA sequence and its translated amino acid sequence are 84% and 81% identical to the corresponding BSAO sequences, while the identities for the placenta sequences and those for human kidney DAO are 60% and 41%, respectively. The TPQ consensus nucleotide and protein sequences are identical for the placenta enzyme and BSAO, but the corresponding sequences for human kidney DAO are nonidentical. Three His residues that have been identified as Cu(II) ligands in other amine oxidases are conserved in the human placenta amine oxidase protein sequence. It was concluded that the placenta cDNA open-reading frame codes for a copper-containing, TPQ-containing monoamine oxidase. A putative 19-amino acid signal peptide was identified for human placenta amine oxidase. The resulting mature protein would be composed of 744 amino acids, and would have a Mr of 82,525. Comparison of the human placenta amine oxidase with DNA sequences found in GenBank suggests that the gene for this enzyme is located in the q21 region of human chromosome 17, near the BRCA1 gene.
