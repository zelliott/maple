O-Specific polysaccharide of Vibrio fluvialis, strain AQ-0002B, is built up to pentasaccharide repeating units contained of D-mannose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactose, D-galacturonic acid and 3-0-[(R)-1'-carboxyethyl]-L-rhamnose (rhamnoactylic acid, Rha3Lac) residues. On the basis of methylation studies, solvolysis with HF, Smith degradation, 1H and 13C NMR-spectroscopy including homo- and heteronuclear correlation spectroscopy and NOE experiments, the following structure was suggested for the polysaccharide repeating unit: [formula: see text]
