Xyloglucan isolated from the elongating regions of pea stems was examined using X-ray diffraction and energy calculations. The X-ray fibre pattern suggested that the backbone (1----4)-beta-D-glucan takes an extended two-fold helix similar to common cellulose. In order to study side chains (xylosyl or fucosyl-galactosyl-xylosyl residues) of the polysaccharide, energetically preferable conformations were searched by calculation of interactions between non-bonded atom pairs. A stepwise calculation for the conformation of fucosyl-galactosyl-xylosyl residue gave 10 allowed area (phi-psi) maps which are useful to deduce xyloglucan conformations of both monocotyledons and dicotyledons in the walls of growing plant cells.
