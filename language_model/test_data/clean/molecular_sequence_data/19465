The cell wall of Streptomyces sp. VKM An-2534, the causative agent of common scab in potato tubers, which does not synthesize thaxtomin and is phylogenetically close to phytopathogen Streptomyces setonii sp. ATCC 25497, contains two anionic carbohydrate-containing polymers. The major polymer is teichuronic acid, whose repeating unit is disaccharide --> 4)-beta-D-ManpNAc3NAcyA-(1 --> 3)-alpha-D-GalpNAc-(1-->, where Acy is a residue of acetic or L-glutamic acid. The polymer of such structure has been found in Gram-positive bacteria for the first time. The minor polymer is teichoic acid [1,5-poly(ribitol phosphate)], in which a part of the ribitol residues are glycosylated at C4 with beta-D-Glcp and, probably, with beta-D-GlcpNAc and some residues are O-acylated with Lys residues. The structures were proved by chemical and NMR spectroscopic methods. It is likely that the presence of acidic polysaccharides on the surface of the phytopathogenic streptomycete is necessary for its attachment to the host plant.
