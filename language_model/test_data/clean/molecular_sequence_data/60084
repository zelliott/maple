Phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on an unknown Gram-positive catalase-negative coccus isolated from a common otter (Lutra lutra). Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that the unknown bacterium represents a new subline within the genus Vagococcus, close to, but distinct from, Vagococcus fluvialis and Vagococcus salmoninarum. The unknown bacterium was readily distinguished from the two currently recognized Vagococcus species by biochemical tests and electrophoretic analysis of whole-cell proteins. Based on phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence it is proposed that the unknown bacterium be classified as a new species, Vagococcus lutrae, the type strain of which is CCUG 39187T.
