The complete genome of Hosta Virus X (HVX), which is thought to be a distinct species of Potexvirus, was sequenced. Nucleotide sequences of HVX were compared with those of other members of the genus Potexvirus and phylogenetic tree was constructed. The range of identities of viral replicase open reading frame 1 (ORF1) between HVX and other potexviruses were 43.1%-55.1% and 35.9%-46.6% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis was performed according to the amino acid sequence of the replicase to determine the position of HVX in the genus Potexvirus. Results from the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that HVX was in the same group as Cassava common mosaic virus (CsCMV), Plantago asiatica mosaic virus (PlAMV), Tulip virus X (TVX), and Hydrangea ring spot virus (HdRSV). In particular, coat protein (CP) sequences among viruses from different Hosta cultivars were revealed to be less variable than those from different isolates of Potato virus X (PVX), a Potexvirus type species. In the present study, HVX was transmissible by seeds of the Hosta "Blue Cadet" cultivar. Moreover, HVX was detected in the embryo but not in the seed coat or endosperm of the seed.
