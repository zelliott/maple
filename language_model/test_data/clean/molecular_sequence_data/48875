A yeast strain was isolated from olive brines in a fermented black olive and olive oil manufacturing plant in the town of Nyons (France). On the basis of domains 1 and 2 (D1/D2) large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequence analyses, the strain CLIB 1303(T) was found to be closely related, but clearly distinct, from the three existing species of the genus Citeromyces: Citeromyces matritensis, Citeromyces siamensis and Citeromyces haiwaiiensis. Strain CLIB 1303(T) exhibited 6 bp, 7 bp and 12 bp divergences in the D1/D2 LSU rRNA gene with C. siamensis, C. matritensis and C. hawaiiensis, respectively. ITS region divergence amounted to more than 8 %, 4 % and 4.5 % with C. siamensis, C. matritensis and C. hawaiiensis, respectively, in addition to several indels. Like C. matritensis and C. siamensis strains, strain CLIB 1303(T) was shown to be halotolerant and osmotolerant. Phenotypically, strain CLIB 1303(T) can be distinguished from other species of the genus Citeromyces by its inability to assimilate trehalose. The strain CLIB 1303(T) (= CBS 12700(T)) was assigned to a novel species, Citeromyces nyonsensis sp. nov.
