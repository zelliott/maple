We have studied the gene expression of ten growth factors in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from patients with lung fibrosis by using a reverse-transcription-DNA polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. IL-1 beta mRNA was detected in almost all of the samples, and TGF beta and IGF-I mRNA were detected in some. The BAL supernatant from the patients was found to have mitogenic activity for lung fibroblasts. Moreover, human recombinant IL-1 beta, TGF beta and IGF-I were found to promote the proliferation of lung fibroblasts. These data suggest that IL-1 beta, TGF beta and IGF-I gene expression in BAL cells might be involved in the development of lung fibrosis.
