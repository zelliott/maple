Degenerate oligonucleotides and polymerase chain reaction-based reiterative selection techniques have been used to define the consensus binding sites for an increasing number of transcription factors. The use of crude nuclear extracts rather than purified proteins permits multicomponent complexes to form, and allows the technique to generate information about the combinatorial interactions involved in gene regulation.
