Cystic echinococcosis in humans and livestock animals is caused by infection with the cestode parasite Echinococcus granulosus. A number of genotypes of the parasite (designated G1-G10) are known to exist, with the genotype cluster G1-G3 and genotype G6 being responsible for the majority of humans infections. A recombinant vaccine has been developed for use in livestock to prevent infection with E. granulosus. The vaccine is based on the antigen EG95 which is expressed in the early larval stage (oncosphere) of the parasite. The EG95 antigen was originally cloned from the G1 genotype of E. granulosus and the protein has been found to be encoded by members of a small family of related genes in this genotype. Reliable information has not been available about the likely efficacy of the EG95 vaccine against genotypes other than G1. In this study, genomic DNA cloning techniques were used to characterize seven eg95-related gene fragments from the G6 genotype of E. granulosus. Three proteins appear to be encoded by these genes. Considerable differences were found between the EG95 related proteins from the G6 genotype compared with the EG95 protein from the G1 genotype. These differences suggest that the EG95-related proteins from the G6 genotype may have different antigenic epitopes compared with the current vaccine antigen. Data presented in this study have implications for future vaccine design and provide the information that would enable a G6 genotype-specific vaccine to be developed against E. granulosus, should this be considered a desirable addition to the available tools for control of cystic echinococcosis transmission.
