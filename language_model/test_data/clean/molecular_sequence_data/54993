We identified extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (erk2) from green mud crab, Scylla paramamosain, in this article. It was originally identified from an expressed sequence tag fragment from a normalized gonadal cDNA library. 5' Rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE) technique was used to obtain the 5' untranslated region (UTR). The full-length cDNA of Sp-erk2 is 1516 bp, including a 5'-terminal UTR of 19 bp, an open-reading frame of 1098 bp, and a 3'-terminal UTR of 399 bp. The translated protein is 365 amino acids in length with a predicted molecular weight of 42 kDa, which is the same as other species. It is the first time that the expression of Sp-erk2 in different stages of ovary development of crustacean was analyzed, and the result showed that the expression of Sp-erk2 increased gradually with ovarian development, with a peak in the mature phase. In situ hybridization histochemistry was used to clarify the detail of expression. Positive signals illustrated that Sp-erk2 mRNA is present in follicular cells when the ovary is in early stages, and in both follicular cells and oocytes when it is in mature phases. All above suggest that Sp-erk2 is important for ovarian development.
