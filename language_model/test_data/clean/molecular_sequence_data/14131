[Phe(4F)3]thymopoietin II was synthesized using a conventional solution method. The deprotection of the protected [Phe(4F)3]thymopoetin II was achieved by treatment with 1 M trifluoromethanesulfonic acid:thioanisole (molar ratio 1:1) in trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of dimethylselenide and m-cresol. The synthetic f1p4(4F)3]thymopoietin II and thymopoietin II were tested for effect on impaired T-lymphocyte transformation by phytohemagglutinin in uremic patients suffering from recurrent infectious diseases. The restoring activity on the impaired phytohemagglutinin stimulation of T-lymphocytes was obtained after incubation of peripheral lymphocytes isolated from uremic patients with the synthetic [Phe(4F)3]thymopoietin II. This peptide exhibited far stronger restoring effect than that of our synthetic thymopoietin II.
