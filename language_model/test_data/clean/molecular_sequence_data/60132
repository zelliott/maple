The RFP gene encodes a Ring finger protein that has a tripartite motif consisting of a Ring finger, a B-box finger and a coiled-coil domain. In the present study, we cloned and characterized the promoter region of the human RFP gene. The nucleotide sequence of the promoter was GC-rich and had no typical TATA and CAAT boxes. Instead, it contained one AP2 and two Sp1 binding sites within 100 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site. Analysis by the luciferase assay revealed that the activity of this promoter region is very strong in both human and mouse cell lines, although the activity in human cells was approximately 10-15 fold higher than that in mouse cells. In addition, the AP2 and Sp1 binding sites appeared to synergistically function for the promoter activity. Thus, the promoter of the RFP gene could be useful for high levels of expression of various genes in culture cells.
