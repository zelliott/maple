The O-chain polysaccharide produced by a mild acid degradation of Aeromonas caviae ATCC 15468 lipopolysaccharide was found to be composed of L-rhamnose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactose and phosphoglycerol. Subsequent methylation and CE-ESIMS analyses and 1D/2D NMR ((1)H, (13)C and (31)P) spectroscopy showed that the O-chain polysaccharide is a high-molecular-mass acidic branched polymer of tetrasaccharide repeating units with a phosphoglycerol substituent having the following structure: [structure: see text] where Gro represents glycerol and P represents a phosphate group.
