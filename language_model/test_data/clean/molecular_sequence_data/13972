The PCR is used for diagnostic purposes as it allows to detect infections agents within a much shorter time than by cultural isolation. In addition, it can detect non-infectious viruses and bacteria in clinical samples. These advantages are important factors in the diagnosis of highly contagious animal diseases (mainly caused by viruses) since a rapid laboratory diagnosis will allow to take immediate disease control actions. PCR is routinely used at the Institute of African and classical swine fever virus, foot and mouth disease virus, Aujeszky's disease virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, as well as Newcastle disease virus. The isolate can be further characterized by direct nucleotide sequencing of the amplified DNA. Since reliability of the results as well as as prevention of contaminations are vital to PCR, this method should be carried out by appropriately trained personnel. In addition, it requires a high level of technical infrastructure.
