Methanoculleus bourgensis, of the order Methanomicrobiales, is a dominant methanogenic archaeon in many biogas-producing reactor systems fed with renewable primary products. It is capable of synthesizing methane via the hydrogenotrophic pathway utilizing hydrogen and carbon dioxide or formate as the substrates. Here we report the complete and finished genome sequence of M. bourgensis strain MS2(T), isolated from a sewage sludge digester.
