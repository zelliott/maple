The nucleotide sequence of a cDNA encoding hamster spermidine/spermine-N1-acetyltransferase, a key enzyme in polyamine degradation and excretion, has been determined. The cDNA consists of a 1016 base pair insert including 120 nucleotides of the 5' untranslated region and the complete 3' untranslated region. The deduced amino acid sequence is very similar to the human spermidine/spermine-N1-acetyltransferase with only 8 differences in 171 amino acids and the corresponding nucleotide sequence shows 91% identity. The 5' untranslated regions are even more closely related with 97% identity suggesting that this region may play a role in the regulation of acetyltransferase activity. Translation of the acetyltransferase mRNA in a reticulocyte lysate was not altered by the addition of N1,N12-bis(ethyl)spermine.
