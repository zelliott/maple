The gene encoding yeast phosphoglycerate mutase was isolated, and its sequence was determined. The gene specifies a protein of 246 amino acids, and contains no introns. The sequence shows a strong codon bias. The upstream untranslated portion of the gene contains a CT-rich block such as is found in many highly expressed yeast genes, but does not have the associated CAAG sequence.
