We have reported previously that heat-shock protein 60 kDa (hsp60) of Helicobacter pylori is an important antigen in the pathogenesis of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. In order to investigate associations with host immune reactions and hsp60 antigen, CD40 ligand (CD40L) expression and cytokine production were analysed following stimulation with hsp60. To provide a clear antigen-driven immune response, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with low-grade MALT lymphoma and gastritis and those from healthy volunteers were stimulated with recombinant H. pylori hsp60 and H. pylori cell lysate in the presence of cytokines (IL4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor). mRNA expression was also analysed by a cDNA microarray containing 1100 genes. Expression of CD40L on PBMCs of patients with MALT lymphoma was increased by cytokines or by combination with stimulation with hsp60 antigens. The production of IL4 in PBMC cultures was increased in patients with MALT lymphoma; however, production of IFN-gamma was at low levels. DNA microarray analysis indicated increased levels of HLA-DR and integrin mRNAs. In cases of low-grade MALT lymphoma, adaptive immune responses against hsp60 may be enhanced by host factors, such as antigen presentation and T-cell activation, resulting in B-cell proliferation, which can be demonstrated during chronic H. pylori infection.
