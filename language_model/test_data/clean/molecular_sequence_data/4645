We have designed and constructed a bacterial expression vector to produce a fusion protein of hapten-specific single-chain Fv (ScFv) and alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) in Escherichia coli. The ScFv gene was assembled using genes encoding the heavy and light chain variable domains of anti-NP (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl acetyl) mouse monoclonal antibody. The ScFv gene was then fused to the 5' terminus of the E. coli PhoA coding region. The expressed fusion protein ScFv(NP)-PhoA was purified using an NP affinity column, and gel-filtration. Characterization of the fusion protein was then performed. The estimated molecular weight by gel filtration was approximately 151 kDa, suggesting the dimerization of the protein. Kinetic constants of ScFv(NP)-PhoA were calculated and compared with those of wild-type PhoA. The k(cat) values of ScFv(NP)-PhoA and wild-type PhoA were 103 (s(-1)) and 96.1 (s(-1)), respectively, showing that PhoA activity was somewhat increased by tethering the molecules. The equilibrium binding constant of ScFv(NP)-PhoA was determined using two different haptens, NP-capronate and NIP(3-iodo-4-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl acetyl) by means of fluorescence quenching measurements. The obtained binding constants were 2.2 x 10(5) (M-1) for NP-capronate and 1.O x 10(6) (M(-1)) for NIP, respectively. No apparent difference in binding constants was seen between ScFv(NP) and ScFv(NP)-PhoA, showing that sufficient specificity and binding affinity were retained when ScFv(NP) was tethered to alkaline phosphatase. ScFv(NP)-PhoA can be used to detect nanogram concentrations of NP-BSA in ELISA without the use of chemically conjugated secondary antibodies.
